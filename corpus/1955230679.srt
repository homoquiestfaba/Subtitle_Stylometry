equation says that if you

00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,357
Cut the surface of a sphere
into faces, edges, and vertices,

18
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,461
And let F be the number of
faces, E, the number of edges,

19
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,163
V, the number of vertices,
then you will always

Get... Reggie Kipper.

21
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,072

I know.

188
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,204
I know.

189
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:31,905
I told you a long
time ago, missus.

190
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:32,772
Yes, yes.

191
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,207
Esa, Jesus Christ.

192
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,949
Will you bring my wine
up to my bedroom, please?

193
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,384
I'm going to watch "Master
Chef" and go to sleep.

194
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,389
Hi, Mom.

195
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,162
How are you?

196
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,030
Yeah, I'm on a pay phone.

197
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,132
I didn't want to use my minutes.

198
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,101
I know.

199
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,469
Huh?

200
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,470
I don't know.

201
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,805
Linden Street.

202
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,808
How's Shelly?

203
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,410
Are you kidding me?

204
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,946
Why is she doing... don't
let her do that, Mom.

205
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,015
She shouldn't be working
there, no matter how much

206
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:15,682
She's getting.

207
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:19,786
I'm fine.

208
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,355
I got fired.

209
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,057
It was just a bunch
of stuff adding up,

210
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,195
And then Dennis came in
and made a big scene.

211
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,896
And I don't really
want to get into it,

212
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:34,968
But I took my stuff out
of his place and left.

213
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,203
I don't know.

214
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,670
I didn't really plan it all out.

215
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,307
It just happened.

216
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,543
Actually, I was thinking
about maybe coming home

217
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,377
For a little while.

218
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,715
Probably a few weeks.

219
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,684
I'm not sure how long.

220
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,621
No, I'm not going back there.

221
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,755
He wouldn't let me anyway.

222
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,224
I threw his guitar
out the window.

223
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,329
I... I don't know how long, Mom.

224
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,697
Long enough... I mean, till
I get some money together.

225
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,533
I've got $160 to my name.

226
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,871
I'm not going to
bring a lot of stuff.

227
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,440
What do you think
I'm going to bring?

228
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,043
I have everything I own sitting
next to me in one suitcase.

229
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,583
Hello?

230
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,384
Yeah, I'm here.

231
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:24,784
Hang on.

232
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,894
Yeah, sorry.

233
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,899
Um... it's nothing definite.

234
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,334
I was only thinking about it.

235
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,902
I could stay with
a girl from work.

236
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,471
She said it'd be fine.

237
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,844
OK, well, I should go.

238
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,348
This is probably
costing you a fortune.

239
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,949
OK, I will.

240
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,684
I will.

241
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,152
Don't worry.

242
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,288
Tell Shelly that she shouldn't
be working in that place

243
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:06,259
No matter what she's making, OK?

244
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,726
I will.

245
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,196
OK.

246
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:09,596
Bye.

247
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,483
[Music playing]

248
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,323
FRIEND: Courtney.

249
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:10,823
Yeah?

250
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,159
Oh, hey.

251
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,059
I just want to let you
know, Eleanor's gonna

252
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,026
Stay the night tonight.

253
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:14,927
Where's she gonna sleep?

254
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:15,795
FRIEND: On the couch.

255
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,829
What's the problem?

256
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,864
This isn't a freakin' hotel.

257
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,532
God, a nightmare she is.

258
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,101
Is it going to be OK
for me to stay here?

259
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,703
Yeah, don't worry.

260
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,338
If she wasn't such a pain in the
ass, I'd let you stay longer,

261
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,773
But technically it's her place.

262
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,141
Oh, it's fine.

263
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,176
Tonight is fine.

264
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,143
I have somewhere to go tomorrow.

265
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,978
FRIEND: You sure?

266
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,546
Yeah.

267
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,048
I'm just going to lay down and
read my book, get up early,

268
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,750
And try to find a job.

269
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,186
Oh, you know what?

270
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,653
Here you go.

271
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,488
Call these people.

272
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,855
My friend Abby told me about it.

273
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,591
It's like a temp agency.

274
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,525
Au pair service?

275
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,359
Yeah.

276
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,194
It's like a service for nannies.

277
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,995
You ever babysit?

278
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,363
Yeah, I guess.

279
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,598
For my little sister.

280
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:52,999
Well, there you go.

281
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,201
Call them up, tell them you have
experience babysitting, taking

282
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,635
Care of kids, or whatever.

283
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,737
Oh, my friend Abby got a
job taking care of the kids

284
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,239
Up... what's her name?

285
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,075
The British girl from that show?

286
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:06,145
Anyway, just dress
nice, go in there,

287
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,348
Bullshit them about
your experience.

288
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,583
I was gonna go in there
myself, but they check

289
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,952
To see if you have a
criminal record, so...

290
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,555
Thanks.

291
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,289
OK.

292
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,790
Well, I'll see you later?

293
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,292
Lock it, will you?

00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,824
FRIEND: Forget about Sal, Mom.

295
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,792
Sal's not coming back.

296
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,061
I'm not interested in Sal.

297
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,296
Mom!

298
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,299
Mom, I'm not interested in Sal!

299
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,300
Mom, stop talking.

300
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,002
Stop talking while I'm talking.

301
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,937
Stop talking, Mom!

302
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,905
God damn it!

303
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:14,614
I've been working
in a bar-restaurant,

304
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:19,452
And I've been
babysitting mostly.

305
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,152
OK.

306
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:20,987
Like, as a nanny.

307
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,022
WOMAN: A nanny?

308
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,223
Yeah.

309
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:29,762
I... I was a babysitter
for a family.

310
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,098
WOMAN: And did you want to
list them as a reference?

311
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:37,870
No, because they
moved back to Europe.

312
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,772
They're from Belgium.

313
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,008
OK, and is there any
way I could contact them?

314
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,610
Probably not.

315
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,978
I could see if I could get
their new number there,

316
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,946
But probably not.

317
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,385
I also took care of
my little sister.

318
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,655
I pretty much took care
of her from the time

319
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,658
She was born until she
was in high school.

320
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,993
My mom worked full
time when we were kids,

321
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,331
So I pretty much raised her.

322
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,868
So I guess you could call
my mom or my sister... I

323
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:09,736
Mean as a reference.

324
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,040
WOMAN: OK.

325
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,907
Could I see your
driver's license?

326
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,982
Why don't you have
a seat out there?

Six-letter word
for "most spare."

328
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,198
Merest.

329
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,000
Merest?

330
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,803
M-E-R-E-S-T, from
mere... that is,

331
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:49,241
Solely or no more or better
than what is specified.

332
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,744
Merest, the smallest
or slightest.

[Phone ringing]

334
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:56,148
Yeah?

335
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,618
What?

336
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,820
It's none of your fucking
business where I stayed.

337
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,155
Do I ask you where
you go all night?

338
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,292
It happens all the
fucking time, Dennis.

339
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,660
And I told you, I'm finished.

340
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,462
Oh, and thanks for getting
me fired from my job

341
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,364
With your little tantrum.

342
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,132
What did you think would happen?

343
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,166
What?

344
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,968
No, I'm not coming back.

345
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:16,569
I told...

346
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,670
OK.

347
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,105
We don't usually move
forward until we've

348
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,807
Had a chance to check
everything over thoroughly,

349
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,209
But something's come in that
you might be perfect for,

350
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,644
And I don't want to miss out.

351
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,479
It would start immediately,
possibly this afternoon.

352
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,047
How does that work?

353
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,081
Yeah.

354
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:29,916
Yes, I can start immediately.

355
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,117
This afternoon?

356
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,184
Yeah.

357
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,554
It's a live-in situation.

358
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,788
OK.

359
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,156
They're looking for someone
on a temporary basis,

360
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,357
A couple of months,
could go longer.

361
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,792
How does that work?

362
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:40,827
It's fine.

363
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,294
It's a family on
the Upper West Side.

364
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,696
It would essentially
require you looking

365
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,698
After their 12-year-old,
a little light housework.

366
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,298
Yes?

367
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,800
Yes.

368
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,001
Great.

369
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:49,969
Here's the address.

370
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,404
They'll be expecting you.

371
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,406
It's a brief interview with
the woman of the house.

372
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,910
On your way, stop
at a drugstore,

373
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,379
Pick up a little light blush and
something subtle for your eyes.

374
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,414
It's a bit much.

375
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:02,415
Better get moving.

376
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,992
Hello?

377
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:20,593
Hi.

378
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,532
Barbara Kipper.

379
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,265
Eleanor Logan.

380
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,136
Well, then.

381
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,841
Let's go in the
library and chat.

382
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,812
You are from upstate?

383
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:40,847
Yeah.

384
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:45,484
OK, well, my nanny
left unexpectedly.

385
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:46,886
My husband is in
China, in Beijing.

386
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,888
That's where his company,
his business is based.

387
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,257
I will be joining him
there in less than a week.

388
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,659
Do you smoke?

389
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,860
No.

390
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,194
If you're going to smoke,
only on the balconies.

391
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,696
There are 15
different balconies.

392
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,832
Choose one if you want to smoke.

393
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:00,399
OK.

394
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,634
I don't smoke.

395
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,435
So Reggie, what
did Claire tell you?

396
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,371
Anything?

397
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,072
Very little.

398
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,574
He's 12.

399
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,375
Basically you get him to and
from school and make sure

400
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:10,076
He eats.

401
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,343
That's it.

402
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,079
Anything else you need,
Esa will help you.

403
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:13,880
Esa?

404
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,081
Yes, ma'am?

405
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,115
Christ.

406
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,216
You're two feet away from me.

407
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,284
Don't do that.

408
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,052
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,289
Helena here is going
to take over for Tula.

410
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,256
Eleanor.

411
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,324
Do you have a boyfriend?

412
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,492
No.

413
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,927
If you want to
see your boyfriend,

414
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,495
Go to his house or wherever,
because it is strictly

415
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:30,329
Prohibited here.

416
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,230
OK?

417
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,131
OK.

418
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,232
See, here's the thing.

419
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,301
He's got to eat.

420
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,637
If you don't make him, he won't.

421
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,805
He only likes certain things.

422
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,372
He's very picky about it.

423
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,043
No meat, vegetarian only.

424
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,412
He doesn't eat meat,
fish, or poultry.

425
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:50,482
He doesn't eat anything except
tofu and vegetarian stuff.

426
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,251
What time is he out today?

427
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,120
He has his music until 4:30.

428
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,154
Great.

429
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,656
So you will pick him up at 4:30.

430
00:25:56,756 --> 00:26:02,328
I absolutely do not want him
walking to or from school.

431
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,896
A, it's not safe.

432
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:08,200
B, that's why I employ a driver.

433
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,803
So we're set.

434
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,106
Esa, make sure Laura here
gets the whole rundown

435
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,074
On everything.

436
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,744
I've got my massage
in 15 minutes.

437
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,979
I'm going to take my
pill and get ready.

438
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,962
[Music playing]

439
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,619
Uh, excuse me.

440
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,921
Hi.

441
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:15,621
Hi.

442
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,256
I'm Eleanor.

443
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,491
I'm here to pick you up.

444
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,661
Did they tell you?

445
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,063
They didn't tell you.

446
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,364
OK.

447
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,732
Well, the car's right there.

448
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,935
Actually, I prefer to walk.

449
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:32,939
Well, your mom really
wants you to take the car.

450
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,241
Despite what my
mother might have said,

451
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,944
I have an arrangement with
the guy... an understanding,

452
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,645
A financial agreement.

453
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,113
Now, I aim to walk home.

454
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,048
It's my thing.

455
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,349
I do it every day,
rain or shine.

456
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,752
Period, the end.

457
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,388
Fine.

458
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:49,989
Fine.

459
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:14,413
Hey.

460
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,485
Yeah?

461
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,353
Would you hang on a second?

462
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,325
I'm Eleanor.

463
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:31,898
Reggie.

464
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,235
Pleased to meet you.

465
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:36,635
Likewise.

466
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,388
Isn't that thing
a little heavy?

467
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,589
Yeah, but I don't mind.

468
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,627
It was pretty amazing.

469
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,395
I'm sorry?

470
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,496
Your playing.

471
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:09,135
I mean, that piece is
absolutely gorgeous.

472
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,269
Thanks.

473
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,938
The way the viola and
the violins interact,

474
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,307
It's so sad and beautiful.

475
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,542
Who composed that?

476
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,277
Me.

477
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,711
You composed it?

478
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,646
I did.

479
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,016
Oh, wow.

480
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,385
Oh, you must really
love doing that.

481
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,487
I mean, I could tell
you really love to play.

482
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,821
Something to do.

483
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,259
Is that what you want
to do when you grow up?

484
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,593
When I grow up?

485
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,062
Yeah.

486
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,729
No.

487
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,864
Why not?

488
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:40,066
Why not?

489
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,868
Well, let's see,
first off the prospect

490
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,603
Of ending up a bitter
and lonely drunk

491
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,172
Doesn't quite appeal to me.

492
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,539
OK.

493
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,742
And not to mention the fact
that art, as a language, dead.

494
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,411
It doesn't matter
what you have to say

495
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,447
Or how well you might
be able to say it.

496
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:56,048
Dead.

497
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,253
Kind of a bleak view.

498
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:01,954
Yes, it is.

499
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,565
Boom.

500
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,501
Douzeper.

501
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,535
What is that?

502
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,637
Looks like 120 points to me.

503
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,671
It's not a word.

504
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,173
It is a word, dickhead.

505
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,609
Noun, plural, one of
the 12 legendary nights.

506
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,677
You should know that,
with all your Dungeons

507
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,845
And Dragons nonsense.

508
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,281
If you say so.

509
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,883
I can't believe that little
fox is going to be living here.

510
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,452
She is so hot.

511
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,853
Man, is she hot.

512
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,323
That's what you say about every
girl you come in contact with.

513
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,057
No.

514
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,391
Just the super-hot ones.

515
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,427
It's only because
you're confused, awkward,

516
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:42,328
And insecure.

517
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:43,695
OK, Mr. Freud.

518
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,998
And convinced you'll never get
a girl to have sex with you.

519
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,333
Right, sure, OK.

520
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,408
This looks so good.

521
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,409
What's the sauce?

522
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,210
Just eat it.

523
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,412
ESA: Meatless brown gluten.

524
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,180
Eat it, Reggie.

525
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,881
It's vegetarian stir fry.

526
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,584
She's always trying to sneak
beef broth into everything.

527
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,256
Sounds like a great set-up.

528
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:11,757
I can't believe how
fast it all happened.

529
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,992
That's what kind of scares
me about the whole thing.

530
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,227
I talked to the
mother for, like,

531
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,762
10 minutes before
she hires me to take

532
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,230
Care of her 12-year-old son.

533
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,066
Next thing I know,
I'm living there.

534
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,667
Sounds like you
totally lucked out.

535
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,069
I mean, what's the big deal?

536
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,336
They're, like, gazillionaires.

537
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,871
The house is the size
of Grand Central.

538
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,607
And what do I know about taking
care of a 12-year-old boy?

539
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,541
Free room and board.

540
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,542
Plus you get paid.

541
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,677
What more could you want?

542
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,412
And besides, you lived
with Dennis for a year.

543
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,481
You should be fine
with a 12 year old.

544
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,882
Yeah, right.

545
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,484
Maybe just see him
and have some closure.

546
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,619
I mean, you threw his
guitar out the window.

547
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,487
Yeah, that's right.

548
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:42,621
I did.

549
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,489
Fuck him.

550
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,423
That was my closure.

551
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,528
Back uptown to the rich folk.

is incredible.

566

It was built by Captain
Francis Falk in 1898.

He also designed the
Museum of Natural History

568

overbearing swimming pools.

00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:29,675
And avoid the complication.

736
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:30,909
I'm responsible for you.

737
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,343
Then do the responsible thing.

738
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,682
I'll be right back.

739
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:02,607
OK.

740
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:03,909
We're all set.

741
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,443
What do you mean we're all set?

742
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:06,778
Well, I know that guy.

743
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,413
He's going to take care of it.

744
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,015
Wait, hold on.

745
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,117
He marks my name down, and I
send him a check in the mail.

746
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:12,884
No questions asked.

747
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,652
Wait, you send him a check?

748
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:15,854
It's OK.

749
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,623
I have an arrangement
with the guy.

750
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,458
Try to understand, OK?

751
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:24,262
I simply do not belong at camp.

752
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,263
Are you hungry?

753
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,531
I bet you're hungry.

754
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,199
I know this great place
not far from here.

755
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,200
You like eggs Benedict?

756
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,168
It's all organic.

757
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,070
Here, come on.

758
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,472
Wait, hold on.

759
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:35,073
Hold on.

760
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:51,857
ELEANOR: $52 for
a spinach salad?

761
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:53,624
It's a heck of a salad.

762
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,592
Trust me.

763
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,227
Everything here, top notch.

764
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,063
I usually get the
wild mushroom risotto.

765
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,198
Go ahead, get whatever you like.

766
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,166
I got this.

767
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,034
We have an account here.

768
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,203
I guess just the garden salad.

769
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,038
That's all?

770
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:07,873
Eat.

771
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,674
This guy is a world-class chef.

772
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,810
What are we supposed to
do for the next six weeks?

773
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,678
This is New York City, kid.

774
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,513
Never a loss for
things to do here.

775
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,414
Trust me.

776
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:17,615
It just seems wrong.

777
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,317
You're supposed to
be in that camp.

778
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,520
Camp Pinnacle is not
an option for me, OK?

779
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,688
It never was.

780
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,290
Now, let's not refer
to camp anymore.

781
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,591
But it's not up to you.

782
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,725
Yes, it is.

783
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:28,626
No one cares.

784
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,828
No one cares where I am.

785
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:30,962
That isn't true.

786
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,163
Look, I don't
mean it like that.

787
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,531
It's just a fact.

788
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,501
The operation continues whether
I'm at camp or home reading.

789
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,104
Personally, I'd rather be home
reading if it's all the same.

790
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:41,172
And it is, believe
me, all the same.

791
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:42,373
What about Esa?

792
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,508
What about her?

793
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:45,076
She's fine.

794
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,778
Do you think she's concerned
where I am or what I'm doing?

795
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,579
She works in the house.

796
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,647
It's just weird.

797
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,749
It's so weird, Reggie.

798
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,819
Yes, well, this is my life.

799
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:55,253
Welcome to the weirdness.

800
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,155
I'm just trying to navigate
a course towards safety

801
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:01,126
And sanity the best
way I know how.

802
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,095
OK.

803
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:07,498
[Chuckling]

804
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,073
[Vibrating]

805
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:22,447
[Vibrating]

806
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,022
[Giggling]

807
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:54,946
DENNIS: I was about to give up.

808
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:56,547
What the fuck are you doing?

809
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,050
Clearly I've been trying to
get in touch to talk to you.

810
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,352
No, I'm not trying to play,
like, head games or some shit,

811
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,120
OK?

812
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,954
I'm serious.

813
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,722
I have ended this relationship.

814
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,892
I thought maybe we
could just talk it over.

815
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,793
You fucked around
a million times, OK?

816
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:10,896
You... you get drunk with
your stupid friends.

817
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:11,863
You treat me like shit.

818
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:12,697
So just forget it.

819
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:13,331
Forget it.

820
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,465
Go home.

821
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,267
Look, I made a mistake,
and I realize it now.

822
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,168
I just want to talk.

823
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:17,735
We talked.

824
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,137
Stop texting me.

825
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:19,537
Eleanor?

826
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,810
I mean, ever since you left,
I've been so, like, despondent.

827
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:28,013
OK, I'm sorry that
you're feeling bad now.

828
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:29,347
Maybe you should have
thought about that before.

829
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,581
I wrote a bunch
of songs about you.

830
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,582
I want you to hear them.

831
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,650
Jesus Christ.

832
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,651
Let's go get a drink.

833
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:34,685
Let's go down to Scratcher.

834
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,887
Bill's DJing over there.

835
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,255
ELEANOR: What are
you talking about?

836
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,789
It's just a drink,
just to talk.

837
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,391
Are you listening
to me in any way?

838
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,492
I'm working, you idiot.

839
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,894
I'm all messed up inside.

840
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:44,262
I haven't been able to sleep.

841
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,663
I haven't eaten.

842
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:49,267
If you think that this cloying,
whining, like, desperate act is

843
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,537
In any way attractive or
appealing, you're wrong.

844
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:53,671
So goodbye.

845
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,340
Goodbye.

846
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,674
Eleanor, come on.

847
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,009
Please.

848
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,978
Oh, so you're just going
to be like that now?

849
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,980
So in other words, you're
just going to move on?

850
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,948
Not in other words.

851
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,415
In those exact words.

852
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:07,285
Well, fine, but you're
going to pay for that guitar.

853
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,387
Make no mistake.

854
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,821
Fucking bitch.

855
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,423
What are you doing out here?

856
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:13,258
What's going on?

857
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:13,758
Nothing.

858
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:14,825
Go inside.

859
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:16,394
You're going to
pay for my shit.

860
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,195
Fucking bitch.

861
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,415
Hey.

862
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:38,316
Are you OK?

863
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:38,816
Yeah.

864
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,718
I'm good.

865
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,154
I'm so sorry about that.

866
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,589
Can I make you a snack?

867
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:47,125
I can whip up some veggie
soba noodles real quick.

868
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,360
Or how about some tofu curry?

869
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,196
It's no problem.

870
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:54,199
You should eat something.

871
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,500
Sure.

872
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,968
Great.

873
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:58,469
We can finish
watching the movie.

874
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:10,548
If you don't mind me asking,
is he prone to such outbursts?

875
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,151
No.

876
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,585
Not that I was aware, anyway.

877
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,190
What a colossal mistake.

878
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:26,131
Life is a series of
colossal mistakes.

879
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,839
I'm doing a horrible job
of taking care of you.

880
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,041
What are you talking about?

881
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,408
You're doing a great job.

882
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:38,509
No.

883
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,411
I don't want you to
know about this stuff.

884
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,646
What stuff?

885
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:43,381
My stuff.

886
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,117
The sordid details
of my break-up,

887
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:49,154
The stuff that happens
in my personal life.

888
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,721
We don't know each
other that well,

889
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,190
And you're too
young to understand.

890
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,558
Don't be too sure about that.

891
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,526
I have a great deal
of understanding.

892
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:56,227
God.

893
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,129
Well beyond my years.

894
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:02,167
Look, I just don't want
you to worry about it

895
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,202
Or think about it.

896
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:04,869
OK?

897
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:05,770
OK.

898
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,737
I won't worry about it.

899
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,239
I'm not worried about it.

900
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,374
Good.

901
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,942
But I can't guarantee
I won't think about it.

902
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:12,843
It's what I do.

903
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:13,978
I think about things.

904
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,382
It's my nature.

905
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:18,849
Fine.

906
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,518
You can think.

907
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:21,519
Fair enough.

908
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,463
Whoa, really?

909
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,531
What?

910
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,766
An uncharacteristic
lapse by the master.

911
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,270
You just left yourself
open for some brute force.

912
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,571
Got your horsey horse.

913
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:41,139
Doesn't matter.

914
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,141
I'll still win.

915
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,809
So you know how
we were supposed

916
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,844
To go to Sydney,
Australia, for vacation?

917
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:47,745
Yeah.

918
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,746
Well, now we're not.

919
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:49,380
Oh?

920
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,781
Yeah.

921
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,183
My dad lost his shirt in some
deal with this guy in Stanford,

922
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,885
Or some guy named
Stanford, who knows?

923
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,522
Anyhow, I had to
go to karate camp.

924
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:58,923
That sounds awful.

925
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,526
I mean, why on earth does he
think I need to learn karate?

926
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:04,395
Maybe 'cause you're constantly
getting your ass kicked.

927
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,897
What I'd really like to do
is this hip-hop dance camp.

928
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,533
That should do wonders
for your profile.

929
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,468
It's like this hip-hop
camp they have... like,

930
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,803
You know, dancing hip-hop
style and stuff like that.

931
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,771
I know what it is.

932
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:14,872
It's horrifying.

933
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:15,873
Don't do that.

934
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,007
That's easy for you to say.

935
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,209
You get to sit in
the park all day

936
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,444
With your hot-as-hell nanny.

937
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,512
Yep, that's what I do all day.

938
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,913
Here, check it out.

939
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,517
There are all these super-fly
lookin' ladies in the pamphlet.

940
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,018
Mm-hmm.

941
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,321
And you figure all
these fly-looking ladies

942
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,357
Are going to be there,
just waiting your arrival?

944

Good luck with that, buddy.

945
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,127
Of course my dad said no.

946
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,395
Smart man.

947
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:38,929
He just made some
vaguely racist remark

948
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,433
And threw it in the trash.

949
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,034
Checkmate.

950
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,270

00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,637
Gotta get your head
out of the clouds.

love that painting.

REGGIE: She kind
of looks like you.

956
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,184
I beg your pardon?

957
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,154
I mean in the eyes.

958
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:13,758
Good, because
she's fairly round.

959
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:18,663
Do you know anything
about Modigliani?

960
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:19,364
No.

961
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:20,865
I'll be I'm about to.

962
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:26,103
He died in penurian squalor
in 1920 at the age of 35.

963
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,071
What's penury?

964
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:28,406
Extreme poverty.

965
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:29,407
Mm.

966
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:30,741
Yeah, he was
discovered by a neighbor

967
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,744
In the final throes of
tubercular meningitis.

968
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,281
Evidently, his bed was
littered with bottles

969
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,916
Of alcohol and
empty sardine cans.

970
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,217
His girlfriend,
Jeanne Hebuterne,

971
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,453
Was there taking care of him.

972
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,188
You'd think she could
have cleared away

973
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:46,291
Some of the sardine cans.

974
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:49,660
She was nine months pregnant
with their second child.

975
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,962
Two days after his
death, she threw herself

976
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,900
Backwards from a
fifth-floor window.

977
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,501
Whoa.

978
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,772
Can I ask you a question?

979
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,308
Sure.

980
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,843
When did you first
become so advanced?

981
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,545
I'm not sure I became advanced.

982
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:11,248
Well, I mean, for instance,
when did you start to read?

983
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:14,018
I was able to read when
I was 18 months old.

984
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:16,554
I guess that might have
been when I became advanced.

985
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,089
What were you reading when
you were 18 months old?

986
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,192
My mother walked in, and I
was reading "Oh, the Thinks You"

987
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,194
"Can Think" by Dr. Seuss.

988
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:24,829
Out loud?

989
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,830
Yep.

990
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,831
She must have flipped out.

991
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,232
She was quite amused.

992
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,635
She'd bring me out at parties.

993
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:31,969
That's insane.

994
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,538
Yes, it is insane.

995
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:35,606
It's insane to wake a child
of less than two years of age

996
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,642
And insist that he sit in
the middle of the table

997
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,345
And read "Oh, the
Thinks You Can Think"

998
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:42,580
Out loud for a bunch
of drunk people.

999
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,814
Holy cow!

1000
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,716
And then... let's see.

1001
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:48,185
I guess right around
when I was four,

1002
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,221
They figured out I was
a sort of math prodigy,

1003
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,591
Solving pretty
intricate math problems.

1004
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:54,792
Wait, what?

1005
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,762
Multiplying seven to 10
digit numbers in my head.

1006
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,631
I could give you the cube root
of pretty much any number.

1007
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:01,899
Like Rain Man.

1008
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,702
No, I believe that character
was an autistic savant.

1009

As you can tell, I'm alert,
extroverted, affable,

1010
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:08,673
And articulate.

1011
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:09,740
Of course.

1012
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,342
And not to mention
devilishly handsome.

Not to mention.

1014
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:16,146
For me, it's always been
like a native language...

1015
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,282
Numbers, playing
music, composing.

1016
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:19,850
It's just the way I came out.

1017
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,454
My father, evidently, was
extremely intelligent.

1018
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,690
What does he do in China?

1019
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,190

00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,425

He doesn't do
anything in China.

He's dead.

00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:37,034
I was three.

1028
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,869
How did he die?

1029
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,971
Someone ran him over.

1030
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,139

00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,545
He was a concert pianist.

1034
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,279
He traveled quite a bit.

1035
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,982
He also held a degree
in physics from MIT.

Sounds amazing.

1037
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:56,153
I'm sure he had his
problems, like everyone else.

1038
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:59,189
However, I like to idealize
him into some mythic figure.

1039
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,126
It makes me feel better.

1040
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:05,262
I guess he also
drank a great deal.

I was thinking that he
might be of some assistance.

1099
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,840

Are you out of your mind?

1106
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,787
It used to be his job,
that kind of thing.

1107
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:44,555
Would you just drop
the subject, please?

1108
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,356
He could just go and
have a talk with him.

1109

I appreciate the
concern and all.

1110

Just a suggestion.

1111

Do you happen to know
who Liu Hoi Sing is?

1119

Why don't you
practice the cello?

1120
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,954
You could take it on one
of the balconies and play.

1121

He was the first Chinese
person to settle in New York.

1122

He arrived in 1862.

1123
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:24,094
He married an Irish woman
who bore him two daughters.

1124
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:24,929
Get your cello.

1125
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,163
You haven't practiced in weeks.

1126
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,431
Ah, I'm done with the cello.

1127
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,099
It takes too much out of me.

1128
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,435
Don't say that.

1129
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,437
I have no interest
in the cello.

1130
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:34,371

your friends and, you know,

1139
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,160
Yeah.

sick of hanging around with me

They're not my friends.

1151
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,373
I don't have friends like that.

1152
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:10,040

Well, I'll bet if you opened
up, they'd really like you.

1156
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,081
Perhaps you need to
make more of an effort.

1157
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:21,786
Well, let's at least call Raj.

1158

I know he's your friend.

1159

He's at karate camp.

01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:00,510
No, thank you.

1276
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,163
Oh, what a slob my sister is.

1277
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,797
She's got a lot of stuff.

1278
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:33,877
We can't sleep in this room.

1279
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:35,445
It'll be OK.

1280
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,885
Would you be more comfortable
if we stayed in a hotel?

1281
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:42,786
Yes.

1282
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:44,188
But I can't afford that.

1283
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,323
Yes, but would you
be more comfortable?

1284
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,698
I need to borrow your car.

1285
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:55,765
Where the hell you going?

1286
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,766
We're going to stay at a hotel.

1287
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,034
For chrissake, Eleanor.

1288
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,503
I'll bring it back
after the hospital.

1289
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:00,204
What time?

1290
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,438
Where... where you going?

1291
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:02,839
It's 9 o'clock at night.

1292
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,274
What the hell you gonna
do, go driving around town

1293
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:05,475
With this little kid?

1294
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,710
I don't know if
there's gas in there.

1295
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,911
What hotel do you
think you're going?

1296
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:08,778
I'll put gas in it.

1297
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:09,679
That room's a mess.

1298
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,780
We can't sleep in there.

1299
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,115
Well, if we knew what
time you were coming

1300
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:13,149
And that you were
bringing guests,

1301
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,284
We would have straightened up.

1302
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:17,654
Can I borrow your car or not?

1303
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,657
I don't know if
there's gas in there.

1304
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,426
I'll bring it back
in the morning.

1305
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:27,331
DALE: You're welcome.

1306
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,896
They have a pool.

1307
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,130
Closed for renovation.

1308
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:01,731
Oh, well.

1309
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,713
So is Dale your mom's brother?

1310
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,615
My dad's.

1311
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,050
They got married when
my parents split up.

1312
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,386
Wow.

1313
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:24,321
They were all friends
in high school.

1314
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:28,292
My dad joined the service,
went to fight in the Gulf War.

1315
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,927
Dale was there for her, I guess.

1316
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,462
And then my dad came home.

1317
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:36,366
He was all messed up and started
doing all this bad stuff,

1318
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,302
So they got divorced,
and Dale moved in.

1319
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:47,844
I'm tired.

1320
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:48,512
Go to sleep.

1321
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,623
When I close my eyes, it feels
like I'm still on the bus.

1322
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,795
What made you leave?

1323
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:07,263
Your whole family's here.

1324
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:09,499
I think you just answered
your own question.

1325
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,775
I wanted to go to Juilliard.

1326
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,545
To be an actress?

1327
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:22,145
No.

1328
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:24,247
God no.

1329
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:25,315
For music.

1330
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,851
For music?

1331
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,252
Yeah, I play the cornet.

1332
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:30,954
What?

1333
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,121
The cornet.

1334
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,459
It's like a trumpet
only smaller.

1335
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:38,127
I know what a cornet is.

1336
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,564
So you're a musician?

1337
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:41,531
Yep.

1338
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,867
Why didn't you tell me before?

1339
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,436
I didn't not tell you.

1340
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,538
How long have you played?

1341
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,107
Since the fourth grade.

1342
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:54,110
They did this test to check
everyone's tonal ability,

1343
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,947
And I got a perfect score,
so I got the free rental.

1344
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,216
Wait, free rental?

1345
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,719
That's how you started
playing the cornet?

1346
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,120
Yeah.

1347
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,356
Well, actually I wanted to play
the trumpet, but they were out.

1348
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,458
So they handed me
a cornet, which

1349
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:10,627
Was fine by me, because
it's easier to play.

1350
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:13,430
And the case was a lot
lighter to carry around.

1351
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,998
That was lucky.

1352
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:16,299
Yeah.

1353
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,068
I played in the band
all through high school.

1354
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,104
I loved it.

1355
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:25,609
I was chosen to play in the
special, like, all-star band

1356
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,677
They put together
for the ceremony

1357
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:30,580
To open the new war
memorial in Syracuse.

1358
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,881
That sounds like a big deal.

1359
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,883
Hillary Clinton was
there to cut the ribbon.

1360
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,285
I got to play a solo.

1361
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:39,022
So what happened
with Juilliard?

1362
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:41,324
They invited me to attend.

1363
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:42,959
Wow.

1364
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,293
Yeah.

1365
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:46,262
But they couldn't offer
me a full scholarship,

1366
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,833
So I didn't have enough
money for the tuition.

1367
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,268
That's awful.

1368
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,637
Not really.

1369
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,105
I'm not sure I really
wanted to go there.

1370
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,141
So what did you do then?

1371
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:02,846
Got a job waiting tables,
started playing in the subway.

1372
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,213
No.

1373
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,450
Yeah.

1374
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,085
I'd play all these,
like, Beatles songs,

1375
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:11,087
And I made good money.

1376
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:12,321
That's how I met Dennis.

1377
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,123
In the subway?

1378
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,358
Yeah.

1379
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:16,493
He saw me, and one
day he just started

1380
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:18,795
Hanging out there
on the platform.

1381
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,130
The trains would come
and go, and we'd just

1382
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,099
Sit there on the bench.

1383
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,400
Did he give you money?

1384
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:25,569
Oh, yeah.

1385
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:31,074
After a while, he started
bringing me coffee and stuff.

1386
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,310
One time he dropped a bag
of Skittles in my case.

1387
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,180
It was cute.

1388
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,248
And then finally
I asked him, you

1389
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,418
Know, hey, you ever
going to say hello?

1390
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,253
What did he say?

1391
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,756
He said he didn't
want to bother me.

1392
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:49,358
He just loved the
sound of my trumpet.

1393
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:51,628
What did you say?

1394
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:55,098
I said, it's not
a trumpet, dummy.

1395
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,199
It happens to be a cornet.

1396
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:58,334
What did he say?

1397
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,904
I don't remember.

1398
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:04,040
Then he took me to lunch at
this Korean barbecue place,

1399
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,409
Which I thought was really cool.

1400
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,646
And we started, you
know, hanging out.

1401
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:12,248
Like boyfriend-girlfriend?

1402
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,918
No, not right away.

1403
01:14:15,018 --> 01:14:16,586
He had a band.

1404
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,654
That was the other thing.

1405
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:19,989
He asked me to join his band.

1406
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,290
He plays guitar.

1407
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,192
Well, not anymore, since
you threw it out the window.

1408
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,462
Yeah, well, I don't feel
so good about doing that.

1409
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,265
I let my emotions
get the better of me.

1410
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:32,001
So where's your cornet?

1411
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:34,470
I don't have it anymore.

1412
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,073
Why not?

1413
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,242
Long story.

1414
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:41,845
Got in a little
financial situation.

1415
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,980
You sold it?

1416
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,314
Sold it?

1417
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,151
Yeah.

1418
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:53,022
It was a nice horn too, an Olds.

1419
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:57,026
My dad bought it for my
high school graduation.

1420
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,462
Total surprise.

1421
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:00,730
I didn't even know he was there.

1422
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,799
I hadn't seen him for a while.

1423
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:08,872
And then when I was
leaving the ceremony,

1424
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:12,542
He was waiting in
the parking lot.

1425
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:15,278
He was holding this case
with a big red bow around it.

1426
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:27,090
Well, good night.

1427
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,091
Good night.

1428
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:41,137
What was the name of that piece
you wrote for the recital?

1429
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,877
"Like Sunday, Like Rain."

1430
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:51,648
So beautiful.

1431
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,817
I'll write a part for cornet.

1432
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:03,159
[Music playing]

1433
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:24,633
Hey, Shelly.

1434
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:27,236
Hey, Eleanor.

1435
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:29,739
This is Reggie.

1436
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:30,807
You dyed your hair.

1437
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,644
So, I heard that you guys
stayed at Days Inn last night.

1438
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:38,014
I'm sorry the room
was such a mess.

1439
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,649
Yeah, you could have
cleaned it up a little bit.

1440
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,118
Yeah, well, that's
kind of hard to do

1441
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,853
When you're working
40 hours a week.

1442
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:47,056
And what are you doing
working in that place?

1443
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:49,592
There are plenty of places
besides that to work in.

1444
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:50,860
You know what?

1445
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,295
It is none of your
business where I work.

1446
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,597
Are you going to cover
my fucking car insurance

1447
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:57,666
And payments for me?

1448
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:59,268
Come on.

1449
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:00,236
Yeah.

1450
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,605
I didn't think so.

1451
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:03,807
That's right.

1452
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:09,278
Acting all high and mighty
in front of your friend.

1453
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,587
Where'd you go?

1454
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,622
Don't tell me you
stayed at the Days Inn.

1455
01:19:19,722 --> 01:19:20,890
Mind putting out the cigarette?

1456
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,591
There's a child present.

1457
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,526
Where's Dale?

1458
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:24,427
Sleeping.

1459
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:25,294
You like Lucky Charms?

1460
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:26,429
I got Lucky Charms.

1461
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:27,196
He's fine.

1462
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:27,897
No, thank you.

1463
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,432
Here's his lousy keys.

1464
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:31,334
I'm calling a taxi.

1465
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:32,836
Where you going now?

1466
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:34,203
Bus station.

1467
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,438
Bus station?

1468
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:36,605
Did you see your father?

1469
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,107
I thought that's
what you came to do.

1470
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:38,674
Yeah.

1471
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,442
Yeah, I saw him.

1472
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:40,276
How about you?

1473
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:41,577
Have you seen him?

1474
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:42,678
Has anyone here bothered to
go down there and see him?

1475
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,213
Keep your voice down.

1476
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,815
You have had a bug up your
ass since you showed up here.

1477
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:46,715
What's the matter?

1478
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:47,616
Yeah, I'd like a taxi.

1479
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,718
59 Pennwick Street.

1480
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:50,753
Yeah, to the bus station.

1481
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:52,055
Thanks.

1482
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:53,356
What the hell is all
this noise going on?

1483
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:54,723
He's on life support, Dale.

1484
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:55,992
Yeah, I know that.

1485
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:57,160
They said that they've
been calling you,

1486
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,694
And you never called him back.

1487
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,529
Do you know what his
veteran benefits cover?

1488
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,865
Not very much.

1489
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,066
That's the reason they
have been calling here.

1490
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,034
I... I just don't
understand why.

1491
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,204
Would it have been so hard
for you to go down there

1492
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,405
And sit with him?

1493
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:10,840
He's your brother.

1494
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,241
He was all alone.

1495
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,010
Hey, I didn't see
you nowhere when

1496
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:17,780
Things started getting bad, so
don't go giving me no lectures.

1497
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:19,015
We'll wait on the corner.

1498
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:21,150
MOM: Come back in
the house, Eleanor.

1499
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,085
Go to hell!

1500
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:27,690
Hey, Eleanor.

1501
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,925
Take it easy, will you?

1502
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,960
I'm never coming
back here again.

1503
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,562
DALE: Just come back inside.

1504
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,697
Eleanor.

1505
01:20:34,797 --> 01:20:36,866
Eleanor!

1506
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:41,070
[Music playing]

1507
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,080
Sorry.

1508
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,514
That's all they
had in the station.

1509
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:26,515
This is fine.

1510
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:27,116
Thanks.

1511
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,489
Good.

1512
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:40,663
Are you really never
going back there?

1513
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:41,564
Where?

1514
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:42,966
Home.

1515
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:45,634
You said that you were
never gonna go back there.

1516
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,370
Who knows?

1517
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:51,407
Probably someday, to see my
brother if he ever comes back.

1518
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:54,110
And you know, I worry
about my sister,

1519
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,145
Though sometimes I
want to strangle her.

1520
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,248
She could come see
you in New York.

1521
01:21:59,348 --> 01:21:59,615
Sure.

1522
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,356
I think actually I'm
gonna head out West.

1523
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:08,757
Out West?

1524
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:11,794
This friend of mine lives in
Idaho, works at a ski resort,

1525
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:14,230
Makes pretty good money.

1526
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,865
She's always telling me she
could hook me up with a job

1527
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:17,633
There.

1528
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:18,934
Sounds cold.

1529
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:20,869
It's really pretty.

1530
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:21,870
I've seen pictures.

1531
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:23,072
It's not cold all the time.

1532
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,746
So that's what you're gonna do?

1533
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:33,116
Yeah, I think so.

1534
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:34,683
What about the cornet?

1535
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,052
What about it?

1536
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:37,653
I'll come back to it someday.

1537
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,255
You have to.

1538
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:41,690
Why don't you read your book?

1539
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,092
Finished it.

1540
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:45,261
"Grapes of Wrath," there's
a happy story for you.

1541
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:54,303
You have a gift, and you have an
obligation to take care of it.

1542
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:55,904
What are you talking about?

1543
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:57,906
For all you know, I
could be the worst cornet

1544
01:22:58,007 --> 01:22:58,974
Player in the whole world.

1545
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:00,243
I don't think so.

1546
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:01,910
I don't think you
would have been chosen

1547
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:04,680
For that all-star band
if that were the case.

1548
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:08,151
You certainly wouldn't
have gotten into Juilliard.

1549
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:10,453
It's a crime to deprive
the world of your art.

1550
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,121
I thought you
said art was dead.

1551
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:13,556
Yes, and it will
remain that way

1552
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,492
If all the great artists
abandon their cornets

1553
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:17,493
And move to Idaho.

1554
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,266
Just promise me you'll
come back to it.

1555
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:28,437
Promise me you'll come
back to your music.

1556
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:30,839
I will if you will.

1557
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:31,440
Deal.

1558
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,035
I dozed off.

1559
01:24:33,136 --> 01:24:36,038
You breathe so
deeply when you sleep.

1560
01:24:36,139 --> 01:24:40,209
I was dreaming.

1561
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:42,077
I was at this lake
that we used to go

1562
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:44,747
To when I was a little girl.

1563
01:24:44,847 --> 01:24:46,749
Dennis was there.

1564
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:49,785
Did you love him?

1565
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:51,487
I guess so.

1566
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,589
I thought I did.

1567
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:54,890
Did he love you?

1568
01:24:58,194 --> 01:24:59,662
He said he did.

1569
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:03,832
He told me he did, but
you know, who knows?

1570
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:07,636
First he was nice, and then
he started treating me bad

1571
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:13,709
And lying and stuff, so I
guess you never really know.

1572
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:18,814
Do you think you're ever going
to get married, have kids?

1573
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:19,848
So many questions.

1574
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:20,683
Sorry.

1575
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:21,817
I'm just curious.

1576
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,223
I don't think so.

1577
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:30,025
I don't think that stuff is
all it's cracked up to be.

1578
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,594
I've never seen it work.

1579
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,296
I would disagree.

1580
01:25:33,396 --> 01:25:34,997
Who's all sentimental?

1581
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:37,132
It does work.

1582
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:41,304
If you belong together with
someone, then it works.

1583
01:25:41,404 --> 01:25:43,206
The trouble is
finding someone you

1584
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:46,875
Belong with who
belongs with you.

1585
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,751
Do you think you'll
ever see him again?

1586
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,019
No.

1587
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:58,554
If someone doesn't
treat you the way

1588
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:02,425
You deserve, then they
don't deserve to have you.

1589
01:26:02,525 --> 01:26:04,893
My dad always told me that.

1590
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,962
Will I?

1591
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:07,996
Will you what?

1592
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,998
See you.

1593
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,099
I'm right here.

1594
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,935
After you go, I mean.

1595
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,537
You're going, right?

1596
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,910
So, will I ever see you again?

1597
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,246
If you want to.

1598
01:26:25,748 --> 01:26:30,353
We could send letters
and stuff, keep in touch.

1599
01:26:30,453 --> 01:26:33,021
Something tells me a year from
now you won't remember my name.

1600
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,223
That's not true.

1601
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:46,869
I wonder if anyone
will ever love me.

1602
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,308
I think the odds
are pretty good.

1603
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:05,521
[Doorbell]

1604
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:19,668
So, how old is he?

1605
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:20,703
Oh, he's 12.

1606
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:21,804
He's really great.

1607
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:25,040
You'll love him.

1608
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,975
Hey, Reg.

1609
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:27,743
Come meet Karina.

1610
01:27:30,813 --> 01:27:31,714
Hi, Reggie.

1611
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:32,948
Nice to meet you.

1612
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:34,683
You have a beautiful home.

1613
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:35,818
Thank you.

1614
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,187
It was built by Captain
Francis Falk in 1898.

1615
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:42,358
He also designed the
Museum of Natural History.

1616
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,126
KARINA: Oh, that's
so interesting.

1617
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:45,160
Not really.

1618
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,396
He designed lots of buildings.

1619
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:50,899
Come and help me
show her around.

1620
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,200
No, thank you.

1621
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:53,569
I'm going to go back
in my room and finish

1622
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:56,972
Reading this biography
of Groucho Marx.

1623
01:27:57,072 --> 01:27:58,073
It was nice to meet you.

1624
01:27:58,173 --> 01:28:00,008
KARINA: Nice to meet you too.

1625
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,375
[Knocking]

1626
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:08,911
Good morning.

1627
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:12,014
Dark roast French press,
just like you like it.

1628
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:14,550
ELEANOR: Awesome.

1629
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,084
I hope you're hungry.

1630
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,455
I made a vegetable frittata
and some flourless pancakes.

1631
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,155
Come on down.

1632
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:52,488
More coffee?

1633
01:29:52,588 --> 01:29:54,222
No, thank you.

1634
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:55,023
This is delicious.

1635
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:08,003
Esa will be here
tomorrow at 8:00 AM.

1636
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:11,707
So Karina's going to
make your dinner tonight.

1637
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:14,510
And lunch.

1638
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,711
I can feed myself.

1639
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,254
Don't forget your vitamins.

1640
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:27,823
Why do you have to go?

[Doorbell]

1642
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:43,639
Must be Karina.

1643
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:21,644
She's just getting
herself unpacked.

1644
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:26,615
Do you want to go for
a walk or something?

1645
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:28,851
I think I should
probably get going.

1646
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:29,251
Right.

1647
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:38,493
This is for you.

1648
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:40,095
What is it?

1649
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:43,231
I made some penne with fresh
pesto and some of that crispy

1650
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:47,335
Kale you like for your trip.

1651
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:48,537
Thanks, Reg.

1652
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,281
Oh, well.

1653
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:02,217
Yep.

1654
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:04,152
Karina's very nice.

1655
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:04,920
Yeah.

1656
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:05,688
She seems great.

1657
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:12,761
She likes to play
chess, she told me.

1658
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:13,161
Cool.

1659
01:32:16,064 --> 01:32:19,434
Um, your mom's
back on the 27th,

1660
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,504
And she's going to
call you tonight.

1661
01:32:22,605 --> 01:32:24,339
Esa's back tomorrow
morning, so...

1662
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:25,307
I know.

1663
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:26,274
Don't worry.

1664
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:33,515
Straight on to Idaho, then.

1665
01:32:33,616 --> 01:32:37,820
I'm not too sure
about that right now.

1666
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,357
I think I need to go home
for a while, regroup.

1667
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:46,328
You know, gather myself.

1668
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:49,431
Sometimes that's
the best thing.

1669
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:50,999
Regroup, take stock.

1670
01:32:56,839 --> 01:33:00,275
It's been really nice
getting to know you.

1671
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:00,876
You too.

1672
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:05,881
It's hard to believe it's
only been a couple of months.

1673
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:10,052
I feel like I've known you...

1674
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:14,690
I have all these
words, these things

1675
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:20,428
And... that I think I feel
the need to say to you.

1676
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:25,267
Only now, suddenly I don't
have the capacity to speak.

1677
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:32,708
I couldn't have stayed
forever, you know.

1678
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:35,010
It was only supposed to
be a temporary thing.

1679
01:33:39,514 --> 01:33:42,384
It's OK.
