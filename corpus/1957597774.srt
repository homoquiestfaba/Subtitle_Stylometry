00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,625
feeding the poor
and picking up trash and shit.

179
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,938
- [Riley] They're busy killing Black people.
- Are we being real right now?

180
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,500
Because I can get real.

181
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,541
- Oh boy...
- [laughter]

182
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,750
It sounds fucked up, but

183
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,458
I have my own problems to worry about.

184
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,041
I can't feed bums on the street,

185
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
I can barely pay my own fucking rent.

186
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,875
- [Brandon] Wow!
- [Luna] Really? Really John.

187
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,166
- That's true though!
- [Riley] So true.

188
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,041
I'm not trying to be

189
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,416
an asshole or anything.

190
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,916
Tell me I'm the only one in the room

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,041
who thinks this?

192
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,625
Tell me.

193
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,500
Right?

194
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,833
I mean, shit, if I'm being really real.

195
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,750
There have been starving kids in Africa

196
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,291
since before I was born.

197
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,708
So like, if they're still starving,

198
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,208
they must not be really starving
or they'd be dead.

199
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,000
- [Brandon] Dude!
- [John] I'm just fucking saying.

200
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,458
- [Monica] Oh my god...
- [John] If the greatest minds haven't

201
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,000
been able to solve the problem
in all these years

202
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,375
what the fuck can I do?

203
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,083
- [Luna] John!
- [Riley] He's right!

204
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,291
- [John] Think about it!
- How am I supposed

205
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,958
to pick up all this trash on the beach?

206
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,083
- [Britney] Yeah!
- If people just keep putting it there.

207
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,666
I have a life. I won't be truly living

208
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,833
if all I'm doing is picking up trash.

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,166
Exactly, I hate donating blood.

210
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,041
[Luna] I can't stand blood.

211
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,416
Why kill myself for someone else?

212
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,041
Bet you'd kill yourself for me, right?

213
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,375
Fuck yeah, bitch, of course.

214
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,916
- [laughter]
- [Brandon] Come on.

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,416
All these problems in the world,

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
I live halfway across the planet,

217
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,916
I can't do jack shit.

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,333
See, that's why I want to be rich

219
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,125
so I can donate to things.

220
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,458
- [Britney] Aw, you wanna' be rich.
- I agree with Luna,

221
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,666
people come up with
new solutions all the time.

222
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,208
Yeah, while you two are getting rich,

223
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,833
people are going to die.

224
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,250
Why is the world so fucked up, though?

225
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,916
Has anyone actually thought about it?

226
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,416
Like, why would God do that?

227
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,125
It's the devil.

228
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,375
- True story.
- [Monica] It's not the fucking devil.

229
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,833
- All right. What then?
- [Brandon] Could be.

230
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,166
You have no idea
who runs the media and governments.

231
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,625
- Oh fuck off.
- [Riley] The governments?

232
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,208
Who do you think controls the news

233
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,583
telling you it's all bad?

234
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,291
[John] Come on.

235
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,833
And the economy?

236
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,416
Making us stressed, anxious and depressed

237
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,750
so they can sell us drugs

238
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,250
and make shit tons of money off?

239
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,208
[Britney] Oh, Monica, chill!

240
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,291
Just saying Britney,

241
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,833
there is some fucked up,

242
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,666
sinister shit going on in this world

243
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,166
that no one talks about because they do...

244
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,333
[mouth click]

245
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:19,583
What shit?

246
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,625
Jack! Shh!

247
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,291
What?

248
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,583
You know, every mass shooter

249
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,208
was on some
sort of mind drug, right?

250
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,250
- [Riley] What?
- [John] Stop!

251
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,708
The news never talks about that.

252
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,250
Any celebrity they want to terminate...

253
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,375
Suicide... OD...

254
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,708
It's the new "natural" cause.

255
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,458
And they told me I had ADHD
when I was nine.

256
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,500
- [John] Can't imagine why.
- [Monica] Wanted to end my creativity.

257
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,291
Fuck you!

258
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,958
I was nine!

259
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,791
I'm supposed to be hyper at nine.

260
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Okay. How do you even know all this?

261
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,375
I've researched a fuck ton online.

262
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,208
Oh, all that fake news,
conspiracy shit.

263
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,250
You need to know how
to do proper research.

264
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,291
It's right there.

265
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,125
Okay, show me.

266
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:54,875
Okay.

267
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:55,458
All right. All right.

268
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,708
You guys, please, no,

269
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,750
can we stop with the fucking conspiracy shit!

270
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,208
- [chatter]
- [Britney] Jack, come on!

271
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,791
- [Brandon] Jack, dude!
- [Britney] Please, you guys!

272
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,708
- [laughter]
- You guys?

273
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,791
The world is fucked, okay?

274
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,041
And we're not going to be able
to do jack shit about it.

275
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,875
So let's just enjoy our lives.

276
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,625
- [Riley] Let's!
- Okay? Right?

277
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,333
Why, I don't even...

278
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,291
Why the fuck are you watching this shit?

279
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,708
[John] Seriously.

280
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,291
- [Riley] Thank you!
- Let's go do something fun.

281
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,000
Like what?

282
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
I don't know.

283
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,375
Brandon, what do we do as kids?

284
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,041
You're the one complaining. Ideas?

285
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,375
I don't know, I guess,
talk to each other more?

286
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,041
- or play catch.
- [Britney] Yeah, no, that's great!

287
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,250
- [Jack] Spin the bottle.
- [Luna] Play catch!

288
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,291
I talk to a lot of people now

289
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,833
more than ever on social media,
so I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
- [John] I can't do social media.
- You know, I kind of lost touch

291
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,875
with all my friends on social.

292
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,250
I see everything they do, but...

293
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,583
When we talk, it's
kind of superficial. I guess...

294
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,916
- [Riley] I don't think so.
- [Monica] Another reason why

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,750
the world is so fucked.

296
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,583
Computers, phones, social media

297
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,541
- making everyone fucking antisocial.
- [Britney] Alright.

298
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:49,916
Alright!

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,125
- Monica, come on.
- [Riley] Get off then.

300
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,166
Knock it off!

301
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,291
Can we just fucking

302
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
look each other in the face

303
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,416
and fucking fact on each other?

304
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,291
[Stacy] We are talking to each other.

305
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,500
I need some water.

306
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,916
[Riley] You're an asshole, John.

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,291
Yes, but I'll always be yours.

308
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,166
- [Jack] Go talk to her.
- [John] Change your sexual preference.

309
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,500
[Riley] Suck my dick.

310
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,916
[John] Anytime, anywhere.

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,875
Go!

312
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,958
Okay, ya'll, listen...

313
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,166
This is my fucking house.

314
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,708
And if I say we're talking to each other,

315
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,458
we're gonna' fucking talk to each other.

316
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,541
Monica!

317
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,625
Oh, Jesus!

318
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
[Monica] Fine. What do you want
to talk about?

319
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,583
- [Brandon] Hey.
- Hey.

320
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,250
- [Jack] Let's talk about horror movies.
- I don't know why I'm so thirsty.

321
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,791
Yeah, me too.

322
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,041
You know...

323
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,500
All that talk

324
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
in there made me realize something...

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,750
Oh yeah.

326
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,833
Yeah.

327
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,791
[Stacy] They're all jump scares...

328
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,208
That we don't really talk enough...

329
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,208
What do you mean
we don't talk enough?

330
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,083
I guess I don't mean like

331
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,791
talk enough, I guess...

332
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,375
You know, talk about things that we really...

333
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,791
should talk about...

334
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,625
Well, what things
do you want to talk about?

335
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,375
[Monica] Is anyone feeling a little strange?

336
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,416
- [ear ringing]
- [Riley] Yeah, kinda'...

337
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,083
[Stacy] I'm feeling tired...

338
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,833
[Monica] What's in this drink?

339
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,416
[Jack] I don't know, but it is strong.

340
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,708
[Britney] It tastes like Vodka...

341
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,708
You know, since your grandma, um...

342
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,958
things have been different...

343
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
Yeah, it's been um...

344
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:09,958
I know.

345
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,458
I'm sorry.

346
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,416
What? No, no, no, no.

347
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,250
Not with you. With me.

348
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,791
You know, she and I, she just...

349
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,000
[Monica] Something is wrong...

350
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,708
It was the last time I saw her,
you know, and I, uh...

351
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,541
It's been hard for me to shake it.

352
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,416

If it's got bullets in it

526
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,791
just take it and shoot
the door off.

527
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,708
- [Brandon] Fuck.
- [Luna] Yeah.

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,166
I wouldn't do that.

529
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,875
[sinister female voice] He says
I'm not supposed to kill you.

530
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,250
- [Brandon] What the fuck?
- [Stacy] Guys?

531
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, my God.

532
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,083
[Brandon] Who are you?

533
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,708
[Brandon] What do you want?

534
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,250
[Jack] Who the fuck are you?!

535
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,375
[Stacy] That's the girl from the TV.

536
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
How do we get out of here?

537
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,500
You survive.

538
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,625
Didn't they tell you?

539
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,083
What?

540
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,833
Your memory must not be so good,

541
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,458
[echoing voice]

542
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,083
Look,

543
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,291
I don't know what's going on here,

544
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,875
but can we have a conversation?

545
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,958
We are having a conversation.

546
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,791
Pills?

547
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,125
Taste good.

548
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,625
Please

549
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,916
tell us how to get out of here.

550
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,291
Going once,

551
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,208
going twice...

552
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,000
More for me.

553
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,708
I have a movie show you.

554
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,833
He put me here to say something...

555
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,666
He put me here to say something!

556
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,166
[Jack] What the fuck?

557
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,541
[Crazy Girl laughs]

558
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,541
It's...

559
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
- [echoed snap]
- [whoosh]

560
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,583
[dark echoed voice]

561
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,000
[heavy breathing]

562
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,958
- What the fuck?!
- What the fuck?!

563
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,083
Where the fuck are we?!

564
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,750
[young adults frantic]

565
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,875
That actually worked.

566
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,125
Fuck you!!

567
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,333
- John!
- John!

568
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,208
- John!
- Don't hurt him!

569
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,125
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey!

570
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:08,875
[Stacy] Shit!

571
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:10,666
- [Crazy Girl] Brandon! Jack.
- [Monica] Stop.

572
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,708
- Monica.
- [Stacy] Let him go!

573
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,958
I will kill him.

574
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,333
- [Stacy] Shit!
- [Britney] Guys, back up!

575
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,916
I'm good with minds.

576
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,416
I'm good with internal organs
and things too.

577
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,125
[Stacy] Oh my god.

578
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,708
But I'm hoping I don't have to use my skills
at this moment.

579
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,125
[Monica] Okay, hold on.

580
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,375
[Crazy Girl] Because I want to watch this.

581
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,208
Sit, please.

582
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,500
[John] Please.

583
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,625
I don't have to be polite.

584
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,500
[Monica] Okay.

585
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,583
Do what she says.

586
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,291
[Monica] Come on, sit.

587
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,666
Sit down.

588
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,333
Thank you.

589
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,041
[John grunts]

590
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,000
I really enjoy killing.

591
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,166
But he says I'm not supposed to kill you.

592
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,333
I'm just an usher.

593
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,708
I'm just an usher...

594
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,958
Come on!

595
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,291
Come on, work!

596
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,875
[television static]

597
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,750
[male voice] Journal 301,

598
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,708
how I got into the crazy business.

599
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,750
When I was a young boy, I was deathly

600
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,041
afraid of the monsters in my

601
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,625
closet and under my bed.

602
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,166
My mother
was a nurse at a local asylum, so...

603
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,625
She used to treat me...

604
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,083
Every Friday night, she would tie me up,

605
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,458
and make me watch horror films

606
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,333
and footage of the horrors of society...

607
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,166
as she listened to Marion Harris,

608
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,041
and doing her crossword puzzles
and her board games.

609
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,708
Suppose I do have to thank her, though.

610
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,250
Because in the end, the treatment worked.

611
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,375
I wasn't scared anymore.

612
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,875
I was so accustomed to fear,

613
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,875
it became part of me.

614
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,833
And it will become part of you too...

615
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,166
Enjoy the experiment.

616
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,958
[television static]

617
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,833
That's where you're meant to go,

618
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,041
your family

619
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,250
and your friends and such are in there.

620
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,333
[Jack] Wait, what?

621
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,583
[gasp]

622
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,125
He says I'm not supposed to kill you.

623
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,750
I'm not supposed to kill you.

624
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,208
[Britney] Fuck.

625
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,541
[breathing]

626
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,041
[Riley's Mom] Riley!

627
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,000
Mom?

628
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,958
[Riley's Mom] Riley!

629
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,458
[Riley] Mom?

630
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,833
Riley.

631
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,000
Hey, Riley.

632
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,000
- [Riley] Mom?
- [Riley's Mom] Riley!!

633
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,708
[Riley's Mom] Quickly!!

634
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,333
[Stacy] Oh my God.

635
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,333
- [Jack] What the...
- [grunt]

636
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,250
[startled voices]

637
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,708
- [Riley's Mom] Come here!

638
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,708
- [Brandon] Hey, man.
- [Riley's Mom] Come here...

639
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,958
[Monica] Brandon!

640
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,625
- Hey back the fuck up, man!
- [Riley] Shit, it's the fucking pizza guy!

641
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,208
Hey, hey!

642
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,083
Hey man, what the fuck is wrong with you?

643
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,625
[yelling and screaming]

644
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,166
- [Jack] Shoot him, man!
- [Luna] Brandon!

645
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,625
[Brandon] Dude, hey man!
[growling]

646
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,833
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

647
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,125
- Oh!

[yelling and screaming]

649
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,541
[Luna] What is that?! What's happening?!

Kill them!

659
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,583
Fuck! Oh god!

[Luna] Brandon!

661
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,541
- God!
- [Luna] Brandon, what's wrong?!

662
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,708
- Come on, tell me!
- [Brandon] I'm fucking dying!

663
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,416

I'm fucking dying!

666
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,333
- Turn him over!
- [Jack] What the fuck!

667
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:10,458
Oh, it's like I've been shot!

668
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,583

00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,166

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,041
- [heavy breathing]
- [Luna] Get him up.

673
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,958

674
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,958
No!

675
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,250
No, guys, I can't, I fucking can't.

676
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,791
I can't, that fucking guy!

677
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,458
That's the guy who delivered
our fucking pizza!

678
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,458
- I knew I'd fucking seen that guy!
- [Jack] We're in a hospital?!

679
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,791
This isn't real!

680
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,166
Taking too long!

not supposed to kill you.

00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,750
Well, fuck him!

688
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,833
I'll do whatever the fuck I want.

689
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,833
You have about ten seconds until she dies.

690
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,333
- Ten!
- [Brandon] Guys...

691
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:06,958
[Britney] What do we do?

692
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,208
[Luna] We have to help her.

693
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,291
- [Jack] How?
- Nine.

694
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,041
[Monica] We need to go.

695
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,250

696
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,916
- [Monica] Go!!
- Seven.

697
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,833

- [Luna] This is crazy!
- [Jack] How the fuck did we get in

702
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,458

703
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,166
[Riley] Where the fuck do we go?

704
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,625

to gain compliance.

1244
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,750
The drugs act as a shock in themselves.

1245
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,000
We only have to give the commands
and they'll follow.

1246

1250
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,250
these tests to great success
all over the country.

[The Superintendent] The results are...

1255
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,875
sufficient...

1256
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:19,750
which leads us to our latest experiment.

1257
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,166
- [Riley] Mom.
- As you can see, I have entered the area,

1258
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,750
educated the public and convinced them

1259
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,666
onto the medication.

1260
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,708
[Riley] Mom...

1261
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,500
Now we use them how we see fit.

1262
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,833
And that was just the beginning.

1263
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,250
One by one, they moved
to influence one another,

1264
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,541
spreading the drug amongst themselves,

1265
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,166
rendering the town

1266
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,500

- These motherfuckers...
- No.

1270
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,625
- No, that's not...
- [Brandon] We have to find Luna.

1271
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:07,666
How's that possible?

1272
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:08,416
They can't do that.

1273
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,541
They can't do that!

1274
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,583
Yes, they fucking can.

1275
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,500
This shit isn't real,

1276
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,666
we just saw the whole fucking town!

1277
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,166
I know what we just saw!

1278
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,958
I'm telling you it's real!

1279
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,541
It's what LSD was developed for
with MKUltra in the 1950s.

1280
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,166
- Basic mind control.
- [Jack] MKUltra? Bullshit!

1281
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,958
We need to get Luna, we find her
and we get the fuck out of here

1282
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,666
- Now!
- How are we supposed to do that?

1283
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,791
We're not supposed to do that.

1284
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:33,375
You think they're going to
fucking let us leave, huh?

1285
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,458
- After seeing that shit?!
- [Brandon] We'll figure something out!

1286
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,625
Hey, Brandon's right.

1287
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,041
We have to figure a way out.

1288
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,291
It's the only fucking way.

1289
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,166

01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,541
You have many questions.

1929
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,708
Why are you doing this, you fucks!

1930
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:11,500
[low rumble] You have many questions...

1931
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:12,666
Why?!

1932
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,666
Answer me!

1933
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,625
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

1934
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,375
Where's Luna?!

1935
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,333
Where are my friends?!

1936
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:22,833
[sliding chair, energy rumble]

1937
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,000
Say something!

1938
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,083
Answer me, God damn it!

1939
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,208
[heavy rumble]

1940
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:34,166
- Ahh, you son of a bitch...
- [heavy rumble]

1941
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,750
[heavy rumble, rattling table]

1942
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:42,875
[energy, hovering pulsating]

1943
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,916
[panting]

1944
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,875
[heavy rumble, whoosh]

1945
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:55,583
- [Brandon yelling]
- [intense chaotic music]

1946
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:02,083
[Brandon crying out in pain]

1947
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,458
[more Brandon pain]

1948
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,625
[struggling]

1949
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:11,291
Fuck you!!

1950
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:18,291
- [heavy rumble, loud screeching "brain stab"]
- [Brandon] Oh, fuck! [convulsing]

1951
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,166
[finger snap, whoosh]

1952
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,291
[loud screeching subsides]

1953
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:28,166
[Brandon gasping for air]

1954
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,000
[more gasping]

1955
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,375
- [Briefcase Man] You need to drink.
- [Brandon panting]

1956
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:45,166
[slurping, breathing]

1957
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,916
[low rumble]

1958
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,708
He likes you.

1959
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,666
Then let us go!

1960
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:55,416
He can't do that.

1961
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:57,375
This is greater than any of us.

1962
01:22:57,458 --> 01:23:00,125
Even now, this is part of the experiment.

1963
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,625
[low rumble]

1964
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,791
He suggests you hurry.

1965
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,125
You still might be able
to make it out alive.

1966
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,583
Luna is in the house.

1967
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,041
She's not far.

1968
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,958
[low rumble]

1969
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:15,666
Okay.

1970
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:22,958
[television turns on, static]

1971
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,458
Best of luck.

1972
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,666
[The Superintendent] Journal 310.

1973
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,083
The key experiment.

1974
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:38,833
We've administered the drug

1975
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,083
and installed the commands

1976
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:42,708
in the young adults... Subjects B.

1977
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,916
Triggers and phrases

1978
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
will bring them
into hallucinated realities

1979
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,916
where they'll unknowingly
follow the commands.

1980
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,291
[echoing voice]

1981
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,541
[ear ringing]

1982
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,250
[echoed voice] If you take off your weapon

1983
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,458
you get an extreme migraine

1984
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,750
and die in 60 seconds. You see your family
and friends killing you.

1985
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:02,041
You see each house
in my supernatural vision.

1986
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,583
Kill them.

1987
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:06,083
[evil demonic laughter]

1988
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,875
[The Superintendent]
You will commit mass murder.

1989
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,958
[loud whimpering]

1990
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,291
Subjects A...

1991
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,125
...the families
that we've been controlling for

1992
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,500
the past few weeks

1993
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,000
have been released from our control

1994
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:21,375
to become trial victims.

1995
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:23,541
They're given only two commands.

1996
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,708
One...

1997
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,708
not to leave the house.

1998
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,000
Two...

1999
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:31,583
To agree to
the imaginings of Subjects B.

2000
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,250
This shows the power of the mind

2001
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,166
Somehow Subjects A respond to
the fabricated rules of Subjects B

2002
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,583
without being told what those rules are...

2003
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:45,583
Telepathic communication.

2004
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:48,166
Subjects B are weapons...

2005
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,000
killing their loved ones without remorse.

2006
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,416
Death will act as a trigger,

2007
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,333
reinforcing the commands.

2008
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:57,000
If they try to resist,

2009
01:24:57,083 --> 01:25:00,041
they will attack themselves,
however they see most fitting.

2010
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:05,083
Now, I believe that we can
achieve our aims with drugs,

2011
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:08,208
hypnotic commands, and triggers alone...

2012
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:09,208
However,

2013
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:11,208
many of my colleagues in The Association

2014
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:12,541
believe our government sponsors

2015
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,875
have a point
in the usage of The Technology.

2016
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:19,875
I consider it to be overkill.

2017
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,208
Why expend that much force

2018
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,833
if you don't have to?

2019
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:28,750
Although, it is quite effective.

2020
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,000
- [magic wand]
- [Jack] Britney run!

2021
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,958
Subjects A have fully become the monsters
Subjects B believed them to be.

2022
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,166
[body explosion, Britney scream]

2023
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,958
- [zombie noises]
- [Brandon] Come on!!

2024
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,583
[The Superintendent] We will see
which method is best to achieve our goals.

2025
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:46,458
[zombie noises, Brandon yelling]
[head explosion]

2026

- [ghostly voices] Yes! Come to me...
- [Brandon echoed] Luna!

2030
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,125

2031
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:05,625

01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:14,708
[Murderer ghost] Go....

[demon baby crying]

2035
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:19,541
[Ghost woman] Let the demon take you.

2036
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,958
Just like my baby...

2037
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:25,958
- [ghostly voices] Let the demon take you...
- [Luna] Brandon!

2038
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:33,000
[ghostly, demonic voices]Let the demon take you...

2039
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,416
- [flickering lights]
- [ghostly voices] This way Luna...

2040
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,458
[Brandon echoed] Luna,
I'm over here! Help me!

2041
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:42,875
[Brandon evil voice] Brandon,

2042
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,833
[Brandon evil voice] do it,

2043
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:47,083
[Brandon evil voice] kill them.

2044

[♪♪♪]

2045
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:55,416

[demonic voice] Very good...

2047
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:00,333
[demonic voice] It's your parents...

2048
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:01,708
[demonic ghost voice] Hey son...

2049
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:05,000
[demonic laughter]

2050
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:08,291
I can't take it anymore.

2051
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:11,083
We know, baby. It'll be over soon.

2052
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:14,000
Make it stop...

2053
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:16,333
[Demonic father] She's coming to kill you,

2054
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:18,666
your mother, me...

2055
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,666
You need to stop her.

2056
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:21,791
[Demonic mother] End her life.

2057
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,500
She doesn't love you.

2058
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:24,791
She has betrayed you.

2059
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,125
She's coming to get you.

2060
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:27,750
Kill her first.

2061
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,583
Kill her first.

2062
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,250
Kill her,

2063
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,333
kill her.

2064
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,166

01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,583
Perperiem rodaem imatti!

2273
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:38,250

2275
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:43,250
Work. You stupid, motherfucker.

2276
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:44,916
[Brandon] You can't be dead.

2277
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:48,833
[Brandon] Oh, god. Luna please...

2278
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:55,333
I love you. Please... [crying]

2279
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,541
[gasp, echoed]

2280
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:02,333
[gasping]

2281
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:08,375
[♪♪♪]

2282
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:13,125
[passionate breathing]

2283
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:17,916
[monstrous demon breathing]

2284
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,000
Come on, go.

2285
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,916
- Go, go, go.
- [monstrous growling]

2286
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,791
Oh shit.

2287
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:24,750
- Oh fuck!
- What the fuck!

2288
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,291
[Brandon] What the fuck was that?!

2289
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:29,416
[Luna] Go, go. [panting]

2290
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,833
Go. Go.

2291
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:33,000
[monstrous growl]

2292
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,958
Work, you piece of shit.

2293
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,041
[stumbling]

2294
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:44,625
I didn't get to finish...

2295
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,208
[whoosh]

2296
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:52,375
[screaming, yelling]

2297
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:55,833
Don't... Move...

2298
01:36:57,041 --> 01:36:58,166
They did this to all of us.

2299
01:36:58,208 --> 01:36:59,291
Don't speak.

2300
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:01,208
I can't think.

2301
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:02,875
[electrical malfunction]

2302
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:06,791
I can't think. [sobbing]

2303
01:37:08,416 --> 01:37:10,875
I'm sorry I killed your friends.

2304
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,458
[sobbing]

2305
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:15,208
I don't...

2306
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:17,750
I have no control,
sometimes. [electrical discharge]

2307
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:21,416
My psychiatrists
knocked a couple of screws loose.

2308
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,750
[Lily's heavy breathing]

2309
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:27,541
[indistinct whispering]

2310
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:31,000
- Cebem maha munstro!
- [electrical malfunctions]

2311
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:33,208
[Lily] Fuck. [gasp]

2312
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:34,916
You know,

2313
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,583
psychiatry began with torture.

2314
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:40,583
Not many people know that.

2315
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:42,375
The original torture was used to rid

2316
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:43,666
people of evil spirits.

2317
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:45,833
They were trying
to get the evil spirits out,

2318
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:48,875
but not in the way
they said they were.

2319
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:51,333
Copsom darei! [electrical discharge]

2320
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,208
Come on!!

2321
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:56,375
[Lily] They wanted to
use the evil spirits.

2322
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:58,625
They were trying to rile them up

2323
01:37:58,708 --> 01:37:59,750
and to make them angry

2324
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,458
to even turn someone into an evil spirit...

2325
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:05,875
A witch.

2326
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:10,041
Psychiatry was never meant for healing.

2327
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:12,125
They went from torture devices,

2328
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:14,750
to ice pick lobotomies, to electric shock

2329
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,166
to pills.

2330
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:19,416
To me... their greatest achievement.

2331
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,625
[desk hit, quivering inhale]

2332
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:24,458
I don't feel healed.

2333
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Hitler used them for Nazi work.

2334
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:30,125
Well, I will not be used!

2335
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,291
Perperiem... [incorrect language]

2336
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:33,208
[electrical discharge]

2337
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:33,958
Ahh!!

2338
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,666
God damn it! These things
never work when you need them to!

2339
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:38,500
- [explosion, falling metal]
- [screams]

2340
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,750
Wait, what?

2341
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:48,208
Where is it? [clanging knife]

2342
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:55,625
[indistinct demonic whispers]

2343
01:38:57,666 --> 01:39:02,583
[louder demonic whispers]
[intense pulsating hum]

2344
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:03,833
He says this thing

2345
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:06,791
can be the new atom bomb. [nervous gasp]

2346
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,250
- Use it. No.
- [loud demonic whispers]

2347
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:14,375
Destroy it. Destroy it.

2348
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:17,000
Ah! No, it's dangerous.

2349
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:18,708
Use it. I said, use it.

2350
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:23,000
You could use it on everyone.
You could kill everyone.

2351
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:24,833
- No, god...
- [loud demonic whispers]

2352
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:26,375

2353
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:27,375
[Lily scream]

2354
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:29,708
[electronic explosion, Lily scream]

2355
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:32,958
[electricity, heavy breathing]

2356
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:35,416
[gasping, heavy electronic pulse]

2357
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,833
[The Superintendent] Shock!
Shock her again.

2358
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,541
[electronic pulse, electricity]

2359
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:47,333
- Oh shit. Fuck!
- [Lily screaming]

2360
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:48,666
Come on, come on, Luna.

2361
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,958
- [The Superintendent] Strap her down.
- [Luna] Where do we go?

2362
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:54,500
- [The Superintendent] Drag her in.
- [Lily screaming]

2363
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:55,958
[Luna] There's no door.

2364
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,416
[The Superintendent] Sedate her!

2365
01:39:57,958 --> 01:39:59,666
[Lily] You can't do this to me,

2366
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,916
you can't do this...

2367
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
- It's okay...
- [Lily] I'm a human being.

2368
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:07,166
No, no more. [scream]

2369
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:09,958
- [The Superintendent] Shock her. Shock.
- [Luna] Where's the exit?

2370
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,250
[heavy electronic pulse]

2371

Oh shit!

- [The Superintendent] Again! Again!

Oh fuck.

2380
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:37,041
- [The Superintendent] Take the pills.
- [Lily] No. No!

2381
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:39,583

01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:48,583
Leads...

2387

[The Superintendent] You're amazing, Lily.

2388
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:54,250
You are powerful! You are amazing!

2389
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:56,250
This is necessary...
I love you, Lily...

2390
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:57,583
You're my greatest experiment.

2391
01:40:57,666 --> 01:41:00,208
You will be the strongest of them all.

2392
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,041
