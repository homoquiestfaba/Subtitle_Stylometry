2
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,040
you're not getting away with this!
Palmer! / what?

3
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,340
you're an asshole!

4
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,110
- Hey! Stop!
- Did that Just happen?

5
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,030
- You meant to do that!
- Well, you startled me.

6
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,970
I don't think I did.

7
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,010
Listen, this wasn't some
West Anglewood Drug sweep.

8
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,960
The search was good, there's
no chance Carter tosses it.

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,480
Would you Just calm down, that's why
it's called an evidential hearing.

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,190
What? So you can smear me

11
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,410
and imply that I invented
a phantom witness?

12
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,330
Did you?

13
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,320
The jaded lawyer, with no
uh, no respect for the law.

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,150
- That's original.
- That's me?

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,630
I respect the law Just fine, I'm Just not
in awe... I'm not even encumbered by it.

16
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,470
If the great state of Illinois
can't meet its burden of proof.

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,830
If I walked with a guilty
client, it's on you!

18
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,900
So I suggest you do
your job, Kattan.

19
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,700
now if you'd like to finish that cliché.
You followed me

20
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,250
to piss or unload...

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,860
Better not involve my reflection. I'm
sleeping at night? How do I do it?

22
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,050
I do it on a tempur-pedic bed,

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,980
in a highland park home,

24
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,330
with a Ferrari in the driveway.

25
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,770
Next to a loving wife, with the ass
of a high school volleyballie.

26
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,130
And, and , and how
does that feel, Hank?

27
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,650
Knowing every person you
represent is guilty?

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,440
It's fine.

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,820
Innocent people can't afford me.

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Burden of proof...Kattan.

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,400
Wait, wait, wait... you said
this won't go to trial.

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,830
- I'm sorry, did I say that?
- I hired you to make this go away.

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,030
Wrong! You hired me
because we both know you

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,350
won't last two days in a
federal penitentiary.

35
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,030
<i>don't tell me how to do my job.</i>

36
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,060
<i>Do I tell you how
to commit fraud?</i>

37
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,260
Deny coverage to terminally ill

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,380
policy holder, embezzled $140
million while you're at it?

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,710
I won't do that because
that's your gig.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,980
That's your forte.

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,170
- I'm hearing you.
- <i>I'm glad.</i>

42
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,730
<i>New voicemail</i>

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,770

<i>Be seated.</i>

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,240
<i>Before I ruled on the
pit's motion, is there</i>

47
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,160
anything either
counsels care to add?<i></i>

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,980
Yes, your honor. We'd like to
remove any doubt as to the validity

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,460
of our search.

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,190
Your...Your honor, could I...Approach?
Your honor?

51
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,270
Yeah, I need a continuance
(POSTPONEMENT).

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,600
Absolutely not.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,540
My mom passed away this morning.

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,700
My ass.

55
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,690
Let me replay it.

56
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,820
Is this the first time your mom
passed away or is this something...

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,370
You do on all your cases
you're about to lose?

58
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm sorry for your loss.

59
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,160
Thank you, first time.
What a schmuck you are.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,050
You know? He...He peed on me,

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,780
<i>Just now, in the restroom down the hall.
I don't...(INDISTINCT)</i>

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,210
<i>(JUDGE): Kattan, step away!</i>

63
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,510
<i>Daddy, are you sad
about your mom?</i>

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,990
<i>Yeah, baby, I wish
you'd met her.</i>

65
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,030
Why can't I go with you?

66
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,440
'Cause it's depressing.
You don't want to go.

67
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,300
So, grandpa Palmer's
is dead too?

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,100
No, grandpa is dead to me,
it's like a figure of speech.

69
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,770
You might have mis-heard
something that I've said.

70
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,130
Sounds complicated, I
should go with you.

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,930
Trust me, nobody wants to
go to Carlinville, Indiana.

72
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,250
Everybody wants to leave.

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
You looking for something?

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,080
You got my beetle
honey, old man?

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
Check it out.

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,750
I love you, baby. don't
eat it before breakfast!

77
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,470
- Got you.
- Um...Hmm.

78
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,540
Is there something I can do?

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,450
They are my in-laws, I
feel like we should...

80
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,300
Bob Schacner...

81
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,470
Is that your divorce attorney?

82
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,580
He's good.

83
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,250
Should be living
with me, by the way.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,570
Hank!

85
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,130
Hank!

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,620
What time the school starts in the
morning, Hank? What's her teacher's name?

87
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,930
Brownie's night is which night?
Soccer?

88
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,700
What's her favorite color?

89
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Who's her best friend?

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,180
What does she have
for breakfast?

91
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,580
Do you know her pediatrician's name?
Do you've her phone number?

92
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,290
What does she wear?

93
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,350
don't let this bother her.

94
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,550
She knows her daddy never
come home before bedtime...

95
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,310
Because he is always on
his phone on weekends.

96
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,070
She knows it's not right her
mom to be...Sad all the time.

97
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,480
- Sad? you're sad?
- Yes!

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm sorry you felt so sad. You got on
Facebook, befriended your old college buddy

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,290
George and fucked him!

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,780
He is so rugged.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,740
He is so wise.

102
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,380
I don't know why you haven't already hang
off in the mountain with that redneck.

103
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,650
You want to do something for me?

104
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,650
Water the fucking
hydrangea or something!

105
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,700
oh god...Here we go.

106
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,480
Nothing changes.

107
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,300
<i>Mary Palmer - beloved wife, mother
and grandmother. 3 - 6 pm rose room</i>

108
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,100
hey Hank...

109
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,130
Hey Derrick.

110
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,370
I missed you.

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,600
Her heart Just kind
of turned off.

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,070
I found her by the hydrangeas.

113
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,630
Good job.

114
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,790
oh, this is Saint Francis. I picked it.
It used to be her favorite.

115
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,790
Friend of the birds like mom.

116
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,330
oh, gotta remember put
food out for Them,

117
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,500
especially in the winter.

118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,220
He, he's gentle,
like mom used to be.

119
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,740
Ran all the snakes
out of Indiana

120
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
and don't ask me how.

121
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,520
Ireland...Out of Ireland?

122
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,990
Snakes here are constant but it's in St.
Patrick, not San Francisco.

123
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,610
And in Ireland, not Indiana.

124
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,150
Trust me, nobody is dispersing
reptiles in Indiana.

125
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,800
- Were you there?
- I was not there.

126
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,000
- Maybe you're right.
- Hank Palmer in carlinville.

127
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,510
- Here he is.
- That's Carlinville's state bird and...

128
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,430
- Hey Glen.
- I Just saw you a few minutes ago.

129
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,030
Where did you park?

130
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,930
- On the street.
- I parked at...

131
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,190
Tried to get a...Space
in the big lot...

132
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,540
I'd to go around...

133
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,870
But eventually I found one.

134
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,950
Here you go.

135
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,290
- Where's the family?
- Couldn't make it, school.

136
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,610
oh, I didn't know that kids in Chicago
go to school in the summer...

137
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,050
No, it isn't. They Just think that...
They...Can't come along.

138
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,090
- What's the story?
- There is no story.

139
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,740
Do you have anything else
to say for yourself?

140
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,660
Anything that would enlighten
us concerning this?

141
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,380
What do you want to hear?
Nobody's hiring.

142
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,930
You can't get spinach
out of a Petunia.

143
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,670
I can't afford to
pay child support.

144
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,770
You can't, huh? But your
new truck, out front...

145
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,400
Which one?

146
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,910
Yeah...

147
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,570
<i>'Yeah', is not an affirmation
a man uses in court.</i>

148
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,230
'Yeah', is not an affirmation
a man uses in court.

149
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:58,330
- Yes sir, judge...Sorry.
- Keys...Go on...

150
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,330
And uh...

151
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,820
- Augustus...Sir...
- Of course...Gus...

152
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,660
Would you give those to Mr.
William's ex-wife, please.

153
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,850
Then escort Mr. William
to his ex-truck.

154
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,930
you're Gonna sign that
vehicle over to her.

155
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,090
And you ma'am, are going down to
Devany Motors, ask for Mike devany

156
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,780
the father of 'not
that nitwit son'

157
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,100
and sell your new
truck back to him

158
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
for whatever that 'turnip'
there put down on it.

159
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,440
- This ain't fair, how I...
- Hey! One more word, go on!

160
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,110
Look around you, you're standing on one of
the last great cathedrals in this country,

161
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,620
built on the premise that you and
you alone are responsible for

162
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,910
the consequences
of your actions.

163
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,190
now you still want fair?
Alright, head north!

164
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,700
Stop when you get to Indianapolis,
tractor pulls, cotton candy, cattle corn

165
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,560
and the world's largest deer...

166
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,310
First week in August.

167
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,180
You'll love it. Hey wait, I
forgot, wait, wait, wait...

168
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,650
You don't have a truck!

169
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,370
Thank you very much, judge.

170
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,890
Want me to tell you what the...
causes that, ma'am?

171
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,510
Thank you fellows, I
appreciate you all being here.

172
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,340
Who is out there
guarding the donut shop?

173
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,470
- She was a good woman, Joseph.
- Grace and I are here...

174
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,690
- ...if you need anything.
- Thank you.

175
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,640
<i>Thank you. It means a lot to me.</i>

176
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,350
- <i>Sorry for your loss.
- ...Good friends always.</i>

177
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,170
<i>Good man.</i>

178
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,950
Thanks for coming.
I appreciate it.

179
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,960
<i>Whole force is out there.</i>

180
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,640
- Henry...Yeah.
- Judge...

181
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,590
- oh, Johnny boy...
- I'm so sorry.

182
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,060
- Jessica said...(INDISTINCT)
- Thank you, rose.

183
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,450
I'm going to shower
and hit the rack.

184
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,490
Glenn, make sure you hold
your boys together tomorrow.

185
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,520
We don't want a lot of...
Caterwauling.

186
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,120
- Will do, judge.
- Yeah.

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
I guess it has been
a while, Hank,

188
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,480
but backing a car into the driveway
would make getting out easier...

189
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,440
It's a concept not
dulled by time.

190
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,350
- Thank you.
- Right?

191
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,180
Got it.

192
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,300
Be my guest, please.

193
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,310
- How are you doing?
- I need to water the plants.

194
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,510
You Gonna to be okay at
the funeral tomorrow?

195
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,960
- Yeah.
- If the camera make an appearance,

196
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,720
we both know where...
It's heading, right?

197
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,140
Up my Arse.

198
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,180
<i>Good man.</i>

199
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,950
<i>Tough day.</i>

200
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,850
At the wake... he shakes my hand
while he was hugging someone else.

201
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,250
This family is a fucking
Picasso painting.

202
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,810
you're Gonna inherit all
dad's important stuff...

203
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,810
It's crazy, I mean...

204
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,220
Magic 8 ball.

205
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,940
That's certain.

206
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,020
- Hey Hank, you want some breakfast?
- You'll have to hustle if you do.

207
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,400
Hey, Hank. Going breakfast
at the diner, care to join?

208
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,520
Ok, when? Right now. Er, oh yeah,
can I throw in some pants?

209
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,520
Sure, you're family member, we're
prepared to offer you some consideration.

210
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
Any of that reason
sounds reasonable.

211
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,910
I come here every Saturday for the last 35
years... oh I forgot, today is about you.

212
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,110
Coffee?

213
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:10,130
- Let's go.
- We'll see you there, Hank.

214
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,140
I'll be right along.

215
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,690
Still letting him wind you up?

216
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,210
Sam...

217
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,930
Henry.

218
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm surprised that
you still work here.

219
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,900
In, in a good way, in a way, you
know, when people are surprised,

220
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,880
you meet somebody you know...
Discovered they've the same job...

221
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,510
- ...20 years...Stop it.
- Yeah, he keeps his hair...

222
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,950
Like sawing sawdust, all
that worry for nothing.

223
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,330
Any other fears come true?

224
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,830
Yes...Just now. Old
girlfriends, seeing Them...

225
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,380
Stop staring, I
know I look good.

226
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm sorry about your mom.

227
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,970
She and I stayed close, er,
I Just saw her Tuesday.

228
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,090
(SIGH)...Mysterious ways...

229
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,730
- I'm assuming you still
know where the cemetery

230
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,830
is. - Yeah, you're
invited, of course you're.

231
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,360
- oh, finish it, you gotta go.
- Surprise that I'm.

232
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,280
See you there.

233
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,030
You'll always be my sweetheart.

234
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,350
You always will be... I
want you to know that.

235
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,080
I'll be back tomorrow.

236
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,360
- Hank's feet is on the couch.
- Indeed.

237
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,070
Hey, Glen, my nephew
still playing ball?

238
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,550
think either of Them
can be as good as you?

239
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,430
Yes...

240
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,060
Yes, Joe...Is hitting
clean up...In varsity.

241
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,560
Eric won't know a baseball
if you threw at him,

242
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,960
even hit him in the head.

243
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,230
Anyway, for what it's
worth, none of my business.

244
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,770
Keep an eye on the judge, I
think he's...He's drinking.

245
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,610
Are you crazy? Dad has
been sober for 28 years.

246
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,990
At the courthouse,
he forgot Gus' name.

247
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,130
Gus? Gus the Bailor?

248
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,690
oh, come on!

249
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,720
Just saying.

250
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,440
That's bullshit! What time
is your flight tomorrow?

251
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,640
8:15, I can't wait,

252
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
first flight out.

253
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,400
Make yourself at
home there, Henry.

254
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,710
- I'm going for groceries.
- Should Glen drive you?

255
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,050
I don't know, Dale. Does being a widower
make me a lousy goddamn driver, huh?

256
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,100
Hank, if I don't see you
before, before you leave,

257
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,020
thanks for coming. I'm sure your
mother would have appreciated it.

258
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,450
Honey, we're going to
firefly and drink.

259
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,940
- No.
- Come on!

260
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,250
- I'm Gonna go to bed.
- No, drink, Dale, you coming?

261
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,810
Dale, you coming?

262
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,400
Hank, he threw things at
us to get our attention,

263
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,040
not to draw blood,
you know that.

264
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,790
No. His use of canine command
is to get our attention.

265
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,860
He hurls periodicals for sport.

266
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,020
Please, with all the troubles you made,
you're lucky that's all you got.

267
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,230
- <i>Hey, thanks for showing up, Carla.
- Yeah, I know I'm late, so, sue me!</i>

268
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,740
It was tough but hell,
it isn't that bad.

269
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,780
- Remember the fishing days?
- Lake house.

270
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,460
Yeah, he used to tell
us all to be quiet,

271
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,010
- 'you're scaring the fish away.'
- 'you're scaring the fish away.'

272
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,510
he still goes there every Wednesday
to play chess with Dr. Morres.

273
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,250
- He loves that place.
- <i>Hey, don't I know you?</i>

274
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,960
don't you run the tire and
rim shop over on state?

275
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,880
That's right.

276
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,760
Hey, Palmer?

277
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,280
I know you too.

278
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,250
You little dimwit shuttle bug retard,
always shooting movie camera.

279
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,680
- He's...
- Judge Palmer's your old man?

280
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,330
He thinks he runs
this town, don't he?

281
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,030
- Your dad is a piece of shit!
- Wait, wait, wait, no...

282
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,430
- I told you already!
- Who's on parole?

283
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,380
You guys have a low
opinion on judge Palmer?

284
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,500
When your field official is
filling out his incident

285
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,830
report, I'm Gonna be very
helpful, as helpful as possible.

286
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,660
So let me guess, who's going to fill in
the DWI? ( DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED )

287
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,730
Ugh, you flinched! Possession of
controlled substances, domestic violence,

288
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,460
that's you, you alright, honey?
What are the random

289
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,170
myriad of fucking misdemeanors
is Gonna come to light

290
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,810
while you're drying
up at the slammer?

291
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,220
Failure to appear bench warrants?
Come on!

292
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,160
And because I'm the only one that isn't
driving with a suspended license,

293
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll be driving your gals home
girls, so...Who lives closer?

294
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,300
Er, bad skin muffin top
or red bull semen breath?

295
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Asshole!

296
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,070
Throw that first punch!
You like county food?

297
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,670
Meet my closed fist, Counsel,

298
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,510
in my own personal space.

299
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,180
Maybe, I'm Just Gonna
ask you blow my dice.

300
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,460
That's a metaphor, I'd heard
it, it's good, you're funny.

301
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,580
Let's get the hell outta here.

302
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Get some counselling.

303
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,310
Hey shorty! Come here!

304
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,240
Uh, why don't you read my b's,
maybe I'll buy you a drink.

305
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,940
Punctuality issues,
equals confidence in

306
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,950
bullying, strong teeth,
ancestral gene pools

307
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,270
and...I'm guessing the wetter
you get, the better you look.

308
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,750
What're you having?

309
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,420
Last call, boys.

310
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're done.

311
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,780
Are you watching for me?

312
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,850
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm your eyes.

313
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,880
- Straight...
- You smell like her.

314
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,740
She smells nice, what's that?

315
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,370
It's ??? Are you
paying attention?

316
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Straighten it out, back...

317
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,920
Back, back. Easy, nice, nice,

318
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,650
shit.

319
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,950
- You did that on purpose.
- No, don't think I did.

320
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,730
No, you did it on purpose .

321
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,400
You Bang it out yourself.
Dale, let's go.

322
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,020
Let's go.

323
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,060
What the hell did he hit?

324
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,980
I was thinking...Six pack?

325
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,500
God damn it!

326
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,410
Which one of you peckerwoods
banged up my car?

327
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,850
Answer me, who did this?

328
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,770
- Who do you think?
- Who?

329
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,530
Who drove last?

330
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,610
We saw you leave for
grocery store, come on.

331
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,780
- Glenn...Where're your boys?
- oh, dad...They won't drive your car.

332
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,680
don't pretend this is complicated,
there's no reasonable doubt here.

333
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,360
He's human, his wife died,
he fell off the wagon,

334
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,240
banged up the cadi'.

335
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,630
- Deal. Shits happen.
- Like your marriage.

336
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,750
- Like your marriage.
- What do you know about my marriage?

337
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,870
- I know a lot about your marriage.
- don't fucking think about my marriage.

338
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,950
She was my wife long before
she was your mother.

339
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,590
We kept no secret.

340
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,260
You tell your brothers you're Gonna
divorce, go ahead, tell Them!

341
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,260
Lisa, played hide the
pickle with someone else.

342
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,030
- I won't be back.
- Happy trail.

343
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,090
- I'll never fucking come bake here again.
- Good!

344
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,530
Make it quick.

345
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,010
<i>Hank, don't get on the plane.
I need you to come back,</i>

346
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,120
- <i>dad...
- I don't care, Glen.</i>

347
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,680
- <i>Stop talking and listen to me.
- I gotta to turn off the phone.</i>

348
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,850
<i>Hey, Just shut up for a second!
336.1 00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:07,104</i>

349
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,600
<i>shut your mouth and listen for
once in your entire life!</i>

350
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,960
What's it, Glen?

351
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,510
<i>Sheriff, sheriff white called, called
dad down to the police station,,</i>

352
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,010
<i>asking him questions about
the damage to the car.</i>

353
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,130
<i>They think he killed...</i>

354
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,390
Glen listen...Unless he killed
somebody already, you're on your own..

355
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,390
<i>They found a body, Hank.</i>

356
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:33,390
<i>You mean judge, I can milk her, kill her,
cook her, eat her even, that's illegal?</i>

357
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,790
<i>It's a true story!</i>

358
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,930
- <i>Mr Palmer...
- Judge Palmer, deputy hanson.</i>

359
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,660
Sir, did anybody other than you
have access to your vehicle?

360
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,370
No sir, no sir.

361
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:44,380
You gotta be shitting me!
Is this an interview?
No sir, no sir.

362
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,930
You gotta be shitting me!
Is this an interview?

363
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,700
We got a witness that
put his car on route 30

364
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,080
heading toward Shelby road at the
approximate time of the accident.

365
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,560
oh boy! That's not enough for
his car to be at the scene.

366
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,440
Any schmuck lawyer is Gonna chew that
up and spit it out - stolen vehilcle.

367
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,550
You need him behind the wheel.

368
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,990
- Hank, let's go, pal.
- Go where?

369
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,030
oh! ? Bobby, graduation night, the quarry,
your grand Chevy, I remember everything!

370
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,910
You and Kevin Thompson in the back
seat naked, huffing whippets...

371
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,590
Shall I continue?

372
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,980
I can elaborate...

373
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,580
- It's Just a rumor.
- <i>Where were we?</i>

374
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,100
He has been on the other side of
the bench too long, he forgets...

375
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,420
If you don't talk, you walk.

376
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,770
We don't hide behind the law here.
The damage to the front of my car...

377
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,670
I went to the convenient
store, last night, alright?

378
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,970
Every word limits his
option, keep going.

379
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,210
Imagine a far-away-place, Hank.

380
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,120
Where people value your
opinion, now go there.

381
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,120
No bad booze? 80% of
hit-and-runs involve liquor.

382
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,480
His wife Just died, why
won't he take a sip?

383
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,520
But you need an admission from him,
better yet, a voluntary urine sample.

384
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
There you go, fill her up.

385
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,020
A bladder filled with
courtesy coffee and since

386
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,310
he's in the John anyway,
that sort of thing...

387
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,460
Just might catch him off guard.

388
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,660
We can get everything we
need from a hair sample.

389
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,540
Sure can, nice work, sheriff.

390
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,400
Yeah, you should be proud of yourself. You
should have him for manslaughter by lunch.

391
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,370
Judge Palmer...We uh, we Gonna
need to impound your vehicle.

392
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,700
- <i>Tell me what happened.
- I don't remember.</i>

393
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,570
- Because you were drunk?
- No, because I can't remember!

394
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,760
don't you think I want to remember?
I can't! For

395
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,760
all I know, I never hit
anything or anybody!

396
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,000
So, I was at the liquor cabinet.

397
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,740
What kind of recovering alcoholic
keeps his stock in the cabinet?

398
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,300
No, no, no, no...'Recovered'
it's a reminder

399
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,920
that I'm stronger. It
holds no power over me.

400
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,830
Right now, that cop Hanson is
on his way to the mini mart

401
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,940
to ask some scared,
shitless, high school

402
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,190
clerk with half a joint
at his front pocket,

403
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,430
- if you have an alcoholic
beverage in your breath,

404
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,630
- did you?
- No!

405
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,260
- Blood shot eyes?
- No!

406
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,900
- Slurred speech?
- No!

407
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,410
They shouldn't drive together.

408
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,090
I'm on your side, judge,

409
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,260
and if this goes south and
it might, you need to

410
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,400
be able to say to someone
with a straight-face.

411
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,200
You haven't had a
drink for 28 years.

412
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,240
What's done is done. If you hit somebody,
it's because he swerved in front of you.

413
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,730
I strongly suggest you dry up
and practice that narrative.

414
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,880
Narrate this!

415
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,310
We Just need to file another
continuance, what else can I do?

416
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,950
Trust me, I'm Gonna be
back as fast as I can.

417
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,060
It's a personal matter. Yea, I'd
love to walk out of it but I can't.

418
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,260
Ken, hold on.

419
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Why the hell you call me, Lisa?

420
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,150
Lauren?

421
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,810
Hi honey, what're you
doing with mommy's phone?

422
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,150
No, no, no, don't worry about it,
don't worry about it. What's up?

423
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,290
I miss you too, baby.
I'll see you soon.

424
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,620
Either I come home or maybe
you come here. Look,

425
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,080
look, we'll figure it out, don't worry.
I promise.

426
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
I'll take you shopping,
will you shop with me?

427
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,030
You want a cellphone? All you own?
I'll get you...

428
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,600
Daddy has to work.

429
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,910
Yep?

430
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,790
Hank, forensics found traces
of blood on your dad's car.

431
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,990
- So...?
- <i>Deep in the grille...</i>

432
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,350
- Great!
- It matches the victim.

433
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,090
- I'm sorry.
- It's murder two.

434
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,800
- Murder? So, are you a clairvoyant?
- That's not the whole of it.

435
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,540
He's Just a little fucking out of his mind.
That's a rookie move, hands off.

436
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,100
The victim is mark Blackwell.

437
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,960
Pretty amazing coincidence,
don't you think?

438
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Blackwell?

439
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,640
<i>Carlinville police dept.
Joseph Palmer</i>

440
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,100
you killed him!

441
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,530
- oh shit! That is Mrs. Blackwell.
- You killed my son.

442
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,970
Alright, alright, go
straight to the car!

443
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,860
- Straight in, there you go.
- When our lawyers are done with you,

444
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,290
I'll burn another
name in your house!

445
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,600
- I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- Sorry? - <i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

446
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,080
You'll be! You can shovel
that man's shit. <i>Come on!</i>

447
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
<i>Mom, let's go!</i>

448
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,080
See, I recognize you!
you're no altar boy!

449
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,320
Why are these people so mad?

450
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,890
She spit on the window.

451
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,410
Look, dad is a judge, you know. Sometimes
he has to make difficult decisions.

452
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,220
There was a girl...

453
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,420
- What was her name?
- Hope Stevens.

454
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,280
There's a guy...

455
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,800
Mark Blackwell, your
senior, like Glen.

456
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,480
Hope is his girlfriend,
Just turned 16.

457
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,430
He took a 38 to her
house, shot the place up,

458
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,790
- can we talk about something else?
- I don't get it...

459
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,130
- <i>Why...Why...
- He shot out at her bedroom windows,</i>

460
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,550
angry over whatever
kids get angry about...

461
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,660
When they have been dating for...What?
6 months?

462
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,900
now you listen to me, he stood in
court and wept like a lost child,

463
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,820
said he was drunk and
would never do it again.

464
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,620
If he meant to hurt
her, he would have.

465
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,460
I believed him! I believed him.

466
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,650
<i>I gave him the minimum, 30 days.</i>

467
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,450
<i>I remember the
morning he got out,</i>

468
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,080
Glen and I were in the backyard,
tinkling with this...

469
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,120
Breaking(?) Ball. Pitcher (?) Was Just
starting the game, Cincinnati vs St. Louis.

470
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,720
But uh...

471
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,770
- God help us, why'd he do that?
- <i>Blackwell...</i>

472
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,880
Threw her down into
the sewage pond...

473
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,210
<i>It's about 50 yards
behind her house.</i>

474
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,130
All into it was is 2
feet of water. He

475
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,220
kneeled down on her chest
until she drowned.

476
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,080
<i>Dad gave him 20 years,
he got out in April.</i>

477
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,980
- Stop the car.
- Dad, come on.

478
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,930
Shoot the Korean, am I speaking Korean?
Stop the goddamn car!

479
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,640
- I need my walk.
- Leaving the scene, blood evidence,

480
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,120
motive...Biggest mistake in your career
and you Just happened to run him over?

481
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,240
I can convict you over
coffee but no, no, no,

482
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,160
routine is important,
close the door, go.

483
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,480
If the blood matches and I've
no reason to doubt it does,

484
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,950
then I must have clipped him.
I don't remember any of that.

485
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,130
'I don't remember what happened
defense' does not fly with a corpse.

486
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,920
We need to establish
a firm defense!

487
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,390
We gotta get the charges dropped and make
it all go away in the preliminary hearing

488
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,690
and never go to trial.

489
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,940
There is no way here, Henry,
this is an accident, period.

490
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,420
Any decent lawyer can
argue this easily.

491
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,830
By decent, I mean honest.

492
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,930
Someone from here, someone with integrity
that an Indiana judge would respect.

493
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,290
I retained one of the greatest
this morning, alright?

494
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,270
I wished I'd like you more.

495
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,440
- He didn't mean it.
- He didn't mean that.

496
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,000
- I wished he'd died instead of mom.
- Cut it out!

497
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,040
- Jut cut it out!
- Eyes forward, you coward.

498
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,820
That is awful!

499
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,200
He said 'jump', you said 'how high?' .
Pull over the car.

500
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,560
Hey, you shoot your mouth
off too damn much!

501
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,470
Drive and stay with him. What
a fucking coward you are.

502
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,070
- Maybe we should follow dad.
- Should I?

503
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,070
oh god...What were you doing when
they were distributing testicles?

504
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,070
- Fuck, I'm getting out.
- Good! Good!

505
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,780
Hey, judge, where're you going?

506
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,140
- Indiana penitentiary is this way.
- Smart ass.

507
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:01,370
Where am...Where were I when they
were distributing testicles?

508
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,780

517
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,450
you're here to listen,
not to talk, okay?

518
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,010
You know the great thing about authentic
Mercury glass is the double wall,

519
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,530
you see that in here? Right on the
bottom...England glass company.

520
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,810
What a great find.

521
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,810
Guys...You want to head
upstairs to my office?

522
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,560
Judge Warren called it,
you know him, sir?

523
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,520
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

524
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,040
He's tough, he's fair,
full of himself.

525
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,390
He assigned a special
prosecutor, Dwight Dickham,

526
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,910
out of Gary... I don't
know why so far.

527
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,390
The preliminary hearing
is set for next Friday.

528
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,690
We're in a bit of a pickle.

529
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,390
It's pretty straight forward, C.P.
It was dark...

530
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,980
Hold up...

531
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,940
What would you say your stronger suit is?
Old furniture or law, quick?

532
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,580
- Er, well, er...Law, law.
- Law school? / yes.

533
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,740
Yes, you're familiar with the concept
or yes, you've attended one?

534
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,890
Yeah, right, I practice law without going
to a law school...Well, yeah, Valpo.

535
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,370
Valpo? Valparaiso?

536
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,250
It's...Up...My, I Just told her
not to...Cover Valparaiso.

537
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,320
Come on, I hate it when
she stacks books here!

538
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,170
It's...Er...Here in Indiana,
did you get out of state?

539
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,280
- Northwestern.
- Wow, that's the dandy of a school!

540
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,110
Ever defended in a jury trial?

541
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,390
- <i>Yes, I have.
- Charge?</i>

542
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,710
- Assault.
- Degree? / third.

543
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,400
- <i>Verdict?
- It was a guilty verdict.</i>

544
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,250
Coach Blakelive broke a clipboard
over his quarterback's

545
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,500
head during halftime at
the homecoming game.

546
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,620
- now...In his defense, - now, you're
guessing! - John Jr. has his helmet on!

547
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,500
- He Just keeps selling, doesn't he?
- Sit...Down!

548
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,490
Just so you know, summers I interned at
the public defense office in Evansville.

549
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,510
After graduation, I clerked 2 years for
justice Robert, Indiana supreme court.

550
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,050
It sure was, er...Pretty
cool experience.

551
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,970
The word 'wow', is not
friendly in courtroom.

552
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,280
- Thank you, duely noted.
- This is your guy?

553
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,960
If he drops the ball, you're facing
a murder trial, Just so you know.

554
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,280
I'm Gonna get a coffee.

555
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,910
Wow! This is a law suit right here. don't
get sued before you lose your next case.

556
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,830
don't mind him, you're my guy.

557
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,870
Your honor, I'm Gonna to
fight like a badger for you.

558
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,710
You can count on that.

559
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,080
Good morning.

560
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:56,030
From <i>judge Joseph Palmer
to judge Sanford Warren</i>

561
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,240
all rise.

562
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,880
The court is in session.

563
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,720
The honorable judge
Sanford Warren presiding.

564
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,640
Be seated.

565
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,430
I understand there's a motion
you'd like to be heard of.

566
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,650
Your honor, the deadline for
filing a change of venue motion

567
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,630
has already come and gone.

568
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,550
So unless there has been
a change in circumstance

569
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,580
that Warren's file of
motion is out of time,

570
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,740
say if...Er...County upped
and moved overnight,

571
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,500
barring that, this trial happens
right here in Carlinville.

572
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,230
This is a preliminary
hearing, not a trial.

573
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,050
What's the story, Mr. Dickam,
filing for a change of venue?

574
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,410
Out of curiosity, your honor, if I were to
ask for a change of venue, you'd say what?

575
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,920
You missed the deadline
but I'll consider it.

576
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,720
And then?

577
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,960
Denied it, you missed
your deadline.

578
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,200
No motion, your honor.

579
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,990
<i>(JUDGE) We're here to establish
whether there's a probable cause</i>

580
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,360
<i>to find if there's a
motion for trial.</i>

581
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,030
<i>I want to hold a
presentation of evidence</i>

582
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,780
<i>until both sides testified.</i>

583
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,580
<i>After which, I would
hear the arguments.</i>

584
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,000
<i>Without further delay, let's
get started, gentlemen.</i>

585
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,020
<i>Sheriff, after you arrived,
what, what happened?</i>

586
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,180
When I approached the victim,
he was unresponsive.

587
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,730
And at that time, did you
offer any assistance?

588
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:32,490
- He was dead, son.
- So, no? / that's a no. / great.

589
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,450
Exactly what did Mr.
Palmer tell you?

590
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,530
Mr. Palmer stated he
drove his vehicle.

591
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,160
His 1971 Cadillac he drove?

592
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,080
Correct, on the night
of the accident.

593
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,880
<i>Okay.</i>

594
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,320
Excuse me, excuse me!

595
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,350
- Yeah?
- Sir, are you co-counsel?

596
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:58,270
- He's not. / no, no.
- Sit and zip it!

597
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,620
Sir, did you form an opinion
as to the cause of death?

598
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,260
Massive internal damage.

599
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,460
Injury consistent of
being struck by a car.

600
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,560
Thank you, Dr. Putney. No
further questions, sir.

601
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,820
Cross examination, Mr. Kennedy?

602
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,890
Er, no further, er, no
questions, your honor.

603
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,250
So you were working that
night at the mini mart

604
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,490
when you saw judge Palmer and Mr.
Blackwell?

605
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,290
They were both by the cooler.

606
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,690
Did you see Them
make eye contact?

607
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,680
Yeah, I saw Mr. Blackwell and
judge Palmer make eye contact.

608
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,880
- And then what did judge Palmer do?
- Dropped his eggs...

609
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,380
- I say out! Bailor, get rid of him!
- Read that! not my

610
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,750
first time. <i>object! You can't
prove eye contact, idiot!</i>

611
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,660
So...After that did they go out together?
Did you see Palmer...

612
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,500
<i>All rise.</i>

613
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,830
<i>The court is in session, the honorable
judge Sanford Warren presiding.</i>

614
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,050
<i>Be seated.</i>

615
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:19,530
<i>Based on the testimony of the witnesses
and the evidence presented by Mr. Dickam,</i>

616
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:24,440
the court finds probable cause
to hold this over to trial.

617
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,240
<i>Jury selection will begin
in one week from today.</i>

618
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,200
<i>See you folks in court.</i>

619
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,280
<i>Judge Joseph Palmer
faces murder trial</i>

620
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,460
<i>agreement from the Gisbon's
coach. - excuse me? - Agreement</i>

621
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,890
from the Gisbon's coach, ten letters.
<i> I allude...</i>

622
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,020
He knows the answer,
yet he answers.

623
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
Come in, sit down.

624
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,390
- His home is court...
- <i>Yeah.</i>

625
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:32,910
Sit down, peacefully,
easily, easily...

626
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,300
Why do you think Dickham
missed the filing deadline

627
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,260
- for change of venue.
- oh, he didn't miss his deadline.

628
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,970
It's a small town. For every 2
people standing in front of

629
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,660
you, one wins, one loses, one
loves you, one hates you...

630
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,260
- That's...
- <i>Pretty obvious indeed. Dickam has</i>

631
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,930
no intention of filing,
he wants the trial here.<i></i>

632
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,250
C.P. Stepped down this morning.

633
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,680
Why?

634
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,670
He said his assistant is more
seasoned and couldn't live

635
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,720
with himself for his lack
of...Experience, cost the case.

636
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,680
Confidentially, what were you
doing in that Choplin road?

637
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,750
There's no route in that mini
mart's home that makes sense.

638
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,430
Wait, wait, wait...

639
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,090
Are you asking if you
could represent me?

640
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,910
Okay...

641
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,570
I remember being at the
mini mart, I needed eggs.

642
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,740
The road home was washed up, where
it dips at the state's old mill...

643
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,740
I turned around, stopped
at the light at the state,

644
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,540
then er...

645
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,870
I'm missing time, so...

646
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,800
- Can I borrow your pen?
- Yeah.

647
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,830
To answer your question
now, I'm not asking if

648
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,400
I can represent you, it
doesn't work that way.

649
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,230
You can't afford me, so...
I have to do it for free.

650
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,590
Fortunately, I'm a bit light on
the pro bono quota this year.

651
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:14,450
This's my standard service contract.
Check, sign and date...

652
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,620
<i>HP services / yes / no / missing time
offer expires in a business day.</i>

653
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,380
I'll give it a think.

654
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,760
<i>The artist is at work...</i>

655
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,920
Hey Hank, I'm splicing film.

656
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,120
- I see.
- You can help, if you want.

657
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,270
No...I'm Just watching.

658
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,910
You know what's funny,
when you said that the old

659
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,350
man was playing chess
every Wednesday with...

660
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:00,150
- Who was it? / with Dr. Morris.
- Yeah, 'Cause he doesn't play chess.

661
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,740
In fact, the only thing he detests
more than board games is doctors.

662
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,900
He does so play chess.

663
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,020
I'll show you. I have it.

664
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,820
It's not really ready yet but...

665
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,090
<i>That's a Greco. They're
a real nuisance.</i>

666
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,170
<i>There's the lake.</i>

667
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,720
<i>Here's the porch....</i>

668
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,230
<i>See? He's playing chess.</i>

669
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,110
Stop.

670
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,900
It's a nice frame.

671
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,980
Thanks...

672
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,220
- What else you got? - Well, if you wait to see what I got, a
whole family of masquerade... 630.1 00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:12,433

673
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,440
body's recovered there. Figure the impact right here. 630.2
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:14,714 the police report have him on a bike?

674
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:22,440
- Yeah. I don't see any skid marks.
- Ok, hey, here it's. Lawyer to client...

675
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,840
Did you recognize Blackwell?

676
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,770
I don't remember, er...
/ I can't have...

677
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,120
No, no, no, no. / can't have?
Stick with that.

678
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,410
Look...We both know you did not

679
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,710
intentionally hit that guy but
that's where they're Gonna spin it.

680
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,470
A few shot of Jack's, Just the
right amount of extra gripe,

681
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:41,030
that's what I thought... but you
haven't been drinking, have you?

682
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,470
- No...
- Are you sick, pops?

683
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,740
You might say that
I'm sick, yeah.

684
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:56,770
Yeah, cancer...In my
plumbing...Colon.

685
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,970
A few more chemo
sessions, it'll be in...

686
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:05,730
In uh...Remission. Nothing I
can't handle, nobody knows,

687
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,810
your mother knew, that's all.

688
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,120
They need an attempt for
murder, that is our case.

689
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,000
We build on diminished ability
for defense due to chemo.

690
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,880
If we can gain some sympathy from
the jury, they'd never convict you.

691
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,920
Wait, wait, hold on!

692
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,320
Native son, public servant,
for over 40 years?

693
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,030
No...Back up! Look what
it does to all the cases

694
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,790
I'd heard over the last year.

695
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,990
You had last year?

696
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,350
Everybody that I sentenced
will challenge the rule.

697
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,220
Strangers, who give a shit?
you're Gonna die in prison!

698
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,180
I'd rather die in prison than
be remembered like that.

699
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,700
- oh boy.
- An incompetent old man on the stand.

700
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,740
oh, I'm not letting you
anywhere near the stand.

701
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,580
now, listen, listen to me.

702
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,890
Ulysiss. Grant held
this country together,

703
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,330
now what is he remembered for?
Being a drunk!

704
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,930
Ronald Reagan never saw the fall of the
Berlin wall that ended the cold war

705
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,770
but any discussion of his legacy
ends with jellybeans, naps

706
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,240
and Alzheimer.

707
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,090
Reagan? Wow...With all
due...I'm Gonna say this as

708
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,880
professionally and as
gently as I possibly can...

709
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,360
you're a civil servant in a corn
belt, Bible-banging battle.

710
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,770
Nobody, nobody...Gives a
rat ass about your legacy!

711
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,230
But I do, son, I do.

712
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,150
I sat on the bench in
that court for 42 years.

713
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,900
People in this
community trusts me.

714
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,660
They trust the law. now this...

715
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,020
This accident is a legal
iron ball, Henry.

716
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,980
You can't screw it up.

717
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,410
So don't.

718
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,490
And only guilty people
refuse to take the stand.

719
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,620
- Got me?
- You tied my shoelace together.

720
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,770
I can't help you if you
don't let me do my job!

721
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,360
Unlock the car, come on,
let's go, I want to go home.

722
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,230
Damn it!

723
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,560
oh, this is cool!

724
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,920
Fuck me!

725
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,410
I only own the one black dress.

726
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,300
Hank, there is someone I'd like you
to meet, this is my daughter Carla.

727
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,200
Well, like I imagined, hold my hair back...
This is your Hank?

728
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,050
God, Just try not to
embarrass me, okay?

729
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,400
- You, you two met?
- Nope. / yeah, / yes.

730
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:55,660
- At the bar...Right?
- What's up with you, turn around.

731
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,340
Huh, I see that
t-shirt survived.

732
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,700
The night Hank Palmer
vanished from Carlinville.

733
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,420
- Since when you have a daughter?
- February, 1990.

734
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,410
She was home for summer break.

735
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,330
- Er...Were you married?
- Negative, no.

736
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:19,240
Um, I am the unplanned but happy
result of a wash back river boat trip,

737
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,360
Kool-Aid and ever clear.

738
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,760
- And now Carla goes to Georgetown.
- D.C., Georgetown? Wow!

739
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,760
Have you ever...Washington, Mr.
Palmer?

740
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,710
Never. What're you studying?

741
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,230
Law.

742
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,340
Always, on grass, never on pavement,
you won't splash your shoes that way.

743
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,250
I don't know what my problem is.

744
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,170
Personally invest in your client,
putting their lives in your hands.

745
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,610
It'll pass, trust me.

746
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,330
I hope not.

747
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,080
<i>So sir, you're telling me you're
not even a little bit swayed</i>

748
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,320
by the fact that you're
familiar with the defendant

749
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,040
and his stature
in the community?

750
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,760
- No...
- What exactly is our target juror?

751
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,750
Intelligent people who will
listen to instructions

752
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,710
and follow the evidence.

753
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,950
Crackpots, those that can be persuaded
to swallow their own tongues.

754
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:32,390
Anyone who has seen a sasquatch,
moon-landing deniers, those are our people.

755
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,860
Mr. Palmer.

756
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,440
Subtly, Henry...A velvet touch.

757
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:52,850
Bumper stickers? Anyone got one on
their car, truck, Harley? Show a hand.

758
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:56,250
And er...What do they read?
Exact word, please.

759
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:00,800
It Just spells out "tolerance",
with religious symbols.

760
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,560
Willie Nelson, for president?

761
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,640
Really? Does he seem
a likely candidate?

762
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,720
They never got him on a felony.

763
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,830
Certified breast
inspector, have Them out.

764
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:25,300
Gun control in using both hands.

765
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,260
Honor roll students on board?

766
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,340
Wife and dog missing?

767
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,820
Reward for dog.

768
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

769
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,190
I missed you, baby.

770
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,150
This is Gonna be
such a fun weekend.

771
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,630
Unless I drop you
on the escalator!

772
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,300
Lauren...Uh...

773
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,980
I feel like I should prep you
before you meet grandpa Palmer.

774
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,290
"Cause he's nothing
like grandpa Schneider,

775
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,310
grandpa Schneider is
kinda, you know...Nice and

776
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,050
half a bowl, maybe take
you for ice cream,

777
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,330
maybe he will read to you, grandpa
Palmer does not do any of that.

778
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,440
If you ask him to read to you,
he might throw the book at you.

779
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,560
But anyway, don't worry about it, I mean
he's not evil, he's Just a dirty old mummy

780
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,920
and he can't hurt you,
because you're special.

781
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,440
oh god, there he is, look.

782
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,470
He's usually wrapped in gauze,
and whooshing and shuffling.

783
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,170
He has come outside...To feed.

784
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,070
Who are you?

785
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,500
- Lauren...
- And who I am? / grandpa.

786
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,980
Yeah.

787
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,780
You are my granddaughter?

788
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,460
Let's go, come on with me.

789
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,890
Glad to be here?

790
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,920
It has been a long time, I've
waited a long time for this.

791
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,360
you're my sweetheart.

792
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,560
I'll show you the
house, come on.

793
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:47,510
I think grandpa is sweet.

794
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,310
Yeah, he isn't but I'm
glad you see it that way.

795
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,580
This is super comfy, there you
go, do you want a second pillow?

796
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,380
- Yes.
- Good, put your head down.

797
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,060
There you go.

798
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:05,260
And now...Oops, oh, maybe I'm
Gonna have a little fun now...

799
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,810
Feel good? Okay, this goes here.
I'm Gonna leave you alone now.

800
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,770
Whose room is this?

801
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:18,050
It was your uncle Glen's.

802
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,680
Why are there so many trophies?

803
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,800
Because he was a really
good baseball player,

804
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,200
- <i>really good.
- Did he play on TV?</i>

805
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,470
He probably would've
been on a big team

806
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,490
but when Glen and I
was in high school,

807
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:36,150
we got into a really
bad car accident,

808
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,510
then his hand got messed up.

809
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:43,350
oh, I'm sorry.

810
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,060
Why didn't he take his
trophies to his own house?

811
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,620
They were more important
to his father.

812
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:07,330
kinda touchy subject,
go to sleep.

813
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,680
- <i>Good night, baby.
- Good night, dad.</i>

814
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,320
<i>Okay, let's rehearse.</i>

815
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,720
Mr. Palmer, mark Blackwell appeared in
your court prior to killing Ms. Stevens.

816
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,670
- Correct?
- Uh huh.

817
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,870
Well, a lot of people appear
in my court, prior...

818
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:28,110
But do you agree...That there were special
circumstances surrounding this case.

819
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,590
Most people think that their
cases are pretty special.

820
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,470
Okay, by the way, there's no
snacks on the witness stand.

821
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,860
- Give me back!
- No! No distraction.

822
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,390
- I don't need preparing.
- You never sat on a

823
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,860
witness stand, you'd
never been on that seat.

824
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,210
Dickham doesn't
have intent, Henry

825
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,210
- and he never will.
- Dickham is a snake shyam

826
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:54,890
he will play his tune, gets the jury
swings into his version of that night

827
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,870
and then you can say
goodbye to your dreams of

828
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,690
flags flying at half-mast
when you're dead.

829
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,640
It's half-staffed... no one
says half-mast anymore.

830
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,880
Here, let's remain not rehearsed.
Fuck it!

831
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:16,180
Alright, don't need to be...
Summer rose, Henry.

832
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,300
Sam, can you hear me? Well,
my head is in the oven.

833
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:29,260
I was Just thinking it was either that
or maybe shower up and come meet you.

834
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:34,460
Okay...There? Alright.

835
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,730
oh my god, looks taller than it used to.
Did they raise it?

836
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,090
Come on, big city,
show me what you got.

837
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,720
Alright, I'm Just Gonna stretch up for
a second. Come on, give me a boost.

838
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,420
We are in!

839
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,990
So, it's midnight. I'm on a date
at blackchop(?) Hauling ass home.

840
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,030
76' Chevette, fake
wood paneling?

841
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,060
- Chev? No, dad's Maverick. Yeah, I know!
- What were you thinking?

842
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:40,860
From the corner of my
eye, I spot something.

843
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,660
Biggest buck you'd ever seen.
12 14 point,

844
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,220
200 pounds give or take,

845
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,580
charging the road
straight for me.

846
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,330
We skid, one hand on the
wheel, one hand on Carla.

847
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,050
This deer jumps,
flies over the hood,

848
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:01,130
its back hoof taps the glass.
One mile per hour faster,

849
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,750
he's coming thru' the
windshield, all abs and

850
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,400
hoofs, killing me for
sure, maybe both of us.

851
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,400
I made a decision
right then and there.

852
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,360
Whatever had or hadn't
happened in the past,

853
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,240
I was going to be the
hero of my own story.

854
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,550
- Sound corny?
- Sounds epic.

855
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:28,180
I've 4 grand in my name, I
borrowed another 12 from grandpa,

856
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:32,780
took about 16 grand, I made Dan an offer
for the diner he couldn't refuse.

857
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,060
- This place was on its last leg...
- This, this is your place?

858
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,760
Yeah, as a matter of
fact, this is my place.

859
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:37,980
Why you got me busted into it?

860
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,340
For my amusement...

861
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,270
Worth the broken window.

862
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,090
Bought the tavern 3 years later.

863
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:50,770
I got money, I got money. I got a lot. I
got money like colonel sander got chicken.

864
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,520
- You've a natural entrepreneurial spirit.
- Yep. / ok, I'm impressed.

865
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,850
We've known each other
since the 3rd grade, why,

866
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,160
you didn't already know
enough to be impressed?

867
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,300
- I'd always liked you.
- you're a dick.

868
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,480
- You...
- This is about accomplishment.

869
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,280
- There you are.
- Alright, baby.

870
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,170
- Except for second grade...
- What? / in second grade,

871
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,730
in Ms. Jenkins' class, on the
kid's ball field, south corner,

872
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:41,930
that's where I try to kiss you
and you...Fish-hooked me.

873
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,930
Taste like salmon.

874
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,200
???

875
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,280
You Just broke off 2 minutes...

876
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,040
- Just...Side parked.
- Okay.

877
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,480
Come on...

878
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,740
What's wrong?

879
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,750
You know I'm leaving
when the trial is over?

880
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,420
You sure, you should do this?

881
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,590
Am I sure?

882
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,020
He's sure but I'm wondering
if you are sure?

883
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,810
Why did we come here?

884
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:26,690
I love seeing you here
but I'm not naive, Hank.

885
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:31,050
- I know you.
- What do you think you know? Honestly.

886
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:36,160
That I'm a decent guy? That I'm loyal?
That I'm a... phenomenal lawyer?

887
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,440
That I got a work ethic that rivalled
the fucking Amish? What do you know?

888
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,760
Say it, I'm used to being
held under scrutiny.

889
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,630
Here's what I know. I'm
never leaving Carlinville.

890
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:52,810
I love it here and you're
Just a boy from Indiana,

891
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:57,270
who's going to do what he has to do.
That much I'm sure.

892
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,860
Lock the door behind you.

893
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:08,630
- I'm going to play with myself.
I'll be thinking

894
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,740
of you.
- And I'm Gonna to meet your daughter.

895
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:27,000
Judges see missing time,
explain that to me.

896
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,360
It's called 'chemo brain'.

897
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,400
Along with the fatigue
and the cracked skin,

898
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,670
sometimes suffered from
memory loss, confusion,

899
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,110
dementia, delusions...

900
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:41,470
It's a very, very real
possibility, probability, that

901
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,990
he's mentally impaired the
night he hit Blackwell.

902
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,320
If you can collaborate that,
I need you in my back

903
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:46,670
pocket. I'm not asking, I
may need you to testify.

904
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,660
He's getting haemotherapy
in a fishing cabin.

905
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,060
I don't think he
wants anyone knowing

906
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,900
and I'm his doctor, I'm
bound by his wishes.

907
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,020
Bound by his wishes
or his vanity?

908
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,100
When will he be done
with his treatments?

909
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,850
Like I told your father,
that's up to him.

910
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,050
In him? But...

911
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:10,770
- How would he know?
- So, what exactly did he tell you?

912
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,810
He told me it's under
control, it's in remission.

913
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,240
Quit your country
quack, I'm not his son,

914
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,870
- I'm his fucking lawyer!
- Well, this isn't that,

915
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,160
is it? You really aren't
a pleasant person.

916
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,160
Right now? I'm a summer breeze.
is it? You really aren't
a pleasant person.

917
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,280
Right now? I'm a summer breeze.

918
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,530
Once I subpoenaed you,
get you on the stand and

919
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,950
extract the truth from your
ass like tree sapping,

920
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:32,470
then you'll realize on that moment
you're correct. I'm not a nice person.

921
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,410
We caught it too
late to cut it out,

922
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,020
to slap a bag on it.

923
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,540
If he had regular screenings...

924
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,030
But the judge wasn't the
type who invites the

925
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,440
camera, even if he
agreed to the glare...

926
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,930
<i>Your mother insisted
that he try.</i>

927
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:02,960
<i>I suspect he would not
do it even for her.</i>

928
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,770
<i>I've been treating
him over a year.</i>

929
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,110
<i>His condition Just
keeps sliding...</i>

930
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,340
<i>Until it reached stage 4.</i>

931
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,380
<i>His pain will increase. We will
administer morphine to control it.</i>

932
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:23,030
( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION )

933
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:26,760
( INDISTINCT
CONVERSATION CONTINUES )

934
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:35,800
- What's a hush puppy?
- It's good for you.

935
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,480
<i>Come on...</i>

936
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,010
- Get out! Leave me!
- Dad, give me your hand.

937
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,100
Get out!

938
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,530
Did I put my shoes on?

939
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,730
- Are you okay?
- oh no, no!

940
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,590
Stay still, you will be okay.

941
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,130
Hold on to me...

942
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,150
Come on, let's get to the tub.

943
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:34,600
Okay?

944
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,140
Careful, watch your steps here.

945
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,300
Can you get your leg over?

946
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,810
There you go.

947
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,260
- Is that okay?
- Okay, ready.

948
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,210
Let's go.

949
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,060
- Is the temperature okay?
- Too hot.

950
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,720
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

951
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,380
Ooh, that's a little cold.

952
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,170
What is it?

953
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:24,290
<i>Can I come in?</i>

954
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:28,090
I'll be out in a minute, go eat!
Finish your hush puppy, baby.

955
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:31,250
- <i>I'm full.
- In a minute, Lauren!</i>

956
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,850
- Come on...
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

957
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,520
What will you say?

958
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
We're fixing the sink, it leaks.

959
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:50,250
- <i>Can I help? / she'll slip...
- No, there's water all over the floor.</i>

960
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,750
now go, go do something. Grandpa
and I will be out in a minute.

961
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:59,500
<i>Knock-knock / Lauren! I
wasn't talking to you!</i>

962
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,540
- Who's there?
- <i>Barney / Barney who?</i>

963
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,320
<i>Barney who and grandpa
still going for ice cream?</i>

964
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,610
Tell me about Lauren, likes, dislikes,
the future... may hold for you.

965
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:28,200
What do you want to be? Teacher, doctor...
Lawyer, seems popular lately.

966
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,080
Racecar driver.

967
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,600
I Just like to go really fast.

968
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,990
you're thinking, aren't you?

969
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:48,790
I, I got a bad idea
but it'll be fun.

970
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,540
- you're looking at the road?
- Yeah.

971
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:56,460
Dude, awesome,
check the mirrors.

972
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,170
you're a natural, buddy...
I feel like I can Just

973
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,730
take my hands off the
wheel and let you drive.

974
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,170
Aah...Don't you do it
when I'm doing it!

975
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,930
See?

976
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,210
And that's how you keep abreast
with what's going on the road.

977
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,810
When are you and mommy
getting a divorce?

978
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:17,000
What? Put your hand
where it's intended to.

979
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,240
- Where did you hear that?
- It is pretty obvious...

980
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,550
Well, the way these things work,
you know, it takes a long time,

981
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,110
happens in stages and...

982
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,390
- Your stuff are in
boxes, - that's a stage.

983
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:38,130
you're not wearing
your wedding rings,

984
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:41,940
and you probably going to ask
me who I want to live with.

985
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:46,380
- So which stage are we in?
- That one.

986
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:49,300
You know too much.

987
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,370
- Mommy will be lonely.
- Yeah? What about me?

988
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,810
- So would I.
- Daddies don't get lonely.

989
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,930
They only marry younger mommies.

990
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:03,490
Well, we will figure
it all out, baby.

991
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,880
It happened to Megan and
then it happened to Kaitlin.

992
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,880
I Just didn't think
it'll happen to me.

993
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,310
Me neither.

994
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:21,470
Let's turn left up here.

995
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:25,280
oh my god, the way you're driving,
you're doing great! you're

996
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:28,870
making the turns all by yourself.
Go, big girl, big girl!

997
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,740
Okay, when you see mom, what
are you supposed to say?

998
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,780
Best vacation ever!

999
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:41,770
Yeah, that's pretty good. Just don't
oversell it! You know what I mean?

1000
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:45,050
Hey, thanks.

1001
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:48,010
You'll be alright?

1002
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,010
You'll be fine,
you're so hustle.

1003
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,760
<i>Hey, daddy.</i>

1004
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,120
Best vacation ever!

1005
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:17,910
It's coincidence.
How's that possible?

1006
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,750
Here we go.

1007
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:35,040
Sir, I appreciate the primary
DNA evidence analysis

1008
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,760
but bottom-line of support... what all
those numbers and percentages mean

1009
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,250
when determining mark Blackwell's
blood on judge Palmer's car?

1010
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,120
It's the victim's blood on the car. 946.1 01:18:43,199 -->
01:18:45,898 - <i>didn't take a swing at Mr. Blackwell?  -</i>

1011
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:43,960
<i>No, sir. 946.2 01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:51,390 used profanity?
Rant, rave, mock, displayed any sign of hostility?</i>

1012
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:54,350
No...

1013
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,520
None of that.

1014
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:58,950
<i>Dr. Brannamon, you found something else in the
system at the time of his death, correct?</i>

1015
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,580
Yes, we did. Mark Blackwell had
oxycodone paracetamol in his blood,

1016
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,420
<i>Percocet. Didn't your lab in Chicago
register a blood alcohol level of .23 ?</i>

1017
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,440
Yes.

1018
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,540
In that condition, could he've
been riding in straight line?

1019
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:15,570
If he could ride a bike at all,
he would've been swerving.

1020
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:19,250
Ms. Blackwell, after all those
years and all the heartbreak,

1021
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:23,960
- how did you feel when he was released?
- I finally had my mark back.

1022
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,990
I waited so long for
him to come home.

1023
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,880
<i>No mother should have to bear
losing a child like that.</i>

1024
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,160
Thank you, ma'am.

1025
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,630
How often did you
visit mark in prison?

1026
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:40,190
Er, I...Don't remember,
too many times.

1027
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:43,670
Perhaps these visitation records
would refresh your memory.

1028
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,110
How many times?

1029
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:50,820
- Twice...
- Pardon me? / twice!

1030
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,380
oh, so, not too many times,
two times in 20 years?

1031
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,860
Twice! One for each hand!

1032
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:05,250
- It's at a 20 degrees bend at best.
- So, deputy Hanson, looking at this road,

1033
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,970
there's no indication that judge
Palmer tried to slow his vehicle?

1034
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:12,410
- No.
- As a matter of fact,

1035
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:14,280
there're no brake marks
at all up there?

1036
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,880
- No sir.
- No further questions, your honor.

1037
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,520
Palmer?

1038
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,840
Deputy Hanson, you were previously
an officer in Detroit...

1039
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,150
Objection, the deputy's
credential is not in question.

1040
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:31,710
- I WAS GONNA SAY: "Welcome
to caritonville" - uh huh.

1041
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,850
As stated by Mr.
Dickham, these pictures

1042
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,230
were taken in the morning
of the incident...

1043
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,660
Uh, what is that?
Can you help me?

1044
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:44,220
- Right there.
- <i>Not really, no.</i>

1045
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,900
Does that help?

1046
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,620
Road kill? Raccoon, maybe?

1047
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,050
- Sir, offer of proof here?
- What is your point, Mr. Palmer?

1048
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,490
That there, is a
snapping turtle.

1049
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:59,850
- <i>And? - And, Detroit can
be forgiven for not knowing</i>

1050
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,200
what running over a
snapping turtle is like.

1051
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:10,640
Nobody will hit it if they can see it and possibly avoid
it. If you hit a rabbit, possum or skunk, your car goes

1052
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:18,430
'oop-oop'. now if you hit a snapper, similar to smacking
into a cylinder block...Kluck-kluck, 'ka-bam!', 'ka-boom!'

1053
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:21,310
Mr. Palmer, where exactly
are you going with this?

1054
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:26,390
Oop...Your honor, the prosecution
maintains that the lack of brake marks

1055
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:29,700
is evidence that Mr. Blackwell
was deliberately struck.

1056
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:33,940
Is it not reasonable to assume judge Palmer
could have hit something substantial,

1057
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:37,660
in the dark, raining, not
realize that a person is hit,

1058
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:40,020
Just kept going.

1059
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,770
Thus, it has been firmly established. Are
we within a mile of a question here?

1060
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:50,370
The question is deputy, any brake
marks in front of that turtle?

1061
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,040
Yes or no?

1062
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,120
No...There're not.

1063
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,060
Thank you, that's all I have.

1064
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:14,600
<i>You re-arranged everything!</i>

1065
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:19,410
<i>Alright, Mary, wait! What?
What? What? What?</i>

1066
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,730
<i>What? God damn it!</i>

1067
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,360
<i>don't be a you know what, Mary!
don't be a...</i>

1068
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:42,270
My memory plays me. Search on!
Go on, search on!

1069
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:47,810
You left too soon, Mary.
You left too soon!

1070
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,150
Thought I heard you having a bad dream.
999.1 01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:08,146

1071
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,140
god, what happened Yo your hands?
Here, let's make the skin soft.

1072
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:27,150
Who is the best lawyer
you've ever seen? Come on.

1073
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:34,190
Mine is Robert Graham. I work for him.
He Just...Doesn't lose.

1074
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,640
now you.

1075
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,080
Mr. Shaw

1076
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,890
my first job after law school.
A drifter killed a farmer,

1077
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:50,310
violated his wife. Five points road,
with a coroner knife, vile human being,

1078
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,700
vile. 1005.1 01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:55,706
court assigned Mr Shaw the case.

1079
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:02,700
So...We took dinner to the jail
every night, Mr. Shaw sat with him.

1080
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:08,300
Prepared him, defended
him, no tricks.

1081
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,460
He won?

1082
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:14,610
Electrocuted.

1083
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:20,450
He was dead. Mr. Shaw
had to live with it.

1084
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:24,320
He was threatened, spit on,

1085
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,720
people won't sit
near him in church.

1086
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,240
He could've refused the case
easily but he believed in the law.

1087
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:38,630
now, I can't say, er...Best
but Henry Shaw...

1088
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:43,130
Most decent man I've ever met.
1015.1 01:24:47,856

1089
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,550
--> 01:24:51,053 - Henry?
- Decent man.

1090
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,610
- <i>Hi, Palmer.
- Hank? Sheriff white.</i>

1091
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:08,310
<i>Wonder you can come by the station,
there's something you should see.</i>

1092
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,200
<i>We already seen the security footage
on the night of the accident.</i>

1093
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,000
Here is what happened. The judge leaves
the store, his car goes one way,

1094
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,520
- Blackwell, the other.
- Patience...

1095
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:40,660
- What time?
- 4 minutes 45.

1096
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,700
- He didn't get to the mill.
- And?

1097
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,670
The point being?

1098
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,650
In his statement, judge Palmer says
he reached the road near the mill,

1099
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:56,770
it was washed out and he
turned around, he's lying.

1100
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:00,050
<i>It takes 9 minutes to get
to the mill and back.</i>

1101
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:04,960
<i>Your dad did it in 5. He didn't turn
around because it was washed out.</i>

1102
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,720
He turned around to
follow Blackwell.

1103
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,720
He lived here his whole life.
don't you think he

1104
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:11,280
can Gauge whether the
road is going to flood?

1105
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,200
- <i>That's not the point.
- Sherriff, may we use your office, please?</i>

1106
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,390
- Thanks.
- What's the honor of a spare room?

1107
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:22,990
- 10 years, he will do 7.
- Insufficient evidence.

1108
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,910
Offer expires when
you walk out..

1109
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:27,760
- Do you want me to fry you?
- I'm glad to see you're on your game.

1110
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:29,780
I like you too but I'm so bored.

1111
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:32,180
I've intent now!

1112
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,340
Premeditation, I'll
paint your father

1113
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,500
as a 'holier than thou' prick determined
to see what he considers justice served.

1114
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,210
My father is a 'holier
than thou' prick

1115
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:45,490
determined to see what he considers justice
served. So, it's going to be a light day.

1116
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,530
That's funny, I guess I can't
fault you for not remembering me.

1117
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,730
I was the second chair
for the prosecution.

1118
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:58,720
You defended that Milwaukee beer baron's
kid, the one that went slimy and dreary.

1119
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,720
40 million in the bank,
one dead prostitute.

1120
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,160
My god, you're good, best
verdict money can buy.

1121
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,830
Everybody went at him because he flinched,
until there's a dead hooker in a hot tub.

1122
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:11,390
There is your bumper sticker.

1123
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:15,150
So, now I'm not sure, you followed
me down here to settle a score?

1124
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:17,230
oh, good lord, no.

1125
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,940
I followed you down here because
I knew that if I didn't,

1126
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:23,260
it was likely somebody was
getting away with murder.

1127
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,980
My father is a lot of many unpleasant
things but murder is not one of Them.

1128
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,660
But he is a liar. We
established that.

1129
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:34,810
A liar who thinks he can operate under
the color of the law Just like his son.

1130
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,050
<i>Your shine isn't worth
a nickel, Mr Palmer.</i>

1131
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,930
<i>A bully with a big bag of tricks</i>

1132
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:44,440
<i>but unlike you, I have
one simple belief,</i>

1133
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:49,200
that the law is the only thing
capable of making people equal.

1134
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,880
You may think mark Blackwell was white
trash and he may very well had been

1135
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,510
but in the eyes of the
state, his life matters.

1136
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,790
I'm going to impale your client
on a first degree murder charge

1137
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,590
and you get front row seat.

1138
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,360
Why are we even down here? Like there's
never a tornado, this is stupid.

1139
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,280
Be happy that your
grandpa has a basement.

1140
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:50,790
don't worry everyone, I got it.

1141
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:57,830
Hey, turn that on, uncle Dale.

1142
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,780
<i>Yeah, why don't you show us
what you are working on.</i>

1143
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:01,230
<i>You said you're going
to show me, man.</i>

1144
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,670
Come on.

1145
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,820
Let's go.

1146
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,820
Okay.

1147
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,500
Charles Francis Jenkins first
invented the projector

1148
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,270
on June 6, 1894

1149
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,770
in Wayne county, Indiana.

1150
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,170
Dale...Can you show the
movie that you made?

1151
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,880
- Thank you.
- Here we go!

1152
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,880
oh, nice.

1153
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,760
oh family Christmas, look
at you guys in your PJ's.

1154
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,480
That's us.

1155
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,550
- That is our family.
- <i>Yes, it's...</i>

1156
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,470
- <i>There is me.
- Sweet.</i>

1157
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,760
<i>Dad, you were cute once.</i>

1158
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:57,420
<i>That's Hank and dad.</i>

1159
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,940
- <i>Judge, you had hair?
- How are you...</i>

1160
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,360
- <i>There you are!.
- Watch and learn,</i>

1161
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,660
<i>boys.</i>

1162
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,200
<i>Watch and learn!</i>

1163
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:32,030
- <i>That was the best day!
- That's it.</i>

1164
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:38,590
- <i>Proud mama.
- And dad.</i>

1165
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:47,060
- <i>oh, shit...
- Shut it, George...</i>

1166
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:54,850
Turn it off!

1167
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:58,490
- <i>Alright, speed it up, man.
- I can't...</i>

1168
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:02,010
- <i>It's film-making, I can't...
- Next! Next!</i>

1169
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:03,870
- <i>Break the fucking thing
with your hand if you</i>

1170
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:05,840
have to, let's go, let's go!<i>
-  Give him a chance.</i>

1171
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,040
Turn it off!

1172
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,840
- Okay, alright!
- Enough! / what?

1173
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,080
- We're Gonna fix it. It's okay.
- Not in this house!<i></i>

1174
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,110
oh dad, shit!

1175
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:24,210
- <i>oh...
- I'm so sick...Of you. I'm tired of the</i>

1176
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:28,450
way you decide...How the
world is Gonna run!<i></i>

1177
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,940
What? you're Gonna parcel out who gets
to say and do what, when you say it?

1178
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:33,580
I decide in this house. You
can go decide in your house!

1179
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:37,140
No, I can't! / why? Because I'm
still in purgatory with a client

1180
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,300
who's doing everything in his
power to be found guilty!

1181
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,750
You didn't make it anywhere
near the mill, did you?

1182
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:42,570
<i>Ok, ok, ok...</i>

1183
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:46,250
Did you? You hung me out fucking dry with
Dwight Dickam 'Cause you rat out on me!

1184
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:50,170
I told you everything I knew!
You told me everything is...

1185
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:54,090
- Guys, come on! Easy! Easy!
- Get outta my way! Get outta my way!

1186
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,440
Get your hands off me!

1187
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,710
God damn it, Hank!
Where's he going?

1188
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,610
Why did you pull me
out of boy scouts?

1189
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:39,130
As punishment for blowing up the
Mccross' mail box with m-80s!

1190
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:42,610
- I was 13, that, you remember.
- Old...Old enough to know better!

1191
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,760
You didn't come to my high
school graduation or college.

1192
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,720
- oh, boo, fucking who!
- Why?

1193
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:50,200
Why? Jail time, truancy, I
was never rewarded anything,

1194
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,520
- none of your shit! - I graduated
from law school, for Christ sake!

1195
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,120
As oppose to what, dropping out?

1196
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:58,250
- Fuck you!
- Let me tell you something, okay?

1197
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,070
Here...

1198
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,350
I put a roof over your head,

1199
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:02,580
money in your pocket,

1200
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,620
clothes on your back,

1201
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,090
food in your mouth!

1202
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,860
Who paid for that
college education?

1203
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:10,810
I never showed up to kiss your asshole!
Your mother?

1204
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:12,980
She's a housewife.

1205
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,390
Why don't you swallow your goddamn
pride and Just come home to her?

1206
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,320
You tell me why!

1207
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:20,400
'Cause you didn't invite kid
parolees back to court.

1208
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,920
You recognized those
who did their time,

1209
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,300
turned their lives around,
made something of themselves.

1210
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,180
Everybody in the court applaud,
you made sure that they did.

1211
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,850
You told Them how
proud you were...

1212
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:33,030
Proud of fucking strangers.

1213
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:37,100
Is that all you wanted, Henry, is
some kind words and 'thattaboy'?

1214
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:42,030
Then the usual way is to
come...The fuck home!

1215
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:44,400
We all waited,

1216
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,660
quietly

1217
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,210
but you never came.

1218
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:50,520
Ok? And I was the one you blame
because you won't come home.

1219
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,860
Me, now was I tough on you? Yes.

1220
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:57,500
How you turned out, Henry?
Waiting tables, a bum?

1221
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,300
You put me into a
juvenile detention.

1222
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,710
You sent me to the fucking
Vanderburgh ( COUNTY JAIL )!

1223
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,390
- No, no, no. You put yourself there!
- <i>Did I?</i>

1224
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,180
Yes.

1225
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:08,000
The prosecution recommended community
service, that was your call.

1226
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,260
No, it won't have helped you.

1227
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,790
I didn't need help,
I needed you!

1228
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,210
You were high, you rolled the
car with your brother in it!

1229
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:16,150
He had a major league
career ahead of him,

1230
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,440
a 90 mile an hour fast ball and
now he work at a tire shop!

1231
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,060
You crippled him, you stole his
future, you call me an asshole?

1232
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,660
I was 17, that's what happened.
I was 17.

1233
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,830
oh! I was 13, I was 17...

1234
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:32,830
You were heading down the wrong path,
I did what I thought was right.

1235
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,670
You know I didn't Just graduate from law
school, I graduated first in my class.

1236
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,840
- <i>Good...
- I was first in my class.</i>

1237
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,360
<i>Yeah...</i>

1238
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:45,970
- I did really well, dad.
- you're wellcome. / fuck it!

1239
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:51,810
I'm tearing this house down.

1240
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:55,320
Burn this fucking house.

1241
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:31,860
<i>Mary Palmer 1940 - 2014</i>

1242
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,870
- about that storm, huh?
- Hmm...

1243
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,490
I am glad you and mommy
became friends and I...Why?

1244
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,430
- Why Sam?
- <i>Why?</i>

1245
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,840
Who the fuck is Carla's dad?

1246
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,170
Go, go to courthouse,
pull the certificate.

1247
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,340
I did...No father is listed.

1248
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,600
No, there's not

1249
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,840
because Carla's father was
never going to be her father.

1250
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,350
Him knowing, would Just
complicate things.

1251
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,460
There was no wildlife river boat trip,
there's no ever clear and kool-aid,

1252
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,070
it's Just one of those
lies we tell ourselves...

1253
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:46,950
In order to move on and we did.

1254
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:49,130
Great, I get to move on too.

1255
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,110
What lies are you
going to tell me?

1256
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:02,620
That it was fine with me when you
left and go to that goddamn concert,

1257
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:05,380
you never called again.

1258
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:09,400
That...Umm...

1259
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:14,100
I'm entirely comfortable with Carla
never knowing who his father is.

1260
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,010
That you're the only one
who is Gonna get hurt...

1261
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:22,670
When you run away, again,
like you always do.

1262
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:26,730
oh, I know that look.

1263
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:28,160
you're a bullshitter.

1264
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:33,040
Well, yeah, it's my bullshit,
kinda removed your shoes from it.

1265
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,550
See you in 20 years...

1266
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,270
Looking forward...

1267
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,300
Finally opened her up, huh?

1268
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,660
Yeah.

1269
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:27,590
Eva Williams, she was 23 years old when
I drove down to Bart stone, Kentucky,

1270
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,850
1979, to buy her.

1271
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:34,800
I almost cracked this baby
open a thousand times...

1272
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,310
And I'm glad you didn't.

1273
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,510
Yep.

1274
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,460
you're not going to tell
me I shouldn't drink?

1275
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,960
you're big boy

1276
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:48,350
as long as you're
ready for tomorrow.

1277
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,340
Dickam is Gonna
turn up the heat.

1278
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,420
I'm.

1279
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:57,070
I went saw mom today.

1280
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:58,330
Yeah?

1281
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,630
Nice...

1282
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,220
Where is she now?

1283
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:02,930
<i>Where's who?</i>

1284
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:07,380
Where is Mary? you're
thinking something else...

1285
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,410
After we died?

1286
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:09,930
you're asking me if
I believe in god?

1287
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,430
<i>Do you?</i>

1288
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:17,240
I'm 72, stage 4 cancer.
What choice do I have?

1289
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,390
You know...

1290
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:28,990
I was going to say that, uh... I was going
to apologize for belittling your marriage.

1291
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,050
It's not easy to have
a good marriage.

1292
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,940
I don't know what to do,
what would you do...?

1293
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,520
With Lisa and all?

1294
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:45,100
I, I don't know.
Henry, I truly don't.

1295
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:48,080
You think you can make
each other happy again?

1296
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:02,160
Go on...

1297
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:05,690
Have a little toast here,

1298
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:09,830
to what, I don't know
but let's have a toast.

1299
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:12,430
- To good luck in court.
- Good luck.

1300
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:30,160
The judge's Cadillac reappears in
the frame approximately 5 minutes

1301
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,930
after it left the lot.

1302
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,740
Exact time, sheriff?

1303
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:36,580
4 minutes, 45 seconds.

1304
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,830
Ok, again. When he leaves,

1305
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,020
oops, sorry, too far...

1306
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,580
There we go.

1307
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,890
Judge Palmer?

1308
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:19,790
Dad!

1309
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:20,740
Bailor...

1310
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:23,910
You mind calling an ambulance?

1311
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,060
Dad, talk to us.

1312
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:29,900
Dad?

1313
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,610
<i>St. Thomas more,</i>

1314
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:33,210
I don't know which paragraph
the judge would like to...

1315
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,570
Maybe St. Joseph because
he's the patient's...

1316
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:37,760
Okay, okay, Dale...

1317
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,690
- <i>And St. Joseph... - Dial down the
crazy now, dial it down! / and...</i>

1318
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:43,900
Hey, you want to go to
the vending machine?

1319
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,690
Ok. / here...

1320
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,650
Whoa / get whatever you want.

1321
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,940
- You've a naked lady in here.
- Yeah,

1322
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,240
- it's a fun wallet.
- Film the vending machines, Dale.

1323
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:04,870
- Look, don't look at me like that.
- <i>don't get off on him.</i>

1324
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:08,310
Not now, don't look at
me like that, not now.

1325
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:10,350
You don't know what
my life is like, ok?

1326
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:13,340
Mom is gone, alright?

1327
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:17,460
And dad is...

1328
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:19,950
And then what are we
going to do about Dale,

1329
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,180
huh? What, you Gonna help?
You? Really?

1330
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,860
I'm not like you, I've been
stuck here all the time...

1331
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:25,700
I understand why
you're going mental...

1332
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:27,890
Hank, I've never asked for a
goddamn thing in your life!

1333
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,210
- I'd never asked you for anything!
- Hey, I'm fucking here...

1334
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,290
- Yeah, but he is your father, you
should be here! - oh my god...

1335
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:38,040
- I'm going crazy...
- I'd never asked for a goddamn thing, ok?

1336
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:44,220
I'm asking you now! You
cannot lose this case!

1337
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,080
Dad cannot go to prison.

1338
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:57,110
don't pat me, don't pat me, I'm the
big brother here, you don't pat me.

1339
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:03,630
Dad wants to see you,
Hank, not you, Glen.

1340
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:25,020
- I killed the bastard.
- you're funny.

1341
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:26,930
Please, don't ever say that again.
don't say that...

1342
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:33,480
- <i>I know me, I ran that man down.
- you're speculating, I know you too.</i>

1343
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:38,320
you're not capable of overriding a
life time of ethical superiority.

1344
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:44,270
- I don't have the energy to fight
with you, Henry. - Then muster some.

1345
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:48,590
- Do you remember hitting him?
- It's Just a matter of time.

1346
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:52,030
Clocks run out! I don't
have fucking time!

1347
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:53,540
you're not taking the stand!

1348
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:58,980
- Then, uh...I'll fire you and C.P.
Will do it. - you're the most...

1349
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:02,140
Brutally, bullheaded
client I've ever had.

1350
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,360
This is easy, there is no witness.
The prosecution

1351
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,970
can't prove you hit him
any more than you can.

1352
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:10,910
I'd spread reasonable
doubt all over this case.

1353
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:14,010
Please, please will you Just...
let me do my job,

1354
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:17,250
let me do the talking, keep
your mouth shut and win.

1355
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,610
Yes...

1356
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:21,280
But I'd to live here.

1357
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,480
you're impossible to defend!

1358
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,080
What happened to Reagan?

1359
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:34,010
You know, the jellybeans,
and your horseshit legacy?

1360
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:42,750
Ok, so, you're Gonna swear in hand
to god and lie under oath that

1361
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,860
you remember hitting him?

1362
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,660
I won't confess to something I
don't remember doing, okay?

1363
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:53,060
- You promise?
- Yes. / thank you. / yes.

1364
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:55,370
- I'll see you in court, Henry.
- I'm sorry, I Just

1365
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:58,010
I'll see you in court.

1366
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,730
I do...

1367
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,830
Judge Palmer, you have been
on the bench how long?

1368
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:17,990
- 42 years. - So how many violent
crimes have you ruled on in that time?

1369
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:22,070
Objection, the defendant's history
as a judge is not relevant.

1370
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:24,660
Your honor, the state has
introduced evidence, suggested

1371
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,420
motive for the alleged crime
related to the judge's duties.

1372
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:33,580
- I'm entitled to rebut that
laughable presumption. - Overruled.

1373
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:37,310
It's, uh, not something
I keep track of.

1374
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:42,050
But would it surprise you to learn that
you've presided over 17 murder trials,

1375
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:50,280
- 434 assaults, 12,942 civil cases.
- <i>It would not.</i>

1376
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,800
Did you run over any
of those folks?

1377
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,340
- Objection!
- Rein it in, Mr. Palmer.

1378
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,790
- Just lost your wife?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1379
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:06,230
- How long were you married?
- 50 years.

1380
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:08,710
How did she pass?

1381
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:16,180
She spent the morning kneading,
she fussed over hydrangeas,

1382
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,220
a blood clog formed at
her left leg and...

1383
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:21,420
Went to her heart.

1384
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:24,220
The day of the accident, what
did you do that morning?

1385
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:29,330
- I buried your mother, oh, my wife.
- <i>Tough day, how did you feel?</i>

1386
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:36,090
- Tired.
- Tired, dark, raining,

1387
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:40,600
- do you remember hitting the victim?
- I do not.

1388
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,040
Thank you.

1389
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,880
Nothing further.

1390
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:52,630
Would it be fair to say that
you dislike mark Blackwell?

1391
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:54,310
Yes.

1392
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,280
Wished him ill?

1393
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:58,400
I did.

1394
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:02,110
Dead?

1395
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:04,380
Yes.

1396
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:15,850
Deputy Hanson testified
that you told him

1397
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,850
that only you were allowed
to drive that car,

1398
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:21,290
- not even you late wife.
- It's my car.

1399
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:25,020
But now a man's blood,
a man that you hate

1400
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:29,280
was found on a car
that only you drive

1401
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,680
- but you don't know how it got there?
- I do not, no.

1402
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,360
A six foot one, 220 pounds man,

1403
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:41,000
that's a pretty big old
boy, on a steel bicycle

1404
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:44,030
but you're in the
dark about it all?

1405
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:47,430
- Objection, asked and answered.
- Overruled.

1406
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:49,790
Correct.

1407
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:51,590
So, on one of the worst
days of your life,

1408
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:54,700
you entered the mini mart,

1409
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:58,540
- you see a man you hate...
- Objection! Argumentative!

1410
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:01,100
Let him finish.

1411
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:06,610
You see a man you hate and minutes
later, you altered your route,

1412
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:09,130
and both of you and the
man are on the same road,

1413
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:14,290
at the same time, only you and
your car, with his blood on it,

1414
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:19,520
and he is in a ravine, with his
kidneys ruptured and his back broken

1415
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:23,680
and you don't
remember hitting him?

1416
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,880
I do not.

1417
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,870
So...you're telling
this court, under oath,

1418
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:34,590
which I know you understand
better than most,

1419
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:39,390
that a man who killed
somebody on your watch,

1420
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:45,460
a man you released, who
drowned a 16 years old girl,

1421
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:49,900
a man that you absolutely hate,

1422
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:53,010
on the worst day of your
life and you have the

1423
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,140
perfect opportunity to
balance the scale of justice

1424
01:49:56,930 --> 01:50:01,570
and your testimony is that you didn't
seize that chance and kill him?

1425
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:03,770
No.

1426
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,800
No further questions.

1427
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:16,840
That is not my testimony.

1428
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:35,100
Sir, how have I mischaracterized
your testimony?

1429
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:37,860
Objection, he said
no more questions.

1430
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:43,420
- Your honor?
- My testimony is...

1431
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:46,100
That I don't remember
hitting him.

1432
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,520
Your honor, may I
request a brief recess?

1433
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:49,330
Denied.

1434
01:50:57,980 --> 01:51:00,060
Mr. Palmer,

1435
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,240
judge Palmer.

1436
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,280
Do you think you killed
him intentionally?

1437
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,310
Objection, call for
speculation, move to strike.

1438
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:16,110
Yes.

1439
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:20,990
Order!

1440
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:23,480
Order!

1441
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:25,000
Settle down.

1442
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:34,070
Thank you, your honor,
no further questions.

1443
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:45,370
Redirect, judge?

1444
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,530
Ok.

1445
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,800
- So...You think you did it?
- Correct.

1446
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,720
Ok, you think

1447
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,620
but not because you
remembered hitting him?

1448
01:51:56,630 --> 01:51:57,280
<i>That's right.</i>

1449
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:02,150
oh, your opinion is that you
hit him on purpose, correct?

1450
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:04,150
I, I, I, uh, I Just said yes.

1451
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:07,390
Why do you think you can't
remember the accident?

1452
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:11,470
- My wife Just died.
- Undergoing any medical treatment?

1453
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:12,750
Objection! Relevance?

1454
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,660
- Goes to state of mind, your honor.
- Overruled.

1455
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:20,260
- You and I are finally done.
- oh, we're not done.

1456
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:24,340
- Yes, we're done.
- C.P., you're up. / sit down, Mr. Kennedy.

1457
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:26,410
- you're done when you answer my question!
- No, no, no, no! / answer it!

1458
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:28,370
No, you're not my lawyer!
you're not my lawyer!

1459
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:30,590
you're on the stand as a
witness, answer my question!

1460
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:33,900
I'm sound mind and body, it's
none of your goddamn business!

1461
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:35,010
Sit down!

1462
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:37,840
- <i>Keep quiet!
- No, no, no! / I'm not done! Sit down!</i>

1463
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,880
Judge Palmer,

1464
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,640
it's your right to seek other
counsel if you so choose

1465
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:49,760
but you'll have to do so after
you completed your testimony.

1466
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,070
Yes, sir.

1467
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:57,230
I'll ask you again, undergoing
any medical treatment?

1468
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:01,910
- <i>Yes or no?
- Chemotherapy.</i>

1469
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:05,900
- <i>For how long?
- 6 months.</i>

1470
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,620
Chemo? That's cancer?

1471
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,500
- Yes...
- Prognosis?

1472
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,860
It is advance.

1473
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:19,180
- Did your doctor caution
you against the potential

1474
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,530
side effects of chemotherapy?
- Yes. He did.

1475
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:23,970
What are they?

1476
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:26,810
- Nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite,
- delusions, fits of anger/ yes,

1477
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:29,840
- depression...Memory loss?
- No,

1478
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,260
- none of that applies to me.
- <i>Really?</i>

1479
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:35,390
What happen to all the cases
you presided over the last 6

1480
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:38,440
months if it would determine
that your mental actuality

1481
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,000
- was diminished.
- <i>Objection!</i>

1482
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,750
- Counselor is trying to
prejudice the jury. - Overruled.

1483
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:48,430
All those trials, they will be
declared mis-trials, would they not?

1484
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:52,710
- Potentially, yes, - a
stain on your reputation...

1485
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:54,980
<i>You'd do everything to
avoid that, would you not?</i>

1486
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:55,740
No, no, no!

1487
01:53:55,740 --> 01:54:02,140
Then, why don't you remember...
Seeing Blackwell that night?

1488
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:08,090
I remember him, I Just
don't recall, uh...

1489
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:10,050
Hitting that son of a bitch.

1490
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:13,130
What do you remember?

1491
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:20,200
I remember he, er... opened
his disgusting mouth.

1492
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,000
What could he had possibly said?

1493
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:39,310
Hey, judge,

1494
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:43,470
sorry to hear about your wife.

1495
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:46,620
You know,

1496
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:50,890
seeing her buried no more
than 15 feet from hope,

1497
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:55,660
I'm not Gonna have to walk too
far to piss on both graves.

1498
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,200
He got him.

1499
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,360
No,

1500
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:25,710
doesn't add up.

1501
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:31,000
I don't buy it. Can't be the first
time someone has insulted you.

1502
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:32,720
It's your job.

1503
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:35,820
Why did you go easy on
him the first time?

1504
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:39,860
Of all the judges in Indiana,
you're one of the tightest.

1505
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:45,570
You gave him 30 days. He threatened her,
discharged a firearm at her residence,

1506
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:51,050
that's 6 months, a year, easy.
What was your reasoning?

1507
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:55,850
180 days, that's solid,
maybe to cool off.

1508
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:59,360
Maybe he doesn't kill hope
and maybe we'd not be here.

1509
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,380
All the years you sat on that
bench, all the people that stood

1510
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,940
before you, the leniency...

1511
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:08,960
The understanding, the free
ride, goes to mark Blackwell?

1512
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,110
How do you explain that
lapse in judgement?

1513
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:22,870
I looked at him...And saw you.

1514
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:27,700
The same...Wilful disobedience,

1515
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,740
the same recklessness,

1516
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:35,540
I looked at him and
saw my middle son,

1517
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:39,050
my little boy.

1518
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,110
<i>My good boy.</i>

1519
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:50,920
I watched him cried right there, I wanted
to put my arms around him and tell him that

1520
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:53,920
it didn't have to be like this.

1521
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,480
I wanted someone to help him,

1522
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,560
like I want someone
to help my boy.

1523
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:08,590
If he lost his way,

1524
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:15,900
it was my chance to be...

1525
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:20,760
That someone, is
that so much to ask?

1526
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:22,390
don't think so...

1527
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:23,540
I have memories...

1528
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:27,700
Of us.

1529
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:30,050
You and me,

1530
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,110
and then nothing.

1531
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:37,410
How come?

1532
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,600
- Why?
- Why?

1533
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,840
Why?

1534
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,990
I looked at you and saw him.

1535
01:57:57,590 --> 01:58:01,030
Your honor, may the
deputy please approach.

1536
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:13,420
Last question. This man has been your
Bailor for 22 years. What is his name?

1537
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:27,810
You don't know?

1538
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:35,800
I'd like to go home now.

1539
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,630
Nothing further, your honor.

1540
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:02,260
Hey.

1541
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:07,930
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1542
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:10,610
Depends on the verdict.

1543
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:16,470
I'm Carla's dad, right?

1544
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:20,720
This again? Why, why can't
you Just let it go?

1545
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,360
- She's fine.
- Of course she is,

1546
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,160
it means it's obvious, she's
born 9 months after I split.

1547
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,410
Either that or you
cheated on me.

1548
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:32,310
Either way, it's not fine, just one version
slightly less not fine than the other.

1549
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:34,870
And the thing is...Listen...

1550
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:42,670
I gotta say something. Here it's. I
met Carla at the tavern, blind, ok?

1551
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,020
- I went with Dale and Glen and...
- He is her father.

1552
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,100
- He who is her father?
- Yea, Glen doesn't know.

1553
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,260
- What my...My brother?
- It Just was one time.../ Glen?

1554
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,660
Glenn? That fucker, what?

1555
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:57,210
What do you mean what? /
what do you mean Glen

1556
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,080
you left!

1557
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:00,610
Fuck up! I went to a Metallica concert!
/ and you never came back!

1558
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:06,690
He was broken, he was sweet, he was almost
normal and I needed a little normal!

1559
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:07,850
You know what? That
makes me, what?

1560
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:11,320
A. A...More superior prick
never slipped into his shoes.

1561
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:15,880
Damn it, Hank, I loved you
then and I love you now.

1562
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:20,560
I do. I love how...
you're simultaneously,

1563
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:24,190
the most selfish and the
most generous person I know.

1564
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:28,670
I love how...You hate a bully
while you're being one,

1565
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:32,030
that your constant second-guessing
of others that...

1566
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:34,420
That...Crystal ball bullshit?

1567
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,500
That, that, that...That hyper-verbal
vocabulary vomiting that you do...

1568
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:44,420
And Just disappeared
right beside me, Hank.

1569
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:53,450
Say it again.

1570
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:57,010
All of it?

1571
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:33,420
- Yep...?
-<i>Jury entering, all rise.</i>

1572
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:44,370
Be seated.

1573
02:01:47,610 --> 02:01:50,160
Mr. foreman, have you
reached a verdict?

1574
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,080
We have, your honor.

1575
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:00,120
What say you in the matter of the state
of Indiana versus Mr. Joseph Palmer

1576
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,230
on the charge of
first degree murder?

1577
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:07,630
We find the defendant
not guilty.

1578
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:16,660
And on lesser included charge
of voluntary manslaughter?

1579
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:23,740
We find the defendant...Guilty.

1580
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:36,060
Order.

1581
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:38,370
Move for sentencing, your honor?

1582
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:44,160
This case has been the
most tragic occurrence

1583
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,440
as I'm required to impose
an appropriate sentence

1584
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:53,430
but as you know, all too
well, sir, that's the job.

1585
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:59,070
I therefore sentencing you to
serve four years in state prison.

1586
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:01,550
Sentencing to be
begin forthwith.

1587
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,940
Deputy, please take judge
Palmer into custody.

1588
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:09,100
Order!

1589
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,250
Dad, dad.

1590
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,250
- Dad.
- Yeah.

1591
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:28,770
I've always been proud
of you, always.

1592
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:41,440
Listen to me, you're a
strong man, not a boy, okay?

1593
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,440
I need you to look after
your brother for me,

1594
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:44,030
can you do that?

1595
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:45,590
Ok, dad.

1596
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:48,510
This camera, it was
a buffer for you.

1597
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,510
Use it

1598
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:52,830
- but you don't need it.
- Ok, dad.

1599
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:54,620
Okay...

1600
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:18,690
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1601
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:23,280
I thank you for your service, you're
excused, this court is adjourned.

1602
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:28,030
- Do you expect an appeal?
- <i>Nah!</i>

1603
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:31,070
You know, 90% of the
country believe in ghosts?

1604
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:33,630
Less than a third
believes in evolution?

1605
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:40,520
35% can correctly identify homer Simpson
and the fictional town he resides.

1606
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:43,020
Less than 1% knows the
man forgot Marshall.

1607
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:47,410
But, when you put 12 Americans together
in a jury and ask for justice.

1608
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:51,850
Something hard to
believe happens.

1609
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:57,890
More often than not,
they get it right.

1610
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,560
You know, uh,

1611
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:07,520
6 weeks we prep Burke's mistress
for the infamous Hank Palmer cross

1612
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,670
and you...You went easy on her.

1613
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,550
I did?

1614
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:19,500
- Might cost you your job.
- Well, you know, win or lose,

1615
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:21,470
even it's...

1616
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:27,900
And when you're on a streak.
....Stick with it.

1617
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:37,740
Indiana prison seven
months later.

1618
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:40,610
Petition for
compassionate release.

1619
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:46,450
<i>Sign here and here
to take possessions.</i>

1620
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:28,950
<i>You look good, you warm enough?</i>

1621
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:31,270
- <i>Yeah.
- Too warm?</i>

1622
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:33,580
Mackerel.

1623
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:38,130
Glen and Dale have gone
for some more bait.

1624
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:42,290
Remember you used to
bring these home?

1625
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:43,050
Yeah.

1626
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,120
- Give me some,
- here...

1627
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:45,950
Give me some to take home too.

1628
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:46,640
There you go.

1629
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,450
You little gremlins,
you inhaled these,

1630
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:50,450
- remember?
- <i>Sure!.</i>

1631
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:52,410
Inhaled Them, Haha.

1632
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:55,220
Until Dale failed to fill it out
and ruined it for everybody.

1633
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:56,950
