1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,800
(military percussive music)

2
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,238
All rise.

3
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:43,699
The court of Fayette County, Georgia

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,108
is now in session.

5
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,609
The honorable judge R.C. Lowry presiding.

6
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:52,979
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,383
Calling the case of the
people of the state of Georgia

8
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,859
versus Mr. Christopher Stone.

9
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,738
Mr. Stone is represented
by his attorney Mr. Aidman.

10
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,056
Good morning, your honor.

11
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:04,054
Mr. Stone, you're
charged with the violation

12
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,896
of Section 40-6-181 of
the Georgia legal code.

13
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:10,605
You were observed driving
105 miles per hour

14
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,950
in a 45 mile per hour zone.

15
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:15,656
And you were also seen
in front of City Hall

16
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,731
picking peaches off of Peach Tree City's

17
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,399
honorary peach tree.

18
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,566
Mr. Stone, how do you plead?

19
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,747
Your honor, I would like
to make the following motion.

20
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:28,472
I move that we dismiss this case

21
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,691
based on the fact that the prosecution

22
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,534
has completely ignored my written request

23
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,970
to discover the officer's notes.

24
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,804
I have here a copy of that request

25
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,027
written on August 9.

26
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:42,965
What notes?

27
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,769
He was clocked doing 105

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,315
and he had peach pits in his car.

29
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,733
Please be seated, Mr. Aidman.

30
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,445
Now, Mr. Stone, how do you plead?

31
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:57,036
Mr. Stone!

32
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:00,795
Oh.

33
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,635
Guilty, your honor.

34
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,515
Mr. Stone, you might
be a big shot movie star

35
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:09,349
out in Hollywood,

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,248
but this is my courtroom.

37
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:15,294
And you will conduct yourself accordingly.

38
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:19,936
See, I get a lot of film folks
come through my courtroom and

39
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,570
well, they come to Georgia
to make their movies.

40
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,031
[Chris] What do you
need me to say, Stanley?

41
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,428
Somehow they find ways to get themselves

42
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,082
- in all kinds of trouble.
- Hey, come on.

43
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,101
All I'm asking for

44
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,294
- is one meeting, okay?
- So, I-

45
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,128
Just one.

46
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:31,128
Mr. Stone!

47
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:34,157
If it's all right with Stanley,

48
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:37,067
I would like to continue.

49
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,318
Bye, Stanley.

50
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:41,117
As I was saying.

51
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,875
I get a lot of film folks
throughout my courtroom

52
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,257
and I was surprised to find out

53
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:48,136
that your daddy is Walter Stone.

54
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:50,477
(chuckling) I'm a big fan of your daddy's.

55
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,016
Why, I've seen Walter
on dozens of TV shows

56
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,550
and movies growing up.

57
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,608
His parts weren't always really big

58
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,276
but he was such a great actor.

59
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,514
Excuse me, your honor.

60
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,413
My client has to be in
hair and makeup by three.

61
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:05,018
What does this have to do
with a speeding ticket?

62
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,291
I got to thinking.

63
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,730
You know, Mayberry Fest
is coming up next month,

64
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,533
and as you know, your daddy
was in a couple episodes.

65
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:14,349
I don't know that Mayberry Fest is

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,787
but can you just set the fine

67
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,776
so we can get back to the set?

68
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:18,931
Mayberry Fest.

69
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,189
It's a wonderful week
of all things Mayberry.

70
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,149
Yeah yeah yeah, the TV show, I get it.

71
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,701
The fine please?

72
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:28,384
There'll be no fine.

73
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,284
Excuse me?

74
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,627
There'll be no monetary fine.

75
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,545
Mr. Stone, I'm sentencing
you to Mayberry Fest.

76
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,112
Mr. Stone, you'll spend one week

77
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:42,976
in Mayberry, North Carolina
as a Mayberry legacy.

78
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:44,691
You'll be representing your daddy

79
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,937
by participating in all the
festivities throughout the week.

80
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,331
I object, your honor.

81
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,121
My client's time does not allow

82
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,325
for whatever this is.

83
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,159
(gavel banging)

84
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,498
Fried chicken!

85
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,999
Charlie, please.

86
00:03:57,913 --> 00:03:59,808
Mr. Aidman, as for you,

87
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:03,290
one more outburst and
I'll find you in contempt.

88
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,774
Mr. Stone, you will attend Mayberry Fest,

89
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,840
you will complete this probation

90
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,813
or you'll find yourself
back in my courtroom

91
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:13,549
and you'll be looking at
some serious jail time.

92
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,905
Do you understand your
sentence, Mr. Stone?

93
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:19,656
Yes, your honor.

94
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,549
You're fired.

95
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,550
Again?

96
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,752
[Judge] This court is adjourned.

97
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,285
(gavel banging)

98
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,232

99

You understand me?

121

You're my agent, Stanley,
not my therapist.

122
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,209
No, I can't get out of it.

123
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,649
Look, do you want to spend
time in a backwoods jail?

124
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,271
Didn't think so, bye Stanley.

125
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:21,951
Welcome home, Mr. Stone.

126
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,785
Who are you?

127
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,393
Oh, I'm Shane, your new assistant.

128
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,329
What happened to my old assistant?

129
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,963
I don't know.

130
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,360
Go get my bag.

131
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,478
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,346
There she is.

133
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:52,455
Come here, come here Lucy,

134
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:53,551
come see your daddy!

135
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,374
Hey, did you miss me?

136
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,476
Oh my goodness, 'cause
I missed you, yes I did.

137
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,762
Yes I did.

138
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:00,767
You're such a good dog,

139
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,588
yes, you're such a good doggy.

140
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,792
Was this really Clark Gable's house?

141
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,483
Get me a beer, will you?

142
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:08,330
Come on.

143
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,330
Yeah.

144
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,835
Where's the kitchen?

145
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,460
(snapping) Come here, Lucy.

146
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:16,943
Come on.

147
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:18,192
Good girl.

148
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,425
Lay down.

149
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,254
Lay down, down.

150
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,088
Lay down.

151
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,088
Here's your beer, sir.

152
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,409
So how was Georgia?

153
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,465
See I have an aunt
- Lay down.

154
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,723
That lives in Augusta

155
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,702
and I was invited out
there last summer, but

156
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,603
I didn't end up going because
she has this feral bird Jimbo

157
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,452
who bit me when I was a kid.

158
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,330
And I don't know,

159
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,286
I've just been terrified
of birds ever since.

160
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,723
Well, it gave me a rash
(phone ringing)

161
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,387
And my aunt, she's immune to it, I guess

162
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:46,350
- by now, but basically.
- Hey, how's it going, man?

163
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,726
Yeah, are you free this weekend?

164
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,742
Yeah, my agent, he sent a
script over for me to read

165
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:54,585
but the walls are like
closing in on me here, so

166
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:55,919
I gotta get out.

167
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,164
Yeah I'll pick you up tomorrow at eight.

168
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:00,342
All right.

169
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:03,062
Bring your board 'cause
there's gonna be waves, man.

170
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,729
All right, see you.

171
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,730
Hey, Shane?

172
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,039
Shane.

173
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,837
(sighing) Lucy, go get Shane.

174
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:14,838
Go, go.

175
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,938
Go get Shane.

176
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,939
Go!

177
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,046
Dumb dog.

178
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,141
Shut up and listen to me!

179
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,821
This is the part where you play the agent

180
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,753
and I play the movie star!

181
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:32,957
No, Stanley.

182
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,237
Stanley, listen.

183
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,238
I gotta go.

184
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:40,077
I swear I have the world's laziest agent.

185
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,338
Dude, you gotta chill.

186
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,947
Well easy for you to chill.

187
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:44,836
Your last movie didn't just tank

188
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,181
at the box office.

189
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,172
Yeah, I'm just saying though.

190
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,148
Well, don't.

191
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,075
♪ Hey ♪

192
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:54,455
♪ Get out of my way ♪

193
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:58,077
Have you ever heard of Mayberry Fest?

194
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,293
Oh, I'm supposed to sign autographs too.

195
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,544
But not with my photos, no.

196
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:07,576
See, they want me to
sign photos of my dad.

197
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,494
[Friend] That's cool.

198
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,414
No.

199
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,229
Not cool.

200
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,751
Bro, once we get in that water,

201
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:19,392
all of your stress will just melt away.

202
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,629
Hey, Stanley.

203
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,452
Hey, did you get me that
meeting with Barry yet?

204
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:24,453
Why not?

205
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,157
Stanley, no.

206
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,397
Stanley, stop talking
and listen to me, okay?

207
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,577
This is a very important role for me.

208
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:33,987
I mean did you see the weekend numbers

209
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,358
from Satan's Game plan?

210
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,354
Stanley, stop talking for like one second,

211
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:41,010
you might just actually learn something.

212
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:42,751
What are you talking about,

213
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,840
I met with him three weeks ago.

214
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,072
I didn't know it was his daughter!

215
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,833
(light guitar music)

216
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,274
What up, superstar?

217
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,552
Hey Larry, how you doin'?

218
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,709
You want a beer?

219
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,354
No, thanks.

220
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:11,289
Bro, your house is 10
times the size of mine.

221
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,232
You should be storing dad's stuff.

222
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,226
And I found dad's first
acting job that he ever had.

223
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,270
This is so stupid.

224
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:22,376
Have you ever heard of Mayberry Fest?

225
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,432
Yeah, sure I have.

226
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,665
Dad used to go to it every year

227
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,211
until he got too old.

228
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,988
You would know that if you
ever bothered to stop by

229
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:28,989
and see him.

230
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,978
Can we not start this again?

231
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,429
From what I hear, sounds like fun.

232
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,811
Yeah, well maybe for
old has been actors, but,

233
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:39,827
I'm Chris Stone!

234
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:40,805
You know what's gonna happen to me

235
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,964
when I show up there?

236
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,288
I'm gonna get mobbed.

237
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:48,626
Remember this one? (Chuckling)

238
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:51,848
Mom tell you she's finally
willing to sell the house?

239
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,067
Yeah. And it's about time.

240
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,589
Neighborhood's getting a little unsafe.

241
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,805
Maybe we should get her
a condo or something,

242
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,669
maybe a senior living apartment?

243
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,782
I already looked at a few

244
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:05,166
but none that I want mom living in.

245
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,312
I told you I'd help her find something

246
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:09,949
when I get back from this
stupid Mayberry thing.

247
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,752
You know, this was one of
dad's most memorable roles.

248
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,163
Of all the shows that he was in,

249
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:17,649
everybody remembers this one the most.

250
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,317
It's like Mayberry Fest
made him a big star.

251
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,861
Look, I don't care about Mayberry Fest.

252
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,964
And I certainly don't care
about dad. Or his career.

253
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:34,625
He never cared about mine.

254
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:36,507
What are you talking about?

255
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:40,067
He has never appreciated my
accomplishments as an actor.

256
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,083
Sure he has.

257
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,167
Oh, really?

258
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:44,877
You know what he said to me

259
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:47,227
when I got my first big
role in Shingletown?

260
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,061
What?

261
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,061
Nothing.

262
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:51,884
Because he wasn't there.

263
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,431
He's just a two bit actor who...

264
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:00,063
Forget it.

265
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,326
Come on man, how can you say that?

266
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:03,403
He's your dad, man.

267
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:04,990
No, Larry.

268
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,688
He's your dad.

269
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:10,107
He was your basketball
coach, your scout leader.

270
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,623
He took you fishing.

271
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:12,921
And when you moved out

272
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:15,883
it was me who watched
him become an alcoholic.

273
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:19,627
And it was me who heard him
yell at mom every night!

274
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:22,315
And it was me who watched
him walk out the door

275
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:23,983
and never come back.

276
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,671
No, you had a dad, Larry.

277
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:33,515
You had a dad.

278
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:42,212
You gotta forgive him for that, bro.

279
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,213
Mom has.

280
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,722
That was a long time ago.

281
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,827
Is there anything else you need?

282
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:53,828
No.

283
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,649
I don't need anything.

284
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,986
But you do.

285
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,031
See you, bro.

286
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,873
(lightly somber music)

287
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:40,410
(plane whooshing)

288
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,129
Thank you, Mr. Stone.

289
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,308
I've never been on a private jet before.

290
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,309
Oh.

291
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:52,092
(Shane retching)

292
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,093
Yikes.

293
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:55,263
Mr. Stone?

294
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:59,346
I'm Doug, I'm gonna be
your driver for the week.

295
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,581
Anything you need, I'm your man.

296
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,502
Right.

297
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,496
Oh, and this must be Shane?

298
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:05,665
Yeah.

299
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,499
Hi.

300
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,332
Hi.

301
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,165
Nice to meet you.

302
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,248
Your chariot awaits, boys, come on.

303
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:19,346
Ugh.

304
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:20,995
Sorry y'all gotta sit in the back seat

305
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:23,644
but the front seat's a little busted.

306
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,794
Y'all ever been to North Carolina before?

307
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:27,338
No.

308
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,538
It's really beautiful.

309
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,117
Oh, we're gonna have a wonderful time.

310
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,397
You are gonna love it.

311
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,599
The people here are all so friendly.

312
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,722
And the food, don't get me
started on the food. (Chuckling)

313
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,983
But you know, you can
really go anywhere you-

314
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,482
Hey, Dan?

315
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,162
It's actually Doug.

316
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,594
Whatever your name is.

317
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,718
Listen, if you, stop touching.

318
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,728
If you don't mind, I
got a bit of a headache

319
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:48,562
from the flight.

320
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:49,395
Say no more.

321
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:51,405
Headache, I know, when you got a headache,

322
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,788
all you want is a little peace and quiet.

323
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:55,566
Well guess what, peace and quiet

324
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,252
is what you are gonna get.

325
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,838
All right, just sit back and relax

326
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,405
and we will be there

327
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:01,980
- in no time.
- Doug!

328
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:02,981
Doug!

329
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:08,316
I will have you there
in a jiffy. (Chuckling)

330
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:11,150
We're gonna have a wonderful time.

331
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,034
(Shane sneezing)

332
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,534
(car honking)

333
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,507
(door slamming)

334
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,317
Don't forget.

335
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,498
I'll be right back here
at 7:30 in the morning

336
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,717
to pick you two up for
the opening ceremony.

337
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:43,837
Opening ceremonies?

338
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,501
Yeah, you know, when the mayor declares

339
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:47,596
the official start of the Mayberry Fest.

340
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:50,703
You two are gonna love it! (Laughing)

341
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:51,704
Swell.

342
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,709
(Shane sighing)

343
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:18,284
Hey.

344
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,919
This is gonna be fun.

345
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,252
(crickets chirping)

346
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,380
(festive parade music)

347
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:39,285
(people cheering)

348
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:43,068
Stop, put it down.

349
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,146
Stop.

350
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:45,038
Mr. Stone!

351
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,305
Hey Mr. Stone, hey.

352
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,389
Welcome to Mayberry Fest.

353
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:52,094
Hey, is it all right if I call you Chris?

354
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,393
We're kind of on a first
name basis around here.

355
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,185
My name's Allan by the way.

356
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:01,228
But you can call me Floyd. (Laughing)

357
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,062
Your name?

358
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,099
Oh, Shane.

359
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,651
Shane, it's good to see you.

360
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:06,654
You look a little shaggy here in the back.

361
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,488
Oh.

362
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,848
Let me trim that up for you.

363
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,253
Ooh, that's good.

364
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,087
Does it look good?

365
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:13,244
Yeah.

366
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,251
Good morning, everyone.

367
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,746
Hey, have you seen Kate?

368
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,485
There's a truck blocking the driveway

369
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,555
and there's someone that
needs to get through.

370
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,437
No, I haven't seen her.

371
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:24,430
You might check over at the office.

372
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:25,832
She could be over there.

373
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,131
[Man] All right, okay, thank you.

374
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,701
Good morning! (Laughing)

375
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,319
Hello, doll.

376
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,956
The fun girls have found you,

377
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:36,104
you better watch out. (Chuckling)

378
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,430
Let's head on over,

379
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,966
take a seat up on the stage.

380
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,314
That's where you'll be
for the opening ceremony.

381
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,148
Excuse me.

382
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,580
Floyd, have you seen Kate?

383
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,606
Kate?

384
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,810
No, I haven't seen her, sorry.

385
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:48,214
Thank you.

386
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,048
Who's Kate?

387
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:49,881
Kate?

388
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,242
Oh, she runs this whole event.

389
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:52,247
Been running it for years.

390
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,312
She's a doll.

391
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,540
(chuckling) A real doll.

392
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,002
Golly!

393
00:17:58,003 --> 00:17:59,999
Welcome to Mayberry Fest!

394
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,540
Judy Judy Judy.

395
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,258
How do you do that?

396
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,620
Okay, come here, listen, listen to me.

397
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:06,912
I don't care how much it costs.

398
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,680
Or who do I have to pay off, all right?

399
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,673
We're out of here.

400
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,136
I'm not gonna stay here a whole week!

401
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:13,970
You understand me?

402
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,060
- Okay?
- Yeah.

403
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,625
- I need you.
- (man cackling)

404
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:21,626
Who are you calling a
creachture? (Cackling)

405
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,357
I'm not gonna stay here another hour!

406
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,191
Hey!

407
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:27,357
Hey, if it isn't
Mayberry's favorite mayor.

408
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,920
Mayor Pike! I got somebody
I want you to meet.

409
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,570
Mayor Pike, Chris Stone.

410
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,930
This is Mayor Pike

411
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:37,039
Good morning, Mr. Stone,
I'm so glad you're here.

It's time to go to the stage.

428
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,127
(crowd applauding)

429
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,994
Good morning everybody, good morning.

430
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:23,978
I want to officially welcome
everyone to Mayberry Fest!

431
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:28,979
(crowd cheering)

432
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,677
We have a big week
planned for you this week.

433
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,904
A lot of fun things going on.

434
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:39,357
You know, this could turn
out to be our biggest yet!

435
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,730
(crowd applauding)
(parade music)

436
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,226
And to think,

437
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,728
for 20 years we've been gathering here

438
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,668
as fans of the show together.

439
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,077
20 years!

440
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:56,078
(crowd applauding)
(parade music)

441
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:01,972
So we have a special
guest with us this year.

442
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,433
And it's always great to have 'em, but,

443
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:07,652
this is our Grand Marshal for our parade.

444
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,623
The daughter of Don Knotts,

445
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:12,873
the lovely Karen Knotts!

446
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:15,791
(crowd applauding)

447
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:19,980
You know, the show was a huge part

448
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,833
of my father's life.

449
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:26,252
And he always thought of his
fans, you guys, like family.

450
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:28,047
And I know we miss him

451
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:29,866
but we're grateful that he's still

452
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,116
entertaining us today, right?

453
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:35,273
(crowd applauding)

454
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,989
You know my dad had a great career.

455
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,368
He was a comic genius.

456
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:44,311
And on top of all that, he had me!

457
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:47,062
(crowd laughing)

458
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,473
Well, I want you to
remember to come see my show

459
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:55,708
Tied Up In Knotts at the Royal
Theater on Saturday, okay?

460
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,458
I'll see you there.

461
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,376
(crowd applauding)

462
00:21:02,197 --> 00:21:03,465
Thank you, Karen.

463
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:06,253
It's so good to have
you with us this week.

464
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:09,168
We have another special
guest with us this week,

465
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,857
a first timer, (chuckling) first timer.

466
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,606
Mr. Chris Stone!

467
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,912
(silence)

468
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:18,672
The son of Walter Stone from season three.

469
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,590
(crowd applauding)

470
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:26,532
Most of you know that
Walter's a regular here

471
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:27,708
at Mayberry Fest.

472
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,558
But he couldn't make it this year.

473
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,090
But he wanted me to send you his love

474
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,173
and tell you that he misses you all.

475
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:37,298
- (crowd applauding)
- Aw, that's great.

476
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,256
We love you, Walt!

477
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,919
But we're lucky to have his
son here to represent him.

478
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,753
Chris?

479
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:44,991
Chris, come on up here, come on up.

480
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:48,068
Chris Stone, ladies and gentlemen.

481
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,793
Yeah, come on up, Chris, come on.

482
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:51,794
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:53,480
Yeah, come on up.

484
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,839
Chris Stone, ladies and gentlemen.

485
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,007
Come right on up here.

486
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,821
Well.

487
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,162
We have a tradition here

488
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,961
that we bring up our mayor.

489
00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:08,045
So the mayor of Mayberry,

490
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,181
ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Luther Wilson!

491
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:15,539
(crowd applauding)

492
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,475
As part of that tradition,

493
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,056
as part of that tradition,

494
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:22,399
we got to present our first time guest

495
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,964
with a special award.

496
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,048
Mayor, Mayor.

497
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:27,910
Miss Mayberry.

498
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,736
Chris Stone, it's my
honor as mayor of Mayberry

499
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:39,753
to present to you a key to our fair city!

500
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:40,781
(crowd applauding)

501
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:42,136
[Man] Attaboy, Luther!

502
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:43,662
(crowd laughing)

503
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:53,783
Hi.

504
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,308

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,476
Thank you, thank you all for having me

506
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:03,955
here with you all.

507
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,815
You know, my uh... my dad,

508
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,520
boy he loved this show.

509
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,521
He loved it.

510
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,239
Mayberry!

511
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
(man clapping)

512
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,479
And uh...

513
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:29,469
He...

514
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,697
Yeah.

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,180
Thank you, uh, thank

516
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:41,063
(crowd applauding)

517
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:44,080
[Floyd] Thank you Chris, thank you.

518
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,500
- That was real purdy.
- I did wanna mention

519
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:50,383
that Chris has brought
with him photos of Walter

520
00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:53,175
that he'll be signing at
our autograph sessions

521
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,512
throughout the week.

522
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,513
(crowd applauding and cheering)

523
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,196
(parade music)

524
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,154
(Chris sighing)

525
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,492
Hey, Stanley.

526
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,451
Any word from Barry's people yet?

527
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,952
What do you mean it's only 7:30?

528
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,313
It's 10:30 here in North Carolina.

529
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:25,298
If it's 10:30 here, it's 10:30 there.

530
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,058
(door knocking)

531
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,142
It's agent time, Stanley!

532
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:33,756
We're all set, Mr. Stone.

533
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:36,079
Here are your photos for
the autograph session

534
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,748
and Doug will pick us up in 30 minutes.

535
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:39,237
And I put some sharpies
in there for you too.

536
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,144
We got black, silver and magenta.

537
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,645
(music)

538
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,896
(siren wailing)

539
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,368
Hi, I'm Greg.

540
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,200
Chris.

541
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,550
Oh yeah, I know who you are.

542
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,216
I'm a big fan.

543
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:17,634
I love your work.

544
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:23,520
Oh, this here, that's my
documentary about Mayberry Fest.

545
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:27,666
Five years of my life making that film.

546
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,989
You know, it's amazing how one show

547
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,455
can have such an effect on so many people.

548
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:36,011
It sure had an effect on me.

549
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:36,925
That's terrific.

550
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,682
[Greg] Oh no, that's yours.

551
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:39,933
I'd be honored.

552
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:43,754
(music)

553
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:57,831
Looks like you've got some competition.

554
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,136
[Woman] Okay Kate,
you can let them in now.

555
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:09,238
Thank you, Holly.

556
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:14,222
(music)

557
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:20,788
Do you have a sharpie?

558
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,009
Love you.

559
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,523
Hey, I'm Ray field, and
this is my wife Ginny.

560
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:25,857
Good morning..

561
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,228
These your daddy?

562
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:31,979
[Chris] Yes, it is.

563
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:34,670
I think we'll take this one.

564
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:36,084
Would you sign this for us?

565
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,673
Sure.

566
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:40,093
Sign it Ray field and Ginny.

567
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:42,094
Oh, thank you so much.

568
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:47,874
Hey, this says Roger.

569
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:54,674
Ray field.

570
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,138
Oh, Ginny.

571
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:04,295
Enjoy.

572
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,241
(light piano music)

573
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:14,409
- (tense music)
- Howdy.

574
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:16,805
Hey, how did it go, sir?

575
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:17,639
Not great.

576
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:18,580
Go, go!

577
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:21,747
Hey Bernie, where you going, come back!

578
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:24,664
Can I get that for you?

579
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:25,759
You wanna do something for me, kid?

580
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,225
- Yeah.
- Go find Kate.

581
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,505
Okay, you got it.

582
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,082
Oh wait, who's Kate?

583
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,244
Ask someone.

584
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:33,828
And then, bring her back to me.

585
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:41,279
[Man] Well, looky
here, a stranger in town.

586
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,113
Uh...

587
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:44,404
I'm just kidding, I know who you are.

588
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:46,004
Yeah, yeah.

589
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:49,350
You probably saw me in my
last movie, Deep Cover PD.

590
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,532
No, that's not it.

591
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:53,967
10 Hours Till Dawn.

592
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,068
Satan's Game plan.

593
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:58,185
Death Figure Eight.

594
00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:00,004
Shingletown!

595
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:01,007
No.

596
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:02,508
I'm Chris Stone!

597
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:05,999
Wow.

598
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,719
You guys, you have a movie theater

599
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,635
in this town, right?

600
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:10,540
Oh yeah, we got real real nice one

601
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11,863
down on Main Street.

602
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,481
They did some renovations last year,

603
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,036
moved the ladies room
from the second level

604
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:16,201
down to the lobby level.

605
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,785
Real classy move.

606
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:21,562
Okay, that's great Barney.

607
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,431
I got some things I gotta do, so.

608
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:25,640
Oh I get it, I get it.

609
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:29,078
Well, real nice to meet
you there, Chris Stone.

610
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,079
And remember, no jaywalking.

611
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:35,476
Mr. Stone?

612
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,519
Hi, your friend said
you were looking for me.

613
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,057
I'm Kate.

614
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:40,650
I'm Chris.

615
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,660
Sorry I haven't had a
chance to meet you sooner.

616
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,257
Things get a little crazy around
here during Mayberry Fest.

617
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:46,761
Yeah.

618
00:28:46,762 --> 00:28:48,636
But thank you so much for coming.

619
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:51,036
Oh, it's my pleasure.

620
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:52,775
You know, dad told me

621
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:54,433
when he wasn't gonna be able to come here,

622
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,600
how much he was gonna miss it, so,

623
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,329
I thought I should come in his honor.

624
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,678
That's so sweet.

625
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,935
Yeah, I know.

626
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,855
He always told me how much he loved

627
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:04,606
coming to this event.

628
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,700
I just thought I should be here.

629
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,604
And we are glad to have you, Nick.

630
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:11,770
Chris.

631
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:12,604
Chris.

632
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:14,125
I'm so sorry.

633
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,804
[Chris] It's okay.

634
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:18,664
What was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

635
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:19,808
Oh.

636
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:20,824
Uh...

637
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,975
I'm sorry to interrupt.

638
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:22,809
- It's okay.
- But Luanne needs

639
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:23,767
to see you in the office.

640
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:25,655
She needs to move Mrs. Wiley's tea party

641
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,302
from 10 to 10:30.

642
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,136
Okay.

643
00:29:28,137 --> 00:29:30,201
- Thank you, Holly.
- You're welcome.

644
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,200
I have to go.

645
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,358
I'm sorry, but what was it you
wanted to talk to me about?

646
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,430
I can't remember now.

647
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:39,503
Well if you do remember,

648
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:41,170
I'll be running around here someplace.

649
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:42,004
[Chris] Okay.

650
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,984
Thank you so much for coming.

651
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:43,889
It was a pleasure meeting you.

652
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:44,722
[Chris] Yeah.

653
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:46,889
We just love your daddy.

654
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,962
Goooolly!

655
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:52,213
Looks like you've just met-

656
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,646
Shazam!

657
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:02,814
(Mayberry March music)

658
00:31:41,144 --> 00:31:42,548
Mr. Stone!

659
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,632
I'm heading down to the
pool, if you'd like to...

660
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:53,885
(music)

661
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,660
Okay, I don't care about that, Stanley.

662
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:59,618
Have you set up the meeting yet?

663
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,020
Wait, what?

664
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,540
Wait why is my mom calling you?

665
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,374
No, no, no.

666
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,582
I told her I'd find a place for her

667
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,916
when I get back.

668
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,562
Yeah.

669
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:12,146
Just, tell her to stop looking.

670
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,768
Hey, Mr. Stone!

671
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:19,473
You forgot something.

672
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,282
Thanks.

673
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:24,360
Hey, good afternoon.

674
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,595
How'd the autograph
session go this morning?

675
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,447
Long.

676
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,485
(chuckling) And what you got planned

677
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,669
for the rest of the day?

678
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,563
Hey, I know who you are.

679
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,306
You're the singing guitar player

680
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:38,301
from that episode with
the singing guitar player!

681
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:41,114
No, no I'm not, sorry.

682
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:41,948
Oh.

683
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:44,482
Well would you mind taking our picture?

684
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:47,233
Just push that button right there.

685
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:50,740
Yeah, right there in front of me.

686
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:51,957
Oh, it's shaggy back here.

687
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,101
[Chris] Smile.

688
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:54,435
[Fans] Cheese!

689
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,445
Oh, thank you very much.

690
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:01,877
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- Thanks, buddy.

691
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:05,200
(chuckling) Now that's
a nice couple there.

692
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,233
Hey, have you ever been
over to the courthouse?

693
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,067
No.

694
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,238
Oh, oh, you wanna see that.

695
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,404
Oh, it's just like the real set.

696
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:16,621
I'll go with you!

697
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:17,622
Swell.

698
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,182
Right this way, folks.

699
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,886
Try to stay together there.

700
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,681
No stragglers now.

701
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,099
Come right on in.

702
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,638
Well, as you can see,

703
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,056
here we have an exact replica

704
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:35,504
of the Mayberry courthouse.

705
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:40,505
Made possible by the Greater
Mayberry Historical Society

706
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,208
and Tourist Bureau.

707
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:44,358
Limited!

708
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,926
(guide chuckling)

709
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,344
Limited, that's a good one.

710
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,272
Feel free to sit at the desk

711
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:56,273
and take a picture while you
make your phone call to Sarah.

712
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:59,146
(bluegrass music)

713
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,186
Oh, and these over here,

714
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:11,270
these are our maximum security cells.

715
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,321
As you probably know,
this is where we keep

716
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:18,406
our most incorrigible prisoners.

717
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:23,407
(man humming)
(music)

718
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:26,986
Here's one of our savage killers now.

719
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,098
(crowd applauding)

720
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,839
That's the greatest thing I've ever saw.

721
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,496
Y'all are welcome to come back

722
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:58,117
and have your picture
taken in one of the cells.

723
00:34:58,118 --> 00:34:59,842
I suggest this one.

724
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:01,742
(group laughing)

725
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:03,576
What are you in for?

726
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:06,422
Peaches.

727
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:08,535
(apple crunching)

728
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:11,594
(bluegrass music)

729
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:16,054
Pretty neat huh? (Laughing)

730
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:18,317
Tell me something, Floyd.

731
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:19,712
Allan, right?

732
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:21,853
Yeah, but this week Floyd.

733
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,520
We wouldn't want anybody to hear you

734
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,463
calling me Allan.

735
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:27,133
Floyd it is.

736
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:29,194
Excuse me sir, can I get a picture?

737
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,278
Yeah, sure.

738
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:32,494
Thank you.

739
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:35,714
Uh... could you move
for just a minute, sir?

740
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,008
Sorry, what?

741
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,676
For just a second.

742
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:44,448
All right, hold still here.

743
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:45,472
[Woman] Got it.

744
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:47,008
Thank you so much.

745
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,842
Thank you too, mister.

746
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,190
So, Floyd.

747
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,688
You've been doing this a long time, right?

748
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:58,788
Yeah, I've been doing it quite a while,

749
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,039
a lot of years.

750
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:03,588
Can I ask you something?

751
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,348
Oh, hey Mr. Schwamp.

752
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:08,868
Sure, yeah, anything.

753
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:09,869
Goooolly!

754
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,428
How well did you know my dad?

755
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:15,050
Your dad?

756
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,570
Pretty good, I believe.

757
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:17,571
Why you ask?

758
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,124
I don't know, I just wanted to know

759
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,762
if he ever talked about his career

760
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,367
other than the show.

761
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:27,428
He's a good talker,
(chuckling) your dad is.

762
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:28,701
- He's a really good talker.
- Yeah.

763
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:30,775
I figured that.

764
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,535
What does he talk about?

765
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:34,922
Acting, he loves acting.

766
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:36,186
He talks about that.

767
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:38,541
Had some great stories
about some of the old shows

768
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,287
he'd been in and stuff.

769
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:43,587
Oh and he talked about you boys.

770
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:45,340
He talked about his kids all the time.

771
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,258
He's very proud of you.

772
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:50,679
Matter of fact, he always made sure I knew

773
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,124
when you had a new movie coming out.

774
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,125
Always.

775
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:58,085
Oh, look at that, I've gotta go.

776
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:02,877
I'm a tenor in the Mayberry
barbershop quartet. (Laughing)

777
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:05,010
Hey, you wanna go?

778
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,261
I'm good.

779
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,929
All right, I'll see you later.

780
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:13,773
(music)

781
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:19,817
(siren wailing)

782
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:26,117
(music)

783
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,750
(music)

784
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:07,476
You know, this is me.

785
00:38:07,477 --> 00:38:09,429
- Everybody knows it.
- Awards are great.

786
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,461
But it's really just knowing that my films

787
00:38:11,462 --> 00:38:13,909
are connecting with the hearts and minds.

788
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,609
Don't mess this up,
Stanley, don't you dare.

789
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,728
Were you sick the day they taught this

790
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,144
in agent school or something? Come on.

791
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:20,706
Awards?

792
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:22,365
Is that what you're going with?

793
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,366
Wow.

794
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:27,779
I'm just asking for one meeting.

795
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
I mean how hard is that?

796
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:32,163
What?

797
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:35,458
Do you even want to be my agent, Stanley?

798
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:36,823
Really?

799
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:40,337
Why don't you start acting like it?

800
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:41,588
Just set it up!

801
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:45,151
Ugh.

802
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:46,503
[Chris] Come on Shane, let's have lunch.

803
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:47,406
- Come on.
- I'm just gonna actually

804
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:48,823
go back to the...

805
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:54,936
(country music)
(crowd chattering)

806
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,982
I nailed the audish, thank you.

807
00:38:58,983 --> 00:38:59,900
I nailed the audish.

808
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,794
Yeah.

809
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:03,899
And that's how I got cast
as Lucky in Shingletown.

810
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,042
From that moment on, I mean

811
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:05,876
I can't walk down the street

812
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,728
without someone asking for my autograph.

813
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,716
Wow, that's amazing, Mr. Stone.

814
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:10,550
You're telling me.

815
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,550
Excuse me.

816
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:13,862
See?

817
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,205
Are you done with the ketchup?

818
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:19,609
Yeah.

819
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,443
Thank you.

820
00:39:25,273 --> 00:39:27,342
You know, you eat like a pig, right?

821
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:28,343
Oh.

822
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,539
I hate to ask you again.

823
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,509
It's okay.

824
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,750
My wife wants me to ask you.

825
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:37,790
I know.

826
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,458
Are you done with the mustard?

827
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:56,117
All right, so give me the lowdown.

828
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:57,927
What's the story with Kate?

829
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,796
She seems nice.

830
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,800
No, I mean like does she
have a boyfriend or anything?

831
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,219
Oh, yeah I wouldn't really-

832
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Oh my!

833
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,620
I can't believe it!

834
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:08,162
You're Chris Stone!

835
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:09,580
Yes, thank you.

836
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,023
I am Chris Stone.

837
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,693
We've seen all of your movies.

838
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:15,615
Death Figure Eight is my favorite.

839
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,477
And Shingletown.

840
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:18,311
So cute.

841
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:19,594
Can we take a picture with you?

842
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,428
Yes, absolutely.

843
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,261
Give your phone to Shane.

844
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:22,437
Oh yeah, of course.

845
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:24,470
[Chris] Come on around.

846
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:27,239
All right, say Mr. Stone on three.

847
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,479
- Here we go.
- One, two, three.

848
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,350
[All] Mr. Stone!

849
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:32,184
[Shane] Got it.

850
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:33,017
Thank you,

851
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:33,850
- thank you.
- You're welcome.

852
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,017
All right, there you go.

853
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:38,647
Wow.

854
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:39,754
Did I tell you?

855
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:40,588
I mean.

856
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:41,864
Yeah, all the time.

857
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,682
And how are things at this table?

858
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:44,619
Great.

859
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,759
Really good, Scott.

860
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,593
Hey, Shane.

861
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:47,426
Hey!

862
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:48,259
Weren't you just-

863
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,329
Oh, this is Chris Stone.

864
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,173
Oh.

865
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:51,197
- Hey Chris, how are you?
- What's up, man?

866
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,601
[Shane] You know,
from Death Figure Eight?

867
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:54,842
Uh, No.

868
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:55,822
Vegan Gringo?

869
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:56,810
Mmm-mm.

870
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,784
Shingletown.

871
00:40:57,785 --> 00:40:59,734
Shingle, no.

872
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:01,098
He's Walter Stone's son.

873
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:01,965
Walter Stone.

874
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:05,129
Oh, you're Chris Stone, Walter's son.

875
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,024
Yeah.

876
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:07,836
Hey, you know what,
your dad would eat here

877
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:10,943
at the Loaded Goat every
year for Mayberry Fest.

878
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:12,492
Your dad's a wonderful man.

879
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:13,643
Scott's the owner of the Loaded Goat.

880
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:15,617
I figured that.

881
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:16,909
Hey, Shane, next time,

882
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,910
you know you get those wings
half price on Wednesday.

883
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:26,140
Hey, do me a favor, bring the check to me.

884
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:28,485
Hey, lunch is on me today, gentlemen.

885
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,495
- Thank you, Scott.
- That's really kind of you.

886
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:30,329
Thank you.

887
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,710
Hey, it's my pleasure.

888
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:32,931
Hey just do me a favor.

889
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:34,024
When you see your dad,

890
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,520
tell them I said hi for me, would you?

891
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:37,879
I will.

892
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,713
All right, awesome.

893
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:39,638
Hey you guys have a great day.

894
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:40,471
- Yeah, you too Scott,
- Take care.

895
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:42,956
- Thank you.
- See you later.

896
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:44,002
Wow.

897
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,799
That was a great burger.

898
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah.

899
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:54,158
Ooh, just got to make a
little pit stop first.

900
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,618
(Chris sighing)

901
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,919
Kate.

902
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,753
Oh, hey.

903
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:08,827
Hey.

904
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:09,661
How's it going?

905
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:10,636
Good.

906
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:11,470
Good to see you.

907
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:12,487
You look great today.

908
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,888
Thank you.

909
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:15,504
I just feel like there's some chemistry

910
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:16,899
right here between you and me.

911
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,976
Hey, Mr. Stone.

912
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:18,810
Hey, Kate!

913
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,643
Hey!

914
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:22,536
Wow, you were just asking me about her

915
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:23,370
- and here she is.
- Nope.

916
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:24,609
- That's so crazy.
- Oh, no, what?

917
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,059
I mean, sorry.

918
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,464
He was dropped on his
head when he was little.

919
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:29,750
What is wrong with you?

920
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,048
Well, you said, what's
the story with Kate?

921
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,325
And then I said, who ah, it's just-

922
00:42:33,326 --> 00:42:34,830
Stop!

923
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:37,125
I don't need your help, okay?

924
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:38,885
I'm Chris Stone.

925
00:42:38,886 --> 00:42:39,886
Watch this.

926
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,760
Are you doing something with your voice?

927
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,942
(elevator music)

928
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,360
I don't get it.

929
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,427
Shane.

930
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:57,648
You're a regular guy, how would you do it?

931
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:58,828
Huh, do what?

932
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:01,512
Kate, how would you make a move on her?

933
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:02,513
Oh, uh.

934
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,709
Well, I don't think I
would make a move on her.

935
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,308
I'd probably just, you know,

936
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:10,296
try and get to know her first.

937
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,315
Yeah, doesn't that take time?

938
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:13,799
Yeah.

939
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,633
Usually.

940
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,598
That's Walter Stone's kid!

941
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:17,757
How are you?

942
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:19,324
- We are big fans!
- Oh, yeah.

943
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:20,158
Of your daddy!

944
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,184
- We sure are!
- Oh.

945
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,342
My name's Walter too

946
00:43:22,343 --> 00:43:23,421
but everybody calls me Walt!

947
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:24,263
Nice to meet you.

948
00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:25,096
I'm Shirley.

949
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:25,929
Okay.

950
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:26,762
We are really big fans of the show.

951
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:27,795
Yeah, what was Andy like?

952
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:28,720
Did you ever visit the set?

953
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:30,379
Y'all are very welcome.

954
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,920
And you have a beautiful day.

955
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:33,081
Did you ever visit the set?

956
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:34,081
Kind of.

957
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:36,877
Those are really, really great questions,

958
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:39,618
and you know, I got a thing, so,

959
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:40,619
gotta go.

960
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:42,690
Hey, Doug.

961
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:44,406
Hey, hey, can I borrow
the car for an hour?

962
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:47,144
- I guess that will be okay.
- Thanks.

963
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:48,072
Where are you going?

964
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:49,109
I don't care.

965
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:49,943
Anywhere but here.

966
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:51,200
[Doug] Okay.

967
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,436
(tires screeching)

968
00:43:56,291 --> 00:44:01,282
(bluegrass music)

969
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:06,572
(music stops)

970
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:19,361
(cellphone ringing)

971
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:22,614
(dramatic ominous music)

972
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:25,531
(tires screeching)

973
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:28,187
(skidding)

974
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:45,335
(birds chirping)

975
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:27,687
Hello?

976
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:40,692
(lightly tense music)

977
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:14,184
Good afternoon.

978
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:15,185
Oh.

979
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:18,177
Hey, uh.

980
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:21,337
Sorry, I was just driving and

981
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:22,417
this huge turtle-

982
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,835
Is there something I can help you with?

983
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:29,045
I doubt it.

984
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:41,802
So the tourists, they don't
make it out this far, huh?

985
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:42,803
Tourists?

986
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:47,441
Yeah, the fans of the show.

987
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,975
Son, Mayberry's been around a lot longer

988
00:46:54,976 --> 00:46:57,129
than that TV show.

989
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,167
Well why don't you tell that

990
00:46:58,168 --> 00:47:00,668
to the thousands back in town?

991
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:05,845
I suppose there comes
a time in everyone's life

992
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:08,179
when things get complicated.

993
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,083
Mostly by our own doing.

994
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:16,283
And that's when folks
start to look to our past.

995
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:22,164
Mayberry... and the show,

996
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:27,300
remind us of a time when
things were simpler,

997
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:30,063
when folks were friendlier to one another.

998
00:47:30,064 --> 00:47:32,598
And just laying back in the grass

999
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,330
and looking up, watching the clouds

1000
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:36,272
roll across the sky was...

1001
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:38,347
Enough.

1002
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:45,316
You see, Mayberry... isn't
just a place. It's...

1003
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,489
It's a state of mind.

1004
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:51,649
It's in Georgia, it's in Indiana.

1005
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,967
Heck, it's even in California.

1006
00:47:57,104 --> 00:48:00,322
It's anywhere where
folks treat one another

1007
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:04,073
with the dignity given
them by their creator.

1008
00:48:05,525 --> 00:48:09,050
It's about... looking beyond ourselves.

1009
00:48:12,261 --> 00:48:17,011
Now is there something in
particular you was looking for?

1010
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:20,263
No.

1011
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,264
Um...

1012
00:48:23,664 --> 00:48:25,331
I got what I needed.

1013
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:29,950
You have a good day.

1014
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:35,485
Goodbye.

1015
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:39,473
Mr. Stone.

1016
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:46,319
(light music)

1017
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,967
(birds chirping)

1018
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,005
(bright music)

1019
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,633
[Chris] To Don and Betty.

1020
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:38,440
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

1021
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:39,956
And tell your daddy hey for us.

1022
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:40,974
I sure will.

1023
00:49:40,975 --> 00:49:41,975
Bye now.

1024
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:47,097
(energetic dance music)

1025
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:59,029
(cellphone ringing)

1026
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:05,918
How are you?

1027
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:06,926
Good, partner.

1028
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:08,169
I'll take this one.

1029
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,750
Could you sign it Bobby-Ray?

1030
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:12,501
[Chris] Absolutely, you got it.

1031
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,731
There you go.

1032
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:17,815
Hey, you're the guy in Shingletown.

1033
00:50:19,939 --> 00:50:20,772
How's it going?

1034
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:21,969
[Man] Great, how about you?

1035
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:22,803
I'm good, fabulous.

1036
00:50:22,804 --> 00:50:24,870
You got a couple options here.

1037
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,833
Hey.

1038
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:34,377
Hey.

1039
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:37,045
So, when can I buy you dinner?

1040
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:39,114
Oh.

1041
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:42,535
I actually have plans, I'm sorry.

1042
00:50:42,536 --> 00:50:46,255
It's okay, we'll just do breakfast then.

1043
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:48,490
Look. Um...

1044
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:51,676
You're a nice enough guy and all

1045
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:53,241
and I'm really glad you're here.

1046
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,459
And I love your daddy.

1047
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,877
But, I'm just not interested.

1048
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:00,482
Sorry.

1049
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,000
(lightly somber music)

1050
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:04,014
Hey buddy.

1051
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:06,346
Can you give me a hand here?

1052
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:07,421
A little help?

1053
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:08,422
Yeah.

1054
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,894
Just get it, that's great.

1055
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,407
See y'all later.

1056
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,778
Oh, hey, Chris.

1057
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:20,612
Hey.

1058
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:21,712
I had to get out of there.

1059
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:23,018
If I stay in there too long

1060
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:26,797
they're gonna want me to cut
somebody's hair. (Chuckling)

1061
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:27,798
Mr. Schwamp.

1062
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,971
You know, when I was a boy

1063
00:51:30,972 --> 00:51:33,371
I actually wanted to be a barber.

1064
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:35,169
Yeah but nobody would
let me cut their hair.

1065
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,340
I used to go out back there and catch

1066
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:38,847
the neighborhood cats.

1067
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,277
Here an example of some of
my work there. (Laughing)

1068
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:43,861
Yeah, looks nice.

1069
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,524
How long have you been playing Floyd?

1070
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:49,471
Hey look, a stranger in town!

1071
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:51,402
No, we've already met.

1072
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,554
No we haven't, I never forget a face.

1073
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:55,120
Yeah, I already told you, my name is-

1074
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:57,502
No, don't, don't, don't
tell me, don't tell me. Uh...

1075
00:51:57,503 --> 00:51:59,809
Let me see if I can...

1076
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,462
Give me the first letter.

1077
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:03,296
- C.
- Cal!

1078
00:52:03,296 --> 00:52:04,149
- No.
- Clay?

1079
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,225
No.

1080
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:06,198
Cliff?

1081
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,200
No.

1082
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:09,116
- No, it's Chris.
- Chris!

1083
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:10,677
See I told you I never forget a face.

1084
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:11,511
Amazing!

1085
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:12,511
Wow.

1086
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:15,518
[Floyd] Hey, look at that, Barney.

1087
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,201
Wow, I don't think I've
seen that one before.

1088
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,351
I never forget a squad car.

1089
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:21,185
(Floyd chuckling)

1090
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:22,564
Yeah it's real nice.

1091
00:52:22,565 --> 00:52:25,181
Reckon what happened
to the original ones.

1092
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:26,200
They should have put one

1093
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:28,215
in the Smithsonian Institute or something.

1094
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:29,693
Yeah, I guess.

1095
00:52:29,694 --> 00:52:31,453
Oh, there's a treasure there.

1096
00:52:31,454 --> 00:52:33,704
It's a shame, a real shame.

1097
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:37,037
You know, I know where
there's an original.

1098
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:38,420
Huh?

1099
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,944
Right over in
Wilmington, North Carolina.

1100
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:42,714
An original squad car?

1101
00:52:42,715 --> 00:52:43,786
Yeah.

1102
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:44,905
It's at an old movie studio.

1103
00:52:44,906 --> 00:52:47,348
I know 'cause I shot a
Western there last year.

1104
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:49,994
You're sure it's the real deal?

1105
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:50,952
A real

1106
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:52,676
Mayberry squad car.

1107
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:53,510
Yeah.

1108
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:55,510
- In Wilmington?
- Yeah.

1109
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:59,181
I'd love to see that.

1110
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,235
There's a national
treasure is what that'd be.

1111
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,386
(chuckling) Yeah.

1112
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:06,767
You guys wanna see it?

1113
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:07,683
See what?

1114
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,711
The squad car.

1115
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:09,934
Oh.

1116
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:10,957
Yeah, I'm in.

1117
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,877
All right listen, we can go tonight.

1118
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:14,781
Be back by the morning.

1119
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:16,057
What'd you say?

1120
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:17,057
Yeah, I'm in.

1121
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:17,890
What about you, Barney?

1122
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:19,219
Yeah, let's do it.

1123
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,053
All right, now we're talking.

1124
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,056
All right, listen.

1125
00:53:21,057 --> 00:53:22,028
I need you to go to my hotel,

1126
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,043
pick me up at 10:30, all right?

1127
00:53:23,044 --> 00:53:23,886
10:30, all right.

1128
00:53:23,887 --> 00:53:25,379
- Sounds good.
- Wait a minute, wait.

1129
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,797
I don't have a car.

1130
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:28,301
I rode here with Otis.

1131
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:29,714
We'll take my car.

1132

(Manhunt Theme music)

1133
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:39,114
[DJ] Good evening, friends.

1134
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,305
You're listening to the soothing sounds

1135
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:42,541
of Mount Pilot.

1136
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:44,919
[Floyd] Ooh, oh, turn
up the radio, Barney.

1137
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,331
I just love Leonard Blush.

1138
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:49,042
Can't this thing go any faster?

1139
00:53:49,043 --> 00:53:49,957
Faster?

1140
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,532
The speed limit's 65.

1141
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:53,399
Yeah but you are going 50.

1142
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,728
Well how would it look if a lawman

1143
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:56,717
got pulled over for speeding?

1144
00:53:56,718 --> 00:53:59,979
Besides, this here's a delicate machine.

1145
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,789
You treat her right, and
she'll treat you right.

1146
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,802
Yeah, she's a beauty.

1147
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:08,440
And it's delicate, delicate, yeah.

1148
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:10,839
She's just a replica.

1149
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,507
You wanna nip it, Floyd.

1150
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:20,480
You guys brought a
change of clothes, right?

1151
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,303
Of course.

♪ Everybody loves the spring ♪

1153
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:35,459
You know, Barney, the
other day, I got to thinking.

1154
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,097
How come Ernest T's name
is always Ernest T. Bass?

1155
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:43,265
It's never just Ernest Bass or Ernest.

1156
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,654
It's always Ernest T.

1157
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:50,761
I mean I know people
with names like Sally Mae

1158
00:54:50,762 --> 00:54:52,500
or Mary Anne.

1159
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,824
But I've never known
anybody with just a name

1160
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,406
and an initial.

1161
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:57,940
Well, you know what I think?

1162
00:54:57,941 --> 00:54:58,851
Yeah, what's that?

1163
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:03,483
What if Ernest T. Bass'
daddy's name was Ernest S. Bass?

1164
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:05,038
Hey, that's good.

1165
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,276
You got something there.

1166
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:10,443
So his granddaddy's name
would be Ernest R. Bass?

1167
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:13,706
And his great granddaddy's
name would be Ernest P.

1168
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:16,119
What are you guys talking about?

1169
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,811
Who cares?

1170
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:21,962
He's a character from a
TV show, he's not real!

1171
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,377
Family's real.

1172
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:29,211
What?

1173
00:55:29,212 --> 00:55:31,913
I said family is real.

1174
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:34,581
Floyd's right, family is real.

1175
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,419
This family.

1176
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:40,074
In fact, family is pretty
much all a man's got.

1177
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,158
He ain't much without it.

1178
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:48,751

(owl hoot)

1180
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,249
[Floyd] Well this is trespassing!

1181
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,800
[Chris] We're not stealing anything.

1182
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:08,075
[Floyd] I should be home in bed.

1183
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,326
[Chris] C'mon, let's go.

1184
00:56:35,246 --> 00:56:37,217
[Barney] Well, looks
like the coast is clear.

1185
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:38,218
Get down.

1186
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:42,237
Go back.

1187
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:12,401
(light airy music)

1188
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:16,794
Go on, take a look.

1189
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:34,819
I can't believe it.

1190
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:41,776
It's beautiful.

1191
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:46,295
[Chris] You wanna sit in it?

1192
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,383
Oh I don't think I
should, I can't do it.

1193
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:49,384
Could I?

1194
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,320
(music swelling)

1195
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,994
It's amazing.

1196
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,107
You think he would sell it?

1197
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:25,610
Oh no.

1198
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:27,128
No, the owner of the studio told me

1199
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,525
he's had a lot of offers over the years

1200
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:30,775
but he won't sell it.

1201
00:58:30,776 --> 00:58:32,990
This puppy's staying right
here with the studio.

1202
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:34,448
(clanging in distance)

1203
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:35,782
What was that?

1204
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:40,368
Was that the security officer?

1205
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:41,909
I don't think so.

1206
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:42,910
Follow me.

1207
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:54,137
(suspenseful music)

1208
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:01,232
- No, the green wire.
- Move your hand!

1209
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,313
- I was the one who graduated high school?
- Shut up!

1210
00:59:07,272 --> 00:59:10,481
Looks like those guys are
trying to steal that car.

1211
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:12,767
Well, we gotta call the police.

1212
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:14,342
What, are you crazy?

1213
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:17,039
You wanna get us arrested too?

1214
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,674
Well.

1215
00:59:18,675 --> 00:59:22,008
We can't just let them steal it, can we?

1216
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:28,541
Oh, no, no, no, those
are real crooks in there.

1217
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,927
I don't think we have
any other options, man.

1218
00:59:30,928 --> 00:59:32,248
We can't just walk away.

1219
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,582
Oh yes we can.

1220
00:59:34,891 --> 00:59:36,306
You got that one bullet, don't you?

1221
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:37,248
It's not real, Floyd.

1222
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:38,266
But they don't know that.

1223
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:40,063
Well they don't know I
only have the one either!

1224
00:59:40,064 --> 00:59:41,064
Shh, guys.

1225
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:45,386
Come on, you can do it, Barney.

1226
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:47,169
My name's Warren.

1227
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,546
(chuckling) His name's Warren.

1228
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:51,074
That's funny, isn't it?

1229
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:52,495
I don't get it.

1230
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,124
Well, you see on the show...

1231
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,650
And I don't care.

1232
00:59:56,938 --> 00:59:59,105
All right, listen, Warren.

1233
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,750
What would Barney do?

1234
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:07,459
(military drum rolling)

1235
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:09,659
There it is.

1236
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:11,895
There it is.

1237
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,063
Yeah, there you go Barney.

1238
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:17,319
We'll be right here.

1239
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,687
Now listen.

1240
01:00:18,688 --> 01:00:19,935
When you get into prison,

1241
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:22,381
I'm sorry, position,

1242
01:00:22,382 --> 01:00:25,040
I'll hit the lights, okay?

1243
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,426
You got this.

1244
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:27,391
Come on.

1245
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:28,293
Come on, you got it Barney.

1246
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:31,710
Little courage, little courage, Barney.

1247
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:38,174
(suspenseful music)

1248
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:44,994
[Thief] Oh yeah baby, come on, come on.

1249
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:02,134
(thieves chattering)

1250
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,727
Freeze!

1251
01:01:08,728 --> 01:01:09,728
Nobody move!

1252
01:01:11,142 --> 01:01:12,392
Out of the car.

1253
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,772
Out of the car, you on the
other side, come around.

1254
01:01:18,773 --> 01:01:19,793
Keep your hands in the air.

1255
01:01:19,794 --> 01:01:21,828
Keep your hands in the air!

1256
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:24,931
I thought you said
there was only one guard.

1257
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,730
[Warren] Hands in the air, buddy!

1258
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:31,643
I think our rent-a-cop
is a little jumpy.

1259
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:32,795
[Warren] Keep your hands in the air.

1260
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:34,264
Keep your hands in the air!

1261
01:01:34,265 --> 01:01:35,774
Are you gonna shoot us all?

1262
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,278
I don't think he's
gonna shoot us, Billy Ray.

1263
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:40,555
I think you're gonna put
that gun on the ground

1264
01:01:40,556 --> 01:01:43,139
and turn around real slow-like.

1265
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:45,944
You best listen.

1266
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:48,278
This isn't worth dying over.

All right boys, let me see your hands.

1270
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:53,747
Get'em up.

1271
01:01:53,748 --> 01:01:55,497
Come on, get'em up!

1272
01:01:58,235 --> 01:01:59,402
Not you, them.

1273
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,501
Hey, stop right there, stop right there!

1274
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,137
What is this?

1275
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,351
Back up.

1276
01:02:06,352 --> 01:02:08,513
There we go, Floyd, all right.

1277
01:02:08,514 --> 01:02:11,063
Hold it right there, slick.

1278
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:11,897
Nice job, Barn.

1279
01:02:11,897 --> 01:02:12,730
Thanks.

1280
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:13,814
Wait a minute.

1281
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:16,185
Aren't you Chris Stone?

1282
01:02:16,186 --> 01:02:18,936
(sirens wailing)

1283
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,230
Hands up!

1284
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:23,231
Nobody move!

1285
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:29,873
Nice job.

1286
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:31,713
Oh, thank you, thanks.

1287
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:32,909
Fortunately for you, your partner

1288
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,713
was able to get himself
free and give us a call.

1289
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:36,714
Partner?

1290
01:02:38,051 --> 01:02:39,910
Oh yeah, my partner.

1291
01:02:39,911 --> 01:02:42,492
Oh yeah, well, I knew I had to step it up

1292
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:44,593
and neutralize the situation.

1293
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,188
Besides, nobody gets a drop on old Barn

1294
01:02:47,189 --> 01:02:50,211
when I got this bad boy by my side.

1295
01:02:50,212 --> 01:02:52,950
You know, the number one thing to remember

1296
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:55,494
when fighting crime here in the big city

1297
01:02:55,495 --> 01:02:56,774
is to always be-

1298
01:02:56,775 --> 01:03:00,187
Hold on a second, hold on a second.

1299
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:03,149
(man on radio talking indistinctly)

1300
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,380
What do you mean the guy says

1301
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,488
he's the only security guard here?

1302
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:07,889
(man on radio talking indistinctly)

1303
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:13,740
(car revving)

1304
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:15,924
[All] Woohoo!

1305
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,473
Oh man! (Laughing)

1306
01:03:19,474 --> 01:03:20,311
Barney, you better slow down.

1307
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:23,128
This is a delicate machine, remember?

1308
01:03:23,129 --> 01:03:24,530
Yeah!

1309
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:26,429
Yeah, you don't wanna
get a speeding ticket.

1310
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,383
You wanna nip it, Floyd! Nip it!

1311
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:30,217
Nip it!

1312
01:03:30,218 --> 01:03:32,282
(Chris laughing)

1313
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:34,430
(upbeat banjo music)

1314
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:35,417
Woo!

1315
01:03:35,418 --> 01:03:36,961
Oh, man.

1316
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:37,811
Yeah.

1317
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:38,811
I think we made it.

1318
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:45,492
(light music)

1319
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:54,909
(cellphone ringing)

1320
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:03,202
Hello?

1321
01:04:04,605 --> 01:04:05,688
Oh, hey Doug.

1322
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,140
Wait, what time is it?

1323
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:17,160
Yeah, yeah, just give me five minutes.

1324
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:18,411
Be right there.

1325
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,131
Hey, stop slouching.

1326
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:30,899
I'm paying you by the hour here.

1327
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,441
You think Briscoe's gonna
help you, think again, pal.

1328
01:04:34,442 --> 01:04:35,593
Can I go now?

1329
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,113
No.

1330
01:04:37,114 --> 01:04:37,974
Do you mind?

1331
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:39,379
Just, all right.

1332
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,240
Say Mayberry!

1333
01:04:41,241 --> 01:04:43,118
[Fans] Mayberry.

1334
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,035
You ain't rubbing my head.

1335
01:04:46,036 --> 01:04:49,021
Hey, come back here, you little brat.

1336
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:51,281
All right, that's it.

1337
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:52,601
Watch this.

1338
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:54,921
And you, watch this.

1339
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:57,094
Maybe you guy'll learn something.

1340
01:04:57,095 --> 01:04:58,923
You know, film making, it's
not done in a vacuum, okay?

1341
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:01,774
I mean, you're on the same team here.

1342
01:05:01,775 --> 01:05:02,775
Come on.

1343
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,412
Where's your Mayberry spirit?

1344
01:05:06,413 --> 01:05:09,177
Now, let's have some fun.

1345
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:10,814
Hey folks!

1346
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:12,433
Come on in, how you doing?

1347
01:05:12,434 --> 01:05:14,195
Welcome to Mayberry Fest.

1348
01:05:14,196 --> 01:05:15,838
Which photo would you like me to sign?

1349
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,006
Oh, fantastic.

1350
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,198
Mom, I'm not saying it
has to be a big house.

1351
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,739
And please don't worry about the money.

1352
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,785
You know you're not gonna be happy

1353
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:27,521
in a senior living complex.

1354
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:32,449
Don't worry, I'll find you
the house of your dreams.

1355
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:35,232
Okay, I love you too.

1356
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:37,727
Bye, mom.

1357
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Hey, dad.

1358
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:10,422
Yeah, I know.

1359
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:15,633
I was filming a movie, and uh...

1360
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:19,421
(gentle music)

1361
01:06:21,058 --> 01:06:22,725
Yeah I'm still here.

1362
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:26,429
I uh...

1363
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,834
Guess where I am.

1364
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:34,168
I'm at Mayberry Fest.

1365
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,121
No, not as a fan.

1366
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:40,597
I'm actually representing you.

1367
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,773
Yeah, the people here are amazing.

1368
01:06:45,774 --> 01:06:47,719
Really kind, and,

1369
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,262
they want me to tell you hi, by the way.

1370
01:06:52,898 --> 01:06:53,898
Kate?

1371
01:06:57,298 --> 01:06:58,298
She's great.

1372
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:01,685
She's amazing, yeah.

1373
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:05,525
Yeah, I'll tell her.

1374
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:14,124
I gotta get going.

1375
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,125
Um...

1376
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:19,070
I just wanted you to know where I am.

1377
01:07:20,696 --> 01:07:25,220
And maybe I'll call you
when I get back to LA.

1378
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:26,304
I will, yeah.

1379
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,133
Okay.

1380
01:07:31,293 --> 01:07:32,293
Bye.

1381
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:50,549
[Greg] Man, how did you get those great

1382
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,698
drone shots in your film?

1383
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:52,973
Oh, I had a good friend
help me out with those.

1384
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:54,232
You're kidding, that's great.

1385
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:56,093
How long did it take
you to do your film?

1386
01:07:56,094 --> 01:07:57,038
Oh, forever.

1387
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,259
You know, you and I could be brothers.

1388
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,712
[Craig] Aw, don't make me howl.

1389
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:02,637
(filmmakers laughing)

1390
01:08:02,638 --> 01:08:04,055
Morning, Chris.

1391
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:06,262
- Hey.
- Hey.

1392
01:08:06,263 --> 01:08:07,118
Morning, Kate.

1393
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,213
[Kate] Do you have a second to talk?

1394
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:10,047
Absolutely.

1395
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,297
[Kate] Great.

1396
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:16,451
What's up?

1397
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:21,467
Well I wanted to
apologize for the other day.

1398
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:23,693
I shouldn't have been so short with you.

1399
01:08:23,694 --> 01:08:25,275
It wasn't very neighborly.

1400
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:27,427
It's totally okay.

1401
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:31,032
I shouldn't have been so
forward, that was my fault.

1402
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:32,755
Look, I know who you are.

1403
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:35,293
I looked you up when I
heard you were coming.

1404
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:39,044
I know you're a movie
star, a big movie star.

1405
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,014
Well I just wanted to apologize.

1406
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:43,635
No worries, okay?

1407
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:44,969
I had it coming.

1408
01:08:46,574 --> 01:08:49,016
Well thank you again for being here.

1409
01:08:49,017 --> 01:08:50,893
I know you're very busy.

1410
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:52,616
Nonsense.

1411
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:55,587
Anything, anything for dad.

1412
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:56,588
So...

1413
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,779
Well Mr. Stone, if
you're free around two,

1414
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,780
we can grab some coffee.

1415
01:09:04,977 --> 01:09:06,544
I'd love that.

1416
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:07,545
Great.

1417
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:10,022
Bye.

1418
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:11,022
See ya.

1419
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:17,823
- Hi.
- Hi.

1420
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:19,204
Craig, give him the elevator pitch.

1421
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:20,267
- Okay.
- Hey, picture this.

1422
01:09:20,268 --> 01:09:21,101
Yup?

1423
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:23,112
You're driving in the car
in the middle of the desert.

1424
01:09:23,113 --> 01:09:24,382
- Yeah.
- Middle of nowhere.

1425
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:26,299
And all of a sudden it breaks down.

1426
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,225
Okay.

1427
01:09:27,226 --> 01:09:28,504
And a beam of light comes down.

1428
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:29,725
Big beam, big beam.

1429
01:09:29,726 --> 01:09:30,649
Big beam.

1430
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:33,507
And, all of a sudden you look up

1431
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:35,757
and you see.
(music intensifying)

1432
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:38,168
Thank you so much for
the photos, Mr. Stone.

1433
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:39,264
Hey, it was my pleasure.

1434
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:41,145
And hey I'm pulling for you
in that promotion, Phil.

1435
01:09:41,146 --> 01:09:42,588
Thank you, Mr. Stone.

1436
01:09:42,589 --> 01:09:43,422
- All right.
- Thank you.

1437
01:09:43,423 --> 01:09:45,252
It's Chris, by the way.

1438
01:09:45,253 --> 01:09:46,086
And you're welcome.

1439
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:46,982
Thank you, bye.

1440
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,331
Bye.

1441
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:51,332
(cellphone ringing)

1442
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:54,880
Stanley!

1443
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:56,298
Talk to me, babe.

1444
01:09:58,342 --> 01:09:59,342
Oh.

1445
01:10:00,387 --> 01:10:01,720
Well, cancel it.

1446
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,719
I don't want it anymore.

1447
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:08,560
Yes, Stanley, I understand
how hard you worked

1448
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:09,693
to get this meeting for me

1449
01:10:09,694 --> 01:10:12,301
and I really appreciate it, seriously.

1450
01:10:12,302 --> 01:10:14,331
But, I don't know

1451
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:17,047
I think I'm gonna take some time off.

1452
01:10:17,048 --> 01:10:19,692
We can talk about it
when I get back to LA.

1453
01:10:20,742 --> 01:10:21,941
Okay.

1454
01:10:21,942 --> 01:10:24,692
Well, talk to you later, Stanley.

1455
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:31,254
Where is he now?

1456
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:34,127
Shane.

1457
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:37,795
(car alarm blaring in distance)

1458
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:41,069
Shane, where are you?

1459
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,737
Oh, hey Mr. Stone.

1460
01:10:43,966 --> 01:10:47,871
Um... I'm at, I'm not really sure.

1461
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:49,219
Hey Roger, where am I at again?

1462
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,129
Son, you're at Twin Bridges Golf Club.

1463
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:54,964
The finest gold club in
the state of North Carolina.

1464
01:10:54,965 --> 01:10:56,636
Oh yeah, I'm at Twin Bridges Golf Club,

1465
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:59,089
the finest-
- I don't care.

1466
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,846
Shane, let me ask you something.

1467
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:04,182
Do you like making minimum wage?

1468
01:11:04,183 --> 01:11:06,548
Then I think you should
get your butt back here.

1469
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:08,025
Right now.

1470
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:09,026
Okay.

1471
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:15,009
Uh... Gotta go, fellas.

1472
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,465
Well, you already have
the ball teed up, son,

1473
01:11:17,466 --> 01:11:19,347
you might as well hit it.

1474
01:11:19,348 --> 01:11:20,467
Oh.

1475
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:21,468
Okay.

1476
01:11:31,108 --> 01:11:32,558
(club whooshing)

1477
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:42,645
Oh, there it is.

1478
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:50,076
(Chris humming)

1479
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:55,740
Oh, Chris Stone. (Humming)

1480
01:12:03,217 --> 01:12:04,133
Hey.

1481
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,133
Hey.

1482
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:07,058
Am I late?

1483
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:08,256
No.

1484
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,157
No, not at all, I was early.

1485
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:12,410
They have really good coffee here.

1486
01:12:13,502 --> 01:12:15,365
I don't drink coffee.

1487
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:18,699
Oh, okay. (Chuckling)

1488
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:23,947
I really just wanted to
get to know you, and so.

1489
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:24,781
Oh sorry.

1490
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:25,751
Just a sec.

1491
01:12:25,752 --> 01:12:28,932
Terry needs to see you
at the office right now.

1492
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:29,933
Thank you.

1493
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,881
I'm so sorry, but I have
to go back to the office.

1494
01:12:35,882 --> 01:12:37,337
Oh.

1495
01:12:37,338 --> 01:12:38,338
Okay.

1496
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:42,499
But um, would you like to walk with me?

1497
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,417
We could take our time.

1498
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:52,657
I'm sorry, this festival is a
really big thing around here.

1499
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:53,944
Big isn't the word for it.

1500
01:12:53,945 --> 01:12:55,609
(Kate laughing)

1501
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,610
What?

1502
01:12:57,357 --> 01:12:59,353
Oh, nothing.

1503
01:12:59,354 --> 01:13:02,652
I'm sure this seems pretty silly to you.

1504
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:04,252
No.

1505
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:05,503
No, not at all.

1506
01:13:07,213 --> 01:13:09,501
(laughing) Okay.

1507
01:13:09,502 --> 01:13:10,835
Yes, I admit it.

1508
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,127
Yes at first this all seemed a little,

1509
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,378
a little nutty?

1510
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:19,111
But I think I get it now.

1511
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,514
I don't know what it is, but

1512
01:13:26,515 --> 01:13:28,515
I really like this town.

1513
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:32,418
Just must seem pretty boring

1514
01:13:32,419 --> 01:13:34,419
compared to Los Angeles.

1515
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:37,962
It has its charms.

1516
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:44,082
So, tell me.

1517
01:13:45,962 --> 01:13:48,212
Why isn't there a Mr. Kate?

1518
01:13:50,021 --> 01:13:51,438
Picky, I guess.

1519
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:56,836
Why isn't there a Mrs. Stone?

1520
01:14:01,301 --> 01:14:03,393
Picky, I guess.

1521
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,601
I have to go.

1522
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:13,602
Oh, okay.

1523
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:18,535
It was really nice
talking with you, Chris.

1524
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:20,889
Yeah, same here, same.

1525
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,826
I'll see you later.

1526
01:14:21,826 --> 01:14:22,826
Okay.

1527
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:28,064
(gentle piano music)

1528
01:14:35,128 --> 01:14:37,711
(parade music)

1529
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:41,569
(crowd cheering)

1530
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:56,770
Hi!

1531
01:14:57,479 --> 01:14:58,479
Hi!

1532
01:15:13,746 --> 01:15:16,496
(crowd cheering)

1533
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:42,337
(uplifting music)

1534
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,087
All right Stanley, I'll
talk to you when I get back.

1535
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:51,179
Mr. Stone.

1536
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,305
Judge.

1537
01:15:52,306 --> 01:15:54,706
Sure looks like sentencing
you to Mayberry Fest

1538
01:15:54,707 --> 01:15:56,803
has turned out great for all of us.

1539
01:15:56,804 --> 01:15:58,987
In the next two weeks you'll
get a document from the court

1540
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,564
that states you've
completed your probation.

1541
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:03,847
Judge, thank you.

1542
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:07,098
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

1543
01:16:09,996 --> 01:16:10,996
Probation?

1544
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:15,228
What did he mean probation?

1545
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:16,062
Well.

1546
01:16:16,063 --> 01:16:19,047
[Kate] You were forced to come here?

1547
01:16:19,048 --> 01:16:20,048
Yes.

1548
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:23,001
I can't believe it.

1549
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:25,026
How stupid am I?

1550
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:25,910
You don't understand.

1551
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:27,093
Oh no, I understand.

1552
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:29,207
You're a bigger phony
than I thought you were.

1553
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:32,205
Mayberry Fest is for
people who love this show.

1554
01:16:32,206 --> 01:16:33,621
- Kate, just-
- No.

1555
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,492
I don't even wanna know why
the judge sent you here.

1556
01:16:36,493 --> 01:16:37,485
Hopefully you got to see

1557
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:41,460
what real thoughtful people
look like, honest people.

1558
01:16:41,461 --> 01:16:44,544
Something you know very little about.

1559
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:47,276
What'd I miss?

1560
01:16:47,277 --> 01:16:48,716
Chris just got chewed out by Kate

1561
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:51,708
for lying about why he
was here at Mayberry Fest.

1562
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:52,709
Shazam!

1563
01:16:58,098 --> 01:17:00,765
So you didn't want to be here?

1564
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:08,684
I didn't want to at first, but,

1565
01:17:08,685 --> 01:17:09,518
What?

1566
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:11,363
I thought we were friends.

1567
01:17:11,364 --> 01:17:13,137
We are friends, Barney.

1568
01:17:13,138 --> 01:17:14,388
I mean, Warren.

1569
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:19,617
Look, yes, it's true,

1570
01:17:19,618 --> 01:17:21,868
I was sentenced to be here.

1571
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:25,318
But being here, it's
caused me to look at myself

1572
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:27,486
and others so differently.

1573
01:17:28,383 --> 01:17:29,553
I'm not the same man that I was

1574
01:17:29,554 --> 01:17:31,001
when I first got here.

1575
01:17:31,002 --> 01:17:35,322
Well, you are a touch
more neighborly. (Laughing)

1576
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:36,704
Yeah and he don't hold his finger up

1577
01:17:36,705 --> 01:17:39,313
when I'm trying to talk no more.

1578
01:17:39,314 --> 01:17:40,314
Well.

1579
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:42,552
Kate, she might,

1580
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:46,156
well she may hate me for life, but,

1581
01:17:46,157 --> 01:17:47,311
I just don't want you guys thinking

1582
01:17:47,312 --> 01:17:49,229
that we aren't friends.

1583
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:51,990
Because we are.

1584
01:17:51,991 --> 01:17:53,158
We're friends.

1585
01:17:54,533 --> 01:17:56,048
Oh well.

1586
01:17:56,049 --> 01:17:59,606
You know, it's like we always say.

1587
01:17:59,607 --> 01:18:02,314
Once you've been to Mayberry
Fest, you're family.

1588
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:04,351
Thanks, Floyd.

1589
01:18:04,352 --> 01:18:05,185
Allan.

1590
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:06,610
That's right.

1591
01:18:06,611 --> 01:18:08,991
You'll be at the talent
show tonight, right?

1592
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:10,410
No.

1593
01:18:10,411 --> 01:18:13,376
Unfortunately, sorry, I've
got something I gotta do.

1594
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:16,541
And then I gotta get on
my flight back to LA.

1595
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:17,542
Oh, man.

1596
01:18:18,386 --> 01:18:21,492
Well, I guess this is goodbye then.

1597
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,348
It's been great having you here with us

1598
01:18:23,349 --> 01:18:25,047
and we hope you'll come back next year.

1599
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:25,881
Oh, yeah.

1600
01:18:25,882 --> 01:18:27,161
We'd really love to have you.

1601
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:28,521
Thanks.

1602
01:18:28,522 --> 01:18:31,620
Well I now know why this
show's been so popular

1603
01:18:31,621 --> 01:18:34,075
for all these years.

1604
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,566
It's nice people like you.

1605
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:37,733
(Allan laughing)

1606
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:38,568
Somebody help me.

1607
01:18:38,569 --> 01:18:39,636
Where you going, toots?

1608
01:18:39,637 --> 01:18:40,913
Come back!

1609
01:18:40,914 --> 01:18:41,944
You're such a doll, doll.

1610
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:43,608
Wait, wait, wait!

1611
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:46,276
(Allan laughing)

1612
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:49,600
Thanks Doug, I appreciate it.

1613
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:50,705
You are very welcome

1614
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:53,679
and I'll be back at 4:30 to
pick you up for the airport.

1615
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,884
Perfect. Thank you.

1616
01:18:54,885 --> 01:18:56,856
You're welcome.

1617
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,357
(car revving)

1618
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:05,366
Hey, Stanley.

1619
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,246
Look, I'd like you to get a
hold of someone for me okay?

1620
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:10,347
You know, this Mayberry
Fest thing is wild.

1621
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:12,200
I did not know this was going on.

1622
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:14,610
I'm so excited that you
get to experience it with us.

1623
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:17,206
Just tell me that
Ernest T. Bass character

1624
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:18,749
isn't staying here.

1625
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,192
He is, is that gonna be a problem?

1626
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:25,272
Okay, you're gonna be in room 216.

1627
01:19:25,273 --> 01:19:26,536
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Bowden.

1628
01:19:26,537 --> 01:19:27,370
Thank you.

1629
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,634
Thanks Stanley.

1630
01:19:29,635 --> 01:19:30,791
Hi.

1631
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:33,330
Good afternoon, Mr. Stone.

1632
01:19:33,331 --> 01:19:34,827
Could I trouble you for some stationery

1633
01:19:34,828 --> 01:19:36,501
and an envelope?

1634
01:19:36,502 --> 01:19:37,502
Of course.

1635
01:19:39,971 --> 01:19:41,591
Here you go.

1636
01:19:41,592 --> 01:19:42,592
Thanks.

1637
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:48,375
Excuse me, Mr. Stone?

1638
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,482
Um... I was wondering.

1639
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:54,650
Can I have your autograph?

1640
01:19:56,512 --> 01:19:57,728
Of course you can.

1641
01:19:57,729 --> 01:19:58,729
It's okay.

1642
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:01,211
I've got it.

1643
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:02,549
What's your name?

1644
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,550
My name?

1645
01:20:05,804 --> 01:20:06,949
My name, uh...

1646
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:07,950
It's Jill.

1647
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:14,514
There you go, Jill.

1648
01:20:19,692 --> 01:20:22,025
Voice over: To the citizens of Mayberry.

1649
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:26,759
Thank you for showing
me the Mayberry spirit.

1650
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:34,229
(gentle piano music)

1651
01:20:37,655 --> 01:20:39,263
Voice over: Kate.

1652
01:20:41,286 --> 01:20:44,252
You have every right to be upset with me

1653
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,794
and I understand if
you'll never forgive me.

1654
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:49,867
And you'll make sure Kate gets this?

1655
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:51,222
Of course.

1656
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:52,983
Thanks, Doug, I appreciate everything.

1657
01:20:52,984 --> 01:20:54,667
You've been great.

1658
01:20:54,668 --> 01:20:55,918
Oh, by the way.

1659
01:20:56,908 --> 01:20:58,306
Take your car to this guy.

1660
01:20:58,307 --> 01:20:59,226
He'll fix your front seat.

1661
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:00,745
It's on me.

1662
01:21:00,746 --> 01:21:02,712
Wow, thanks, Mr. Stone!

1663
01:21:02,713 --> 01:21:04,245
It's Chris, by the way.

1664
01:21:04,246 --> 01:21:06,419
Oh, and don't let Shane sleep in.

1665
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,064
His flight leaves at 11.

1666
01:21:08,065 --> 01:21:08,943
Shane?

1667
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:11,020
Didn't he tell you?

1668
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:13,087
Tell me what?

1669
01:21:13,088 --> 01:21:15,571
(kooky music)

1670
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:23,517
[Floyd] Everybody step back!

1671
01:21:23,518 --> 01:21:24,351
Step back a little bit.

1672
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:25,268
Break it up now, break it up.

1673
01:21:25,269 --> 01:21:26,698
You heard the man, give him some room!

1674
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,532
Scooch, buddy, scooch!

1675
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,401
Well that's the car from the studio!

1676
01:21:32,402 --> 01:21:34,302
Yeah, it is!

1677
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:36,302
- It is.
- It looks like the real deal.

1678
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:38,386
[Man] This is exciting.

1679
01:21:41,046 --> 01:21:42,381
If this car is real,

1680
01:21:42,382 --> 01:21:44,140
Oh, Jim will know.

1681
01:21:44,141 --> 01:21:46,103
It's real.

1682
01:21:46,104 --> 01:21:47,576
It's real!

1683
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:52,577
(crowd cheering)
(uplifting music)

1684
01:21:56,562 --> 01:21:57,518
Hey hey!

1685
01:21:57,519 --> 01:22:01,345
Wait a minute, it's a note from Chris!

1686
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:05,667
It says, "To the citizens
of Mayberry Fest.

1687
01:22:05,668 --> 01:22:08,300
Please accept this gift for showing me

1688
01:22:08,301 --> 01:22:11,580
that there is a Mayberry in all of us."

1689
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:12,581
Aw.

1690
01:22:13,406 --> 01:22:15,676
- Yeah.
- All right.

1691
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:17,619
There's more, there's more.

1692
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:21,753
"PS, if you're ever in
Los Angeles, look me up."

1693
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:24,518
(everyone laughing)

1694
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:29,519
(crowd applauding)
(light music)

1695
01:22:33,757 --> 01:22:35,676
Now I know you got everything.

1696
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:38,657
But, for your birthday,
I got your favorite.

1697
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:40,630
Tallest peanut butter
and jelly sandwich ever.

1698
01:22:40,631 --> 01:22:41,636
Of course.

1699
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:43,245
If it's from you, I'm sure it's amazing.

1700
01:22:43,246 --> 01:22:44,080
It is.

1701
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:45,150
(cellphone ringing)

1702
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:46,403
Sorry.

1703
01:22:46,404 --> 01:22:47,404
It's mom.

1704
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:49,290

I hope you're having
a wonderful day, sweety.

1711
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:06,006
I love it.

1712
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:09,507
And you were right, this place is perfect.

1713
01:23:10,577 --> 01:23:12,278
Well I'm glad you like it.

1714
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,134

I love you too.

1716
01:23:15,556 --> 01:23:16,556
Bye.

1717
01:23:17,957 --> 01:23:19,529
I moved her in two months ago

1718
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,334
and she still thanks me
like it was yesterday.

1719
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:22,409

1720
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:24,715
(cellphone ringing)

1721
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:27,398
Sorry, it's front gate.

1722
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:29,058
Floyd?

1723
01:23:29,059 --> 01:23:30,134
Hey.

1724
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,515
I mean, sorry, Allan.

1725
01:23:31,516 --> 01:23:32,553
Hey.

1726
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:35,400
You said if I was ever
in LA, come look you up.

1727
01:23:35,401 --> 01:23:37,714
Yeah, I absolutely did.

1728
01:23:37,715 --> 01:23:38,736
Let me open the front gate for you

1729
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:39,570
and come on up to the house.

1730
01:23:39,571 --> 01:23:41,012
The door will be open.

1731
01:23:41,013 --> 01:23:43,125
It's a guy I met at Mayberry Fest.

1732
01:23:43,126 --> 01:23:44,371
And he came to see you?

1733
01:23:44,372 --> 01:23:45,993
Very funny.

1734
01:23:45,994 --> 01:23:47,994
Did he loan you money?

1735
01:23:52,053 --> 01:23:53,776
He's actually a Floyd tribute artist.

1736
01:23:53,777 --> 01:23:55,058
He's pretty good too.

1737
01:23:55,059 --> 01:23:57,195
I was actually serious
about the money question.

1738
01:23:57,196 --> 01:23:58,859
Of course you were.

1739
01:23:58,860 --> 01:23:59,791
Allan, hey!

1740
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,624
Hey!

1741
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:01,490
Great to see you, buddy.

1742
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:02,323
Great to see you.

1743
01:24:02,324 --> 01:24:03,600
This is my brother Larry.

1744
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:04,604
[Larry] Allan, pleasure to meet you.

1745
01:24:04,605 --> 01:24:05,913
Nice to meet you too.

1746
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:07,324
Wow.

1747
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:08,783
Nice place you got here.

1748
01:24:08,784 --> 01:24:10,444
Oh, thanks.

1749
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,364
I'm actually thinking
about selling the place.

1750
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:13,580
Too small, I guess.

1751
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,825
(all laughing)

1752
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:17,689
Hey, I've got a surprise for you.

1753
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,027
[Chris] Okay.

1754
01:24:19,028 --> 01:24:20,617
Hey, you old son of a gun!

1755
01:24:20,618 --> 01:24:21,565
[Chris] Warren?

1756
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:22,741
This is quite a treat.

1757
01:24:22,742 --> 01:24:23,876
Man, it's great to see you.

1758
01:24:23,877 --> 01:24:24,710
Good to see you, bud.

1759
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:25,543
[Chris] This is my brother Larry.

1760
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:26,536
Larry, nice to meet you.

1761
01:24:26,537 --> 01:24:28,465
Warren, it's a pleasure.

1762
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:30,643
So what brings you two nuts to LA?

1763
01:24:30,644 --> 01:24:32,406
Every couple of years a
bunch of us come up here

1764
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:34,924
to California and do
all the Mayberry stuff.

1765
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:36,865
Yeah we go up to
Franklin Canyon Reservoir

1766
01:24:36,866 --> 01:24:38,348
where they filmed the opening credits.

1767
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:41,016
We go out to the old 40 Acres back lot

1768
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:43,090
where you know, it's all Mayberry stuff.

1769
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:44,567
I'm really excited you guys stopped by,

1770
01:24:44,568 --> 01:24:45,831
this is awesome.

1771
01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:47,008
Thanks.

1772
01:24:47,009 --> 01:24:49,013
Hey, I'm sorry about your dad.

1773
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:53,208
Walter was a great guy
and he's really missed.

1774
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:54,909
Thank you.

1775
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,930
Yeah, the last three
months we had with him

1776
01:24:56,931 --> 01:24:58,168
were really great.

1777
01:24:58,169 --> 01:24:59,419
I needed those.

1778
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:02,712
And I've been autographing
more of my dad's photos

1779
01:25:02,713 --> 01:25:04,232
than my own since he passed.

1780
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:06,530
Well, we're not interrupting
anything then, are we?

1781
01:25:06,531 --> 01:25:07,704
No, not at all, seriously.

1782
01:25:07,705 --> 01:25:09,410
Oh great, 'cause first off,

1783
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:11,787
I want to say thanks for
getting us that squad car, man.

1784
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:12,621
It is sweet!

1785
01:25:12,622 --> 01:25:14,034
- You're welcome, man.
- Yeah, it's great.

1786
01:25:14,035 --> 01:25:15,707
How did you get the guy from the studio

1787
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:16,705
to sell it to you?

1788
01:25:16,706 --> 01:25:19,832
You said he wouldn't sell
it, it had to stay there.

1789
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:21,149
We made a deal.

1790
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,650
[Warren] A deal?

1791
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:25,490
I bought the studio.

1792
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:26,737
- What, are you kidding?
- You're kidding.

1793
01:25:26,738 --> 01:25:27,571
[Chris] No!

1794
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:28,691
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

1795
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:30,894
Hey, we've got a surprise for you.

1796
01:25:30,895 --> 01:25:31,728
- Here.
- Okay.

1797
01:25:31,728 --> 01:25:32,561
It's out front.

1798
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:34,249
Come on, come on out.

1799
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,055
You bought another studio?

1800
01:25:36,056 --> 01:25:36,889
Yeah.

1801
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:38,794
[Allan] He bought a whole studio.
