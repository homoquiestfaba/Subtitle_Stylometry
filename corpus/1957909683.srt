And I brought myself my coffee.

13
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,413
Saying I should
stay up in the books

14
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,882
and not start to
build a buzz but they

15
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,517
the ones bugging, yeah.

16
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,352
So I don't really
feel like staying.

17
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,787
I don't really
feel like playing.

18
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,923
Quit fucking with the plans,
a couple of young kids.

19
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,390
I'm very hot.

20
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,893
Stacking money on a
one way trip, yeah.

21
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,563
Whoa.

22
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,797
OK.

23
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,166
We're almost at
2,000 which is crazy.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,168
And once we hit
it, Madison and I

25
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,170
are going to get blackout
drunk again on camera

26
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:21,441
like we did for 1,000 but
no vodka shots this time.

27
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,579
We're going to stick to the
rosé all day, every day.

28
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,547
So yeah, that is it.

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,320
Hi, guys.

30
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,722
Welcome back.

31
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,258
So today, we are going
to be going on our river.

32
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,662
Well, yeah, it's not
our river, but we're

33
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,864
going to go on to our
annual river trip.

34
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,600
And I am super,
super, super excited.

35
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,736
But I also, I don't
know, feeling a little--

36
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,306
Yeah, I don't know.

37
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,376
I guess it's going to be
different and a little weird

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,446
this year without--

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,282
OK, well, I'll show you.

40
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,821
So this is 100% going to
be the strangest unboxing

41
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,556
video that I've ever done.

42
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:18,265
And yeah, so Chuy actually made
it just in time for the trip.

43
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,440
And we have his urn--

44
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,324
Yeah, there's a little
note from his mom here, so.

45
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,266
Yo, you ready?

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,669
You scare the shit out of me.

47
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,407
What is this?

48
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,945
Chuy.

49
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,781
What's up, bro?

50
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,949
Hey, was that recording?

51
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,417
Are you still doing
this vlog shit?

52
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,485
Come on.

53
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,855
You only ever get one view.

54
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:14,989
Come on, we got stuff to do.

55
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:15,757
Let's go.

56
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,691
Let's get going.

57
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:19,827
Love you.

58
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,333
You guys all know that we
got like at least 100 views

59
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,635
on the last video.

60
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:31,739
So yeah, little,
little Jackson doesn't

61
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,609
know because he actually
barely watches these.

62
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,677
But we love him, right?

63
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,348
Yeah, we do.

64
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,315
He's lucky he's cute.

65
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,518
Oh, here stand like that.

66
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,351
Hop to the river.

67
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,920
Hop to the river.

68
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,658
Girl, I
love your extensions.

69
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,893
Thanks.

70
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,561
I love your sweet
little face, Maddie.

71
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,597
We should totally do a tutorial
on why you put those in.

72
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:57,799
I bet that would crush.

73
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,834
Come on, guys.

74
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,434
Let's go.

75
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,637
Nice to see you too, Dee.

76
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,942
This is going to be.

77
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,979
All right, ladies, next
stop, Monte Rio, T-minus,

78
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,380
hella hours.

79
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,749
I hope everybody
went to the bathroom,

80
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,918
too, because I'm not
changing that black water.

81
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,119

I don't know.

95
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:05,533
I just think it won't be the
same this year without Chuy.

96
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,101
I mean, he died on the river.

97
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,803
Should we really be
going back there?

98
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,905
Dee, chip, Chuy, OD'd.

99
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,573
He didn't die
because of the river.

100
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,709
And plus, he would have
wanted us to do this, anyway.

101
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,409
100%.

102
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,479
I mean, he loved this
trip more than anyone.

103
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,048
Remember, when he
brought that slingshot

104
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:24,185
and he was launching beers at
people as this..

105
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,854
Man, classic Chuy.

106
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,155
Totally.

107
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,191
So why wouldn't he want
us to keep it going.

108
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,759
I'm just saying
he should be here.

109
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,664
Well, here he is.

110
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,869
Chuy, going to miss
you there, bro.

111
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,104
There's two extra cases.

112
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,705
Natty ice are going
to miss him, too.

113
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,707
Those few extra bumps, too.

114
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,643
Hey, guys, chill.

115
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,511
We all party a
little bit too hard.

116
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,647
It's not Chuy's fault
he had a problem.

117
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,649
It's a disease.

118
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,918
Mental illness, self medication.

119
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,487
OK, Dr. Phil, how many credits
did JC have again, like five?

120
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:04,025
More than you, Mr.
Welcome to speedy change.

121
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,726
Here we go back in
I'm the one person

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,494
in this car who has a job.

123
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,730
All right, guys, let's see if
you're talking to that trash

124
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,166
when I go by the
alcohol, all right?

125
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,237
By the way, are we buying
stuff for Blake and Zola?

126
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,672
Hell no.

127
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,906
Blake is on his own.

128
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,841
Why the fuck is Zola
bring him anyway?

129
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,510
They're supposed
to be broken up.

130
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,844
Baby-mama drama.

131
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,547
Yeah, mommy and daddy can be YO.

132
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,549
Still can't believe
they have a kid.

133
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,718
Wonder who's going to watch
it while they're gone.

134
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,153
Not in it, Dee.

135
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,055
You make Thea sound like
they're a dog or something.

136
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:34,989
Just ew.

137
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,590
They totally have a kid.

138
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,993
Yeah, I don't know, it
makes me feel like old.

139
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,227
Blake is old.

140
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,630
He's like 26.

141
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,131
Blake's hot, though.

142
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,633
Totes.

143
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,767
Too bad he's a douche.

144
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,702
Hey.

145
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:48,235
Blake's my boy.

146
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,136
I like him.

147
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,104
No, it's true, Jackson.

148
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,739
Blake's kind of a douche.

149
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:52,940
He's certainly not you.

150
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,680
Ew, get a room.

151
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,667
All right, guys.

152
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,569
We made it.

153
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,203
Oh.

154
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,204
Don't even.

155
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:24,071
OK.

156
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,073
Hurry up, let's go.

157
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,176
We are.

158
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,810
Auntie Kali.

159
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,084
Hey, guys.

160
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:37,685
Zola.

161
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,085
Hey.

162
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,919
Hey.

163
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,554
You brought Thea.

164
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,557
Yeah, my mom's on some
self-determination bullshit,

165
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,159
says if I want to
have some fun, then

166
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,897
I'm going to have to take on my
own responsibility or whatever.

167
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,699
Hey, Dee.

168
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,234
Hey.

169
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,703
Yo, ladies, y'all going to
help me with the shit or what?

170
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,817
Allow me, miss.

171
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,720
Thank you dear, sir.

172
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,855
Yeah, real fucking
chivalrous assholes.

173
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,895
Kali, is it 2,000 yet?

174
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,631
Not yet but when I do, we're
going to get fucked up.

175
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,601
Mad, I'm filming.

176
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,836
Is that OK?

177
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,071
Yeah, you should see my Tinder.

178
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,372
This is nothing.

179
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,206
No, it's all good.

180
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,040
I'll turn it off.

181
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:39,380
Speaking of 2,000, you
subscribed, right Dee?

182
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,716
I-- I haven't gotten to it yet.

183
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,617
What?

184
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,152
Dee, are you serious?

185
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,221
I'm busy studying for my LSATs.

186
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,689
School has been super busy.

187
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,924
Yeah, it's all good.

188
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,058
I know you have your
own shit going on.

189
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,327
No, Dee that's fucked up.

190
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,763
Kali's really trying to make
something of herself here.

191
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,266
She's putting herself out there,
and she's actually really good.

192
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,669
I'm not saying that you need
to help her with her vids

193
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,937
like I do.

194
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,006
But you could at the
least be supportive.

195
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,308
I am supportive.

196
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,778
Does that mean I have
to watch her videos?

197
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,181
I mean, I feel like that's a
pretty good way to support her.

198
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,884
No, I can be supportive
by not doing that--

199
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,852
Like how?

200
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:18,419
By just being her friend.

201
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,186
In what way or--

202
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,057
Mad, it's OK,

203
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,060
We're best friends, Dee.

204
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,928
Why would I need
you to subscribe?

205
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,330
It's all good, Kali.

206
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:33,167
You are just one viral bit
away from being a star.

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,901
I just know it.

208
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,669
Thanks, babe.

209
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,038
Why do you even care, Madison?

210
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,674
It's not going to be
you who's Insta famous.

211
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,676
I'm not allowed to
want to help my friend?

212
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,677
Yeah, sure.

213
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,879
You can do that.

214
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:45,880
I just don't see
what's in it for you.

215
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,082
You're fucked for that, Dee.

216
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,017
I just want to see Kali succeed.

217
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,188
Not everyone is just
out for themselves.

218
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,023
And what's that
supposed to mean?

219
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:56,790
Nothing.

220
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:57,925
I'm just saying.

221
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,326
Oh, really?

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,327
I feel like you have more
to say to add to that.

223
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:01,328
Hey.

224
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,963
OK.

225
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:06,967
Let's all just relax and
get back to the real world.

226
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:07,401
OK?

227
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,445
You're so annoying.

228
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,381
Let's get drunk.

229
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,216
Never.

230
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,484

Let's go, come on.

You suck.

00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,775
Oh, my God.

260
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,810
Come on.

00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,111
You suck at this game, Blake.

262
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:24,812
I swear to god.

263
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:25,312
Zola.

00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,749
Who the hell knocks like that?

265
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:40,995
What's up, bro?

266
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:41,929
We're being too loud?

267
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:50,104
I just came to tell you
to watch out if you're

268
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,339
planning on floating the river.

269
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,074
Yeah, we're floating.

270
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,877
I wouldn't if I were you.

271
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,346
We do it every year.

272
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,849
This year is different.

273
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:06,287
The river has been taking
people, certain people.

274
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,221
Like who?

275
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,156
Like your friend.

276
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,091
Chuy?

277
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,294
I don't know his name.

278
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,862
He seemed like a nice kid.

279
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,834
Come back next year.

280
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,870
How about you come back
when you get your fucking

281
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:23,904
shirt clean, buddy?

282
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,573
I'm warning you.

283
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:29,176
Do not float the river.

284
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,244
Whatever, old man.

285
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,179
Just get the fuck out of here.

286
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,282
You fucking believe this guy?

287
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,016
Hello?

288
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:47,461
Hello?

289
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,037
Whatever, we'll
just shut the door.

290
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:57,539
All right.

291
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:58,238
All right.

292
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,488
Don't y'all float
this river, you hear?

293
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:19,661
Let's get drunk.

294
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,028
I can't.

295
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,031
Like what the fuck?

296
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,568
You'd have something.

297
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,502
You'd have something.

298
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,135
All right.

299
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,036
Now--

300
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,903
You got to go for it.

301
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,238
Yes, now I'll drink.

302
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,574
All of it, all of it,
all of it, all of it.

303
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:33,941
I'm going to splash you
if you don't chug it.

304
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:34,975
I drink it, OK?

305
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:35,643
Here.

306
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:36,578
I'll take the rest.

307
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,277
Ow.

308
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,416
I thought something bit me.

309
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,586
You suck.

310
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,653
Oh, man.

311
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,188
That dude was wilding.

312
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,356
He's a fucking bitch.

313
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,460
Well, look, what if--
what if he's right?

314
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,397
Like what if the
river took Chuy?

315
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,435
What does that even mean, Dee?

316
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,138
Chuy OD'd and fell
into the river.

317
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,673
The river was just there.

318
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,975
It didn't take shit.

319
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:08,942
I guess.

320
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,043
I don't know.

321
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,679
Why would he just say that?

322
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,715
Because he's a fucking
tweak or some shit.

323
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,482
I don't know.

324
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:19,319
Look, OK, the river
has no current.

325
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,689
It's like two feet deep.

326
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:23,357
The only thing
dangerous on this river

327
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,292
is that, to be honest with you.

328
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,196
Yeah, probably.

329
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,065
Fuck, now, I'm scared of him.

330
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,200
You know, I'll protect you.

331
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,208

So are you back with Zola?

354
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:58,553
Physically here, yes but
not like psychologically.

355
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:02,089
I mean I'm just
with her for Thea.

356

00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:14,067
'cause there's a
lot you don't know.

361
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,538
Only keep family
beside me 'cause all

362
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,205
of you folk never liked me.

363
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,574
Blake.

364
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,542
Yeah?

365
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:22,309
You have a kid.

366
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,112
I'm so not into that, OK?

367
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,681
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,650
I'm going to law school.

369
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:33,021
I got to handle my
business as do you, sir.

370
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,259
Oh, come on, Dee.

371
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,460
You know we were always
meant to be together.

372
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,261
Just one more kiss, come on.

373
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:41,696
No.

374
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:42,564
Come on.

375
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:43,731
Just one more kiss.

376
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:47,702
Besides-- just
doesn't feel right.

377
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,839
I mean, Chuy died in there.

378
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,517
Where are you going?

379
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,723
Don't get too close 'cause
there's a lot you don't know.

380
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:26,541
Zola, I--

381
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,408
Dee, shut the fuck up.

382
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,177
I saw you guys out there.

383
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,679
Nothing happens.

384
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,146
Literally it's exactly what
I predicted what happened.

385
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,147
I don't have time for this.

386
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,550
Well, congrats.

387
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,450
You're getting exactly
what you want ever since--

388
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,184
Nothing happened.

389
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,385
High school.

390
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,219
You need to-- please,
Zola, I don't--

391
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:39,787
Don't touched me.

392
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:40,521
Even though--

393
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:41,388
I've done--

394
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:41,889
Fuck you too, Blake.

395
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:42,790
Fuck you.

396
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,559
I saw you all out there.

397
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,392
What?

398
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,293
Nothing happened.

399
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,562
Just chill the fuck out.

400
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,466
Fuck.

401
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,300
Great.

402
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:53,935
Look what you did.

403
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:54,769
Now, she's awake.

404
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,737
Shut the fuck up.

405
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,638
I'm not dealing with that.

406
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,839
You go deal with that.

407
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:58,506
Why the fuck would
I deal with that?

408
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,374
Mom?

409
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,408
Fuck.

410
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,275
See, she's even calling for you.

411
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,176
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,211
Just go get her blanket.

413
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:04,779
She's fucking calling for you.

414
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,894
Why are they still together?

415
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,963
Oh, my god, shots?

416
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,798
Yes, please.

417
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,967
Kali?

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,737
I think Jacks and I are going
to retire for the evening.

419
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:30,638
Ooh.

420
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,405
If you catch my drift.

421
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,740
What was-- ew.

422
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:34,676
So nasty.

423
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,611
I'm not talking about boning.

424
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,278
OK, OK, we get it.

425
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:38,913
Thanks.

426
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,347
No, it's fine.

427
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,415
Me and Dee are just
going to be having

428
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,750
a threesome with Jose Cuervo.

429
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,218
Or maybe that old
creepy groundskeeper guy

430
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:45,887
is still out there.

431
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,988
You could call him.

432
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:47,989
No,

433
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,356
That dude was way too sober.

434
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,292
I might be a little
bit too drunk.

435
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,262
Cheers for you.

436
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,531
Look at my boyfriend, everyone.

437
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,431
Isn't he cute?

438
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,413
Yo, Kali, turn that shit off.

439
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,674
So you guys, things got a
little bit messy last night

440
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,542
to say the least.

441
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,410
But that's OK.

442
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,012
Today is going to be wild.

443
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:46,781
I mean, I don't know
if it's actually

444
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:51,519
going to be wild because it
hasn't happened yet but yeah.

445
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,855
I think it's going to be crazy.

446
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:58,492
So keep on watching or don't.

447
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:02,630
I don't really care,
except I do actually care.

448
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:09,637
So please like and subscribe and
let me finish my make up here.

449
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,076
Guys, we should get going.

450
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,410
It's almost noon.

451
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,913
So?

452
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,315
So it'll be dark by
the time we get done.

453
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,618
Oh, shit, bro.

454
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:25,653
We got to drop the RV
at the parking lot.

455
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:26,721
All right, let's go.

456
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:27,487
I'll come with.

457
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,528
Is she really going to come?

458
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,029
She's not a dog, Dee.

459
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,364
I can't just leave her in
the bathroom for five hours.

460
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,487
Oh, shit, dude.

461
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,355
I thought I told you
not to float the river.

462
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,691
Yeah.

463
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,692
And I thought we told
you to fuck off, bro.

464
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,593
Blake, get back in the car.

465
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,828
Yo, what's up, old man?

466
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,629
We're going to have
a fucking problem?

467
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,866
You're going to have a problem
if you float the river just

468
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,634
like your friend Chuy.

469
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:14,936
Hey, get our friend's name out
of your fucking mouth, bro.

470
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:15,970
You know shit about him.

471
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,505
You think you know how he died?

472
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:18,606
Jackson, this is fucked.

473
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:19,774
Get back in the car.

474
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:21,509
You think he overdosed?

475
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:25,012
Man, shut the fuck up, you
potbellied sister fucking hick.

476
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:28,381
Go back to your trailer and
eat some fucking pork rinds

477
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,852
before I whoop your fucking
ass, you understand me?

478
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,587
I'll fucking knock
you off the concrete.

479
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,958
It's not my problem then.

480
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,467
Yeah.

481
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,403
Well, leave us the fuck alone or
we'll be your fucking problem.

482
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,438
Fuck out of here.

483
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,573
What the fuck, Blake?

484
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,140
Hey, babe.

485
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:53,841
Chill, chill.

486
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,843
We got this.

487
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:59,714
Let's go get some fucking tacos.

488
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:00,781
What's up, brother?

489
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,116
What can I get for you?

490
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,852
I'll have three
carne asada, please.

491
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,520
Actually, we're all vegan.

492
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:07,521
OK.

493
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,856
We'll just get some chicken.

494
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,824
Yeah, three chicken.

495
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:11,092
Yeah, please.

496
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,160
So you guys, this creepy
groundskeeper dude

497
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,997
is actually trying
to kill us like irl.

498
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,866
Yo, that dude is a fick.

499
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,167
Straight up, bro.

500
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,938
That dude's a fucking
100% dumbass, right?

501
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:24,972
I don't know.

502
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,473
Maybe the creepy dude is right.

503
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:30,711
Like maybe it's a
sign or an omen.

504
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:32,179
What do you mean an omen?

505
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:36,050
Like maybe this isn't the
year to float the river

506
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,219
with Chuy and all.

507
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,487
I mean he obviously
knows the family.

508
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,489
Plus, I feel like I'm
at barf from last night.

509
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:44,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, not in the hellcat.

510
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,760
Are you fucking kidding me?

511
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,529
You can barf from
the fucking river.

512
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:52,066
Yo, are you filming this, too?

513
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,567
I don't know why.

514
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,569
I mean you do the same
shit as Bell Benton.

515
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,672
And she's got like
400k followers,

516
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,806
plus her titties are bigger.

517
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,473
Bro, no, yo, stop.

518
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,542
Yo, I'm just kidding, man.

519
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:01,976
Chill.

520
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:05,913
No.

521
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:06,547
Thea.

522
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,480
No.

523
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,083
Thea, stop.

524
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:09,784
All right.

525
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:10,551
fine.

526
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,552
Thea, it's fine.

527
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,620
It's fine, OK?

528
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:13,187
Come here.

529
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,888
Come here.

530
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:14,789
It's fine.

531
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,090
Yo, what the fuck, Zola?

532
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,825
I leave for five minutes
and she falls apart.

533
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,093
Can't you control your daughter?

534
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,962
You were gone for
30 minutes, asshole.

535
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,897
And she didn't get that
much sleep last night.

536
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,497
That's why she's breaking down.

537
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,233
All right, you know what,
you guys just go ahead.

538
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,902
We're going to go up
and watch a movie, OK?

539
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:28,803
No, no.

540
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:29,737
Thea's got to man up.

541
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,237
What?

542
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:31,605
Come here.

543
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,573
Here, put this life
jacket on, here.

544
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,240
She doesn't want to go.

545
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:33,874
Come on.

546
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:34,709
Come on.

547
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,243
Yo, where's Chuy?

548
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:37,011
Oh, shit.

549
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:37,812
I'll get him.

550
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,787
Keeping you safe here.

551
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,796
Cheers to the boy.

552
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,964

Something is grabbing
my fucking leg.

577
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,220
Fuck you.

578
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,088
You're such a fucking dick.

579
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,059
Jackson, I can't
believe I missed that.

580
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:59,760
That stuff's killing unreal.

581
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,662
You got to be quicker
than that, babe.

582
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:06,000
You know, they caught an 8-foot
sturgeon around here last year.

583
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,134
Gross.

584
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,602
Is it going to eat us?

585
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,303
No, bud.

586
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,938
We're going to eat it.

587
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,674
No one told me that there's
creatures in this water.

588
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,709
Oh, don't worry, they're
more afraid of you

589
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,711
than you are of them.

590
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,147
Am I supposed to be offended?

591
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:23,217
Yeah, low key.

592
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,320
I wonder if there are
monsters in this river, too.

593
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:27,655
No, sweetie.

594
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:28,856
There's no such
thing as monsters.

595
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,214
You're right.

596
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,916
I'm always right.

597
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,951
Yeah, this is nice.

598
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:04,859
I do miss Chuy, though.

599
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,695
Yeah, I do, too.

600
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:10,931
I just wish there was more that
we could have done for him.

601
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,167
You were a good friend to him.

602
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,937
He was lucky to have someone
like you in his life.

603
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,673
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

604
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,242
There's something on my leg.

605
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,309
Ew, get it off,

606
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:23,210
Zola, here.

607
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:24,211
Get it off.

608
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:30,818
I'll get these off.

609
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,457
Ew.

610
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,761
I thought this was supposed
to be more scared of me.

611
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:42,897
I guess you might
have sweet blood.

612
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:51,238
Yo, where's Thea?

613
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,139
What?

614
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:52,973
What do you mean what?

615
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,341
I gave her to you.

616
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,110
I swear she was just right here.

617
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:57,845
Are you fucking kidding me?

618
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:58,279
Thea?

619
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:12,293
Thea!

620
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:12,927
Thea!

621
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,764
Thea!

622
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,332
Thea!

623
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,301
I swear to God, when we find
her, I'm taking her from you.

624
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,835
You can't fucking control her.

625
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,404
It's not good for her,
and it's not safe.

626
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,072
What do you think I've
been doing by myself

627
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,373
for the past five years?

628
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:29,176
Well, it's a miracle
she's gotten this far.

629
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,010
Oh, my god.

630
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:30,512
Oh, my god, Blake.

631
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:31,779
I see her.

632
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:32,346
I see her.

633
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,283
Oh, my god.

634
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:37,051
Oh, my god.

635
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:12,353
Man, Dee, she's so jelly of
you, she forgot her own kid.

636
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,055
Seriously, I don't know
why they're still together.

637
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,424
I can't believe Dee had leeches.

638
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,492
Ew.

639
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,928
I totally had leeches.

640
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,129
Sounds like an STI.

641
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,098
Ew.

642
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,866
Oh, baby.

643
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:26,568
Wait.

644
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,468
Do you have a condom?

645
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:29,169
I have leeches.

646
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:29,903
That's hot.

647
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:30,337
Ew.

648
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,383
Blake?

649
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,017
Hello?

650
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:48,322
Thea?

651
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:49,890
Thea?

652
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,925
Blake?

653
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,359
Blake?

654
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,397
Zola.

655
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,031
Blake?

656
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,564
It was supposed to
be a friend weekend.

657
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,065
I can't believe
they brought her.

658
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,066
Madison.

659
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,035
Yeah, I hope they find Thea.

660
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,204
Should've just duck gone
down the river or something.

661
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:37,871
I don't know.

662
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,180
Blake, Blake, Blake.

663
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:47,114
Zola, stop.

664
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,449
Relax, relax, relax.

665
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,450
I saw-- I saw--

666
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:50,585
Zola, Zola, relax.

667
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:51,619
Where's Thea?

668
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:54,021
Oh, my god.

669
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:54,922
What?

670
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,156
You don't have her?

671
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,257
What the fuck, Zola?

672
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,527
What are you doing here?

673
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,229
They killed Blake.

674
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:03,997
What do you mean
they killed Blake?

675
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

676
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,569
There's something
in those woods.

677
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,206
That's OK.

678
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,440
I'll go find her.

679
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:14,576
That thirsty?

680
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,943
Madison, someone just died.

681
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:16,977
Bullshit.

682
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,212
You really believe this bitch?

683
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,113
Look at her.

684
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:19,947
She's fucking hammered.

685
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,519
Are you sure?

686
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,153
Yeah, no problem.

687
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,020
I'll go with her.

688
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:27,689
It's fine.

689
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,423
Jackson, I'm scared.

690
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:30,491
Can you stay here with us?

691
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:31,358
Maybe Maddie can go.

692
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:32,292
Fuck that.

693
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,427
It's OK, guys.

694
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,229
I'll go see if I can find Thea.

695
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:36,930
Hey, we're not that
far from the cabin.

696
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:41,969
If I find her,
we'll just go there.

697
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,405
What if Blake actually
did get killed?

698
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:45,439
No, I'm with Maddie.

699
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:48,075
There's no way Blake is dead.

700
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,276
I love you.

701
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,310
Shut up, Kali.

702
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:51,478
See you in like five minutes.

703
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,194
Hi, guys.

704
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,563
So things have kind
of gone downhill

705
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:10,698
since last time we chatted.

706
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:12,399
We lost Thea.

707
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,503
And Zola is convinced that
something happened to Blake.

708
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:17,237
I don't know.

709
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,139
Do you think that something
actually happened to Blake?

710
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:20,974
Maybe it was that creepy
groundskeeper dude

711
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:22,510
from this morning.

712
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:23,477
But yeah, I don't know.

713
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:26,581
She's like catatonic.

714
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:28,449
And I'm going to
be live streaming

715
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:32,052
all day so be sure
to like, share--

716
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:39,059
Jackson, read the room,
the girl's in shock.

717
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,329
Jackson's right here.

718
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,096
Zola?

719
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,531
Zola?

720
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,164
Zola!

721
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,499
Zola!

722
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,400
Zola, what the fuck?

723
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,136
Zola.

724
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,137
We have to do something.

725
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,138
I know but what's in there?

726
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,306
Do you think it's a sturgeon?

727
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,508
No, where did she go?

728
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:54,141
Zola!

729
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:54,776
Zola!

730
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,211
Oh, my god, Zola.

731
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:57,779
Shit.

732
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,246
What the fuck?

733
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,448
Jackson!

734
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:02,449
Jackson!

735
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,351
Jackson!

736
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:05,252
You see her?

737
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,286
Fuck, I can't find her.

738
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,155
Fuck! where the fuck did she go?

739
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:08,690
Jackson!

740
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:10,725
Oh, my god.

741
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,326
Oh, fuck it's hot.

742
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,393
Get out.

743
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:14,094
Oh, my god.

744
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:15,095
Fuck.

745
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,463
Guys, get the fuck to shore.

746
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,280
Thea?

747
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:49,429
Oh, my god.

748
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,264
What the fuck?

749
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,760
Guys, I can't get a signal.

750
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:22,429
What are we going to do?

751
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,709
Oh, my god, Zola.

752
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:35,710
It's Chuy's soul.

753
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,744
He's come back to haunt us.

754
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,478
You spaz, ghosts aren't real.

755
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,648
Yeah, some people thought
that coronavirus wasn't real,

756
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:42,249
and it still killed them.

757
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,719
Even if Chuy was a ghost,
he was our best friend.

758
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:48,388
Why would he come back
and do this to us?

759
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,157
I don't know.

760
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,626
Maybe he's mad at us that we
weren't there for him, that we

761
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,562
didn't try to help him more.

762
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:55,530
I mean, whatever it is.

763
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,364
We got to do it now.

764
00:34:57,397 --> 00:35:00,267
Do what?

765
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:04,706
You know--

766
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,142
No, not like this.

767
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:13,180
Maybe it's the only
way to put him to rest.

768
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,693
I'll do it.

769
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:44,177
Chuy--

770
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,882
Chuy, I'm sorry that
you were depressed.

771
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:53,353
And I'm sorry that you felt
the need to self medicate.

772
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,531
And that's all that
defined your death.

773
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,669
But it's not what
defined your life.

774
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,277
You're the life of the party.

775
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,682
And you are the brightest
face in every room.

776
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,417
And you never said a single
bad thing about anyone

777
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,218
even when Maddie and
I would have our epic

778
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:26,286
shit talking sessions.

779
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,467
You held us together, Chuy.

780
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,536
And now, you're gone.

781
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,445
Then we are falling apart.

782
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:59,721
And I know that
wherever you are,

783
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:03,490
you would be trying to help us.

784
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,959
And you wouldn't
try and hurt us,

785
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:09,731
because you were a good
person even though we weren't

786
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,431
there for you when
we should have been,

787
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,633
and that fucking sucks.

788
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,607
We're so sorry.

789
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,550
We love you, Chuy.

790
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,019
Are you sure?

791
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,420
Yeah, I would not get
back on that inner tube

792
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,390
if it was Justin Bieber's
big beautiful dick.

793
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:10,992
Gross, Mad.

794
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,031
OK, take care of yourself.

795
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:19,567
I love you.

796
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,736
I love you, Kali Fyre.

797
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:32,713
All right.

798
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,015
I have the girl.

799
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,084
No, no, no.

800
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,585
Stop.

801
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,418
She's safe.

802
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:52,927
I can take you to her,
but you have to be quiet.

803
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,862
You're in danger if you don't.

804
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:25,660
You haven't vlog since--

805
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,694
Yeah.

806
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:27,662
I hadn't even thought about it.

807
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:32,566
It's been nice.

808
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:41,208
It's just you and me, no
phone, no viewers to act for.

809
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,778
I'm not acting when I vlog.

810
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:45,012
I'm just being me.

811
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:48,015
Yeah, but it's like
a version of you.

812
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,850
What do you mean?

813
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,919
It's like I've known
you for 10 years

814
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,689
and then there's the real you.

815
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,757
And then there's
the Kali Fyre you.

816
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:00,594
And those two aren't
the same people.

817
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:02,964
You don't think I
know that, Jackson?

818
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,932
You don't think that
I feel like a fraud

819
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,001
every time I hit
that record button,

820
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:09,036
or do you think I'm so
frigging awkward about it?

821
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,205
So why do you even do it?

822
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:12,707
I don't know.

823
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,141
Maybe it's something
that I just have to do,

824
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:16,043
makes me feel important,
gives me a voice.

825
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:18,913
Yeah, but you should talk
about other important stuff

826
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,181
like going premed and all that.

827
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,282
Like what happened to that?

828
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,751
People change.

829
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,853
I'm not really sure
I like this change.

830
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,158
Are you trying to tell me
that you don't like my vlog?

831
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,693
Is that it?

832
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:33,961
I thought you knew that
I didn't like your vlog.

833
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,696
I always tell you
that I don't like it.

834
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,031
I thought you were kidding.

835
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:38,532
But why would I be kidding?

836
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:39,934
It's been three years
since we graduated.

837
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,069
And everybody else
is making moves.

838
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,904
And you were just
going to be 40,

839
00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:46,874
like making makeup
tutorials or something?

840
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,776
Geez.

841
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,111
I'm sorry.

842
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:53,147
No, no, no, you want to
talk about it, clearly.

843
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,648
So let's talk about it.

844
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:55,983
Do you need me to
say it out loud?

845
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:57,151
No, that's fine.

846
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,319
That way you can
hear how ridiculous

847
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,954
it sounds, because I'll do it.

848
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:00,955
Yeah?

849
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:01,756
OK, sweet.

850
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,090
Let's go.

851
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:05,960
I want to be Instagram
famous when I grow up.

852
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:08,329
I want to get that
blue checkmark.

853
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:12,299
And I want to ride this
wave until it's over.

854
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:16,237
And I want to get paid to
try makeup that cosmetics

855
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,705
company sent to me.

856
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,640
And I want to get
paid to rosé all day.

857
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:25,746
And I want to vlog from tropical
beaches, not some fucking--

858
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,249
Some fucking what?

859
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:28,883
No.

860
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:29,583
Say it.

861
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:29,984
Never mind.

862
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:31,919
Say it.

863
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:34,655
Come on, you don't want to be
like at a white trash river

864
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,757
float with all your friends
like you are right now.

865
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:37,658
No.

866
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,359
That's not what I meant.

867
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,161
But you didn't have to.

868
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:43,831
It's like Kali Fyre's too good
for her and all of her friends.

869
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:44,799
I guess--

870
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,067
It's not what it's about.

871
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,201
She's not really worth
with her friends.

872
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:47,835
Jackson.

873
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:48,736
What?

874
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:49,703
Like no, it's honestly--

875
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:50,337
Jackson.

876
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:51,105
The truth, though.

877
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:54,575
Jackson Jackson!

878
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,912
Are you OK?

879
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:32,713
Yeah, I think so.

880
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:42,723
We're almost there.

881
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,120
In there?

882
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:20,895
What is it?

883
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:21,962
It's a safe place.

884
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,170
Can't she just come out here?

885
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,881
It's pretty cold in there.

886
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:54,795
Take this.

887
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:12,346
Thea?

888
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,220
Mom?

889
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,788
No, it's Dee.

890
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:24,058
Your mom's friend.

891
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:24,491
Thea.

892
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:40,307
Hey!

893
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,809
Hey!

894
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:42,243
Hey!

895
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:48,048
Hey!

896
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:17,278
Yeah, let's float.

897
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,312
Yeah, let's float.

898
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:20,414
Yeah, that's real, real smart.

899
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,884
Let's just go float
on the death river.

900
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:24,519
Fuck that.

901
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,588
I'm gonna be dry.

902
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:29,456
Gonna get service.

903
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,425
Somebody's going to pick me up.

904
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,481
No, no, no.

905
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:23,977
Where are my parents?

906
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,251
Is something wrong?

907
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:47,000
Thea, sometimes being an
adult is just really hard.

908
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:53,374
You know, your mommy and
daddy love you very much.

909
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:57,478
Yes, they argue sometimes
but not about you.

910
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:58,546
And then what's it about?

911
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,883
How about grown
up stuff, sweetie?

912
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,488
Is that why my dad left?

913
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,497
Your daddy will never
really leave you.

914
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:24,304
Have you ever done
a pinky swear?

915
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:25,607
No.

916
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,176
Well, maybe but I don't
think I remember it.

917
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,445
Do you know why we do it?

918
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:32,980
No.

919
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:37,217
Well, to promise something.

920
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,520
Oh.

921
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:41,955
And you know why we
use our pinky fingers?

922
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:44,358
Well?

923
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:48,162
Well, you know how we've
been floating on this river?

924
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,497
I didn't want to go
but my dad made me.

925
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,166
I know, sweetie.

926
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,002
But do you remember how we
put the tubes on the river

927
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:57,438
and it flowed down?

928
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,373
Yeah.

929
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:05,179
Well, our arteries are
like little tiny rivers

930
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:09,316
carrying blood from your heart
to everywhere it needs to go.

931
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:18,626
It's going to your feet, going
to your knees, your eyes.

932
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,394
It went to my butt?

933
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:24,064
Yes, even to your butt.

934
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:25,767
You know something.

935
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,036
But little kids,
those rivers don't

936
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:32,306
end at the tips of
their pinky fingers.

937
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:36,109
The little kids are special.

938
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,445
They have an
invisible river that

939
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:42,182
flows out from their pinky
fingers to their moms

940
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:46,654
and their dad's pinky fingers
no matter where they are.

941
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:53,193
In these invisible rivers,
they flow to your parents veins

942
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,162
and into your parents
hearts so that

943
00:49:55,195 --> 00:50:01,335
no matter what, you'll always
be in their hearts forever.

944
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:02,336
Even when they die?

945
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,044
Yeah, it's forever,
the pinky swear.

946
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:37,437
Let's just get the
fuck out of here.

947
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:43,511
Shit.

948
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:44,211
What?

949
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:44,646
Oh, shit.

950
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,780
What?

951
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,114
My keys, they were
never in here.

952
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:48,348
OK, well, where are they then?

953
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:55,389
Oh, fuck.

954
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:56,089
What, Jackson?

955
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:56,524
Shit.

956
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:57,859
What?

957
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:00,762
I left them in the
center console, the raft.

958
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:03,430
The center console-- it's
not a fucking car, Jackson.

959
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:04,298
I know.

960
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:05,165
I'm so fucking dumb.

961
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,418
OK, we have to go back.

962
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,715
They must have dumped
out in the Rapids.

963
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:56,383
Yeah, well, I'll go upstream
and try to find them.

964
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,652
That'll be useless.

965
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,419
It's almost dark.

966
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,255
What other choice do we have?

967
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,156
What about Dee?

968
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,324
What if she found Thea?

969
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,628
It's getting dark.

970
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:08,696
I'll only go as
far as the rapids.

971
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,897
At least let me come with you.

972
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:11,498
It's scary up there.

973
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:12,800
You're safer here.

974
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:13,768
You should stay.

975
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:18,606
OK, please be careful.

976
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,239
I will.

977
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:26,748
I love you.

978
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:32,219
I love you, too.

979
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:06,219
Well, here I am in some
random fucking parking lot.

980
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:12,492
I started the day
out with my boyfriend

981
00:53:12,527 --> 00:53:13,695
and three of my best friends.

982
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:22,603
I don't know if you'll see
it but Zola disappeared.

983
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:27,575
And we think she--

984
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:31,546
I'm not even going to say it.

985
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:38,452
Madison could have been picked
up by some psycho by now.

986
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,922
And who the fuck
knows where Dee went?

987
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:52,332
And Thea, I don't know
if I can know about Thea.

988
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:02,977
All just like--

989
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,454
It's all just too much.

990
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:15,857
And now, my mascara's smearing.

991
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,592
That was supposed to
be waterproof, so.

992
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:22,797
Hello?

993
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:27,935
Jackson?

994
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:44,652
Jackson, is that you?

995
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:40,875
Jackson?

996
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:45,680
Help me.

997
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:00,995
Madison!

998
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:01,629
Madison!

999
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:08,502
Madison!

1000
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,541
Madison, what happened?

1001
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:16,110
I fell on a stone.

1002
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:17,178
I saw the guy.

1003
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:17,979
What guy?

1004
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,013
Who-- what?

1005
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,848
How'd you even pass the rapids?

1006
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:21,816
What rapids?

1007
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:25,485
Never mind.

1008
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,754
Never mind.

1009
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:28,455
We got to-- we got
to get you some help.

1010
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:35,630
Chuy?

1011
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,739
Chuy, what are
you talking about?

1012
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:47,074
I thought you OD'd and
fell into the river.

1013
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:49,977
I hadn't taken that much before.

1014
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:51,712
I know you're trying
to reach out to me.

1015
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:54,649
I was trying to give you
tough love or some shit.

1016
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:55,983
I should have been
there for you.

1017
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:59,086
I was too busy focusing
on my stupid vlog shit.

1018
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:06,493
No, it's not your
fault. It's the river.

1019
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:08,930
It took me.

1020
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,899
And now, it's trying
to take all of you.

1021
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:18,039
It preys on your weaknesses.

1022
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,240
Why do you even care, Madison?

1023
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,207
You still doing this vlog shit?

1024
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:21,075
Not everyone is just out--

1025
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,143
I saw you guys out.

1026
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:23,110
I don't have time for--

1027
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:25,947
Move your fucking ass.

1028
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,516
It preyed on mine.

1029
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:29,684
Don't go near the river.

1030
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:45,099
What the actual fuck?

1031
00:57:58,713 --> 00:57:59,814
Here, you good?

1032
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:02,783
Yeah, I'm OK.

1033
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:04,218
Hey, Jackson.

1034
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,720
Yeah?

1035
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:09,090
Remember I told you
I'd kill you earlier.

1036
00:58:09,123 --> 00:58:11,092
Yeah, I do.

1037
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,261
I'm not going to kill you.

1038
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:16,530
You're actually a good guy.

1039
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:19,567
I'm glad you're
dating my best friend.

1040
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,268
I'm glad you're my
girlfriend's best friend.

1041
00:58:27,274 --> 00:58:28,209
It's safe--

1042
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:31,145
Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.

1043
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:31,746
Jackson!

1044
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:32,279
Jackson!

1045
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:33,514
Hold on.

1046
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:37,818
Jackson!

1047
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:39,987
Jackson!

1048
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:40,955
Hold on.

1049
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:41,589
Jackson!

1050
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:45,126
Madison!

1051
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:02,977
Madison!

1052
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:07,214
Jackson!

1053
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:46,213
I have your friend and the girl.

1054
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:47,214
They're safe.

1055
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:49,717
What about the rest of them?

1056
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,820
There is another girl.

1057
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:55,122
Maddie?

1058
01:00:55,156 --> 01:01:01,896
She's about my age walking
down this road.

1059
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:03,864
They're of the river.

1060
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:06,000
They're off the river?

1061
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:08,903
Of the river.

1062
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:09,803
Hell does that mean?

1063
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:16,110
It means I can't help them.

1064
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:17,378
But I can help you.

1065
01:01:20,014 --> 01:01:21,182
Let me take you there.

1066
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:25,252
I have to find my friends--

1067
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:30,424
And Mace.

1068
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:37,164
OK.

1069
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:54,048
You don't happen to have
an iPhone charger, do you?

1070
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:10,497
Can you at least tell
me where we're going?

1071
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:12,466
To see your friend and the girl.

1072
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:19,940
Yeah, you told me that.

1073
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:20,774
But where?

1074
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,880
I'm going to jump out
of this fucking car

1075
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,382
if you don't tell me
where we're going.

1076
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:31,318
I warned you not
to float the river.

1077
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:35,189
So what, you're trying to punish
us for not listening to you?

1078
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,490
It's not me.

1079
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:40,528
OK, well then who?

1080
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:48,335
Not who, what.

1081
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,803
What are you talking about?

1082
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:56,277
There is something
in that river.

1083
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,947
It took your friend Chuy.

1084
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,148
I don't know how many others.

1085
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:06,920
I tried to save as many of
your friends as I could.

1086
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:14,295
Do you think you're
immune from reality?

1087
01:03:14,328 --> 01:03:14,928
