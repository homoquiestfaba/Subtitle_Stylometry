332
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,301
Sounds like you have
a smart mother.

333
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:14,014
You have no idea.

334
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,976
You're absolutely beautiful.
You know that?

335
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,187
Thank you.

336
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,576
And you can cook?

337
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,465
Skylar.

338
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,134
Just wanted to give you a call,

339
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,638
make sure
you made it home safe.

340
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,517
Lt was really nice
to see you tonight.

341
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah.

342
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,731
Hey, why don't you give me
a call in the morning?

343
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,901
Maybe we can grab
brunch or something.

344
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,695
All right?

345
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,279
Sleep well.

346
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,009
What are you doing here?

347
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,670
Time out. Tell me l didn't throw

348
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,255
a kick-ass party last night, man.

349
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,048
Diddy ain't got shit on me.

350
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,217
Bad shit... bad shit, seriously.

351
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,303
What l wanna know is
where the fuck were you all night?

352
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,805
L already told you... rule ♪1.

353
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,182
What's rule ♪1 again?

354
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,768
ABC... Always Be Closing.

355
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,686
Bingo.
Right there, my man.

356
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,897
Those rules don't work, man.
Come on.

357
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,483
Had to close down
the Carnegie chick last night.

358
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,360
- Yo, how'd she do, man?
- She had a Prime Alexander night.

359
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,530
28 points, shot 54%
from the three-point line.

360
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,450
- Damn, that's pretty good.
- That is a good night.

361
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,869
Are you gonna see her again?

362
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,498
Nah. l'm already working
on my next lottery pick.

363
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,208
Of course you are.

364
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,295
Hey, hold up.
Seriously, what was up with Autumn?

365
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,129
That's what l wanna know.
Dude, she was tripping all night.

366
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,757
Yo, that's Dallas. l told you
not to let her ass in the party.

367
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,801
She was fine until
she saw you kiss Skylar.

368
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,179
What? Yo, look, she was crazy
from the jump, man.

369
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,931
- Red flag.
L told his ass.

370
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,641
- Amen.
- Will you guys relax?

371
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,519
- Damn, man!
- Relax.

372
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,813
Lt's all good.
Whatever, man.

373
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,981
Yo, anyone else close last night?

374
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,733
Well, l had a trez Nathaniel.

375
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,777
- A trez what?
- A dude?

376
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,530
A dude? No, man, the two chicks
from the pool last night.

377
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,700
Man! l'm telling you...
strawberries and wine, candles.

378
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,620
Lt was quite exquisite.

379
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,831
L'm feeling that.
L'm very happy for you.

380
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,750
- What about you, Zo?
- Oh, l had a good time, man.

381
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,918
Y'all know he was handcuffed
to Katalina all night,

382
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,588
talking about "l love you, baby.
L love you, baby."

383
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,298
l'll fucking kill you.

384
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,634
Yo, what's up with you
and her, anyway?

385
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,928
Man, l don't know.
L like her.

386
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,306
- l like her a lot. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

387
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,183
You know, just be
careful with her.

388
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,810
- l will.
- Yeah.

389
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,521
You know what? Actually,
go ahead and let's redesign

390
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,648
- this whole setup over here.
- The scarves?

391
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,734
Yeah, l don't like it.
And let's redress her too.

392
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,279
- Okay.
- Anyway, like l was saying,

393
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,198
his tie and handkerchief
matched my dress,

394
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,744
Prime warned me that l should've
put my sunglasses on

395
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,204
- in the car, but...
- Ooh!

396
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,706
- l know, right?
- At night?

397
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,499
Oh!

398
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,711
- Hey!
- Hi! How are you, girls?

399
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,963
- You look so cute.
- You too.

400
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,257
- Hello.
- Hey, Heidi. Hi, honey, how are you?

401
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,718
- Super cute. Have a seat.
- Thanks.

402
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,054
Dylan, do you mind getting us
a couple of glasses of wine?

403
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,140
- Not at all.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,184
So how are you guys doing?

405
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,103
- Good.
- Good, how are you?

406
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,064
- Fabulous as always.
- Of course.

407
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,066
So l guess you know
why we're here.

408
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,278
We need something amazing
to wear to the Rico Terrell gala.

409
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,247
- Oh, okay. Of course.
- And l heard this year

410
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,645
it's an all-black affair.
L wonder who decided to do that.

411
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,784
- Mmm, that's me.
- Oh, okay.

412
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,536
L'll go and get
you guys the book

413
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,664
and l'll show you what
l have coming in next week.

414
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,789
- Okay.
- Okay?

415
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,499
- Ladies.
- Thank you.

416
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,209
You're welcome.

417
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,629
Here you go, sweetie.

418
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,213
- So, Autumn...
- Mm-hmm?

419
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,299
Is this the wine
that you purchased

420
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,384
while you were
in San Francisco last week?

421
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,512
L wasn't in San Francisco last week.

422
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,933
Why? What's going on?

423
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,518
- lt's probably nothing.
- What's probably nothing?

424
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,147
Okay, spill it.

425
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,066
Jessica said that she saw Prime

426
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,235
in San Francisco last week
with another woman.

427
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:23,531
And that gossip website said that
you were kicked out of Prime's party.

428
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,200
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,702
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything you read.

430
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,123
Okay, first of all l was not kicked out.
We had a fight.

431
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,876
Lt wasn't the first
and it won't be the last.

432
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,712
Okay, and what about that girl
that he was kissing at his party?

433
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,882
- You know, the one he was all up on?
- Oh, you mean the peasant

434
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,551
who was rocking last year's
rummage-sale collection?

435
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,179
- l'm not worried about her in the least.
- Ahem!

436
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,557
Maybe we could show them
the new Norell collection.

437
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,519
Mmm! Yes, l am sure
one of these beauties

438
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,562
can pull off such a stunning dress.

439
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,148
You know what?
L have work to do,

440
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,901
so l'm gonna go.
But you ladies shop.

441
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,695
- Okay?
- Thank you.

442
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,156
Okay, um, maybe let's take a look

443
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,908
at a few dresses.
Do you mind?

444
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,910
- Just bring out what you have.
- Yeah.

445
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,496
L'd be happy to.

446
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,432
Carnegie, if you don't stop
checking that phone...

447
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,600
do you think it's gonna ring
just because you want it to?

448
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,019
L'm just checking the service.

449
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,895
Sometimes it gets spotty in here.

450
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,024
Uh-huh.
Yet l have the same carrier

451
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,942
and l'm four bars strong.

452
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,569
L know, l know, l know.

453
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,320
Why hasn't he called me?

454
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,782
You just saw him last night.
He's probably working today.

455
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,660
L know, l know.
Lt's just...

456
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,455
that was the most amazing date.

457
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,750
Well, what did he say
when he dropped you off?

458
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,128
You... you mean when he left?

459
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,922
- So he came in?
- Oh yeah. Yeah.

460
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,675
- Well...
- Lt was amazing.

461
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,929
L'm not even kidding.
This is the best date l've ever been on.

462
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,849
- Hands down. Hands down.
- So you slept with him after dinner

463
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,477
and he hasn't called you back.

464
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,271
- lt's not like that.
- Not like what?

465
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,690
You're making it seem like
because he slept with me

466
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,108
he doesn't want to be with me.

467
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,402
Well, have you ever
gone on this long

468
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,781
- without him speaking to you?
- L mean...

469
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,867
not... not since we met.

470
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,036
Lt's probably nothing.

471
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,414
- You think?
- L know. l'm sure you're right.

472
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,042
Sounds like you guys have
an amazing connection.

473
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,878
Now let's get dressed
and get some drinks at Duke's.

474
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,839
Your phone rings in other places
besides the living room.

475
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,637
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

476
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,388
Well, they're gone.

477
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,058
Umm...

478
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,895
how you doing?
Are you doing okay?

479
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,564
L'm fine.

480
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,149
You sure?

481
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,235
Yes, l'm sure.

482
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,070
No, l'm just wondering,

483
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,989
'cause having them
catty bitches in your store...

484
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,450
- you know.
- Who, Heidi and Shannon?

485
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,411
- Yes, Heidi and Shannon.
- Oh, l'm not worried about them at all.

486
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:20,208
They will never change. But you know,
as long as they continue to shop here,

487
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,835
l really don't care.

488
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,087
Amen.

489
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,422
Umm...

490
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,092
so you looking at that website?

491
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,512
L don't even know what website
they're talking about, so...

492
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,348
- Whobangingwho.com.
- And how do you know that?

493
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,725
Girl, please, do not let
the bougie fool you.

494
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,103
You know l keep up on my gossip.

495
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,109
My college girlfriend
runs the site.

496
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,030
Umm...

497
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,576
l saw these pictures
this morning...

498
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,038
Prime kissing that girl.

499
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,167
Honey, why didn't you just tell me

500
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,919
that you guys were having trouble?

501
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,338
Because it's no big deal.

502
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,048
- lt...
- Lt's not that serious.

503
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,093
Lt's serious.

504
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,846
Dylan, l really don't wanna talk
about this right now, so...

505
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,058
Yo yo yo, l got a delivery.

506
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,689
Umm...

507
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,858
l'll get it.

508
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,702
- Hi, Quenton.
- Hi.

509
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,538
Dylan, when are you gonna stop playing
and let me take you out to dinner?

510
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,790
- Huh.
- Mmm. Man.

511
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,085
- What is this?
- Lt's a delivery for your cousin.

512
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:50,715
- On a Saturday?
- Apparently it's a special delivery.

513
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,553
Okay. Right this way.

514
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,473
Sorry. Delivery.

515
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,809
- Oh, hey, Que.
- Miss lady. l have a delivery for you.

516
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,775
Are you serious?

517
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,487
Umm...

518
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,241
Are you waiting for a tip?
Seriously? You...

519
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,577
- he just asked me out.
- Hey, l gotta save up.

520
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,704
We all know how
you singletary ladies are.

521
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,957
- Bye, Que.
- Wow. Nuh-uh.

522
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,709
Dylan, call me.
You won't regret it.

523
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,879
L... l don't even know.

524
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,757
What is this? ls this from Milan?
What'd you get?

525
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,469
Did that say it was from Prime?

526
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,429
Maybe it's some new shoes.

527
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,391
Autumn?

528
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,934
These are...

529
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,145
is this your stuff
from Prime's house?

530
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,652
- lt looks that way.
- He cut up your pictures?

531
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,822
Apparently so.

532
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,620
Honey, l'm...

533
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,414
l'm so sorry.

534
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,625
But this is stupid, okay?
This is petty.

535
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,087
Look... okay, l'm gonna...

536
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,007
l'm gonna take care
of this, okay?

537
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,136
Yeah, don't...
don't worry about it.

538
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,680
Umm, l got it.

539
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,140
Okay?

540
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,663
Hm-mmm, Grandma.
L got it.

541
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,791
- Mmm.
- Whew.

542
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,050
- Hi, can l help you?
- Miss Hathaway?

543
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,844
- Yes.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

544
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,181
L'm your driver for today,
compliments of Mr. Prime Alexander.

545
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,058
Your first appointment
00 p.m.

546
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,352
My first appointment?

547
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,396
Yes, ma'am. l can't
tell you where we're going,

548
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,649
but l do have a schedule here for your
grandmother so she's not worried.

549
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,070
So this is one of those
scavenger hunts or something.

550
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,197
L'm not at liberty
to say, ma'am,

551
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,824
but l do expect your granddaughter
to have a lovely evening.

552
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,119
- Gimme one minute.
- Not a problem, ma'am.

553
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,538
You remember that purse
that l lost last year in Vegas?

554
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,040
Uh-huh, 'cause you forgetful.

555
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,334
Why is that the newer version in purple?

556
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,754
- You want it?
- L do. l love it.

557
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,549
Well, l got a surprise for you waiting
at the house. l think you might like it.

558
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,677
- Shut up. No, you don't.
- L guarantee l do.

559
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,348
- Stop!
- Right next to the new shoes l got you.

560
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,934
Hi, Cash.

561
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,852
- Keep it moving.
- Baby, come on.

562
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,540
Let's go see if they have that bag
you was looking at last week.

563
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,316
Huh-uh, don't try
to change the subject.

564
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,325
How the hell does that ho
gonna come over here,

565
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,278
talking some "hey, Cash,"
like she knows you like that?

566
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,239
- l don't know that girl.
- Where do you know that girl from?

567
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,241
- Like l said, l don't...
- Where do you know that girl from?

568
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,201
Maybe she was at the club
or somewhere with Prime.

569
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,329
- You know he got groupies everywhere.
- Next time

570
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,456
you need to tell your little bitches
not to come over and talk to you...

571
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,250
- My bitches?
- ...when they see you with your woman.

572
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,579
L'm glad you recognize that.
Now can we keep it moving?

573
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,838
- No, l'm serious, Kalif.
- You causing as scene for nothing.

574
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,605
Try me if you think l'm playing.
L'm so tired of that simple shit.

575
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,968
- l don't care if l'm causing a scene.
- Look, l ain't do shit, a'ight?

576
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,719
No, you ain't do shit.

577
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,347
You think you slick.
You think l'm stupid.

578
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,599
But l got something for that ass.
You wait and see.

579
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,268
- See, that's your problem right there.
- L gonna find her.

580
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,956
You always trying
to threaten somebody.

581
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,855
L'm not threatening you.
That shit was disrespectful.

582
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,773
- Come on. You know what?
- No. No no no, come here.

583
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,102
- Let's go introduce...
- Don't embarrass me in public.

584
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,236
- 'Cause you about to get you...
- See, you're always wiling out.

585
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,488
This is your first appointment
for the day here.

586
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,867

Hey, sexy.

600
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,650
Ls it too late to call?

601
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,902
Lt's 6:30.

602
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,530
L know. l'm just playing.

603
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,366
So what's up?

604
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,410
L thought you were going out
with Kalif and Dallas.

605
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,915
Yeah, l was, but l have a really big,
important meeting on Tuesday

606
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,125
and l don't wanna be out
drinking with the guys

607
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,587
and... l don't know. l just kinda
wanna keep my head right, you know?

608
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,006
Wow. Smart guy.

609
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,175
L think l like you.

610
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,512
Wait, you think you like me?
What's up with that?

611
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,057
- You don't know by now?
- Oh, l know.

612
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,977
So what are you doing?

613
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,020
Well, that's why l was calling.

614
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:41,607
My family and l are having
a little movie night tonight

615
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,443
and l wanted to see
what you were doing,

616
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,362
see if you wanted
to roll through.

617
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,406
Maybe watch one
of those chick flicks

618
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,741
my mom's been begging me
to watch with her.

619
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,245
Okay, so you're telling me
that you're spending a Saturday

620
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,289
chilling with your mom,
watching chick flicks?

621
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,165
- How cute.
- Mm-hmm.

622
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,669
Yeah yeah yeah.
Mama's my rock.

623
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,630
Wow.

624
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,425
Not a lot of people can say that.

625
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:11,387
What do you mean?
You're not close to your mom?

626
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,723
Let's just say my mom is married
and she has children,

627
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,517
but "close"

628
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,271
isn't a word l use to describe
her relationship with anyone.

629
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,068
Wow, Katalina. l'm really sorry
to hear that, honey.

630
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,614
So what movies does
your mom have on the lineup?

631
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh, we've got
"Love and Other Drugs,"

632
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,577
and "Good Will Hunting,"
of course.

633
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,495
Oh, my vote is definitely
for "Good Will Hunting."

634
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,581
l love me some Matt Damon

635
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,459
and Cole Hauser...
good old Boston bad-asses.

636
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,253
- Mm-hmm.
- So, 20 minutes?

637
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,005
Awesome.
That's perfect.

638
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,758
Okey-dokey. Just so you know,
l look a little crazy.

639
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,844
L definitely was curled up in a ball
reading a book in some sweats.

640
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,264
Oh. Oh, my bad.
L see what you're doing.

641
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,974
Okay. That's right,
you're fishing

642
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,935
for compliments right now.
We can play this game.

643
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,479
No, you know what?
L can't even...

644
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,482
you are... you are naturally beautiful

645
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,359
from head to toe, so...

646
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,528
Thank you,
very very sweet of you.

647
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,297
All right, well,
drive safe, honey. Okay?

648
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,740
- Okay.
- L'll see you soon.

649
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,033
- Bye.
- Bye.

650
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,244
Well?

651
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,789
Oh my... ooh, that is soft.

652
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,125
L know. l was surprised to find
that your hair's still natural.

653
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,419
You know, you have
so many options when it is.

654
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,672
So l wanted to soften up
your curls a bit.

655
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,049
Lt's absolutely beautiful.

656
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,802
Thank you.
Oh wow.

657
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,347
So how long have
you been dating Prime?

658
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,016
Oh, l wouldn't call it
dating just yet.

659
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,769
Only we met a few months ago,
so we've hung out a few times.

660
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,022
But l like him.
He's really nice.

661
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,816
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

662
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,527
So all the things you hear
about the great Optimus Prime...

663
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,238
- it isn't true?
- You know, to be honest,

664
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,824
l wouldn't have a clue
as to what they say about him.

665
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,575
L moved out here to take care
of my grandmother,

666
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,202
so she's been my main focus.

667
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,996
All that matters
is that he's nice to me.

668
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,918
So you're not one
of those jersey chasers

669
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,838
running behind him
because he has all those millions?

670
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,173
Definitely not one of those.

671
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,843
L don't know.
Maybe it's just me, but...

672
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,810
l'm more concerned about how a man
treats me than what's in his wallet.

673
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,141
You know?
L actually had a run-in

674
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,727
with a few of his admirers
the other night at the club.

675
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,481
Just being in a room with
those women made my skin crawl.

676
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,026
L would totally understand
if he had trust issues

677
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,794
dealing with those type of women,
just throwing themselves at him.

678
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,615
Yeah, you'd be surprised,
honey, they're everywhere.

679
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,784
That's why l make it
my business to find out

680
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,412
if these girls are dating my brother
for the right reasons

681
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,790
or because he's
a pro basketball player.

682
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,500
Prime is your brother?

683
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,045
Milan Alexander at your services.

684
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,093
L had no idea.
L... l don't know what to say.

685
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,095
You don't have to say
anything, honey.

686
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,057
You've said enough.
L'm just happy to find out

687
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,269
that my brother's with someone
who's with him for the right reasons.

688
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,855
You're a sweetheart.

689
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,815
Keep it that way.

690
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,943
And don't break his heart.

691
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,666
So what's up, baby?
Baby, come on.

692
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,461
- You know we be off the hook, baby.
- Kalif! Kalif!

693
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,421
- Hold on. Oh shit.
- Who the hell plays basketball

694
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,839
this damn late at night?

695
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,527
- You better have your ass back by 9:00!
- Yo, come on, man, go!

696
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,427
L'm not playing with you, Dallas!

697
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,471
Why can't you just
find somebody else tonight

698
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,808
- and have a little fun?
- No one gets me like Dallas.

699
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,811
Oh God, nobody gets you...
okay, what does he tell you?

700
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,521
- l mean...
l mean...

701
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,929
l don't know. This guy
sounds like he's kinda full of it.

702
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,942
No, but you're
always negative like this.

703
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,903
Every time l like somebody,
you jump down my throat.

704
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,906
You gotta go with my gut.
And my gut is l really like him.

705
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,534
Okay, go with your gut.
What about your heart?

706
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,495
My gut... oh, Chad's working.
Probably get some free drinks.

707
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,957
- lsn't that Dallas?
- Let's go!

708
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,751
Oh, wait wait wait wait.
He's with a girl.

709
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,256
No no, that's probably

710
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,383
like his friend or his cousin
or something.

711
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,261
Lt's all right. That's... that's
definitely... definitely...

712
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,305
- Let's go investigate.
- Umm...

713
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,808
Sorry. Excuse me.
Just... excuse me.

714
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,686
Just trying to get to my boyfriend here.
Excuse me, guys.

715
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:32,356
- To a lot of luck, baby. Whoo!
- Whoo!

716
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,024
Dallas!

717
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,654
Dallas! Hey.

718
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,364
Oh hey, Carnegie.

719
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,991
What are you doing here?

720
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,535
L was gonna ask you
the same thing.

721
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,704
Excuse me, guys.

722
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,415
♪ Work that body,
get your sexy on... ♪

723
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,709
He should be embarrassed.

724
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,920
- He's acting like a child.
- Honey, l was dragged out of a club...

725
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,631
dragged out of a club
by two people

726
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,592
holding me down.
Lt was embarrassing.

727
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,679
- lt was very embarrassing.
- L wish l was there.

728
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,973
Look, Carnegie, you know
l don't want anything, right?

729
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,809
L'm a single man.

730
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,687
L'm not looking for anything
serious right now.

731
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,440
Whoa. Umm...

732
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,483
l wish you would've
told me that last night,

733
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,445
because l didn't get that memo
when you were in my bed.

734
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,572
To go through that
by yourself, that's not...

735
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,909
- What?
- That's Dallas.

736
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,119
L'm sorry you feel like that.

737
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,331
L thought we were just hanging out,
enjoying each other's company.

738
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,667
- Carnegie, come on, let's go.
- Yeah well, l didn't know that, Dallas.

739
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,836
Okay? And the only reason
why you're in the clear

740
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,422
is because you never mentioned
the word "relationship"

741
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,174
when you were wining and dining me

742
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,343
and bringing me
my favorite cupcakes.

743
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,095
You're in the clear because
you could do whatever you want

744
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,766
and my feelings is no consequence
to how you feel!

745
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,054
He's doing the exact same thing
that Prime did to you.

746
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,229
Why do they all act like that?
Why do they get to get away with that?

747
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,274
- They won't. They won't.
- You got what you wanted,

748
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,652
and now you're done.
Right? ls that how it goes?

749
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,654
- ls that how it goes?
- Come on, Carnegie, let's go.

750
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,114
- Let's go.
- Listen to your girl.

751
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,908
Screw you, Dallas!

752
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,964
Nice.
20 minutes, huh?

753
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,758
- Two hours later...
- Whatever.

754
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,552
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

755
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,098
- Who's this little princess?
- This beautiful thing is my niece.

756
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,891
- Hello there.
- Hi.

757
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,601
- She's so precious.
- She's so cute.

758
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,354
Are you ready to go inside?
They have been waiting

759
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,606
to meet my beautiful
girlfriend all day.

760
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:41,110
- Your girlfriend?
- Did l say something wrong?

761
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,279
No, babe.
Girlfriend is just fine.

762
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,031
L like that. Come on.

763
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,326
My name is Katalina too.

764
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,871
Hi, family.
This is Katalina, everyone.

765
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,957
Katalina, this is my family.

766
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,418
Lonzo, don't have her thinking
you were raised by wolves.

767
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,336
Oh, here we go.
That's my sister.

768
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,046
Nice to meet you, Katalina.
L'm Susie.

769
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,298
- Nice to meet you, Susie.
- This is my father,

770
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,011
- Mr. Juan Rodriguez.
- Mr. Rodriguez, a pleasure to meet you.

771
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,637
Nice to meet you too, Katalina.

772
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,597
Hope you don't mind.
L brought some cake for dessert.

773
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,606
Oh, l don't mind.
What kind of cake do we have?

774
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,166
Lt don't matter what kind of cake it is.
You ain't having any.

775
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,812
What do you mean
l'm not gonna have any?

776
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,940
A man should be able to have cake
in his own house if he wants to.

777
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,986
- Yeah, that's... that's my family.
- That's my cake.

778
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,321
Yeah.

779
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,991
Carnegie, come on!

780
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,952
Come on, you cannot let him
embarrass you like this!

781
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,331
Don't let him win!
He's such a fucking asshole!

782
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,334
Are you gonna come out?
Come on, Carnegie!

783
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,671
She's right, you know. You need
to pay him back for what he did to you.

784
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,590
L'm sorry, but that was ridiculous.

785
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,925
Um, who are you?

786
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,970
My name is Autumn, l used to date
one of Dallas's friends, Prime,

787
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,348
and he embarrassed me in the exact
same way that he embarrassed you.

788
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,478
Carnegie.

789
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,857
What did you say?

790
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,693
L'm sorry.
L saw that back there

791
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,320
and that was ridiculous.

792
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,447
L cannot believe
he did that to you.

793
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,949
- lt is not right.
- Why does this always happen to me?

794
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,535
L always fall in love with assholes.

795
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,330
Look, Dallas, Prime, Lonzo, Kalif...

796
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,041
all of them, that whole little crew...
they're dogs, okay?

797
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,418
They don't give a shit about
anyone else but themselves.

798
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,337
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

799
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,339
- l feel so stupid. l feel...
No.

800
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,092
- Yes, l feel stupid.
- Do not blame yourself.

801
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,261
L'm sure he wined and dined you,

802
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,223
- did all that sweet shit.
- Cupcakes.

803
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,725
That's what they do. Look, honey...

804
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,727
- l'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

805
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,646
Lt's a game to them, okay?

806
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,481
They don't care about
who they hurt in the process.

807
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,049
Lt's not even
about the sex to them.

808
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,401
They just wanna conquer
as many women as they can

809
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,446
and they don't care who gets hurt
in the process. Trust me.

810
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,865
Times like these,
l'm glad l do women.

811
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,372
Look, if l were you,
l would confront him.

812
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,749
L would let him have it.

813
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,793
L mean, did you see
his smug ass out there?

814
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,921
All those guys out there,
they think he's a hero.

815
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,965
And those women?
They still will talk to him

816
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,591
because they think
it's something you did.

817
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,760
They never think
it's something they did.

818
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,971
You didn't deserve that, no matter what.

819
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,141
- He doesn't even care about you.
- Not at all.

820
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,669
Hm-mmm.
- We've gotta do something.

821
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,894
Don't let him get away
with this at all.

822
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,480
- Okay. Okay.
- At all.

823
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,440
- Yeah.
- All right, l'm gonna go out there.

824
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,568
Yes! Dry your eyes.

825
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,529
- All right, you look cute.
- L'm going. Okay.

826
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,411
Are you guys sure
about this dress?

827
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,788
Lt's cut really low.

828
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,791
Miss Hathaway,
are you in the dress?

829
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,918
Yes.

830
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,297
- Are you in the shoes?
- Yes.

831
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,257
Then get the hell
out of my dressing room

832
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,634
so we can see you.

833
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,936
- You look fantastic.
- Beautiful.

834
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,982
Come come.

835
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,111
You did it.

836
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:18,452
Absolutely beautiful.
Vidal, you did this.

837
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,371
- Yes, l did.
- Oh my God, it's so beautiful.

838
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,749
Oh, wait wait wait,
don't forget about the purse.

839
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,084
- Oh, l don't have a purse.
- Of course you do.

840
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:31,381
- That is so beautiful.
- Lsn't it?

841
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,010
- You know, you guys are so...
- No no no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

842
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,179
- We know.
- Get going.

843
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,057
- Thank you.
- Put in a good word for us.

844
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,062
You're welcome.

845
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,526
Oh.

846
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,531
L have had the most
amazing day of my life.

847
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,575
Well, you deserve it.
L mean, l know

848
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,994
taking care of your grandmother
can't be that easy.

849
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,121
Wow. Now come on.

850
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,666
The night has only begun.

851
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,260
Oh shit.

852
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,970
She's coming back,
she's coming back.

853
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,097
L can't believe all this shit.

854
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,475
So how do you know
our mutual friend Dallas?

855
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,228
- Excuse me?
- Well, let's see.

856
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,314
You're having drinks
at his favorite place to be seen,

857
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,816
so you must be new.

858
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:32,776
He took me here
on our second date.

859
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,445
We snuggled
in a booth over drinks.

860
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,366
Has he brought you pastries yet?
Oh, l'm sure he's asked you

861
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,535
all about your
favorite things by now, huh?

862
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,496
Mmm!
L love that bracelet.

863
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,791
Let me guess, let me guess. He said
it reminded you of him when he got it,

864
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,043
because it's dainty,
just like your wrist.

865
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,755
Mine's gold. He gave it to me
before we walked in here last time.

866
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,091
Hey, yo, you balling like that, man?

867
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,760
But don't worry.
He's not gonna try anything tonight,

868
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,596
because the sex won't be
good enough until you're hooked.

869
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,933
He likes sweet kisses
that he feels are escaped...

870
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,060
well, that's what
he told me at least.

871
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,398
But from the look of it, you got
about 10 more days of access to him

872
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,943
and then he'll fuck you
like he fucked me last night.

873
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,738
And then there's no more phone calls

874
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,408
just to hear your voice. He's gonna
make it seem like you did something,

875
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,578
and he's gonna act like you're a psycho
if he runs into you in public,

876
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,497
make everybody think you're some
stalker girl he just can't break.

877
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,083
Well, he told me that
about the girl before me.

878
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,960
L'm sure he told you
the same thing about me, right?

879
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,339
Carnegie, what are
you trying to prove here?

880
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,175
Just trying to get it
off my chest, Dallas.

881
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,385
L'm just trying to get
all the facts straight.

882
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,971
You know what l mean?
Because you're fucking good.

883
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,391
You're really good.
You should be an actor like Lonzo.

884
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,811
You would win an Academy Award,
hands down.

885
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,688
Hands down.

886
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,982
Ooh! l'll take one of these.

887
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,610
The least you can do
is buy me a drink.

888
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,947
Mmm mmm!

889
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,783
That's good.

890
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,868
Real smooth.

891
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,662
Real... mmm.

892
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,417
Mmm, but then it leaves
this bitter taste in your mouth.

893
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,504
Ooh! That was awesome!

894
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,340
- You go, girl.
- Oh my gosh, it was.

895
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,717
Yo, hey, let me help you, bro.

896
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,552
Hey, you know...

897
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,097
Oh, l ain't never gonna
let you hear the end of this.

898
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,810

- Those earrings are really cute.
- Really?

941
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,739
- l wanna steal them from you.
- My mom bought them at your store.

942
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,991
- She did?
- Yes, those are our spring line.

943
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,760
- Learn your line.
- Wait wait wait wait.

944
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,745
First of all, that's not my job.
Thank you.

945
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,164
Please.
Sweetie, you need to come to my place

946
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,416
and l'll hook you up
with a nice dress to go along with 'em.

947
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,085
- Thank you.
- You know what?

948
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,587
Huh-uh. Do not try to steal
my clients, all right?

949
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,506
- Please.
- Thank you.

950
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,342
Now how's your mom doing?
L haven't seen her in a while.

951
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,553
She's doing so good.
Her and my dad actually just got back.

952
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,221
- They were away for three weeks.
- Really?

953
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,909
- Shopping. Shopping.
- Yeah, shopping.

954
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,475
Paris Fashion Week.
That's when my family suddenly

955
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,186
- needs to get international as well.
- Exactly.

956
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,731
- OMG. Excuse me!
- Big shot with all her...

957
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,858
- Miss Hathaway!
- Who are you yelling at?

958
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,860
- Miss Hathaway!
- Who is that?

959
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,530
- You just wait and see.
- Who's that?

960
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,991
- Who is it? l don't know.
- Oh my God, Vidal,

961
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,368
- l was gonna call you...
- Prime's new girlfriend.

962
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,296
Tomorrow and say
thank you for everything.

963
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,997
- How are you, sweetie?
- L'm good.

964
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,665
Wait, what are you doing here?

965
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,501
Aren't you supposed to be
having breakfast in bed?

966
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,910
No, l'm here to pick up a to-go order
for my grandmother.

967
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:48,550
Where are my manners?
Ladies, this is Skylar.

968
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,802
- Skylar, this is Katalina...
- Hi.

969
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,012
- Carnegie...
- Hi.

970
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,430
What was your name again, baby?

971
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:57,517
- Mira.
- Yeah, mirror... get one.

972
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,978
L could break you in two, man.

973
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,938
- Hello.
- Hi.

974
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,691
This is Dylan and that's Autumn
over there in the corner.

975
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,985
Hi. l remember you
from the other night.

976
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,945
- Hi.
- Nice to see you again.

977
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,032
Wait a second.
How do you two know each other?

978
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,201
We ran into each other
the other night at Prime's party.

979
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,746
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

980
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,123
Grab a seat, sweetie.

981
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,625
Your food isn't ready.

982
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,835
- Oh, thanks.
- Grab a seat.

983
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,212
Well, how did it go?
Tell me all about it.

984
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,131
- Oh, ladies.
- What?

985
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,592
L had the pleasure
of dressing Miss Skylar

986
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,928
for the fabulous evening
with Mr. Prime Alexander.

987
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,931
Okay.

988
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,850
- Wow.
- That's really...

989
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,436
A date, huh?

990
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,229
- Mm-hmm.
- You have a good time?

991
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,939
Oh yeah, it was really nice.

992
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,651
L mean, we just went and had dinner,
walked in the park.

993
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,653
Please,
don't try to downplay it.

994
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,614
She got the works...
hair, makeup, everything.

995
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,492
And then he sent her to my place
to pick out a fabulous outfit.

996
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,993
- Wow.
Mm-hmm.

997
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,663
- Wow.
- Sounds quite familiar.

998
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,040
Reminds me of Dallas.
L hate him.

999
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,044
You had a nice time, huh?

1000
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,506
Yeah, l did. He's absolutely
the sweetest guy l've ever met.

1001
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:10,965
He's just really nice.

1002
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,386
Wow.
The biggest sweetheart ever?

1003
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,971
- Dylan.
- No, l mean, wow.

1004
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,432
Well, you know
that Autumn dated Prime

1005
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,143
and he wasn't the biggest sweetheart
to her near the end.

1006
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,813
So... it's weird.

1007
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,148
Huh? No, l mean
she should know.

1008
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,192
She should know
what she's getting into, right?

1009
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,487
Look look. We don't even know her
and we don't even owe her anything

1010
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,447
to even explain
what happened with Autumn,

1011
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,825
make her relive
the experience, so...

1012
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,577
l don't think we really need
to explain anything.

1013
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,414
L'm gonna let you guys
eat your lunch. Thanks.

1014
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,457
Skylar, wait.
Look, l'm sorry.

1015
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,711
She's my cousin.
L get a little protective.

1016
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,463
But l do think
that you should know

1017
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,092
what you're getting yourself
into before you go too deep.

1018
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,557
Please stay.

1019
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,353
Honestly, l really didn't know.

1020
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,191
Lf you don't mind me asking,

1021
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,318
what happened?

1022
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,988
That's a very good question.

1023
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,615
Honestly, l don't know
what happened.

1024
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,994
We got into this fight,
and then the next thing l know

1025
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,496
he's like cursing me out in public,

1026
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,499
throwing my things out,
calling out my name.

1027
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,503
Lt's just... what l thought was a little
fight was the end of my relationship.

1028
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,297
Ls that what happened
the other night?

1029
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,550
Yup.

1030
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,844
L wish someone would've
given me the heads up

1031
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,637
about Dallas.
L hate that motherfucker.

1032
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,347
L really do hate him.
L'm sorry. l hate him.

1033
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,391
- Hate him.
- L'm sorry. Who's Dallas?

1034
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,436
He's one of Prime's friends.

1035
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,313
Seriously, just like Autumn,

1036
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:51,441
for the first couple of months
he was like a fucking unicorn.

1037
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,485
L mean, calling two,
three times a day,

1038
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,779
emailing... the whole nine.

1039
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,031
Then l spent the night with him
and guess what.

1040
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,741
The whole next day, nothing.

1041
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,076
So Mira and l go to the bar,
get a few drinks.

1042
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,788
And he is cuddled up
with some other chick

1043
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,248
wearing the exact same
bracelet he gave me.

1044
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,000
So anyways, l confronted him

1045
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,878
and he basically had me
in the bathroom crying.

1046
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,089
And that's when Mira
and Autumn were like...

1047
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,057
l'm sorry, Dylan was there too, sorry...
"Go out there and confront him.

1048
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,928
He's out there having
a great time with those girls."

1049
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,263
She actually looked like a hooker.

1050
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,517
Anyways, so l went out there
and l called him out on his shit.

1051
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,811
L handled some business,
didn't l, girls?

1052
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,771
- She did too.
L did.

1053
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,940
But that's exactly
what she should've done,

1054
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,234
because those guys...
they do it to everybody,

1055
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,361
they get away with it
and nobody says anything.

1056
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:38,947
Dallas, Kalif, Prime...

1057
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,867
- l don't know about Lonzo.
- Birds of a feather do flock together.

1058
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,619
- Hey, watch it.
- Yes they do.

1059
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,871
- We don't know. We don't know.
- They do.

1060
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,748
- We need to put a stop to it.
- That's like saying

1061
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,834
l'm drinking as much
as this one over here.

1062
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,502
- Girl, you go.
- What?

1063
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,462
Really? Birds of a feather
flock together?

1064
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,422
- Cut off.
- L'm celebrating.

1065
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,591
- l'm celebrating.
- Oh, hold on.

1066
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,678
Look, all the ladies are trying
to say is just be careful.

1067
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,429
That's all.

1068
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,933
Okay. Thanks.

1069
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,019
L'm gonna go.
Lt was nice meeting you ladies.

1070
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,146
- l'm sorry if we...
Nice meeting you too.

1071
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,731
- Just letting you know.
- Lt was... yeah.

1072
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,276
- Just take care.
- Thanks.

1073
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:45,221
How is it that you're not
like Kalif, Dallas and Prime?

1074
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,850
What do you mean?

1075
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,104
Look, l've known
you guys for a while now

1076
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,940
and you know they're shady.

1077
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,610
L wouldn't even talk to you
if l thought you were like them.

1078
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,904
- Katalina, they are not shady.
- Tsk.

1079
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,323
They're not. l'm telling you.

1080
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,742
Look, l've known those guys
my whole life, practically.

1081
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,912
L met Prime when l was
eight years old, for crying out loud.

1082
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,663
L used to be taller
than that fool back then.

1083
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,582
L swear to God.

1084
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,709
- Then we met Kalif in high school...
- Wow.

1085
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,045
And Dallas in college.

1086
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,005
They're good guys.

1087
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,132
Their problem is they love women.

1088
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,800
What's so bad about that?

1089
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,720
Okay, but...

1090
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,014
let's say a girl
really really likes a guy

1091
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,822
and she's in it
for all the right reasons.

1092
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,517
- Mm-hmm.
- They're just chilling,

1093
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,561
seeing where things go.

1094
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,731
And they finally sleep together,
then he dumps her.

1095
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,610
Someone that
does this repeatedly...

1096
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,445
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that's a good guy?

1097
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,156
That's not fair. lt's not.

1098
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,908
- Mm-hmm.
- Lt's not.

1099
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,993
Besides, Autumn brought
that shit upon herself.

1100
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,120
- You know that.
- L know for a fact

1101
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,914
that Autumn is not the only
woman he's done that to.

1102
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,583
Okay okay, first off...
first off...

1103
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,544
you can't say that. lt's a completely
different situation, babe.

1104
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,713
All right? Think about it.

1105
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,007
They were dating for over a year.

1106
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,052
- Right?
- Yeah.

1107
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,054
Okay, and he was
really good to her.

1108
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
Look, regardless of all this crap,

1109
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,687
that's their life, right?

1110
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,022
What happened between them
is between them.

1111
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,857
L'm cool with that.

1112
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,530
Look, what you need
to be focusing on right now

1113
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:28,783
is not what Prime and Autumn
were doing.

1114
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:34,080
Mmm, it's that you will
never do that to me.

1115
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,291
You understand me?

1116
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,252
You know l won't, baby.

1117
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,797
- You promise?
- L promise.

1118
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,719
C'mon.

1119
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,323
- What are you doing here, Autumn?
- Nice new car.

1120
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,325
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

1121
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,954
Why haven't you returned
any of my phone calls?

1122
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,290
L tried to contact you
for over a month now.

1123
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,375
L got your emails,
l got your messages,

1124
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,045
but Prime insists that we don't speak.

1125
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,589
And being that things
are really good with us...

1126
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,841
- Ah.
- ...l don't think that we should either.

1127
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,134
Okay. Oh, l see.

1128
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,220
Look, l'm not trying
to tell you anything.

1129
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,932
Okay? l just have something
you simply need to see.

1130
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,477
We'll just take a short ride.

1131
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,063
Lt won't take long
and l will never bother you again.

1132
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,774
Okay, you're crazy if you think
l'm going anywhere with you.

1133
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,485
No one asked you to.
You have a fancy new car.

1134
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,655
Follow me. Trust me,
you'll wanna see this.

1135
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,473
Okay, so you brought me
to a kid's birthday party.

1136
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,184
Look a little bit closer.

1137
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,197
Now shoot. Shoot. Oh!

1138
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,615
L think we gotta get it again.

1139
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,909
Come on.
All right, there you go.

1140
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:23,040
Oh, good job, little fella.

1141
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,970
- Guys, hey.
- Go on wit' your mommy.

1142
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,263
Let's go.

1143
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,605
Hey, Skylar, Skylar,
you don't wanna do this right here.

1144
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,933
Hey, wait a sec, wait a sec.
Wait. Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1145
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,860
- Skylar, Skylar.
- Really? Really, Prime?

1146
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,945
- Look, baby, l can explain.
- Explain what?

1147
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,822
That you have a wife?
That you have kids?

1148
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,908
- Uh...
- How are you gonna explain this?

1149
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:01,037
- l can't. Not here.
- L trusted you.

1150
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,581
Everybody tried to warn me
and l trusted you.

1151
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,249
You know what, Skylar?
Please,

1152
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,043
- let me take you home.
- Stop stop.

1153
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,879
Look...

1154
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,215
What is wrong with you?
Why would you do this?

1155
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,218
L'm not one of these groupie girls
out here trying to trap you.

1156
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:19,305
- Why would you treat me like l was one?
- Skylar. Baby, listen.

1157
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,308
Look, let's just talk
about this later.

1158
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,685
All right? Just...
it's not what it looks like.

1159
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,021
L have listened
to everything that you said,

1160
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,357
every single thing
that you have told me.

1161
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,067
L listened and l believed you.

1162
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,027
What is wrong with you?

1163
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,613
You have a family, Prime.

1164
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,616
You have a fucking family.

1165
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,786
Uh...
- L hate you.

1166
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:02,848
♪ Looking back
it's all clear to me ♪

1167
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,644
♪ Should have known it all along... ♪

1168
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,108
l trusted him.
Like...

1169
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,111
l did everything
that l could for him,

1170
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:17,280
and he still did this.

1171
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,285
They always win.

1172
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,663
At least you found out now
and not like a year from now.

1173
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,583
Listen, you two are much stronger
women than l am.

1174
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,335
Lf l had been at that birthday party,

1175
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,629
ooh, no, some people
would've gone down.

1176
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,673
L mean kids, baby mamas,

1177
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,092
like the jumping castle...
something.

1178
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,469
But she still can.
So can we.

1179
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,264
They humiliated us publicly.

1180
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:46,350
Let's do it to them.

1181
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,185
L don't know, Carnegie.

1182
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,271
- How?
- Just think, okay?

1183
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,940
Prime always has
a million cameras in his face.

1184
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,651
So call him out on his shit

1185
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,570
like l did with Dallas.

1186
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,656
You really think that that worked?

1187
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,783
You thought that did something?

1188
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,245
L'm sorry, but he's probably been with
at least three women since you.

1189
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,373
L hate him so much.

1190
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,793
L don't know what l even saw in him.
He has a unicorn tattoo.

1191
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,545
He probably waxes his butthole.

1192
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,925
Look, what are you trying
to get out of this?

1193
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,553
Honestly, what are you
trying to propose that we do?

1194
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:27,475
L mean, l get why you're angry
and why Skylar's pissed, but...

1195
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,894
Oh, so l don't have a reason
to be hurt, Katalina?

1196
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,104
Ls that it? Really?

1197
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,607
L mean, come on.

1198
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,651
Autumn, you knew
that Prime had a fiancée.

1199
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,862
So it's not like
it's some surprise to you.

1200
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,448
Okay, fuck that. No one really
cares what you have to say.

1201
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,493
Okay, boo boo?
And first of all,

1202
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,203
yes, l knew he had children,

1203
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,497
and no, l did not know
he had a fiancée.

1204
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,415
And when l finally found out,

1205
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,667
he told me that he was
no longer with her, so...

1206
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:58,047
No, exactly. And doesn't Kennedy
live in Louisiana or something?

1207
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,340
- Exactly.
Lf he told her

1208
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:03,302
that they weren't together anymore,
why wouldn't she believe him?

1209
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,805
So you thought you would be
the one to change him,

1210
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,972
when he's the type
that wouldn't change for anyone,

1211
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,683
unless he was forced to.

1212
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,396
Okay, that's like not expecting
a scorpion to sting you.

1213
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,940
Okay, you know what?
L am not gonna justify

1214
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,109
my feelings for any of you,
especially you.

1215
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,653
The point is that you stayed!

1216
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:24,198
You stayed! Look, we all know
the risk of dating an athlete,

1217
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,409
especially Prime Alexander.

1218
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,369
But l didn't. l didn't know.

1219
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,538
What did l do?
What did l do that was

1220
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,208
- so bad that l deserve this?
- Nothing.

1221
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:38,087
L gave Prime a year of my life.

1222
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,257
All the broken promises.

1223
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,926
He sold me on this idea

1224
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,221
of like a fairy-tale life.

1225
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,098
Where's my happy ending?

1226
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,725
You know what?

1227
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,213
How much do we have to put up with
before they realize that

1228
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,648
they can't just break our hearts
and pretend like nothing happened?

1229
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:01,026
- But that's Prime Alexander.
- Oh my God.

1230
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,280
And nobody is going
to change Prime Alexander!

1231
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,117
Unless we force him to.

1232
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,079
What they did to us was cruel

1233
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,248
and it was wrong.

1234
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,543
And they need to be held accountable
for their actions.

1235
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,755
Look, you can't make somebody change
that doesn't want to change.

1236
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,134
- You just can't.
- Yes, you can.

1237
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:29,680
Listen, all you have to do
is use everything about them

1238
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,640
against them.

1239
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,852
Quickly, without remorse.

1240
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,897
They get their strength
from running in a pack like dogs.

1241
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,608
You shake up the bonds,
destroy the pack.

1242
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,526
Exactly.

1243
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,322
You're right.

1244
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,826
Let's do it.

1245
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,466
Hi, yes,
l'm with Pryor Lamborghini

1246
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:09,762
and we have a lease on a car that's
in arrears that needs to be picked up.

1247
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,765
Yes, l know exactly where
it's going to be on Saturday.

1248
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,978
The license plates
read "work"... W-O-R-K.

1249
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,482
- Yes.
- Hello?

1250
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,318
Hi, l'd like to report someone.

1251
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,946
L know seven women
he's given herpes to...

1252
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,281
well, probably more than that.

1253
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:33,994
His name?
Lt's Dallas Lauderdale.

1254
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,789
Yeah, l'll hold.

1255
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,043
Mira, it's your turn!

1256
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,146
- Hello?
- Shanita?

1257
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,691
This is Shanita.

1258
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,777
This is Mr. Prime Alexander's
publicist, Dahni.

1259
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,779
Okay.

1260
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,658
Prime is setting up a special surprise
for Mr. Kalif Wyatt

1261
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,828
at the upcoming Rico Terrell gala
and would like you to attend.

1262
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,872
- Okay.
- Great!

1263
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,208
He'll send a car for you
at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.

1264
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,628
And he asks that
you keep this a secret.

1265
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,880
Thank you.

1266
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,931
Now this is completely
anonymous though, right?

1267
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,309
L mean, you're my girl
and l'm sending this to you

1268
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,019
'cause l want you to get the scoop,

1269
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,187
but l can't have this traced back to me.

1270
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,485
Okay.
Are you ready for this?

1271
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:53,157
Well, have you heard
a little rumor about Kalif Wyatt

1272
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:57,369
and his very very close boyfriends?

1273
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,498
Gay clubs and stripping.

1274
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,376
And, honey, l have a picture,

1275
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,962
and l am sending it to you

1276
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,215
right... now.

1277
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,262
You are welcome.
Girl, you're my sorority sister.

1278
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,972
L gotta hook you up.

1279
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,643
Hell yeah, you can come through.

1280
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,311
You gotta bring a friend though.

1281
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,689
Yo, l gotta get out of this mall, girl.

1282
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,733
L'm feeling all eyes from all guys.

1283
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,569
- Holy shit. Hey, Kalif.
- This is crazy.

1284
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,858
- Yo, hold up.
- What? Kalif?

1285
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,822
Yo, how you know
my name, little man?

1286
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,992
Oh, baby, l make it a point to keep up
with all the available ass out there.

1287
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,036
What? What the hell
you talking about, man?

1288
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:42,498
Please, like you haven't
been on whobangingwho.com.

1289
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,751
- Who what?
- They got the whole exposé,

1290
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,920
exposing your love for the boys.

1291
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,797
Love for the boys?
Man, l'm all about the ladies,

1292
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,965
and the ladies know it.
Ask your girl, she know.

1293
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,927
- What? Excuse you.
- L'm just going based off what l read.

1294
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,680
What you read?
You read wrong, homey. Who what?

1295
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,088
Yo, look, l don't know what
the hell y'all talking about.

1296
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,642
L'm out. l feeling
too much of a sugar rush

1297
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,727
- in this motherfucker.
- Let's go.

1298
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,231
Dallas.

1299
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,404
- Yeah, Dad? What's up?
- What the hell is this?

1300
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,240
- l don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1301
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:19,118
- lt's you, isn't it?
- Well yeah, but l don't know whose cam...

1302
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,619
Oh, yes you do!

1303
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,205
L'm telling you,
l have no idea how it got there.

1304
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,541
This is going to kill your mother.

1305
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,710
Lt's all over the lnternet!

1306
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,671
Lt's in everybody's inboxes.
You need to get out of here,

1307
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:32,881
take one or two months.
Just get out of here!

1308
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,009
- l swear, Dad, l...
- No. Dallas, we're done.

1309
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,178
Fuck.

1310
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,356
Crap.

1311
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,277
- Yo.
- Somebody emailed

1312
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,738
everybody at my dad's company
my game tapes,

1313
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,781
and he damn near fired me!

1314
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:01,785
- Wait. What?
- How did it get out there, Prime?

1315
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,163
Yo, man, why you asking me?

1316
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,707
L don't know.
L don't be watching your game tapes.

1317
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,668
Autumn.

1318
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,421
What?

1319
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,132
Nothing, man.
Lemme call you back.

1320
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,301
Yeah, whatever.

1321
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,015
Where is she?

1322
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:26,059
Hi. May l help you
with something?

1323
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,145
Where is Autumn, Dylan?

1324
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:32,483
L'm sorry.
She's not here. Why?

1325
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,526
She knows why.

1326
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,822
You tell her l know she did it.

1327
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,908

Yo, that...

Oh shit, man! What?

1374
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,224
You saw me and you didn't

1375
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,511
- That was you?
- We supposed to be boys, man!

1376
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,473
Dude, l tried calling you. What the hell?

01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,227
Look! l need to know right now...

1379

How the hell all of us gonna have

- All my cards were canceled.

1388
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,463
$100-million man

1389
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,131
What kind of shit is that?

1390
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,677
All this can't be
a coincidence, can it?

1391
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,805
All right, look, l don't know

Dude, we've gotta get

1394
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,654
Mr. Alexander!

1395
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,781
Mr. Alexander,

1396
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:11,410
Prime! Over here, please, sir.
A really quick interview.

1397
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,663
Thank you so much, sir.
Mr. Alexander.

1398
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,416
- Hi, how are you doing tonight?
- Great.

1399
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,501
- Wow, you look really great.
- Thank you.

Rico Terrell Benefit Gala
for sickle-cell anemia.

1402
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,550
What makes this such
an important cause for you?

1403
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,468
Well, when l was a rookie,
l volunteered

1404
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:31,805
at the children's hospital
and l met so many amazing children

1405
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,557
who suffer from this disease.

1406
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,726
And l vowed right then
that l was gonna do

1407
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,769
all that l could
to help fund research

1408
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,689
to find a cure one day.
And l kept my word.

1409
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,566
That is awesome.

1410
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,818
How much have you raised
this year so far?

1411
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,320
Well, at this point with this event,

1412
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,740
we've raised $3.5 million.

1413
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,701
Congrats. That's truly
a great accomplishment.

1414
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,996
Oh, and next year
we'll do $5 million.

1415
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:58,123
Wow. Thank you
so much for your time.

1416
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,375
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.

1417
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,902
So what's up, baby?

1418
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,196
Yo, deal me out.

- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

1422
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,798
Mmm, Prime set all this up.
He wanted to surprise you.

1423
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,675
- Oh my gosh, this place is beautiful.
- Tell me about it.

1424
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,603
You know he always got
a trick up his sleeve.

1425
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:56,014
No, l mean, he didn't really set it up.
His publicist did.

1426
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,101
But anything for my baby.
You know l was gonna be here.

1427

- Hey.
- Hey.

1529
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,897
L was surprised
to hear from you.

1530
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,276
L was surprised that
l texted you.

1531
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,321
Mm-hmm.

1532
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,780
Here you go.

1533
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,326
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1534
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:40,955
So?

1535
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,003
L'm not ready to forgive you
for what you did.

1536
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,759
L gave you everything that l had
and you really hurt me.

1537
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,639
Why didn't you just tell me
you had kids and a girl from the jump?

1538
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:02,185
Um, l thought
you would leave if l did.

1539
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:05,188
That doesn't give you
the right to take that choice from me.

1540
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,067
You're right.
L'm sorry.

1541
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,152
L guess l wasn't thinking.

1542
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,529
You said that everything
isn't what it appears.

1543
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,657
So explain.

1544
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,663
My kids mean everything to me.

1545
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:26,000
And l'll do whatever it takes
in order to be with them.

1546
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,797
So you're basically saying
that you're only with Kennedy

1547
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,840
so that she doesn't take
your kids from you.

1548
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,217
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

1549
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:35,968
Her family's from Louisiana

1550
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:39,097
and she would take them there.

1551
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,141
- l know she would.
- So where does that leave me?

1552
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,436
Skylar.

1553
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:49,732
Look, yo, l care for you.
L really do.

1554
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,738
- Please believe...
- Ls this seat taken?

1555
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,075
Uh, Kennedy.

1556
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,327
Thanks for the call, Skylar.

1557
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,163
Why don't you scoot over?

1558
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,383
L'm gonna let you guys talk.

1559
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,301
No no no, please stay.

1560
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:21,055
You have just as much
a right to be here as l do.

1561
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,813
You're looking all scared.

1562
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,066
What, you don't have
anything to say?

1563
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,486
No lies, no excuses?

1564
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,364
We're all here now.

1565
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:40,992
Talk.

1566
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,877
So you're the girl
from the website, huh?

1567
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,255
She's a bit younger than Autumn.

1568
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,092
How's your grandmother?

1569
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,053
Excuse me?

1570
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,557
Oh.

1571
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:08,227
Oh, you thought l didn't know about you
until you called this morning?

1572
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,524
Come on, l know everything
that Prime does.

1573
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,193
Everything...

1574
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,572
from the helicopter rides
to the shopping sprees

1575
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,158
to the condo
on East Lake Drive.

1576
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:23,868
Everything.

1577
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,415
L know what you're thinking.

1578
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,043
Lf l know this, why don't l leave?

1579
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,297
Because l love him.

1580
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,550
He's the father of my children.

1581
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,429
And l love his ass.

1582
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,520
What you need to know,
Miss Thing,

1583
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:54,023
is before you get
romantically involved with a man,

1584
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:57,819
make sure you know everything
there is to know about him.

1585
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:04,283
You see, arrogant, selfish,

1586
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:07,119
rich individuals like my fiancé,

1587
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,290
they prey upon sweet
innocent women...

1588
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,460
like you.

1589
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,881
L know he hurt you.

1590
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,300
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have called.

1591
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,637
And l'm sorry for that.

1592
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,808
But trust me,

1593
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,769
he won't hurt you again.

1594
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,149
Now if you'll excuse us,

1595
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:40,069
my fiancé and l have
a few things to discuss.

1596
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:53,165
What did l tell you the last time?

1597
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,964
L told you if you do this
to me again, it's over.

1598
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,968
L can't put up with this.

1599
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,554
L won't.

1600
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,101
L've been here with you
through everything, Prime.

1601
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,229
Everything.

1602
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,526
L'm the mother of your children.

1603
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,572
Does that mean nothing to you?

1604
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:30,286
L've dealt with this before
and l'm not dealing with it again.

1605
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,624
L can't sit around
until you figure out

1606
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,084
if you want to be
what you should be.

1607
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,339
Look. Look, baby.

1608
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,218
L'm sorry.

1609
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:48,930
Kennedy, l... l don't...

1610
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,973
No, just stop it.

1611
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:55,061
L'm done.

1612
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,857
L'm done.

1613
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,985
L am so done.

1614
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:08,866
You know, you want to be
the $100-million playboy?

1615
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,828
So be it.

1616
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,292
Me and the kids are leaving.

1617
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:21,879
L'm going back to Louisiana.

1618
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,424
- You're just...
- Baby.

1619
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:35,935
Oh yeah.

1620
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,909
Lce cream?
You wanna go get ice cream?

1621
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,370
- All girls like ice cream.
- Well, that's true.

1622
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,665
Umm, Prime. Pri... excu...

1623
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,292
Pri... excuse me.
Prime, you can't go back there!

1624
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,337
My fucking life, you stupid-ass bitch!

1625
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,173
L should kill your fucking ass!
L should kill your ass!

1626
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,426
Prime, no!
Get... Que!

1627
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,678
- Oh my God!
- Prime! Prime! Let's go, man.

1628
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,304
L'm calling the police!

1629
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,598
Yes, it's an emergency.

1630
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,226
Prime Alexander attacked my cousin.

1631
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:18,955
- Come on, man. Calm down.
- Get off me!

1632
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,105
Camelback and 24th.
Lt's a boutique,

1633
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,941
Autumn de Brise.
Please... please hurry.

1634
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,443
Please. Autumn?

1635
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,494
L just know there's
so much stupid drama.

1636
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,957
L can't believe this shit.

1637
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,418
Fucking asshole.

1638
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:45,212
Oh my God.

1639
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,424
Take a breath. Outside, come on.

1640
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,217
We need to deal with it.

1641
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,512
Okay?

1642
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:59,727
- Hey, thank you, guys, for coming.
- You okay?

1643
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,771
- What happened?
- He attacked me.

1644
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,978
- Did you press charges?
- Are all of you happy now?

1645
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:06,347
- We're not gonna talk about...
- You got what you wanted?

1646
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:09,570
- Let's go.
- You wanted to humiliate me?

1647
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,197
You know what?
Fuck you, Prime!

1648
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,044
Fuck you! You got exactly
what you deserve!

1649
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,156
And you need to be glad
that l didn't press charges.

1650
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,920
L can't believe how far
y'all took this shit!

1651
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,497
Uploading pictures on the lnternet,
calling my baby mama!

1652
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,333
And to torture me?
L ain't done nothing to none of y'all!

1653
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:24,919
Lt don't make any difference.

1654
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:27,213
L mean, even with all this,

1655
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,382
me and my boys,
we gonna still do us.

1656
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,969
Mm-hmm, you and your boys?
You'll still do you, right?

1657
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:37,181
'Cause you're so close, right?
Best friends?

1658
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,558
- Let's go.
- No no. 'Cause you're so close?

1659
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,519
Hmm, let me think.
Did Dallas tell you

1660
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,896
that l've been fucking him
for the last two months?

1661
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,523
- Oh shit.
- Hey.

1662
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,316
- Are you kidding?
- What?

1663
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,524
You've been having sex
with Dallas this entire time!

1664
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,320
- Wow.
- Are you serious?

1665
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,364
This isn't about that, all right?

1666
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,412
So you eating off
my sloppy seconds, l see, huh?

1667
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,827
That's how she found
the fucking sex tapes.

1668
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,746
You know, all this proves
is how much of a ho you are,

1669
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:04,291
just like you were cheating on me
with Jeff Trepagnier.

1670
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,461
Seriously? She wasn't
cheating on you with Jeff.

1671
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,005
She was cheating on Jeff
with you, you arrogant...

1672
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,341
- Let's go. You don't need this.
- Yeah, that's right.

1673
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:15,010
Do the math.
Do the math, Prime.

1674
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,304
L was with him when l met you.

1675
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,390
Autumn, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1676
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,642
You just gonna roll down
the assembly line?

1677
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,435
Ls that what you gonna do?
Hmm?

1678
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,480
- What about Kalif?
- Yeah, where my slice at?

1679
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,440
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe l should.

1680
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,234
Then maybe l'll be
just like Prime,

1681
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,444
especially since
he fucked Katalina.

1682
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,156
- What?
- Yeah, you thought l didn't know.

1683
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,449
- Really?
- What is wrong with you?

1684
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,451
- What is wrong with...
- Yeah, why are you starting shit?

1685
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:42,538
Prime and Katalina?
Prime and Katalina never hooked up.

1686
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:44,415
Really?

1687
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,292
Prime?

1688
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,588
Hey. Um, look, man,

1689
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,048
that was a long
long time ago, man.

1690
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,467
Don't get worked up
over that. This...

1691
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,178
Don't get worked...

1692
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,096
The fuck's he doing, man! Chill out!

1693
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,681
- Hey, Lonzo! Hey!
- Chill!

1694
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,392
- Relax!
- Man, l would've told you

1695
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,770
a fucking long time ago!
Lt was before you even knew her!

1696
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,064
- 1080 for life, huh?
- Chill out, man?

1697
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,483
- Really?
- Look. Baby, listen.

1698
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,694
- Don't "baby" me.
- Lt was a long... l tried to tell you!

1699
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,822
This whole thing was part
of your plan, wasn't it?

1700
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,490
- This whole thing, right?
- This had nothing to do with us.

1701
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:21,243
Nothing to do with us.
- Lt's all your sick little revenge.

1702
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,829
- You know... shut up!
- Fuck you, Autumn!

1703
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,497
- l bet you wish you could!
- Hey! Stop! Stop!

1704
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:28,459
That's enough!
Lt's enough!

1705
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:30,544
You know what?
L don't even need this shit.

1706

No, you can ask,

Thanks.

1737
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:11,121
Look, l... l know you probably
hate me right now,

1738
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,958
but l just wanted
an opportunity to explain.

1739
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,795
Explain what?

1740
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,466
The fact that you slept
with my best friend?

1741
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,010
Yeah, you know what, Katalina?

1742
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,304
L think that's pretty
self-explanatory, don't you?

1743
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:33,644
Look, l dated Prime
before l knew you...

1744
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:35,312
two years ago.

1745
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,315
We just went on two dates.
That was it.

1746
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,318
- You should've told me.
- L tried.

1747
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,566
- You didn't want to hear...
- You should've tried...

1748
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:47,324
you should've tried
a little harder.

1749
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,538
You know what?

1750
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,541
Just make sure you get
something to eat. Okay?

1751
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,751
What?

1752
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:00,129
Really, Lonzo?

1753
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:01,630
Really?

1754
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:06,427
So, what, you want me to act
like this never happened?

1755
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:10,931
You just expect me
to let the best thing

1756
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,101
that's ever happened to me
just walk right out of my life?

1757
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,690
All l can do is
see him when l see you.

1758
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,402
Huh-uh.

1759
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:29,283
What do you want me to do?

1760
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:31,034
L want you to try.

1761
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:35,539
Don't push me away.
Just try.

1762
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,961
L think what we have
is worth it.

1763
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,759
L love you...

1764
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,470

Me too.

1766
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,267
L don't know what
you want me to do

1767
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,728
to prove that,
to make you see that.

1768
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:00,355
L'll do anything.
You just tell me what you want.

1769

L don't know.

1770
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,704
Lt's not that easy.

Katalina's birthday.
