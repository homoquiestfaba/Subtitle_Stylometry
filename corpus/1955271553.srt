00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,690
Look.

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,220
You'll get the hang of it.

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,920
Yeah.

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,150
Okay.

6
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,410
There you go.

7
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
Where did you put the food?

8
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm starving.

9
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,200
Oh, God, I...

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,060
... I put the food by the door.

11
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,930
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,170
I'll get you something else.

13
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:07,970
I'm okay.

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,860
No.

15
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,100
You're exhausted and 
 you need something to eat.

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,140
I will go get you something.

17
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,730
Okay, lie down.

18
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,380
 This stuff they brought 
 eariler was fucking disgusting.

19
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,510
 I know it was disgusting.

20
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,310
Could you not say...

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,540
... "fucking" around the baby?

22
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,690
Maybe, just like...

23
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,440
Give it a week?

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,160
-Don't you think?  
 - Yeah, one week.

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,240
Okay, one week, alright? Lie down.

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,380
Okay.

27
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,130
I'll be back in a minute, alright?

28
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,670
Your daddy's gonna get your mommy

29
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,300
 - some fucking food  
 - A week.

30
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,080
And he better fucking hurry.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,420
Yeah, it's very funny.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,130
Hm, hey, excuse me,  
 do you know where...  is there a...

33
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,360
Okay.

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,590
Erin.

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
-Jonah.  
 - Hi.

36
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,590
Hi.

37
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,590
Hey, I...

38
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,130
I thought you moved to Brooklyn.

39
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,270
Yeah, no, I did, I umm...

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,830
My mom still lives, here, so.

41
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,470
I'm here, with her for...

42
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,470
... for a little while, I think.

43
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,280
I heard you were still at the college.

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,300
Um, yeah.

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,530
- Teaching, or?  
 - Yeah, I'm a professor now.

46
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,790
Wow, that was fast.

47
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,830
Yeah.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,850
 - Umm...  
 - I hope it's nothing too serious, is it?

49
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,080
Yeah, you know, uh...

50
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,420
It's tough, she's...

51
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,420
 - ... not even 60.  
 - Oh.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,810
Shit, I'm sorry.

53
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,810
- Yeah, it's... 
 - I'm sorry. I really always liked her.

54
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,040
Yeah, she really liked you too.

55
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,590
You actually...

56
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,500
... you actually made quite the impression on her.

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,430
She's um...

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,370
... been kind of tough on my boyfriends 
 ever since we broke up.

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,500
No, come on.

60
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,400
No, really.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,100
Um, are you okay?

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Um...

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,940
Well, my wife...

65
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,410
Uh...

66
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,170
Uh, Amy, she uh...

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,800
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry. 
 - Oh, oh...

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh, yeah, thank you.

69
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,100
Thanks.

70
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,610
What took you so long?

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,310
Uh, nothing.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Everything was closed, sorry.

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,740
It's alright.

74
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,630
Isabelle, it's only me. Isabelle, look at me.

75
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,020
It's okay.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,840
You're okay.

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,420
<i>It's very difficult conditions of work.</i>

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,430
<i>You have no infrastructure.</i>
<i>It's very difficult conditions of work.</i>

79
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,470
<i>You have no infrastructure.</i>

80
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,310
<i>When you get to places, </i>

81
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,950
<i>you just have to wait most of the time. </i>

82
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,910
<i>Very often, we would be working 
 together somewhere. </i>

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
<i>Photographers everywhere. </i>

84
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,500
<i>Something would happen, </i>

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>they go to it like bees. </i>

86
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,190
<i>Looking at the same thing 
 Focus on the same thing. </i>

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,370
<i>She'd get the shot.</i>

88
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>Using memorable images under extreme hazard. </i>

89
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,940
<i>Congratulations... </i>

90
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,070
<i>When I first started, I thought the job was</i>

91
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,580
<i>to get as close as possible. </i>

92
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,580
<i>The exciting part was probably 
what drew me to it. </i>

93
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,770
<i>Then I became confused and I thought I</i>

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,900
<i>I had to stay. </i>

95
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,450
<i>Until after the tanks had left to</i>

96
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,880
<i>- to show the damage, maybe the... 
 - The consequences</i>

97
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,460
<i>- the tole of war. 
 - Yes, the other side of the war, you have </i>

98
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,320
<i>The thing that most of my photographs, 
 my recent photographs</i>

99
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
<i>are the testimony of.</i>

100
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,830
<i>How long will you do this? </i>

101
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,830
<i>And when will you know it's time? </i>

102
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,060
<i>I think it's...</i>

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,050
<i>Yes, if...</i>

104
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,210
<i>It's my responsibility.</i>

105
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,930
<i>No, I don't think I should stop. </i>

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,140
<i>Why should I?</i>

107
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,250
<i>In a twisted fate.</i>

108
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,610
<i>Having finally quit the hazardous world 
 of conflict photography,</i>

109

<i>Isabelle Reed died in a car accident</i>

110
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,800
<i>less than mile from her home in Nyack, New York. </i>

111
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,030
<i>She was 57 years old. </i>

112
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,740
<i>Leaving behind her husband, </i>

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,820
<i>and two sons. </i>

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
Well, you get the idea.

115
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,400
It has to be this brief.

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,600
People don't like to watch

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,460
long films as part of an exhibition.

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,570
Sure. Sure.

119
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,640
Well, it seems...

120
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Seems totally fine to me.

121
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,140
Some of the prints of her photos are

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,790
are already done.

123
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,340
Did you see them, on the way out?

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,230
Oh, no, I didn't get a chance.

125
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,070
- Oh, they look great. 
 - Yeah.

126
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,190
Good.

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,890
We wanted to ask you.

128
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
I know it's been a while, but

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,720
Have you kept any of her 
 material at your house,

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
something we can take a look at?

131
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Hm.

132
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,470
I'm afraid it's...

133
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,480
It's all a bit of a mess.

134
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,920
Could there be something 
from her last trip?

135
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,480
When she went to Syria, 
 I never saw any pictures from that.

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,400
Well...

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,210
I'll run it by Jonah and uh...

138
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,680
I don't see any reason 
 why you can't have a look.

139
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,250
- Great. 
 - We appreciate it.

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,630
They tell you I'm doing an article 
 about Isabelle?

141
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,410
For the New York Times.

142
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,520
- Kind of a built up to the exhibition. 
 - Yeah.

143
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,900
Yeah, they told me.

144
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,990
 She always thought the one in print has been

145
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,990
cropped a bit too much on the right.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,300
Right here.

147
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,030
Oh, yes, yes.

148
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,030
I see what she meant.

149
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,510
So, when I write this article,

150
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,510
I don't think I can avoid

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,810
mentioning how she died.

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,100
That is wasn't really an accident.

153
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,450
Yeah.

154
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,760
So, are you saying that you 
 want to write that she,

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,750
killed herself?

156
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,870
Gene, I don't want to be a part of 
romanticizing what we do.

157
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,870
Isabelle wouldn't either.

158
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,820
I mean this is hard.

159
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,380
It takes a tole.

160
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,560
Then...

161
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,120
Well, I...

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
I don't have to tell you 
 that is was hard on her.

163
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,610
Yeah.

164
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,580
- Yeah. 
 - So, um.

165
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,130
It's been a few years, so I...

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,540
I just wanted you and 
 the boys know before the uh...

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,020
Before the article comes out.

168
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,320
And they know what 
 really happened, right?

169
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,590
Well, Jonah obviously does.

170
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,400
But Conrad,

171
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,860
well, he was 12.

172
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,350
So...

173
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,590
That's a conversation.

174
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,440
Come here. 
 Let me show you something else.

175
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,080
<i>- Yeah? </i>
 - Hey.

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,400
- It's me. - 
 <i>- Yeah, I know dad. </i>

177
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,750
So, what are you doing?

178
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,110
<i>I'm just</i>

179
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,420
<i>with Kenneth and some others.</i>

180
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,210
Okay.

181
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,600
No, I was just wondering 
 what time you're coming home?

182
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,060
<i>Don't know.</i>

183
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,400
- I'm making tacos. 
<i> - Yeah, I'm...</i>

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
<i>I'm kinda busy right now dad. 
 I'll talk to you later. </i>

185
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,740
Hello?

186
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,520
Can I come in?

187
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,170
What are you playing?

188
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,140
Are you the girl?

189
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,200
She's a sorceress.

190
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,110
A what?

191
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,210
I play other characters too.

192
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,530
You know that meeting I had this morning?

193
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,890
Well,

194
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,560
Richard was there. 
 You remember Richard, don't you?

195
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,850
Well, he's gonna be writing this article and

196
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,580
it just reminded me that there was 
 some stuff that you and I...

197
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,490
We just needed to

198
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,160
to talk about.

199
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,400
Can you turn that off?

200
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,070
Just out it on pause.

201
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,910
Conrad, can you please turn that off.

202
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,080
Get out!

203
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,690
Get the fuck out.

204
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,490
Don't you speak to me like that.

205
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,290
I'm just trying to talk to you!

206
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,280
Alright, stop this. Stop this. 
 Stop it!

207
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,950
This isn't funny.

208
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,650
Stop it!

209
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,400
Wake up.

210
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,790
<i>'But now as he sank farther and 
farther from the waves above,'</i>

211
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,960
<i>'it wasn't the crucial moments that came to him.'</i>

212
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,310
<i>'Instead his thoughts traveled to the 
 outer reaches of his memories,'</i>

213
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,620
<i>'small events long forgotten.'</i>

214
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,130
<i>'He remembered a sentence he had read,'</i>

215
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,040
<i>'in the paper a few days a ago'</i>

216
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,120
<i>'and didn't understand.'</i>

217
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,680
<i>'He thought of,'</i>

218
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,860
<i>'an old suitcase he had'</i>

219
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,440
<i>'stored in his uncle's attic,'</i>

220
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,970
<i>'a brief glance from a stranger.'</i>

221
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,050
<i>'Inconsensual fragments all present'</i>

222
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,290
Inconsequential.

223
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,610
Inconsequential.

224
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:00,560
<i>'Inconsequential fragments all present 
 at once during his final seconds.' </i>

225
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,280
<i>'Seconds that were not seconds any more but'</i>

226
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,580
<i>'stretched out to minutes.'</i>

227
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,360
<i>'Time suspended.'</i>

228

<i>'Seconds that were not seconds any more but 
 stretched out to minutes.'</i>

229
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,010
<i>'Time suspended.'</i>

230
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
<i>What could she have been thinking? </i>

231
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,870
<i>What went through her 
 mind when she realized</i>

232
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,450
<i>the accident was unavoidable?</i>

233
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,190
<i>She remembered lying on the beach,</i>

234
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,980
<i>dozing off,</i>

235
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,230
<i>feeling the wind, 
 blowing grains of sand on her face,</i>

236
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,550
<i>thinking that if she just 
 kept still long enough</i>

237
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,170
<i>it would end up covering her.</i>

238
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,480
<i>Maybe she remembered places,</i>

239
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,640
<i>our house,</i>

240
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,950
<i>the hallway,</i>

241
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,120
<i>'the living room,</i>

242
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,510
<i>Maybe she even thought about him.</i>

243
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,000
<i>She could have</i>

244
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,690
<i>some little thing,</i>

245
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,270
<i>something he himself,</i>

246
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,750
<i>had forgotten.</i>

247
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,300
<i>Conrad!</i>

248
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,710
<i>He was hiding.</i>

249
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,240
<i>Listening to her calling out his name.</i>

250
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,700
<i>He realized now she must 
 have seen him.</i>

251
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,300
<i>All the time, he was standing there,</i>

252
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,360
<i>she just pretended not to,</i>

253
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,900
<i>never straying to far away,</i>

254
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,150
<i>always</i>

255
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,680
<i>watching him from the 
 corner of her eye.</i>

256
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,720
<i>Conrad?</i>

257
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,380
<i>Conrad?</i>

258
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,030
Conrad?

259
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,460
Well, she seems to be implying that, 
 to believe that,

260
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,520
wisdom comes with old age, 
 is a myth.

261
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,010
Wouldn't you agree?

262
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,550
- Yeah? 
 <i>- Hey!</i>

263
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,380
<i>- It's me. </i>
 - Yeah, I know dad.

264
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,050
<i>So what are you doing? </i>

265
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,180
I'm with Kenneth and some others.

266
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,000
<i>Okay. </i>

267
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,510
Mm-hm.

268
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>No, I was just wondering 
 what time you're coming home? </i>

269
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
Don't know.

270
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,070
<i>- I'm making tacos.</i> 
 - Yeah, I'm...

271
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,470
I'm kinda busy right now dad, 
 I'll talk to you later.

272
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,420
Thank you so much.

273
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,850
Can I help you?

274
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,480
<i>And then I was amazed because 
 I couldn't feel anything. </i>

275
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,870
<i>But it was like, um...</i>

276
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,010
I felt like I was,

277
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,400
- outside of it. 
 - Um-hm.

278
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,300
All I could think was,

279
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,310
this will destroy me.

280
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,750
My life will never be the same.

281
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,770
You make it sound like that 
 might be a good thing.

282
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,360
<i>And you were there too. </i>

283
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,920
<i>- Really? 
 - Yeah, just watching.</i>

284
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,390
<i>I was just watching? </i>

285
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,500
<i>I couldn't see you but 
 I smelled your cigarette. </i>

286
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,680
<i>- My cigarette? 
 - Um-hm.</i>

287
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,000
In my dream, you were a smoker.

288
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,170
So...

289
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,210
Why are you telling me this?

290
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh, I'm just wondering 
 what it means, but

291
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,760
But it's only a dream.

292
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,750
- You want me to tell you what it means? 
- Um-hm.

293
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,590
Okay.

294
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,920
You think that I'm passive and boring,

295
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,040
- uh, something like that. 
- Um.

296
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,660
But really you're bored.

297
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Because you're hanging around 
 the house all day.

298
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,850
And you want to pick a fight with me.

299
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,190
- Interesting. 
 - Um-hm.

300
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,780
- Did it touch a nerve. 
 - Yes it did touch a nerve.

301
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,340
If you don't mind me saying so.

302
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,970
This guy who's,

303
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,550
sitting there not saying anything 
 just watching,

304
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,220
But you weren't not doing -

305
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,540
No you were just, uh...

306
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,040
Was it like...

307
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,840
Was it like this -

308
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,640
Or like this -

309
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,960
Or like this -

310
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,480
I don't know, but it was very scary.

311
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,220
- Really? 
 - Um.

312
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,670
Um.

313
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,960
Hey, sleeping in?

314
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,640
- Hey! 
 - Hey.

315
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,540
- Great to see you. 
 - Hi.

316
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,020
- Good to see you too. 
 - So, uh...

317
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,890
Where's Amy and the baby?

318
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,890
Yeah, we finally decided against it.

319
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,630
It's a 6 hour drive with a baby in the car.

320
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,900
Yeah, I understand.

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,200
Sure, okay, well um...

322
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,180
Let me get dressed and 
 I'll see you in a moment.

323
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
- Okay? 
 -Sure, take your time.

324
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,260
Do you want a cup of coffee?

325
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,940
Wait, dad let's you eat that stuff?

326
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,520
Um-hm.

327
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,020
It's interesting.

328
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,570
Opps.

329
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,090
You can see that I've started there, 
 but it's just...

330
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,840
Yeah.

331
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,180
- You know, put aside some junk. 
 - Yeah.

332
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,060
Hey, you know, we can still let 
 the agency deal with this.

333
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,200
We can't give this to the gallery people.

334
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,640
I want to go through everything first.

335
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,270
Remember that tacky 
 photo book they made?

336
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,930
Listen, dad, mom was so 
 protective of her stuff, okay?

337
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,590
We wouldn't even now 
 what we'd be giving them.

338
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,560
Look at this.

339
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,340
Yes, we wouldn't want this to fall into 
 the wrong hands, would we?

340
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,290
What do you do, 
what are you even looking at here?

341
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,630
-This is your headshot? 
- Um-hm, yeah.

342
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,360
People saw this and said 
 'yes we would like him'.

343
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,110
What is that look on your face?

344
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,040
You look like your about 
 to murder somebody

345
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,840
this side of the photograph.

346
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,450
Turn it over.

347
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,620
She kept it because she thought 
 it was a really good photo of me.

348
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,290
Uh.

349
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,530
My agent thought that my good looks 
 would hamper a serious acting career.

350
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,940
You're career might be hampered? 
 You're too attractive.

351
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,190
- That was you're problem 
 - Too attractive.

352
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,950
Wow.

353
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,210
Hey, why don't we get some breakfast?

354
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,060
No, I'm fine. I think I have

355
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,440
pretty good idea about how to do this.

356
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,250
Oh, come on.

357
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,040
You haven't been here for a while, let's...

358
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,880
Let's do it together.

359
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,480
You know, 
 I actually I'd love to just get started.

360
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,540
Okay, sure.

361
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,810
Hey.

362
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,880
How's everything?

363
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,490
Fine.

364
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,500
Did you find the towel?

365
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,810
Yeah, the one that was on the bed?

366
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,750
- Yeah? 
 - Yeah.

367
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,280
I had my room all ready 
 for you guys, but...

368
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,400
It's really great to have you here.

369
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,360
- Thanks. 
 - I've been thinking, you know,

370
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,550
I think it's time that we told Conrad 
 what happened with Isabelle.

371
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,400
Wait...

372
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,600
Why, why now?

373
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
Because he's older.

374
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,970
And you know this article that 
 Richard is gonna write?

375
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,170
I'm sure it's gonna be tasteful but 
 he wants to mention it.

376
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,350
That's what he told me.

377
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,250
Well...

378
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,740
I mean he can't,

379
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,900
he can't do that.

380
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,320
Did you tell him he can't do that?

381
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,450
You know, I've really been thinking about this.

382
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,200
And,

383
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,780
I think that Conrad has a right to know.

384
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,040
Yeah.

385
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,900
It's not been so great with me and him lately.

386
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,670
That's why I'm really thrilled that you're here.

387
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,510
That's all.

388
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,030
Goodnight.

389
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,570
<i>He thinks I can't hear anything 
 when he's on those earphones.</i>

390
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,900
<i>But you know, 
 I know that he is up late every night,</i>

391
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,720
<i>playing with games with these kids from</i>

392
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,870
<i>New Zealand or Japan or whatever.</i>

393
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,830
So, I got this idea to log on,

394
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,650
but you can't just start playing, you know?

395
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,060
You have to make up a character, 
 so I've spent hours doing that.

396
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,550
<i>And then I've spent a really long time, walking around</i>

397
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,550
<i>in that world, looking for him.</i>

398
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,370
<i>So last night, I log on.</i>

399
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,230
<i>I, I am...</i>

400
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,660
<i>So excited.</i>

401
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,990
<i>I'm walking around in this world.</i>

402
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,990
<i>And suddenly I see him. 
 There he is.</i>

403
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,060
<i>And he looks over and he sees me and</i>

404
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,820
<i>I'm looking at him and he's looking at me.</i>

405
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,470
<i>Yeah.</i>

406
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,670
<i>I just wanted us to have some fun, you know?</i>

407
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,400
<i>Oh...</i>

408
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,120
<i>Sounds like fun.</i>

409
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,970
I mean he didn't even know it was me.

410
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,870
Oh...

411
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,970
Yeah.

412
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,970
It's kinda pathetic really, isn't it?

413
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,610
No.

414
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,090
He's a good kid, you know.

415
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,670
It's just a difficult age.

416
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,340
<i>She was young.</i>

417
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,670
<i>Somebody had said late thirties.</i>

418
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,490
<i>No children.</i>

419
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,450
<i>But she seems younger.</i>

420
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,710
<i>No, not when she smiled.</i>

421
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,080
<i>And how did he appear to her in</i>

422
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,080
<i>this harsh classroom school lighting?</i>

423
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,880
<i>Those earrings are just wrong.</i>

424
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,640
<i>Why wear something like that 
 to a teachers get-together?</i>

425
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,540
<i>Was it for him?</i>

426
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,060
<i>No, he was just being conceded.</i>

427
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,170
<i>She was just being friendly.</i>

428
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,330
<i>Being knew at the school.</i>

429
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,110
<i>Being his colleague and all.</i>

430
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,730
Oh, by the way,

431
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,380
I think you're gonna have my youngest son

432
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,090
Conrad in your English class next year.

433
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,520
Youngest?

434
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,030
I've got two boys.

435
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,280
The eldest is finishing his PhD in Sociology.

436
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,290
That's impressive.

437
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,850
Yeah, he's gonna be teaching next year

438
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,410
and his wife is pregnant which means 
 that I'm going to be a grandfather.

439
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,050
- I can't believe it. 
 - Congratulations.

440
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,430
<i>Why the hell did he have to mention that?</i>

441
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,880
<i>She was probably thinking of her grandfather now.</i>

442
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,720
<i>The odor of tobacco and urine.</i>

443
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,230
<i>Phones with large dials.</i>

444
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,640
<i>Dying slowly of throat cancer.</i>

445
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,500
What's so funny?

446
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,780
Nothing, nothing, not really. Nothing

447
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,640
Thank you.

448
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,770
- Can I tell you something. 
 - Yeah.

449
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,070
I shouldn't be really telling 
 you this but fuck it.

450
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,190
This...

451
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,770
... is the first time that I've slept

452
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,220
with somebody.

453
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,780
Probably since my wife passed away 
 which was 2 years ago.

454
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,600
Probably?

455
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,610
Well, there were one or two...

456
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,690
- Incidences. 
 - Improper ones.

457
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,180
I was...

458
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,350
I was too tense.

459
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,240
Hm.

460
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,420
Yeah, you know, it's just...

461
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,030
You know, when you get older

462
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,660
you're just more conscious 
 of your body and the way it...

463
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,480
It's getting weird sneaking around like this.

464
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,210
It's uncomfortable,

465
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,270
looking at Conrad in class and 
 pretending he's just like the other kids.

466
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,660
Yeah.

467
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,240
<i>It was early and freezing. </i>

468
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,080
<i>There was a group of men,</i>

469
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,720
<i>preparing the burial of a young boy. </i>

470
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,070
<i>Children were dying daily. </i>

471
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,180
<i>I felt I had to get this one right. </i>

472
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,820
<i>That this might convey something 
 about what was going on. </i>

473
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,460
<i>And there was this, </i>

474
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,030
<i>man.</i>

475
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,130
<i>I thought he had to be the boy's father.</i>

476
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,060
<i>I was searching for some sign that 
 it was okay to be there.</i>

477
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,060
<i>That he accepted me. </i>

478
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,050
<i>I'm faced with this every time. </i>

479
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,320
<i>Can I take a photo 
 that tells their story? </i>

480
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,580
<i>The way they would 
 if they could tell it? </i>

481
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,570
<i>And is that my job? </i>

482
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,950
<i>Or, shouldn't I instead use this family 
 to tell something bigger and</i>

483
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,950
<i>in some ways more important? </i>

484
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,440
<i>At the risk of reducing 
 them to an example, </i>

485
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,800
<i>to victims. </i>

486
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,050
<i>In times of war or extreme poverty, </i>

487
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,850
<i>the codes for civilized 
 behavior are suspended. </i>

488
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,290
<i>And so-called normal life, </i>

489
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,810
<i>nobody would go to a house where people 
 are grieving and photograph them. </i>

490
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,170
<i>I try to approach people with respect. </i>

491
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,840
<i>I try not to speak to loud. </i>

492
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,340
<i>Or move to fast. </i>

493
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,050
<i>I want to be open.</i>

494
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,940
<i>I want to feel open in 
 my heart toward them. </i>

495
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
<i>And,</i>

496
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,310
<i>they do sense it. </i>

497
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,690
<i>Even with no words at all. </i>

498
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,790
Hey, buddy.

499
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,100
Hey, come sit down.

500
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,490
Hey, I just wanted to talk to you.

501
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,610
And I wanted to know, um, if,

502
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,080
if you ever think about mom?

503
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,980
Do you ever think about the car accident?

504
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
Why?

505
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,810
Well,

506
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,330
there's no story in a car accident, 
you know.

507
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,340
So people,

508
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,980
People have to make one up, 
 they have to invent something,

509
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
that they have something 
 to blame or something.

510
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,360
- You know? 
 - Hello?

511
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,110
It's very normal, but, um...

512
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,830
Honestly it was just bad luck.

513
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,760
I mean it's fucked up but,

514
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
it's not like it was 
 anyone's fault or anything.

515
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,270
You know?

516
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,610
He's not doing that well.

517
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,960
I don't think you should 
 tell him what you told me last night.

518
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,220
- I... 
 - Yeah.

519
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,020
I don't know, I...

520
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,120
Don't you think he deserves 
 to know the truth?

521
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,160
The truth?

522
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,140
What is the truth?

523
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,040
What some story that Richard 
 wants to write now,

524
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,790
is that the truth?

525
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,170
He's gonna make her out to seem 
 like she's some kind of,

526
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,560
- a depressed person. 
 - No, I don't think he will.

527
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,310
But she was depressed, 
you know that, right?

528
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,140
I mean you were 
 away at college, I mean,

529
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,440
Sometimes I think it must 
 have been really hard for you.

530
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,300
I mean,

531
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,690
it was tough here.

532
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,830
You don't know what was 
 really going on, I mean, it was...

533
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,930
Yeah you couldn't know 
 what was going on.

534
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,990
Actually,

535
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,440
I did

536
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,660
know what was going on cause 
 she called me all the time.

537
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,970
When she wouldn't talk to you, 
 she would talk to me.

538
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,010
I spoke to her all the time.

539
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,490
Yeah?

540
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:13,920
Yeah.

541
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,090
Anyway, I guess this story suits you 
 perfectly though.

542
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
cause then you can make her out 
 to be the negligent parent

543
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,730
and you can be like the 
 perfect parent.

544
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,450
Yeah, uh...

545
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,040
- I don't want to argue about his. 
 - No?

546
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,880
I guess I don't either.

547
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,400
Just think really hard about 
 what you are doing here because

548
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,440
I mean even if you see her that way,

549
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,300
I don't think Conrad has to.

550
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,790
It's Gene's baby!

551
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,160
It's not my baby.

552
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,060
- It's so cute. 
 - Yeah.

553
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,440
- Priceless. 
 - Look at that, is that the mother?

554
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,330
- She's young! 
 - She's 28.

555
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,030
Oh, look at that one.

556
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,570
Yeah, this was taken 
 just after she woke up.

557
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,690
Oh, my God.

558
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,820
That was so weird.

559
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,460
Oh, my God! 
 Dude you're like the,

560
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
like the Billy Elliot of Hip Hop.

561
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,820
Hey!

562
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,800
Hey, man, I'm sorry. 
 No, no, it's funny.

563
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,120
It was really weird. 
 But it was really funny.

564
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,570
It was funny.

565
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,990
It was funny, it's fine. 
 What was it anyway, what are you watching?

566
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,610
What are we listening to, what is that?

567
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,270
It's old.

568
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,730
What else are you watching here?

569
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,300
'BirdSkeleton - DECOMPOSED'

570
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,940
This is what you look at?

571
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,940
You're gonna like, 
 shoot up a school, are you?

572
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,250
What is this? 
 What are we looking at here?

573
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,620
What are we watching here?

574
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,760
Just wait.

575

<i>- Is there someone in charge - Doctor Scanlon.</i> 
 - Okay.

576

<i>Doctor, Scanlon?</i>

577
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,120
Doctor Scanlon?

 - Mm-hm.

585
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,180
Oh, that's horrible. 
 Oh, don't look at us.

586
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
- Look at his hair. 
 - Oh God, that is so creepy.

587
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,750
- Wait, how did you find... 
 - Wait, wait, wait, watch now...

Where are you? Where are you?

592
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,120
Okay, okay.

593
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,810
You can look everywhere, like up, down.

594
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,550
- Oh my God. 
 - It's everywhere.

595
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,480
Okay, okay, okay.

596
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,370
Okay, I'm going up the thing.

597
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,960
Hey, don't you think these 
 games are kinda stupid.

598
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,190
You're aware that this is 
 like a very one dimensional

599
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,580
representation of 
 US Military intervention, right?

600
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,510
It's very realistic.

601
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,500
- It's like, really being there, you know? 
 - Right.

602
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,580
I mean, you wear the headphones, 
 it's like,

603
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,220
everywhere.

604
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,340
- Okay...? 
 - Mm.

605
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,910
Right, but do you think it's fun?

606
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,090
You agree?

607
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,000
What is that?

608
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,810
I don't know.

609
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,900
Um.

610
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,640
Did you write this?

611
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,910
Yeah.

636
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,330

00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,300
Dude.

701
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,330
That's amazing.

702
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,850
It's...

703
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,810
Seriously, it's really,

704
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,440
really weird, but thank God.

705
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,070
Dad's really stalking you like that?

706
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,400
What the hell is he doing? 
 He can't do that.

707
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:10,980
Jesus.

708
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,980
And you just feel down 
 on somebody's grave?

709
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,430
Who's was it?

710
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,900
Some random guy.

711
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,680
Valez, or something.

712
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,220
- Really? 
 - Mm-hm.

713
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,880
It's like really weird but interesting.

714
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,050
It's really, it's really good.

715
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,670
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

716
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,000
Hey.

717
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,240
How are you, my love?

718
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,290
Come here, 
 let me get your stuff.

719
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,600
I decided I will go 
 directly to the airport.

720
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,400
- Yeah? 
 - Mm.

721
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,320
You had another fight with dad?

722
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,420
Why don't you two get divorced already?

723
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,080
Just, get it over with.

724
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,080
The price has changed, 
 the public attention is so,

725
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,340
fragmented.

726
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,890
There's too much noise now.

727
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,730
So, why do you still do it?

728
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,490
Because I'm good at it.

729
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,490
I make a very good living out of it.

730
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,370
- Yeah?

731
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,060
I would say you're 
 definitely good at it.

732
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,230
- Yeah! 
 - Yes.

733
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,870
She's nice.

734
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,320
- Who? 
 - The girl at the party.

735
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,110
Is she your girlfriend?

736
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,040
No.

737
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,090
No.

738
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,280
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

739
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,770
No, I mean,

740
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,990
I don't really...

741
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,250
I don't really think I have time for it.

742
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,560
Mm.

743
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,950
You're so good at what you do. 
 You should have fun.

744
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,950
No?

745
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,910
Jonah?

746
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,760
Mm.

747
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,900
I'm glad I came.

748
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,630
I had fun.

749
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,120
Recently I have felt really tired.

750
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,610
I don't know why.

751
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,310
It's really good being here.

752
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,520
With you.

753
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,480
It makes me feel,

754
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,570
like, um...

755
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,800
Like I can still feel...

756
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,900
... passionate about things.

757
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,880
Are you sleeping?

758
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,890
Yes, sorry, it's just like, 
 it's such a mess up here.

759
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,700
My father just has not dealt with,

760
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,630
any of my mother's stuff, so...

761
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,480
But weren't you supposed 
 to lecture here this week?

762
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,740
Hey, it's not, hey, hey!

763
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,740
Not my fault if the gallery 
 people keep like fucking it up, is it?

764
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,100
<i>- I'm just trying to talk to you. </i>
 - Sorry, I know.

765
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,000
No I know. Listen, um...

766
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,490
I'll be back later tonight, okay? 
 I've already packed.

767
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,750
I'll call you from the road, okay?

768
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,020
Bye.

769
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,690
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

770
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,460
I was driving around 
 the neighborhood and I,

771
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,800
I saw your light was on.

772
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,510
Oh.

773
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,860
Yeah.

774
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,010
Um...

775
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,240
I was wondering,

776
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,670
how you were doing?

777
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,210
No, but I got to spend 
 a lot of time with her.

778
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,210
- Which was good. 
 - Yeah.

779
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,930
Yeah, it's just...

780
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,140
Not really how you want 
 to remember someone.

781
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,140
- Sure. 
 - Yeah.

782
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,060
Yeah.

783
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,450
And um...

784
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,250
I'm sorry to drop by like this,

785
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,400
- No, No. 
 - I just...

786
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,610
No, this is stupid, I just, um...

787
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,460
Um.

788
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,210
Yeah, I just like...

789
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,470
I have a lot going on 
 right now actually.

790
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,990
You know we've actually 
 had sex in this bedroom before.

791
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,150
- Yeah, I know. 
 - Yeah.

792
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,650
You know what?

793
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,610
Um.

794
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,410
You know I still haven't told 
 Amy about my mother, about...

795
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,560
About how she died.

796
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,070
Why?

797
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,380
I don't know.

798
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,710
I mean when we first 
 started dating, it was not like,

799
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,780
a wonderful topic of conversation.

800
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,730
You know? 
 But then everything moved so fast.

801
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,440
It become too late.

802
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,560
Sometimes I'm sure she's gonna leave me.

803
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,020
Really?

804
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,270
Does she still have her hair?

805
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,690
Her hair?

806
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,630
Yeah, that was the part that, um...

807
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,410
really bugged me about my mom.

808
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,120
Oh, her hair. 
 Yeah she has her hair still, so.

809
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,200
Great.

810
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
Yeah, thanks for asking.

811
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,500
Oh, my God.

812
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,000
What?

813
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,040
I was uh...

814
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,250
... clearing out the last of 
 my moms stuff the other day and I,

815
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,440
I didn't realize that I...

816
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,060
Wait, did we just have sex 
 with your mothers condoms?

817
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,190
- We might have done that. 
 - Oh, great.

818
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,560
- ... 
 - Oh, Jesus Christ.

819
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,540
Could you check the date?

820
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,230
- Jonah... 
 - I'm sorry.

821
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,140
Oh, my God.

822
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,630
Yeah, she was this lively person. 
 She was not this depressed...

823
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,000
I know. 
 You talked about her all the time.

824
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,730
- Really? 
 - Mm-hm.

825
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,170
Did she live up to it?

826
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,780
Yeah.

827
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,460
Mm.

828
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,140
Yeah.

829
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,890
But...?

830
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,450
No buts, I...

831
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,150
You know, I didn't expect her to be so...

832
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,930
... fragile.

833
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,490
Fragile?

834
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,020
- Yeah. 
 - Huh.

835
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,780
I don't know, that's not 
 the right word but she was...

836
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,980
No, no, it's just interesting, like...

837
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,040
Would you have said that if you 
 didn't know what happened to her later?

838
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,420
No, probably not.

839
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,740
Right.

840
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,990
You're lucky.

841
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,380
I am? Why am I lucky?

842
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,690
No, that's not mine.

843
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,920
Because,

844
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,720
You're better when you're in one place.

845
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,000
Except you?

846
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,530
Except me.

847
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:25,520
I've had this feeling lately, I...

848
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,160
I can't really explain it but,

849
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,020
I feel that,

850
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:36,820
every time you go away I half expect 
 that you're not gonna come back.

851
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,230
I understand.

852
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,060
It's normal.

853
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,060
- Is it? 
 - Mm.

854
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,950
After this, I'll slow down.

855
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,760
I promise.

856
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,540
If it wasn't for you,

857
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,140
I would have stopped a long time ago.

858
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,270
You know, most of the other 
 people I work with,

859
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,870
they don't have anything to go back to.

860
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,020
Like I have.

861
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,270
They're...

862
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,250
They're like addicts.

863
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,490
- As soon as they go home, they want... 
 - Aren't you like that?

864
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,490
... to go, to leave again.

865
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,810
Aren't you like that?

866
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,270
No, not at all.

867
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,280
I don't wanna be the one 
 to tell you to stop.

868
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,220
I stopped. I gave up acting.

869
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,700
- I never asked you to give it up. 
 - I know you didn't.

870
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,710
I know you didn't.

871
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,900
Do you hear what you are saying?

872
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,540
Do you hear how selfish that is?

873
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,950
No, it's our life.

874
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,180
It's our family's life.

875
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,120
Me, and those two... 
 - I thank you, I thank you.

876
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,050
When they call me and 
 they tell me you're at hurt.

877
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,050
You know the first thing I thought? 
 About the kids.

878
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,320
Not about you.

879
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,930
Because that's what 
 I've been expecting.

880
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,260
For years.

881
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,310
And there it is.

882
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,870
<i>'Afghan Refugee Camps 
 Struggle in Search of Aid.'</i>

883
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,240
It's great.

884
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,140
Anyway, thanks for taking me 
 to the airport.

885
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,380
You're welcome. I wanted to.

886
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,740
I know I said I 
 wouldn't do this anymore.

887
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,430
After this, I'll slow down. I promise.

888
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:54,870
Urgh.

889
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,840
I can't believe 
 they still do this shit.

890
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,340
- They're really good. 
 - Oh, yeah?

891
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,710
Yeah. They got second place in like,

892
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,140
some competition.

893
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,260
Oh.

894
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,980
That's amazing.

895
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,880
Mm-hm.

896
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,010
There.

897
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,160
Which one?

898
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,870
- Grey hoodie. 
 - Ah.

899
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,680
What happened to her arm?

900
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,320
Man, she'll miss the game on Friday.

901
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:26,180
- Hey, sorry. 
 <i>- Where are you? Are you okay? </i>

902
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,110
Yeah, no, no, 
 I'm actually I'm still here.

903
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,110
- Did you not get my message? 
 <i>- No.</i>

904
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,670
<i>What's happening? </i>

905
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:35,040
Yeah, no, no, 
 It's just been crazy up here.

906
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,970
Uh...

907
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,920
Yeah, no I kept thinking 
 I would actually make it back.

908
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,340
I'm actually, um...

909
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,300
I'm in a middle of a meeting 
 with the gallery right now.

910
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,640
Yeah, there was kind of a mix up.

911
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,080
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

912
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,080
Yeah, I will Skype you as soon 
 as I get back to the house.

913
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,240
Okay?

914
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,800
<i>-Who's that?</i> 
 - No, I don't...

915
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,090
What, I don't know. 
 No I don't know what that was, um...

916
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,880
I miss you and um...

917
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,090
Yeah, I got to go.

918
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,090
<i>Okay, call me. </i>

919
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,180
You know, if I had a girl,

920
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,720
- I'd never lie to her. 
 - Yeah?

921
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,190
Good luck with that.

922
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,060
I'm gonna give it to her.

923
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:12,950
What?

924
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,740
You know, the stuff you read.

925
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,870
To her?

926
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,480
Mm-hm.

927
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,640
You serious?

928
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,760
Yeah, I want her to know me.

929
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,200
Huh.

930
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,740
Okay, listen.

931
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,000
I thought you were kind of a like,

932
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,940
Like backwards and really weird, uh...

933
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,020
But it turns out you're not.

934
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,440
You're um...

935
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,870
I mean you're actually pretty cool.

936
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,960
And that stuff you wrote,

937
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,110
Really...

938
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,730
That stuff was...

939
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,130
... it was excellent.

940
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,110
Still...

941
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,290
And I'm telling you this 
 because I love you,

942
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:51,200
that girl is never gonna 
 go for you in that way.

943
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,840
I'm sorry, she's just not.

944
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,100
It's not your fault.

945
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,660
I mean it's not her fault either it's...

946
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,880
It's high school and 
 like the hierarchy here?

947
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,450
The status of looks and social skills.

948
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:04,390
All this bullshit is stricter here 
 than anywhere else in the world.

949
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,130
That's why you should never 
 give those notes to that girl.

950
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,190
I mean look at her, 
 she's not gonna get it.

951
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,700
Look at her friends, 
 they're gonna laugh at you.

952
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,790
I mean, they'll be wrong because,

953
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,960
You are way cooler 
 than they will ever be.

954
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,300
You really are.

955
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,230
But, but they'll destroy you.

956
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,380
Just lay over for a few years.

957
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,340
Sit it out. Okay? It gets better.

958
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,120
Do you understand me?

959
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,520
Time's up.

960
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,490
This looks right just fill it back in.

961
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,440
No.

962
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,200
Why did you erase it?

963
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,030
It's okay. 
 Just fill it back in when I collect the others.

964
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:58,800
No!

965
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,480
That's not fair.

966
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,160
Stop joking around, just do what I say.

967
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,350
Sit down.

968
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,850
Sit down!

969
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,250
I must admit, I'm...

970
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,650
... a bit lost here.

971
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,960
Me too.

972
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,680
And Conrad,

973
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:53,100
you still have nothing 
 to say for yourself?

974
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,780
You know I don't think 
 this will happen again.

975
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,960
Listen.

976
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,400
I'm not gonna see her again.

977
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:18,410
I know I fucked up.

978
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,400
I don't always do the right thing.

979
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,580
And I end up making 
 these really stupid mistakes.

980
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,690
I'm sorry.

981
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:31,720
Is it...

982
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,630
Is it difficult for you to talk to me?

983
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,820
I mean, we don't always 
 have to agree about everything.

984
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,270
But I think it's really 
 important that you and I,

985
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,810
are able to talk to each other.

986
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,970
You remember when you were a kid,

987
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,040
And we used to just... please.

988
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,080
Wow.

989
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,680
It's beautiful.

990
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:53,480
Wow.

991
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,700
When did you do this drawing? Today?

992
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,520
- Mm-mm. 
 - No? Ah, before I came back.

993
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,620
Hm.

994
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,210
Look at this.

995
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,970
Isn't it pretty?

996
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,470
Floating in the desert, but...

997
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,750
You are very talented, Conrad.

998
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,140
Very talented.

999
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,440
I missed you so, you know?

1000
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,240
Yeah.

1001
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,760
I'm so happy to be back.

1002
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,490
Yeah?

1003
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,740
Um...

1004
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,800
Could you give this to Melanie, please?

1005
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,120
Melanie, it's for you!

1006
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,390
<i>- Who is it? </i>
 It's a friend of yours.

1007
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,210
<i>Hold on. I'll be there in a minute. </i>

1008
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,860
Thanks.

1009
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,550
I rather you went through it than...

1010
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:56,340
... those agency people.

1011
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,270
You take anything with it?

1012
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,640
Oh, um... black.

1013
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,090
Samina's moving to Jackson Heights.

1014
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,800
With the kids.

1015
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,690
And she is going back to school.

1016
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:16,650
She wants to be an architect.

1017
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:17,790
At...

1018
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,600
... 45.

1019
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,170
It's all good.

1020
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,560
Look.

1021
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,690
I don't have to say this but I...

1022
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,770
... did you have an affair 
 with Isabelle?

1023
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:46,750
Yeah.

1024
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,910
Yes, yes I did.

1025
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,260
Did it go on for long?

1026
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,030
A while.

1027
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,090
On and off.

1028
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,420
But it was never here.

1029
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:02,790
It was never stateside, 
 it wasn't like...

1030
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,910
And I wanted to be with her Gene.

1031
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,110
I was ready to leave 
 Samina and everything.

1032
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,110
But for her,

1033
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,110
It only made sense 
 when we were working.

1034
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,650
So, when she stopped...

1035
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,650
... going, uh...

1036
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,880
That was it.

1037
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,790
She wanted to be with you.

1038
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,080
And the boys.

1039
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,370
Yeah.

1040
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,690
She wanted to make that work.

1041
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,400
I never believed it.

1042
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,790
<i>I was so... </i>

1043
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,020
<i>.. I was just so angry. </i>

1044
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,660
<i>I had this feeling all the time that...</i>

1045
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,310
... you know, 
 that one day she was just...

1046
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,300
... she was just gonna get up and...

1047
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,530
... leave again.

1048
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:21,670
<i>One morning you're over there, 
 doing something you feel is important. </i>

1049
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,020
<i>But it's hard as well, you know. </i>

1050
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,950
<i>You can't wait to go back home. </i>

1051
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,580
<i>And then finally you're here. </i>

1052
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,490
<i>You always arrive exhausted. </i>

1053
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,380
<i>Having changed planes like four times. </i>

1054
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,060
<i>You follow you convictions. </i>

1055
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,240
Your dreams, your passions.

1056
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,240
And then all of a sudden, one day,

1057
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,500
it's your life.

1058
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,320
And you are split.

1059
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,270
You're split down the middle.

1060
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,640
Yeah, but...

1061
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,910
... you don't have to, you have a choice.

1062
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,930
Yes.

1063
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,210
But you can't...

1064
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,340
... plan for what happens 
 after you make that choice.

1065
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,810
One morning,

1066
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,650
you find yourself, somewhere

1067
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,180
in the world,

1068
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,330
doing what you believe in. 
 What feels important.

1069
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,210
And then it is frustrating as hell

1070
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:17,770
because you can not wait 
 to get back home again.

1071
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,260
And then you are home and...

1072
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,150
... and you're exhausted. You've...

1073
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,820
It's been a day and a half...

1074
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,950
...getting home. 
 Changing planes four-five times...

1075
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:32,930
... and all you want to do 
 is get some rest so...

1076
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,090
... you know, catch up.

1077
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,830
<i>But you hear them. </i>

1078
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,240
<i>Trying to be quiet.</i>

1079
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,380
<i>Just waiting for you to come out. </i>

1080
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,460
<i>They don't know how 
 much they have changed, </i>

1081
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,160
<i>since last time you saw them. </i>

1082
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,030
Oh, thank you for the luggage.

1083
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:00,030
<i>You have to learn all the names 
 of the new things that they are interested in. </i>

1084
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,600
<i>Things that would change 
 again a month from now. </i>

1085
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:06,180
Television programs, films, you know.

1086
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,760
Foods, that they like now 
 which they didn't like before.

1087
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,750
And uh...

1088
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,760
<i>After a few days you 
 feel better in the role. </i>

1089
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:17,580
<i>No, it's not even a role. </i>

1090
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,800
<i>You like it. </i>

1091
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,800
<i>They want you there. </i>

1092
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,310
<i>They love you. </i>

1093
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,310
<i>You can feel it. </i>

1094
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,890
<i>And you love them too. </i>

1095
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,890
<i>More than anything. </i>

1096
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,200
<i>But you still feel like 
 you're in the way. </i>

1097
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,250
<i>And the way of what they usually do. </i>

1098
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:49,170
<i>Again you get the feeling 
 that you're in the wrong place. </i>

1099
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,310
<i>It's not that they don't want you there. </i>

1100
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,680
<i>But... </i>

1101
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,880
<i>... they don't really need you. </i>

1102
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:18,730
<i>Hello? </i>

1103
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:22,340
Hey.

1104
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,870
You okay?

1105
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,020
I thought you said it wouldn't 
 come out until the end of the month.

1106
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,170
That's a really big piece.

1107
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,510
He puts it into context.

1108
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:55,240
Just like you said he would.

1109
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,680
He seems to know her really well.

1110
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,710
Is that what you wanted?

1111
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,850
Did Conrad see this?

1112
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,600
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

1113
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,190
<i>Hey, this is Conrad. 
 Please leave a message after the tone. </i>

1114
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,300
Hey, Conrad it's me.

1115
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:24,190
It's kind of important. 
 I need to talk to you.

1116
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,430
Thanks.

1117
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,020
Conrad?

1118
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,350
Jonah?

1119
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:14,040
<i>You've reached Hannah Brannon. 
 Please leave a message. </i>

1120
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:33,500
I think we've got to 
 bring something, you know?

1121
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,980
We cannot like, not bring something, right?

1122
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,010
I guess, yeah.

1123
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:41,780
- You sure you don't want anything? 
 - No, I'm okay.

1124
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:22,110
<i>Is there anyway, if I like, take...</i>

1125
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,990
<i>... double or something... </i>

1126
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:27,450
<i>... that I could maybe buy some beer? </i>

1127
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:54,540
I think it's this way.

1128
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,290
It should be it.

1129
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,540
Is that T.J.?

1130
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,430
Do we really want to do this?

1131
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,860
I don't know.

1132
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,670
We're here.

1133
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,450
I think I'm gonna go.

1134
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,980
<i>Are you coming? </i>

1135
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,840
<i>Sorry. </i>

1136
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,980
You.

1137
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,950
You, like, spat Ms. Brannon 
 in the face.

1138
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,360
I have to get home.

1139
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,400
I don't feel so good.

1140
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,620
I'm like injured, I shouldn't be out.

1141
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,880
You know, but I just...

1142
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,010
I know, I never like...

1143
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,180
... fall like that.

1144
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,270
Mia, has my place now.

1145
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:41,300
She's like really good.

1146
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,630
You know?

1147
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,480
Did you read the...

1148
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,450
Did you look at that thing I gave you?

1149
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,130
You wrote that?

1150
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,360
That was...

1151
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,380
You're Conrad?

1152
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,720
Yeah.

1153
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,020
Oh...

1154
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,750
Where...

1155
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,360
... did you get all that stuff?

1156
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,730
What do you mean?

1157
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,310
Did you like find it 
 online or something?

1158
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,600
No.

1159
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,780
You came up with all that?

1160
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,120
Mm-hm.

1161
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,120
You know, I've...

1162
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,840
- Oh... 
 - Are you okay?

1163
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:35,000
Oh my God.

1164
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:06,950
Can you help me?

1165
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:12,390
Can you help me with the buttons?

1166
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,700
Tell me if anyone comes.

1167
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:53,860
And no peeking.

1168
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,500
Just a little peeking.

1169
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,730
No peeking.

1170
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,310
You're nice, you know that?

1171
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:44,550
<i>He could still many years from now 
 recall the scene in all its detail. </i>

1172
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:49,380
<i>The lock of hair she carefully 
 placed behind her ear. </i>

1173
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:53,580
<i>The way the washing label stuck out 
 from the neck of her tank top. </i>

1174
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:58,920
<i>The street lights that went out 
 as they passed Kevin Anderson's house. </i>

1175
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,330
<i>That strangely familiar smell of damp earth 
 he couldn't quite place. </i>

1176
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:09,960
<i>As a stranger passed,</i>

1177
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:14,520
<i>he glanced at them as he went by, 
 probably thinking they were a couple. </i>

1178
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:19,850
<i>She had said that she wanted 
 to have lunch with him Tuesday after English. </i>

1179
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,770
<i>He knew that this would never happen. </i>

1180
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:26,420
<i>That she would feel differently 
 Monday back in school. </i>

1181
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,860
<i>But at that moment he just enjoyed that</i>

1182
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:32,330
<i>she felt like saying this to him. </i>

1183
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,600
That she maybe really felt

1184
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,820
like having lunch with him.

1185
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,430
That while they were 
 walking there like that,

1186
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:44,340
Having lunch together 
 at school seemed to her

1187
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,430
like a perfectly natural thing to do.

1188
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:55,890
Goodnight.

1189
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,760
<i>Where are you?</i>

1190
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,140
<i>Are you okay? </i>

1191
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,410
So it's true?

1192
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,860
Paper?

1193
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,090
Is true?

1194
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:28,050
Yes it is.

1195
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,000
Why didn't you tell me?

1196
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,340
I saw her you know.

1197
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,270
I saw how she was.

1198
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,360
I was here.

1199
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,100
I know.

1200
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:51,100
I'm sorry.

1201
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,380
Am I really that difficult to talk to?

1202
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,330
No.

1203
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:00,640
It's me.

1204
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,100
It's me too.

1205
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,370
It's difficult.

1206
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:20,380
Hey.

1207
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,440
I'm okay.

1208
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:30,450
I know you are.

1209
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:53,520
I'm okay.

1210
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,410
You sure you don't want something? 
 Some breakfast maybe?

1211
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,440
No, I got to get some sleep.

1212
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:03,410
You shouldn't stay out 
 like that, you know.

1213
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,420
I know.

1214
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,320
You know...

1215
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,840
Jonah.

1216
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,800
He's not doing so well.

1217
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,020
Yeah.

1218
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,070
Yeah, I know.

1219
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:19,180
I'll talk to him .

1220
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,520
You get some sleep.

1221
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:33,280
Hey.

1222
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,570
So, how are you doing?

1223
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,100
It's time to go home to Amy.

1224
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,300
Yeah.

1225
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:45,870
Yeah, I know.

1226
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:50,910
But I don't think 
 I can drive right now.

1227
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:51,910
Been drinking.

1228
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,150
Come on.

1229
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,370
I'll take you.

1230
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,900
<i>Mom, had been away like she used to. </i>

1231
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,090
<i>In Africa or something. </i>

1232
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:38,310
<i>And she came back. </i>

1233
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,360
<i>For her exhibition. </i>

1234
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,520
<i>But she had a baby with her. </i>

1235
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,030
<i>And... </i>

1236
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,310
<i>... when I was little I thought 
 she should do that. </i>

1237
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:49,410
<i>Just, bring them back here. </i>

1238
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,090
<i>But this was Jonah's baby. </i>

1239
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:57,280
<i>And me and Dad were very curious. </i>

1240
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:59,250
<i>Because we hadn't really met her.</i>

1241
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,070
<i>Not for real. </i>

1242
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,910
<i>The baby was a very old man. </i>

1243
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:06,180
<i>And it didn't feel strange. 
 It was just... </i>

1244
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:07,940
<i>... Jonah's baby. </i>

1245
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:11,130
<i>He couldn't really talk, 
 being a baby and all but... </i>

1246
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:14,110
<i>... he was very nice and he really liked me. </i>

1247
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,840
<i>I could tell. </i>

1248
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:19,690
<i>I can remember 
 we all felt proud, you know. </i>

1249
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:20,990
<i>That...</i>

1250
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:22,990
<i>... she was our mother.</i>
