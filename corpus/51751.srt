1
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,909
( heavy breathing )

2
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,555
( weeping )

3
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,894
- What the hell?
- Woman: Is this the jail?

4
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,908
- Aye.
- Woman #2: Keep the door closed.

5
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,410
- George!
- Man: George?

6
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,284
- Woman: George!
- Man: What do you want?

7
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,023
- George.
- What do you want?

8
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,027
George?

9
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,996
- Come back here.
- George!

10
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,192
- I did it.
- Did what?

11
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,030
I killed him, my husband.

12
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,967
It was me.

13
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,199
I'll get Mr. Mullen.

14
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,264
You stay here.

15
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,471
Oh, George!

16
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,478
Je suis Marie.

17
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,951
Y'a pas de George ici.

18
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,181
( weeps )

19
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,557
She's undone, sir.
Driven.

20
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,722
Carried on
like a madwoman.

21
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,996
Man #2: Why not
send her to the church?

22
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,366
Reverend's away
from the fort, sir.

23
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,268
( coughing )

24
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,475
It's too hot in here.
It's a jail, not a bloody inn.

25
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,101
Aye, sir.

26
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,975
Mullen: So...
you say you've killed a man?

27
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,846
Man #1 : Your husband.
What's your name?

28
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,679
Mullen:
It's a simple question.

29
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,312
Your name.

30
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,825
- She can talk.
- This girl speaks French.

31
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,300
- Man #1 : Careful, sir.
- She's a strange woman.

32
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,737
Here, sit up.

33
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,467
Come on.

34
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,702
( woman pants )

35
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,641
Mullen: She's covered
in scratches.

36
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,874
She's gone wild, sir.

37
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,043
Fill out the forms, Donnely.
Lock her up.

38
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,984
I'll take her statement
tomorrow.

39
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,820
- Should we feed her, sir?
- I don't care.

40
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,602
This weather was sent
from hell, lass.

41
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,170
I'd rather freeze
than hang, though.

42
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,219
Mullen's voice:
Journal of Mr. Henry Mullen,

43
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,918
Chief Recorder, Hudson Bay Company.
November 1 5th:

44
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,587
In the absence of Governor Simpson,
it's fallen to me

45
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,562
to investigate
this strange young woman

46
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,258
who appeared last night
at the fort.

47
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,359
As I am inexperienced
in these matters,

48
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,836
I asked Dr. Jenkins
to assist me.

49
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,032
First of all,
I want your name.

50
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,844
Fine, then.
Who's George? Your husband?

51
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,814
Perhaps he took shelter
with some natives.

52
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,509
Or perished.

53
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:57,022
- I've done a terrible thing.
- You said you killed your husband.

54
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,287
And George as well.
Mon Dieu!

55
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,225
How did you kill him?

56
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,188
With a rock.

57
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,301
I heard his skull crack.

58
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,530
Jenkins:
And where did this happen?

59
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,333
At the homestead.

60
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,273
We were building a fireplace.
We had lots of rocks.

61
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,869
- Why did you kill him?
- Because I wanted to.

62
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,480
I wanted to kill my husband,
so I did it.

63
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,451
- You haven't told us your name.
- Annie.

64
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,148
- And your husband?
- Simon.

65
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,054
And who's George?

66
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,083
His brother.

67
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,356
- Can you examine her now?
- No!

68
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Right. Quite frankly, I'd rather
have her cleaned up first.

69
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,997
Would you like that?
Nice hot bath.

70
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,165
Good. Take her over
to the house, Ruth.

71
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,573
Jenkins: It's not
in a woman's nature.

72
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,975
Mullen: In the middle
of bloody nowhere,

73
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,036
cut off from civilization,

74
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,173
people do the unthinkable.

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,152
True, but no one has been
reported missing.

76
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,189
Nobody knows
what goes on out there.

77
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,925
She got lost,
quite likely.

78
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,395
How old do you think
she is?

79
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,591
1 8, 19...

80
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,463
it's hard to tell.

81
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,026
I'll have to take
a closer look.

82
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,236
What's this?

83
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,469
Purple.

84
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,173
Yes, I love purple.

85
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,546
Mmm...

86
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,046
your book?

87
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,418
I'll just put it
over here, okay?

88
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,158
It's burnt, huh?

89
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,401
Okay.

90
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,273
You get in now.

91
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,675
We'll get some more water.

92
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,865
( churchbell tolls )

93
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,075
" Oh what needless pain
we bear "

94
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,112
" Oh what needless pain
we bear "

95
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,580
" All because
we do not carry "

96
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,277
" All because
we do not carry "

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:44,619
" We do not carry everything
to God in prayer. "

98
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,555
( whistling )

99
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,856
- You cannot go with him, Annie.
- ( water splattering )

100
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,021
Annie, get out!

101
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,328
Come on, get out!
Come on!

102
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,704
- Annie...
- I have to get dressed!

103
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,709
Woman:
I don't understand.

104
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,405
I told her to finish
her bath, get dressed--

105
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,209
Miss Cresswell, I don't know.

106
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,546
She knew he was waiting.

107
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,381
Good... Iet him choose
one of the other girls.

108
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,422
- I want him to choose me.
- You can't go with him, Annie.

109
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,120
- Again, I had the dream.
- I have my own dreams, Sadie.

110
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,389
I want babies and a home...

111
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,863
- and a husband.
- Had a baby once.

112
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,902
Came out of a big boil
on my stomach, the size of a rat.

113
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,301
They took it away,
fed it to the dogs.

114
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,863
- That's a lie.
- It's true. I almost died!

115
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,547
Man: I do not care
if she can sing.

116
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,551
I need a wife
who can work.

117
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,426
Ah, here she is.

118
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,462
- She's awfully wee.
- She's strong.

119
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,896
And willing.

120
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,697
She's French, but can read
and write English.

121
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,736
No need.

122
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,830
She can sew just about anything--
suits, shirts--

123
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,273
she's been well instructed.

124
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,910
She'll do.

125
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,644
You won't be sorry,
monsieur.

126
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,329
You want to drown yourself?

127
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,305
The Scots make good whiskey.

128
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,742
At least they're good
for something.

129
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,336
- ( knocking on door )
- Here she is, sir.

130
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,575
I put a damper on her.

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,174
My own.

132
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,618
- Thank you, Ruth.
- I found this.

133
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,623
It's burnt.

134
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,387
- Was there a fire?
- She won't talk, sir.

135
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,485
It's a mistake
to teach girls to read.

136
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,621
- I agree.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,336
Come.
Sit on the table, please.

138
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,203
- Mrs...
- Simon.

139
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,640
Come sit on the table.
We'll begin your examination.

140
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,405
- I'll leave it to you.
- No!

141
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,639
Come on.
Come sit down.

142
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,649
Come sit down!
Come here and sit!

143
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,354
Ah! We'll tie you down
if that's what it takes!

144
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,856
Just hold her, Mr. Mullen.

145
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,856
Please.

146
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,784
Good.

147
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,294
Thank you.
This won't take long.

148
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,821
I examine everyone that comes
into the jail, Mrs. Simon.

149
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,595
It's for your own good.

150
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,227
How's your sleeping?

151
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,932
Fine.

152
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,140
Have you heard
from your wife?

153
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,543
There's nothing more to say.
Her position's straightforward.

154
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,104
She won't be coming back.

155
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,378
And you, have you made
a decision yet?

156
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,114
Well, I make
lots of decisions and then...

157
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,156
I change my mind.

158
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,520
Oh...

159
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,025
some frostbite.
Must be sore.

160
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,254
Yes.

161
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,319
She's had
a rather rough time.

162
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,456
Lots of bruises
and scratches.

163
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,167
Yes, look at this.

164
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,364
A bite mark here
on her hand.

165
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,701
Human?

166
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,934
Yes.

167
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,907
Now lie back.
Just lie back.

168
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,606
Mullen: Come on.

169
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,148
- Move your legs apart, please.
- No!

170
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,187
- Move your legs apart.
- No!

171
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,222
No one is going
to hurt you.

172
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,689
Jenkins: Good. Uh-huh.

173
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,525
Uh-huh. Okay.

174
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
Very good.

175
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:53,095
Apart from the obvious,
physically she's strong and healthy.

176
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,970
The marriage was consummated,
although not kindly.

177
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,606
I want her to take one teaspoon
of this four times a day.

178
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,616
It'll help calm her nerves,
help her to sleep.

179
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,121
- It'll probably improve her memory.
- Mullen: I should hope so.

180
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,592
- Ruth, get her dressed.
- Ruth: She has nothing to wear.

181
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,390
Give her something
from my wife's closet then.

182
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,363
And leave the book!

183
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,060
Come. We'll dress you
like a lady.

184
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,272
Your first murder case,
Mr. Mullen.

185
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,809
I found it.

186
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,921
It's a bit worn.
Mr. Mullen's old work coat.

187
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,449
You need something.
That place is so cold.

188
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,088
- Is this your room?
- No.

189
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:57,431
Mrs. Mullen brought all
this furniture from England.

190
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,631
That's enormous.

191
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,401
Do you have some scissors...

192
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,442
and needle and thread?

193
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,080
I'll ask.

194
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,315
Mullen's voice: "Tho' women's minds,
like winter winds,

195
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,287
May shift, and turn,
an' a' that--

196
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,324
- The noblest breast--"
- Mr. Mullen.

197
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,519
She's quite different
since I gave her that medicine.

198
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,893
- She's talking.
- Good.

199
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,024
- "The noblest--"
- She wants scissors for sewing,

200
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,558
- you think that's safe?
- Yes, that's fine. Thank you.

201
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,274
Annie's voice:
"Dear Sadie,

202
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,368
except for the discomforts
of riding a horse,

203
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,811
I have never been so happy.

204
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,813
The country is magnificent.

205
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,949
I feel as though
my life has just begun.

206
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,184
Everything is new,
everything is possible.

207
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,193
As soon as I am settled,
I will send for you.

208
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,559
Perhaps you'll change
your opinion of marriage,

209
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,564
as there will be
a choice of eligible,

210
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,065
handsome men
in the district.

211
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,796
So far, Simon
has not spoken much.

212
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,964
He seems anxious
to get home."

213
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,168
- What are you doing?
- Writing about our journey.

214
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,840
Get your animal.
Follow me...

215
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,781
up on the path.

216
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,088
Simon: Yah! Come on.

217
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,557
Yah!

218
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,063
Annie: Simon!

219
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,033
Simon: Yah!

220
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,902
Come on!

221
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,772
Get him going.
Get him across, for Christ's sake!

222
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,640
I can't!

223
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,883
Simon: The supplies
are getting away! Hurry.

224
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,217
Get up!

225
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,086
Take off the blanket.

226
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,132
- What?
- I want to see you.

227
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,359
Not here.

228
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,370
Why not?

229
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,497
You're my wife.

230
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,007
- Yes, but--
- But what?

231
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,677
Simon: It's your duty!

232
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,646
Ah! Damn rock.

233
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,864
Just do as I say.
We'll get on real good.

234
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,941
- Spread your legs.
- Wait.

235
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,072
No!

236
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,968
That's what men
and women do.

237
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,509
We did it just fine.

238
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,915
Next time you'll want it.

239
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,261
Good morning, Annie.

240
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,239
You want some nice,
warm porridge?

241
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,140
- George?
- No.

242
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,374
What have you done?

243
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,151
Wow...

244
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,788
Iook at this fine work.

245
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,621
Yes, it's very nice.

246
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,684
Wow...

247
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,230
Mullen: Where did you
learn to do this?

248
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,960
At the school.
We all learned.

249
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,899
School,
you went to school?

250
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,129
Yes.

251
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,968
Did your husband
go to school as well?

252
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,441
No, he came and got me.
He wanted a wife and he chose me.

253
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,273
I see.

254
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,177
Sit down
and mind your business.

255
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,413
And where is
your homestead?

256
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,789
I don't know.

257
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,334
Annie: Is that it?

258
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,537
Simon: George!

259
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,113
Hey, Simon!

260
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,321
Mullen: Eat.

261
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,220
No.

262
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,554
Listen to me.

263
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,823
There is no reason
not to tell me everything.

264
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,894
You're in the worst possible
situation anyone could imagine.

265
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,270
You've confessed to a hideous
crime for which you could hang--

266
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,935
hang by the neck out there
with everyone watching.

267
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,980
A hood on your eyes,
a gruesome death. That's the law.

268
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,743
Don't you care?

269
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,909
Don't you want
to save yourself?

270
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,887
- Where was George when Simon died?
- In the forest, working.

271
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,658
He came back with a load of shingles
and saw what had happened.

272
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,858
- Where's the body?
- Buried.

273
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,664
George and I buried him.

274
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,432
Simon:
You haven't done anything.

275
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,942
I couldn't do much
without the horses.

276
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,274
You use your hands.

277
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,974
I did some chinking.

278
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,381
But I needed a fork
to mix it.

279
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,352
Hey.

280
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,290
Where are the supplies?
There's nothing here.

281
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,759
Ask her.
She sent them down the river.

282
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,228
Didn't you?

283
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,733
Hey.

284
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,673
I thought there was a house.
A farm, the letter said.

285
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,368
There will be.
A castle.

286
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,674
Hey.

287
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,011
Simon.
What are you doing?!

288
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,484
- I can't sleep outside.
- You're not sleeping here with us.

289
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,348
Annie:
We could hang a blanket up--

290
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,118
He's not sleeping here.

291
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,855
- You'll bunk there at the cabin.
- I'll stay with the Treeces.

292
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,522
Like hell you will.

293
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,135
You make us something to eat
while George and I

294
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,037
take the packers back
to the neighbors.

295
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,166
Tonight?

296
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,073
Simon, she's tired.

297
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,170
- She hasn't done anything yet.
- It's all right.

298
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,478
- I like working.
- Is there any meat?

299
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,711
I didn't set the traps,

300
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,481
'cause there are a lot
of skunks about.

301
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,454
But I got some berries.

302
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,115
- Berries?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,626
Christ.

304
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,521
There's plenty of food
if you didn't mind killing.

305
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,374
Annie's voice: It was like being
lost in the middle of the ocean.

306
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,285
I felt so small
under that sky.

307
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,834
Henry,
it's her wedding tonight.

308
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,996
I'm sure there'll be some pretty,
young squirrels, huh?

309
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,564
- ( Jenkins chuckles )
- No one would blame you.

310
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,133
I've written to every parish,
both Catholic and Protestant,

311
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,442
within 20 miles.
Someone must know of her.

312
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,146
Said she was walking
for three days.

313
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,244
She could have been
walking in circles.

314
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,619
She said she came
down the river, from the west.

315
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
Lots of Scots out there.

316
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,521
Here's a sweet idea,
why not bring Annie?

317
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,588
- She'd brighten up any party.
- I'm sure she would.

318
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,691
Oh, Mullen.

319
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,429
We're pretty much free to do
as we wish out here.

320
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,806
I'm going to the party,
with or without you.

321
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,038
Should be fun.

322
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,479
( drunken laughter )

323
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,345
( music playing )

324
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,110
Well... I'm out.

325
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,787
- I could play another.
- Time for bed.

326
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,154
I'll go wash up.

327
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,421
You should wash up too.

328
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,555
Shut your mouth, clever laddy.

329
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,760
I did win five games
in a row.

330
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,009
George:
Simon, she's a lassy.

331
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,912
I lived with lassies.
I can.

332
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,918
They hate men who smell of old filth
and sweat like you do.

333
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,012
You sound like a lassy.
Get out of here.

334
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,165
Good night, Annie.

335
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,763
Good night.

336
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,025
- Simon: Come here.
- Annie: No, no!

337
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,036
- Simon: Come here.
- I don't want to.

338
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:13,269
- Simon: Stay still.
- It hurts.

339
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,644
( groaning )

340
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,222
- Don't just push it. Pull it.
- I am.

341
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,831
- Simon: Come on, you lass.
- George: Don't call me that.

342
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,019
Go get another one, lass.

343
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,563
What do you think
you're doing?

344
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,601
Get up and do some work.

345
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,332
Thanks.

346
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,077
Oh, Annie.
That is good.

347
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,547
- What is this?
- Same as last night

348
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,311
and the night before.

349
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,715
No!

350
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,186
- You're kidding me.
- ( Annie chuckles )

351
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,519
Hummm...

352
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,725
( Annie chuckles )

353
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,062
( thud; groaning )

354
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,362
Stop it.

355
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,100
Stop it.

356
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,342
( Annie screams )

357
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,562
For God's sake, Simon!

358
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,762
- What are you doing to her?
- Bugger off!

359
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,169
Why are you hurting her?!

360
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,664
Simon!

361
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,505
God damn it, George.

362
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,819
- ( thump )
- What do you think you're doing?

363
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,290
George: I cannot stand
what you're becoming.

364
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,759
- ( thump )
- Simon: It's none of your business.

365
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,362
Simon: Stay away!

366
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,871
( branches crack )

367
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,960
Annie's voice: "I dream'd I lay
where flowers were springing

368
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,859
Gaily in the sunny beam;

369
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,057
List'ning to
the wild birds singing,

370
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,327
By a falling crystal stream."

371
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,075
George: That's it.

372
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,584
I'll get you back.

373
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,768
George: Annie.

374
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,541
No, no!

375
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,953
One storm in that tent
will end it here for all of us.

376
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,444
Ruth: Mr. Mullen agreed
to put her in a larger cell.

377
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,579
Don't mind if she doesn't talk.
She just sews and sews.

378
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,919
I heard you singing.
That's good.

379
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,925
I have something.

380
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,193
A letter? You wrote it?

381
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,257
That's something
I want to do.

382
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,303
- Learn to write.
- You will mail it for me?

383
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,701
This is William Sellor.
I told you about him.

384
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,244
He has some dresses
he wants you to sew.

385
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,509
Costumes.
For a play based on an opera.

386
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,782
Are you sure
she can do this?

387
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,584
I can't afford to have it fail.
It took two weeks to get the cloth.

388
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,454
Ruth: She's an artist.

389
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,925
Look at her work. Here.

390
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,859
Yes, it's real nice.

391
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,625
It is outstanding.

392
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,733
- But...
- But what?

393
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,872
I've done a few sketches...

394
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,637
to inspire you.

395
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,076
Here are the measurements
for Lucia.

396
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,171
Both dresses are for her.

397
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,580
Are you familiar
with the story of Lucia?

398
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,381
- No.
- It's a wonderful story...

399
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,854
about a young girl
named Lucia.

400
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,982
She falls madly in love
with a young man.

401
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,088
Woman: Hello!

402
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,759
Hey. It's the Treeces.

403
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,829
Welcome.

404
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,271
Simon: Oh Christ.

405
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,537
Hello, George!

406
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,272
I just stopped by to see

407
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,576
if you folks would come over
Sunday next.

408
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,913
We haven't had a chance
to welcome you, Mrs. Herron.

409
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,112
We don't have time
for parties.

410
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,953
- Don't mind him, Mrs. Treece.
- Hope you'll perform for us.

411
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,816
With pleasure.

412
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,624
We miss seeing you
at the church.

413
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,859
Well, I've been anxious
to finish the house.

414
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,231
Not working on Sundays,
I hope.

415
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,370
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

416
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,635
We're on our way
to the fort, actually.

417
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,701
Simon, we'll be
picking up some supplies

418
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,010
before the weather changes,
back in a couple of days.

419
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,573
Is there anything you need?

420
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,914
No.

421
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,850
It must be very awkward
here for you,

422
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,257
alone with
these two young men.

423
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,818
No, we manage very well.

424
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,024
You have a lot of work to do
before the snow flies.

425
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,931
Well, now, here's something
I haven't seen before.

426
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:25,203
A fireplace open on both sides,
in the middle of the room.

427
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,244
Simon says
it'll heat four rooms.

428
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,803
Mr. Treece:
Nothing but a fire hazard.

429
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,009
You're sleeping out here?
You must be freezing.

430
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,884
You're welcome to sleep
at our place, George.

431
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,119
Well, it's not so bad.
I've built a shelter.

432
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,456
I've got that bear rug
you gave me.

433
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,463
You're building too close
to the creek.

434
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,693
This whole area floods
in the spring.

435
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,578
Hup!

436
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,921
We didn't need his help,
or anyone else's.

437
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,893
He's hoping we'll fail
so he can take it over.

438
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,826
Or he'll marry
his daughter off to George.

439
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,921
You'd be daft enough
to do it, huh?

440
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,366
- You borrowed the house, Simon.
- I paid him in furs.

441
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,369
He isn't so smart.

442
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,497
Lots of places have fireplaces,
open like this.

443
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,474
Every house in Orkney.

444
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,909
Annie: That Jenny does have
her eye on you, George.

445
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,711
Pure and simple.

446
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:44,687
Nothing's pure,
and never simple.

447
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,781
( people chatter )

448
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,893
- Five?
- All right.

449
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,056
Good night.

450
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,497
Good night.

451
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,168
Sir?

452
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,816
Annie gave me this to mail.
I never mailed anything.

453
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,912
So I thought I should
give it to you.

454
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,082
Thank you, Ruth.
I'll take care of it.

455
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,462
Annie's voice: "Dear Sadie,

456
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,527
I'm in terrible trouble.
I don't know who I can trust,

457
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,665
so I won't write of my situation
until I have heard from you."

458
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,734
"If you make your way here,
I'm sure that Mr. Mullen,

459
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,145
the fort headquarters,
will find you a place to stay.

460
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,343
Yours affectionately,
Annie."

461
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,545
It says nothing.

462
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,147
It says she's keeping
a great deal to herself.

463
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,749
I'll post the letter.

464
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,853
Then, if Sadie exists,
their correspondence continues

465
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,626
and we can learn what
really happened out there.

466
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,997
Good idea.

467
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,077
George: " Talk not of love "

468
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,243
" It gives me pain "

469
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,621
" For love
has been my foe "

470
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,888
" He bound me with "

471
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,192
" An iron chain "

472
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:38,998
" And plunged me
deep in woe. "

473
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,733
He wrote that
for a secret love...

474
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,970
Agnes Craig,
a married woman.

475
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,774
A lover.

476
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,213
You have a haunting voice.

477
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,581
No wonder
they miss you at church.

478
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:00,384
There was not much to sing about
till you came, Annie.

479
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,495
I thank God every night
that you're here.

480
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,897
You've been
such a blessing.

481
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,436
- ( Annie sighs )
- I'd better go back

482
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,340
and make supper.

483
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,980
Annie...

484
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,256
if you were my wife...

485
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,723
I would worship you.

486
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,605
Mullen's voice:
A month has passed,

487
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,943
and no light has been shed
on the young woman's true identity,

488
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,244
nor on the location
of her homestead.

489
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,411
Her youth and open demeanor
invite sympathy.

490
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,353
But in my experience,
judging a woman from her parents

491
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,220
is always a mistake.

492
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,619
I think I'd better
give this to you.

493
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,424
Thank you.

494
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,828
Look at this.

495
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,535
"Sadie Johnson...
deceased."

496
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,302
Oh dear.

497
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,038
- You want to tell her?
- I'd be wise not to.

498
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,445
For one thing, she's writing
another letter, a long one.

499
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,710
Yes, I see what you mean.

500
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,617
A man in your position
should always tell the truth,

501
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,985
but not all truths
need be told.

502
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,080
Exactly.

503
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,757
She has a bold script,
don't you think?

504
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,626
Yes.

505
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,393
Yes, a fascinating lass,
that one.

506
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,703
( music plays )

507
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,968
George: " Till all the seas
gang dry, my dear "

508
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,514
" And rocks melt
with the sun! "

509
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,107
" And I will love thee
still, my dear "

510
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,812
" While the sands
of life shall run. "

511
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,660
Mr. Treece:
Well done. Bravo.

512
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,795
- What confidence.
- Extraordinary.

513
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,397
You've got a real
talent there, lad.

514
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,840
Where did you learn
to sing like that?

515
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,346
Well, I was raised
by my father's sister,

516
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,382
a schoolteacher.

517
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,282
Simon was not so lucky.

518
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,786
He was raised
by my mother's cousin,

519
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,151
a woodsman.

520
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,019
I can sing a tune...

521
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,559
but you might not
like it much.

522
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,357
I wanted to go on at school.

523
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,298
But Simon was impatient
to take out my father's claim.

524
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,859
How wonderful
that you have each other.

525
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,873
- You can sing at my church.
- No, he can't.

526
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,273
We're leaving now.

527
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,778
Get your coat.

528
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,610
No, son. We thought
you'd stay here tonight.

529
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,240
It's pitch black
out there.

530
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,946
I didn't want to come
in the first place.

531
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,854
- We could get up early, Simon.
- No!

532
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,085
God damn it!

533
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,026
I wouldn't think
of traveling so late.

534
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,293
- I'm staying.
- Afraid of the wolves, Reverend?

535
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,197
God will protect you.

536
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,196
I hope you'll come back
soon, Mrs. Herron.

537
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,002
Maybe I can't read
or write...

538
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,009
but I can do a day's work,

539
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,602
- and not whine about it.
- We're going, Simon.

540
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,980
I just wanted to thank you
for the best meal I've ever had,

541
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,281
and for your hospitality.

542
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,720
- God bless you all.
- He'd be dead if it weren't for me.

543
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,020
- 1 00 times over.
- We're going, Simon.

544
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,287
The wolves would be chewing
at his bony ass.

545
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,668
You saw how he was.

546
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,432
Oh don't mind him, George.

547
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,474
I made a raisin pie.

548
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,873
Sit down.

549
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,877
Thank you.

550
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,573
Jenny made
the custard, George.

551
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,956
Simon, I'm falling!

552
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,869
You think I'm stupid?

553
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,470
You think I didn't see
what's going on?

554
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,918
I should leave you both
out here to freeze.

555
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,179
George!

556
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,604
Get down.

557
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,313
Make a fire.

558
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,494
You're not ready?

559
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,366
Simon, I don't want to.

560
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,672
Let's get it nice
and warm in here first.

561
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,110
Take everything off now.

562
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,114
Just sit down and--

563
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,174
I'll undress for you.
You'll like it.

564
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,152
I'll take off everything.

565
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,923
Just sit there.

566
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,231
George will be here soon.

567
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,031
Be very quiet,
and go to bed.

568
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,619
George: Annie!

569
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,949
Annie!

570
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,814
Annie!

571
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,882
Are you all right?

572
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,951
- Geor--
- Annie!

573
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,291
God damn you.

574
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,296
- Get the hell away from here.
- Annie!

575
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,900
Annie,
just say something.

576
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,308
- Anything.
- Annie: Simon, you're drunk.

577
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,403
Tell him, honey...

578
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,414
how much you love
your husband.

579
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,145
I'm fine, George.
I'm fine.

580
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,312
No...
I'm coming inside.

581
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,152
Annie: No, don't! Don't!

582
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,158
- Annie.
- Go away, George.

583
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,956
- Annie, please.
- Go now.

584
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,088
Please, go.

585
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,512
( Simon groans )

586
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,820
George: Christ.

587
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,461
Mullen:
Thank you, Donnely.

588
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,158
I've had a response
from my inquiries.

589
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,966
- A Reverend McBain.
- Have they found George?

590
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,099
He says he arranged the marriage
between you and Mr. Herron.

591
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,640
Seems to know a great deal.
He's very concerned about you.

592
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,147
And...

593
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:16,050
he says that this has been
a horrible mistake.

594
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,352
Why did you come here?

595
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:25,024
Have you ever looked
into a dead man's eyes?

596
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:30,895
No, not a dead man's.
A dead child's.

597
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,870
My daughter...
just a few days old.

598
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,338
- I'm sorry.
- I blame myself.

599
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,899
But that doesn't
make it right, does it?

600
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,706
No, sir.

601
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,441
Death is forever.

602
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,678
Heeyah!

603
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,197
Annie,
do you remember me?

604
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,289
Reverend McBain, of course.

605
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,959
Poor wee child.

606
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,837
We've gone over every idea.
Then we got word you were here.

607
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,401
- Have you seen George?
- He's at the Treeces'.

608
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,176
He's distraught
and confused...

609
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,810
as I'm sure you are.

610
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,821
Annie...

611
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,188
George told us
what happened.

612
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,387
I think not, Reverend.

613
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,955
I think not.

614
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,569
What have you
got on, there?

615
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,966
I'm going to marry
the devil.

616
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,944
Tell George not to lie

617
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:29,816
unless he's absolutely certain
the truth will never be discovered.

618
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,682
Aye, we'll make
some arrangements, sir.

619
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,952
Her mother was a Catholic,
but her father was a Scot.

620
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,290
Make him go away,
Mr. Mullen!

621
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,830
Nobody's accusing her
of anything.

622
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,594
You weren't there, Reverend!
You don't know!

623
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,828
Will you just listen to me?

624
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,394
Calm down, Reverend.
This is going nowhere.

625
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,440
- ( Annie hums )
- Donnely.

626
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,618
Mullen: Did you believe
his story?

627
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,676
Reverend: He's a member
of my congregation.

628
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:08,282
- He swore it is truthful.
- Either she's mad...

629
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,962
Am I wicked or insane?

630
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,301
Annie: George!
He's finally asleep.

631
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,903
Annie...

632
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,070
it's all right.

633
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,171
Let's get inside.

634
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,414
Take me away.

635
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,854
We could start over--

636
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:53,028
our own place,
our own family.

637
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,848
Simon: God damn you.

638
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,357
No, don't!

639
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,233
No!

640
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,174
- Annie: George!
- I should do the same to you!

641
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,783
Annie:
He's sick from the drink.

642
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,184
He's fallen asleep.
He's sorry.

643
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,017
I'm sure
he'll apologize.

644
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,922
He can apologize to Satan,
for all I care.

645
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,222
What if the fire goes out?
He'll freeze.

646
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,489
Mr. Treece:
How are you doing there?

647
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,394
George: I'll talk.

648
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,329
Jesus!

649
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:41,200
Simon,
what are you doing?!

650
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,673
- Get off my land!
- What do you think you're doing?!

651
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,577
- I'm here to help!
- You thankless bastard.

652
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,172
For God's sake, Simon!

653
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,775
We can't stay here.
She won't last the winter.

654
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,055
Simon: Walk away!

655
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,989
We need help!
Can't you see that?

656
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,361
You want to lose this place?
It'll happen.

657
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,162
George, Mrs. Herron,
you're all right?

658
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,963
Simon:
Get away from us!

659
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,630
- Leave us alone!
- You're not thinking, son.

660
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:18,806
Hey!

661
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,282
Now you have one last chance
to make this right.

662
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,686
You get on that horse
and we get to work.

663
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,749
And you stay
the hell away from her.

664
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,057
Or you leave here alone...

665
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,120
and you don't
ever come back.

666
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,660
George.

667
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,114
Annie's voice: "Oh Sadie,
I know there's no possibility

668
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,385
of me mailing this letter,
but still I must talk to you.

669
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,187
Thank goodness
Simon cannot read.

670
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,993
I fear that the worst
has happened."

671
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,657
( ruffling pages )

672
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,396
"They've been gone
for two nights now...

673
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,337
and I'm afraid George
might be dead."

674
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,310
( Annie sings )

675
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,779
( Jenkins chuckles )
It's Christmas.

676
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,352
Merry Christmas, Annie.

677
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:17,017
I've brought the key.

678
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,660
I've brought you
another bottle of laudanum.

679
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,725
I thought perhaps
you were low.

680
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,327
Would you like a sip?

681
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,713
Ummm...

682
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:41,410
I thought it was high time
I checked your frostbite.

683
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,782
Just to be sure, of course.

684
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,453
Do have a seat, please.

685
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,624
Pull down
your legging, please.

686
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,133
Good.

687
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,776
I'll take your boot off.

688
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,709
What are you doing here?

689
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,373
Get out of here,
you stupid fool! Go!

690
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,186
Silly Scotsman.

691
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,483
Hush now, Annie.

692
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,118
Just let the doctor
do his work.

693
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,523
Annie...

694
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,960
- Stop!
- It's so warm in here, Annie.

695
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,402
- Stop!
- What's going on here?

696
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,066
- It's Christmas, Mr. Mullen.
- Christmas, my ass!

697
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,167
- Open this damn door!
- Get back to the party.

698
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,371
I'll be with you
shortly. Ah!

699
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,882
Mullen: Pull up your damn pants!
Stop this insanity.

700
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,387
You drunken fool.
Get the hell out of here.

701
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,761
Don't tell me you never thought
of it too, Mr. Mullen.

702
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,381
He finds you
very attractive.

703
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,555
I tell you what,

704
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,593
come over to my house for a nice
hot meal. A little Christmas turkey.

705
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,494
( laughter )

706
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,329
See, nothing in the bowl.

707
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,426
Nothing in the bowl.

708
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,562
Rub it and make a wish.

709
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:49,035
- ( children gasp )
- You wished for candies.

710
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,677
Sing a song for us, Annie.

711
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,582
- Oh...
- Your turn. You promised.

712
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,176
Come on.

713
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,526
" My love is like a red,
red rose "

714
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,359
" That's newly sprung
in June "

715
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,366
" My love is
like the melody "

716
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:14,267
" That's sweetly
play'd in tune "

717
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,670
" As far as thou,
my bonnie lass "

718
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,733
" So deep in love am I "

719
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,643
" And I will love you
still, my dear "

720
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,205
" Till a' the seas
gang dry. "

721
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,793
Annie's voice: I thought
it was a log he dragged

722
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,701
and that it was Simon.

723
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,698
But in fact,
it was George,

724
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,971
wearing Simon's coat.

725
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,685
Annie: Oh mon Dieu!

726
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,767
What happened?

727
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,473
George, what happened?

728
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,105
Annie's voice:
What should we do?

729
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,939
What should we do?

730
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,084
When did it happen?

731
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,915
Yesterday?

732
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,282
You got in a fight?

733
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,957
It was an accident?

734
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,427
Don't you worry.

735
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,525
Everything will be
all right.

736
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,002
- A tree fell on him.
- Poor Simon.

737
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,539
He was my husband,
but I never really knew him.

738
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,404
No one did.

739
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,568
He worked hard.

740
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,374
Aye.

741
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,381
Annie's voice:
I cannot deny it, Sadie,

742
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:43,385
I felt a tremendous sense of relief
when I saw he was dead.

743
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,978
I wanted to put everything
about him behind me,

744
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,046
as though he had
never happened...

745
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:52,584
as though it was George who had
come for me and brought me here.

746
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,187
My prayers
had been answered.

747
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,571
God forgive me.

748
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,546
Of course
God forgives you.

749
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,309
It was an accident.

750
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,113
Close your eyes.

751
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,812
God will tell us
what to do.

752
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,118
Our Father
Who art in Heaven,

753
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,488
hallow be Thy name;

754
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,358
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.

755
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,478
We should go
tell the Treeces.

756
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,918
- And the reverend.
- Not tonight.

757
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,548
I've covered the body.
It's safe enough.

758
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,216
Tomorrow.

759
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,924
Get in there quickly
before it gets cold.

760
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,432
It's so peaceful here.

761
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,096
Aye.

762
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,663
I had a wee nap
while you were outside.

763
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,733
Everything will be
all right.

764
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,487
I wanted you from
the first moment I saw you.

765
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,668
Annie.

766
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:46,113
My apologies. I didn't mean
to frighten you.

767
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,548
I was worried about you.

768
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,382
I spoke to Mr. Treece.

769
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,649
- Annie: Oh.
- Aye.

770
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,021
Yes, good of you to come.

771
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,485
Reverend.

772
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,257
Welcome.

773
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,922
George.

774
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,995
- Where is Simon?
- He's gone...

775
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,663
to the fort.

776
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,833
We needed a new axe.

777
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,540
Mr. Treece was very upset.

778
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,479
He told me
Simon shot at him.

779
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,746
Not at him. In the air.

780
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,845
I didn't think
it was him at first.

781
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,483
Yes, Simon--
the firing and all,

782
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,152
- he was upset.
- Aye.

783
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,752
I see.

784
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,423
- Well, I'd like to talk to him--
- He understands he was wrong.

785
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,126
- He's sorry.
- I'm sure.

786
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,725
I don't want to make
matters worse, but--

787
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:44,170
- when will he be back?
- We'll tell him you came over.

788
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,070
We are all very worried
about you.

789
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,583
Do you not think
it'd be wise

790
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:58,085
to find yourself a place
to stay until spring?

791
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,213
We're doing fine, Reverend.

792
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,086
- Truly.
- Aye.

793
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,922
We'll build it better this time.
In the meantime...

794
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,825
we'll manage.

795
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,797
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

796
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,224
I can see you're busy.

797
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,939
George.

798
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,847
Why did you lie to him?

799
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,284
Why did you lie
to the reverend?

800
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,483
To give us time together...

801
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,924
now.

802
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,462
But why not just tell him
what happened?

803
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:41,621
Annie...

804
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,029
I want to be with you...

805
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,830
alone with you... now.

806
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,129
To love you.

807
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:55,337
But we have to give Simon
a proper funeral at the church.

808
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,605
No.

809
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,079
- I'll bury him here.
- Why?

810
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,345
He didn't believe in God.

811
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,886
It's what he'd want.

812
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,614
- Where are you going?
- To check the trapline.

813
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,001
Mullen's voice:
January 6th:

814
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,538
I have determined to journey
to the Herron homestead

815
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,631
to investigate for myself.

816
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,539
Mr. Mullen.

817
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,408
I'll be gone by the time
you're back.

818
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,379
This country is testing me.

819
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,078
I must confess
it got the better of me.

820
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,247
You were right to send
me back, I suppose.

821
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,950
You can send me some
correspondence on the girl.

822
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,892
I'd be interested to know
what you discover.

823
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,798
There you go.
Good luck.

824
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,606
Mullen's voice: The decision
whether to charge Mrs. Herron

825
01:07:58,674 --> 01:07:59,902
weighs heavily upon me.

826
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,881
The difference between Mrs. Herron's
account and that brought

827
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,442
by Reverend McBain is so striking
as to demand further inquiry.

828
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,784
I've sent word of my desire
to examine the body

829
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,416
and to interview all involved.

830
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,999
( gunshot )

831
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,966
George: God damn it!

832
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,936
- Piece of shit!
- Annie: What happened?

833
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,564
The wolves.
They smell the body.

834
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,837
I'll go tomorrow to get a shovel
so we can bury him.

835
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,504
- You were gone a long time.
- Aye.

836
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,481
I needed time... to think.

837
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,712
- About what?
- About what to do now.

838
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,311
I don't know much
about farming.

839
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,788
Simon was the one
who could do all that.

840
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,088
I was brought up
in a town...

841
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,720
in a big house,
with help.

842
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,788
I don't think
I can do this now.

843
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,630
You won't be alone.
I'll be here.

844
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,966
Our farm will be
a proper farm.

845
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,063
We'll have chickens
and geese and cows...

846
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,076
- and babies.
- Annie.

847
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,771
I--

848
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,239
I don't even care
if we can have this now.

849
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,411
What are you thinking?

850
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,752
I have nowhere else to go.

851
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,884
It's not right.

852
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,454
What we're doing,

853
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,396
it's not right.

854
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,065
I know.

855
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,234
We should have waited.

856
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,172
All right...

857
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,581
but I want you now.

858
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,779
I can't help it.

859
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,449
I don't want to face
anyone I know.

860
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,219
I just want you.

861
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,505
Annie...

862
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,666
what will become of us?

863
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,760
Henry Mullen. I'm looking
for George Herron.

864
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:46,365
Mr. Treece: He's not here.
He's gone to visit his aunt.

865
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,309
I've sent word with Reverend McBain.
They'll be coming within the week.

866
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,642
- Never mentioned it.
- I need to speak with him.

867
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,080
- Take a statement.
- Not to worry.

868
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:57,915
You can stay with us.
He'll be back within a few days.

869
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,717
It wasn't right, her being
there with those two laddies.

870
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:04,316
Simon was mainly stupid,
very different from George.

871
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,191
George is a sweet laddy.

872
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,288
We feel so badly for him.

873
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,560
He's hardly said a word
since the accident.

874
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:15,035
When they first arrived, George
came to the church every Sunday.

875
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:19,768
Then she arrived. The reverend said
she was raised by our church, but--

876
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,777
- We had them for supper.
- They left in the middle of dinner.

877
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,781
- Jenny: George didn't want to go.
- Next morning, we smelled smoke.

878
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:30,148
Henry went over and
Simon ran him off with a gun.

879
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,710
- A gun?
- Aye. I...

880
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,278
told Reverend McBain.

881
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,397
I'll take them straightaway
and let her try them on.

882
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:53,100
She will be so pleased.
I have more work if you have time.

883
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,075
I have nothing
but time, sir.

884
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,941
Yes.

885
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,843
Yes, this is absurd...

886
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:01,280
- you in here.
- Oh, I like it.

887
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,749
Yes, well...

888
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:07,551
freedom has little to do
with one's physical surroundings.

889
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,385
Allow me.

890
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,063
I will be back.

891
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,806
Mullen's voice: The spareness and
isolation of the place oppressed me.

892
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,180
Life here would be
barely supportable

893
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,219
under the most favorable
conditions.

894
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:47,353
There was a grave,
as Mrs. Herron had said.

895
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,558
But it was empty...

896
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:53,465
the surrounding soil
soaked in blood.

897
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,971
Someone had been here recently,
to judge by the fire

898
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,803
still smoldering
in the ruined fireplace.

899
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:06,513
Annie's voice:
I heard his skull crack.

900
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,379
( gunshot )

901
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,392
( animal whining )

902
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,105
What are you doing here?

903
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,547
I'm investigating
the death of Simon Herron.

904
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,244
My name is Henry Mullen.

905
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,915
George Herron.

906
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,982
I'm here to examine
the body of the deceased...

907
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,549
your brother.

908
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,528
It was an accident.

909
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,064
There seems to be
some question of that.

910
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,326
Put that gun down.

911
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:08,008
You told the Treeces
you were visiting your aunt.

912
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,237
I was. I am...

913
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,542
but I decided
to come here first.

914
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,913
- To check the trapline.
- I saw the body, George.

915
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,885
In the fireplace.

916
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,354
Wolves dug him up.

917
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,482
It was...

918
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,493
gruesome.

919
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:30,494
Some parts were dragged
into the bush...

920
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,796
chewed to the bone.

921
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,565
So I gathered up everything
I could find...

922
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,802
- and I burnt it.
- In the fireplace?

923
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,811
I couldn't think
of what else to do.

924
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,241
- How old are you?
- I'm 1 7, sir.

925
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,013
1 7...

926
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:55,250
I know your story, from both
the reverend and Mr. Treece.

927
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,918
Now I think you should tell me
in your own words.

928
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,018
There's not much to tell.

929
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,722
My brother had an accident.

930
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,665
I saw it with my own eyes.
A tree fell on him.

931
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,794
And Annie... his wife,

932
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,031
well,

933
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,369
it undid her, I guess.

934
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,173
- She took off.
- Fond of her?

935
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,545
Aye. We get along all right.

936
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:23,346
We both like
books and music.

937
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,181
And your brother?

938
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,222
Did you get along with him?

939
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,482
Simon and I didn't have
much in common.

940
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,391
But he worked hard.

941
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,556
He wanted to make a better life
for himself, for us.

942
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,930
- And I appreciated that.
- I see.

943
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:43,063
What are you doing?

944
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,106
I'm taking your brother's
remains with me.

945
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:47,733
- You're taking them?
- Yes, as evidence.

946
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,209
They'll be returned to you
if you wish, for burial.

947
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,680
- Or we can bury them for you.
- No, I'll bury him.

948
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,239
Very well.

949
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,979
Are you going to continue
homesteading?

950
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,817
It's all I have.

951
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:04,256
Mr. Treece says he'll
help me plant in the spring.

952
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,055
They've been very kind to me.

953
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,255
And I'll try and
make a go of it.

954
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,738
What will become of Annie, sir?

955
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,713
If the evidence supports
her claims,

956
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,545
we'll charge her...

957
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,778
and she'll go to trial.

958
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:34,549
- So she can hang?
- If she's found guilty, yes.

959
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,251
And if she is found guilty,
you'll be considered just as guilty

960
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,261
for withholding evidence.
You understand this?

961
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,354
You're under
investigation as well.

962
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,762
Aye.

963
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,130
But she's not guilty,
Mr. Mullen.

964
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,931
I can say that
before God, my maker.

965
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,802
I'll need a sworn statement
to that effect.

966
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:55,036
- Aye, sir.
- Do you like hunting?

967
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,476
I like to live, sir.

968
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,037
My brother taught me
that much.

969
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:11,250
Mullen's voice: My journey has both
raised and answered questions.

970
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,794
That crushed skull
is damning evidence.

971
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:17,923
But George Herron is adamant...
that it was accident.

972
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,560
I now had a picture
of her life there--

973
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,332
a hard life
with a hard man.

974
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,374
Hard enough to drive
a woman to madness?

975
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,136
Or murder?

976
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,908
My inclinations were at war
with each other.

977
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,975
I am of a mind to charge her
and let the jury decide the matter.

978
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,133
- Mr. Mullen is back.
- Yes.

979
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,197
He's very tired. He slept
under the stars last night.

980
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:04,473
- Did he speak to George?
- He doesn't report to me.

981
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,413
- I must talk to him.
- ( Ruth chuckles )

982
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,042
He doesn't report
to you either.

983
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,143
Hand me your linens.

984
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,223
And your rags?

985
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,638
- Ah, Mr. Sellor.
- Sorry. I heard you were back.

986
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,447
- Yes. Is there a problem?
- Not exactly.

987
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,919
Mrs. Herron asked me to mail this,
but the postmaster said

988
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:50,947
her last letter to Sadie Johnson
was returned, marked "deceased."

989
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:53,517
I find it peculiar
that she hadn't been told.

990
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,894
I thought it best. She's been
under considerable duress--

991
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,126
I tell you what,
leave it with me.

992
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:05,132
I would never forgive myself
if I did her any harm.

993
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,074
She's done enough harm to herself,
I dare say.

994
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,304
How's it coming along--
your play?

995
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,471
- Full rehearsal this evening.
- Congratulations.

996
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,572
- I look forward to seeing it.
- Thank you.

997
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,480
- Mr. Sellor?
- Yes?

998
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,712
Don't mention anything
to Mrs. Herron.

999
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,118
Please.

1000
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,963
Will you have
your supper now, sir?

1001
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:33,728
Yes, I'll be dining
in here this evening.

1002
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,032
The girl would like
to have a word with you.

1003
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,197
I'll speak
with her tomorrow.

1004
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,037
- Sir--
- Thank you, Ruth.

1005
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,515
Annie's voice: Dear Sadie, why
have you not answered my letters?

1006
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,680
I can only think
you have not received them.

1007
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:09,863
Hell is truth.
Seen too late.

1008
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,867
He was no longer a boy.

1009
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,638
The child was gone in him.

1010
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,948
( animal growls )

1011
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,738
Get away from there!

1012
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:52,905
Go!

1013
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,039
Go!

1014
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:03,683
Go!

1015
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,555
You don't scare me!

1016
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,835
The cut had been
made by an axe.

1017
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,038
Deep and gruesome,
cutting through bone

1018
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:00,206
and right through
the heart of him.

1019
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,481
Whatever had happened
out there, Sadie,

1020
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,992
had ended in betrayal,
brother against brother.

1021
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,255
And it was all
because of me.

1022
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:17,025
I had set them
against each other.

1023
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:14,013
I told you
I would bury him.

1024
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,825
You say it was an accident.

1025
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:22,852
- Just like you said.
- Why didn't you leave him alone?

1026
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,489
Help me.

1027
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,330
( George screams )

1028
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,544
( crack )

1029
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,457
George: I killed him.

1030
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,658
I watched him spout
his last bloody breath.

1031
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,166
And there was no sign.

1032
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:10,036
You wanted him dead, too.

1033
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:14,642
We're both guilty,
I know that.

1034
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,583
But nobody need judge us.

1035
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,747
I did it for you.

1036
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,860
He was going to come back
and have you, he said.

1037
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:32,832
Laughing at me.

1038
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,931
He was talking crazy
about what he'd do to you.

1039
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,038
So I picked up the axe...

1040
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,635
and I flung it wildly.

1041
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,076
And he went down...

1042
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,243
with one scream.

1043
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:55,051
Then he just looked at me.

1044
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,316
And that was it.

1045
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:03,423
It was much too easy.

1046
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,363
Much too easy.

1047
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,622
Aren't you coming to bed?

1048
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,252
Maybe we both wanted it.

1049
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,388
But it was me that did it.

1050
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:40,665
I'll never say
anything to anyone.

1051
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,638
It was better when
you didn't know the truth.

1052
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,168
Because every time
I look at you,

1053
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:54,841
I remember pulling that bloody blade
out of my brother's back.

1054
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,735
( horse neighs )

1055
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,746
Where are you going now?

1056
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:36,085
The truth is
chasing me, Annie.

1057
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:38,682
I cannot sleep
and I cannot stay here.

1058
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,955
- I'm going to the fort.
- It's both of us,

1059
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,192
- not just you.
- If someone comes,

1060
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,166
just tell them the truth
about what I did.

1061
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:51,337
I'll turn myself in.
They don't need to know about us.

1062
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,170
Don't go!

1063
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:57,507
I hope that I never
see you again.

1064
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:22,898
Annie's voice: I waited
for days, going slowly mad.

1065
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,531
I thought George had gone
to the fort and that he would hang

1066
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,701
for a crime that was
as much mine as his.

1067
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:31,244
Finally, I could
bear it no longer.

1068
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,444
( breathing heavily )

1069
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,154
I know my part in this.

1070
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:49,526
But I did truly think
that George loved me...

1071
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,861
as much as I loved him.

1072
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,439
How has she been?
Mrs. Herron?

1073
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,403
Not so well.
Worried.

1074
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:06,572
And sick in the mornings.

1075
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:11,107
She is with child.
It's quite apparent.

1076
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,287
She's having a baby.

1077
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:19,690
You can't hang her now,
can you?

1078
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,093
It's not up to me, Ruth.

1079
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,654
I think it is.

1080
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,859
I know it is.

1081
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,099
Annie's voice:
I need you here, Sadie.

1082
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,538
I have an enormous
favor to ask.

1083
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:36,668
Please send word immediately,
or I really will go mad.

1084
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,955
Mr. Mullen.

1085
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,557
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes, but first--

1086
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:57,462
please, take a seat,
Mrs. Herron.

1087
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,469
This has been returned.

1088
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,525
I'm so sorry.

1089
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:37,066
Have you come
to some conclusions?

1090
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,628
Not yet.

1091
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,833
It's more complicated
than I anticipated.

1092
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,239
That's all I can say.

1093
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:53,382
I'll have Ruth
bring you some tea.

1094
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,432
Mullen: "In the matter
of Mrs. Annie Herron--

1095
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:52,908
In the matter of
Mrs. Annie Herron,

1096
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,244
it is the conclusion
of this office--

1097
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:02,352
It is the conclusion
of this office

1098
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,948
that there's insufficient evidence
to warrant the laying of charges.

1099
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:06,926
for any criminal act.

1100
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,985
Mrs. Herron suffered
from delusions,

1101
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:12,123
brought on by her mistreatment
at the hands of her husband.

1102
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,760
The result is that she believed
herself to be implicated

1103
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:16,565
in his accidental death,

1104
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:19,299
wishing as she did,
for release from her torment.

1105
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:21,341
Her better nature
has been restored

1106
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,003
and she is therefore
released from custody."

1107
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:45,457
Ha! Get along!

1108
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:51,064
Nice day for getting married.
Isn't it, Annie?

1109
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,098
Come on!

1110
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,480
Minister:...according to the duty
of a faithful husband,

1111
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,483
forsaking all others
during her life,

1112
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:06,042
keeping faithful and truth
on all points,

1113
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,715
as the Word of God and
His Holy Gospel doth command.

1114
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,553
George:
Even so, I take her...

1115
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:15,653
before God and in the presence
of this congregation.

1116
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,994
Minister: The Lord sanctify,
bless you and pour

1117
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:20,966
the riches of His grace upon you,
that you may please Him

1118
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:24,402
and live together in love
till your lives end.

1119
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,906
Could you all please rise?

1120
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:33,239
" The Lord is my shepherd "

1121
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,215
" I shall not want "

1122
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,616
" He makes... "

1123
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,950
Annie's voice:
It seems that Mr. Treece

1124
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:42,956
did get control of the land,

1125
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,891
just as Simon said he would.

1126
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,020
" He leadeth me "

1127
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:55,228
" The quiet waters by. "

1128
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,596
( fiddle playing )

1129
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,046
- ( clapping )
- Man: Ladies' choice!

1130
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:42,514
Your turn, ladies!
Come on, now.

1131
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,312
Ladies' choice.

1132
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:50,587
George, as your sister-in-law,
I think I deserve a dance.

1133
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:55,393
( music starts )

1134
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,332
I'm so sorry, Annie.

1135
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,606
- I failed you.
- We all do it.

1136
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:08,665
We have to do it, George.

1137
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:14,577
You didn't tell me
you were having his baby.

1138
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,641
Not his... yours.

1139
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:22,249
It's a girl. Sadie Herron.

1140
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,257
But she'll be known
as Simon's daughter

1141
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,317
so she'll have a legitimate
place in this world.

1142
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,459
Aye.

1143
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:33,557
Of course.

1144
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:36,466
( clapping )

1145
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:39,097
I know you'll do well
by us, George.

1146
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:42,173
I will.

1147
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,050
( music plays )
