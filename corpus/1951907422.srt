about going away to school, right?

197

Well, I think I may have found
the perfect compromise.

198

It's a duplex in Ventura.

to UCSB. I can get to work.

It's the same distance,
I'll show you on the computer.

201

you have this whole top floor to yourself.

I couIdn't very well tell him
that the concept was only

210
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,238

than being buried alive.

You are officially out of the Stone Age.
You've evolved.

213

for me to hang and be irresistibly alluring.

we casually blurt out,

Because he knows you, you know.

Mandy, I need you to show me a picture
with your phone of the commons.

347
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,734
Now.

00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,181
ALEXA: Hi.

349
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:07,057
I love what they've done with the place.
I'll see you at home in 10 minutes.

350
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,058
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

351
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,237
Sorry, I have to go.
It was really nice knowing you.

352
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,973
-I hope you can make it to my funeral.
-Wait. Look.

353
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:25,180
Saturday night, I'm having this party and
I was wondering if you wanted to come.

354
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,084
I'll leave your name at the gate.

355
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,016
-Wait, are you...
-Asking you out?

356
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,950
Yes.

357
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,093
Mandy, will you go out with me?

358
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,432
To your party?

359
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,527
I mean, the biggest, most glamorous,
important party of the year?

360
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,936
-Me?
-Yeah.

361
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,934
-With you?
-Yeah.

362
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,375
So you'll come?
I mean, what could possibly stop you?

363
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,939
You're grounded.

364
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,951
No! No, no, no. Dad, Dad, Dad. Wait. Okay.
You don't understand.

365
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,055
I can't be grounded, okay?
Okay, do you not get it?

366
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,817
Dad, he is like the hottest guy in school

367
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,758
and he asked me to his party
this weekend, Dad.

368
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,193
Dad, it is Drew Patterson.

369
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:16,127
Drew Patterson, right. He's the rabid
primate that was groping you.

370
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,701
It's amazing how you can watch
these videos over and over and over.

371
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,535
Dad, we are not bonding here.

372
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,940
The problem, Mandy, is that this is just
another example of how you don't listen.

373
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,946
As a matter of fact,
you're double-grounded.

374
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,311
-Double-grounded?
-I'm sorry, did I say double?

375
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,283
'Cause I meant triple.

376
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,879
Triple-grounded?

377
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,616
Yeah, 'cause you can't go out, you can't
use your phone and you can't watch TV.

my own home.

is the dream.

383
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,478

-Sure.
-You are coming tonight, aren't you?

Dad, is it possible that you're overreacting
with far too much aggression

00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,760
to such a minor transgression?

-No, I'm not insane.
-Yes, you are.

411
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,902
No, no, I'm sure it's an emergency.
It's just that she's grounded.

412
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,411
That's why she can't talk to you.

-Yeah.

Okay, Dad. I have a totally for-real
legitimate homework 911 crisis.

to study history and econ.

on the night of this wildly important party,

you're gonna go out,
but you're gonna study at Alexa's.

I make lemonade,

452
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,058
by studying hard, so I can get
good grades to get into a good school

453
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,960
and become
a productive member of society.

454
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,731
Yeah, the lemon's not really buying that.

455
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,604
It's fine. I understand.

456
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,336
You don't trust me.

457
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,611
And even though that eviscerates
my very well-being, it's fine.

458
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,714
I'll just stay here and wallow in despair.

Probably scar myself for life,
but don't worry, okay?

460
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,222
-No.
-I'm sure eventually, I'll forgive you,

by the time
you start collecting social security.

But seriously, I have to study.

Let me ask you this,
will Alexa's mom be there?

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,689
Yes.

465
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,364
So we'd have genuine authentic
adult supervision.

466
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,669
All right, I'm gonna say okay.

467
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,300
But there are some rules.

468
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,373
First of all, you can have your phone back.
That's exciting.

469
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,678
But you're not allowed to make any calls.

470
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,584
In fact, you're not allowed to receive
any calls, other than from me.

471
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,817
And I'm gonna be calling every half hour.

472
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:17,157
You know, just to make sure
everything's going well with the studies.

473
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,463
Thanks, Dad. I really appreciate you
trusting me so much

00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,626
-you're putting me under phone arrest.
-Well.

475
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,671
You've given a whole new meaning
to the term cell phone.

476
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,932
Enjoy.

477
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,708
And don't worry, I don't need the car.
I can just walk.

Okay, if you insist.

482
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,023
But I need you to know
that I'm not really a monster.

between a daughter and father is trust.

485

Of course, Dad. And I want to trust you.

you're staying here. There's no UCSB.

-Books?

MANDY: Once again, I had to walk as a
ghost on the grounds of high school.

1387
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:54,009
For I, a humble peasant girl,
had done the unthinkable.

1388
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,745
I had spurned the crown prince
of Camelot.

1389
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,513
The repercussions of which
would no doubt haunt me

1390
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:01,953
for weeks to come.

This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

Senior prince, Drew Patterson,
will now crown his princess.

01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,939
Drew.

1395
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,799
Come on, man, what's up?

1396
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:51,502
If you do this, you're no longer one of us.

1397
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,306
Come.

1398
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,987
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

1399
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:14,758
Come with me, please.

Why are you doing this?

1402
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:39,184
With all these people around,
I figured you might not say no to me.

1403
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,248
And I could do this.
