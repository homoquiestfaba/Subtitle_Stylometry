1
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,625
Here.

2
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,458
Do you see the color?

3
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,250
It's ruby-red,

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,917
like your necklace.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,709
That means
the sun was perfect this year.

6
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,583
It's ready.

7
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,750
Go tell your mother

8
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,458
that we're going to have
chicken tonight.

9
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,250
It will go so well
with our new wine.

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,333
Go, go.

11
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,500
Name all 44 wine villages
of Burgundy.

12
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,291
Chablis, Nuits, Macon...

13
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,834
Oh.

14
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:12,792
I'm almost ready.

15
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,125
Calm down, sweetie.

16
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,709
It's only me.

17
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:16,976
Just wishing my best friend
good luck

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,875
on the most important

19
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,542
day of her life.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,917
No pressure, right?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,393
Promise me once you pass
your master sommelier exam,

22
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,500
you'll come home to visit.

23
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,500
We miss you
in little old Carington.

24
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,625
If I pass.

25
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,250
Hey, don't second-guess
yourself.

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,792
- You got this.
- Thanks.

27
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,166
Oh! And guess who's awarding
badges this year?

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,709
Taylor Swift?

29
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:34,792
No.

30
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:35,917
Jennifer Huether.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,226
She's probably
the best-known woman

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,625
to ever become a master somm.

33
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,291
Anyway, I've got to run.

34
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,500
All right.
Call me later.

35
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,333
Okay. Love you. Bye.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,750
Good morning.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi.

38
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,333
Good morning, Miss Savern.

39
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,834
Glad to see you trying again.

40
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:15,917
Thank you.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,875
It's an honor to be back.

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,959
Good luck.

43
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,250
Miss Savern,

44
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,500
you have 30 minutes

45
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,834
to identify
all six wines correctly.

46
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,542
Starting now.

47
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,792
This wine is clean,
crisp, fresh.

48
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,458
Light body, medium-light.

49
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,458
Flavors of slate, citrus,

50
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,250
unripe pear, hint of oak,

51
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,917
hint of salt.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ocean air.

53
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,709
This is a Chardonnay
from France.

54
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,750
Burgundy, Chablis, Grand Cru.

55
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,583
Les Clos, 2016.

56
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,208
This wine is medium-bodied.
New World.

57
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,750
Flavors of lemongrass,
grapefruit, mango.

58
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:13,375
Sauvignon blanc
from Wairau Valley, 2019.

59
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,959
O Rosal, 2018, from Rias Baixas.

60
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,667
Saint-Julien, 2008,
from Bordeaux, France.

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,417
Zinfandel, Rutherford.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
2018 from Napa Valley,
California, USA.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,375
Um...

64
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,417
This wine is medium-heavy.

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,959
Opaque.

66
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,834
Notes of...

67
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,834
raspberry, plum...

68
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:55,834
lots of fruit.

69
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,583
It's a...

70
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,834
Malbec...

71
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,375
from San Rafael, Argentina.

72
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,291
Wait. Not Malbec.

73
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,166
Cabernet Sauvignon?

74
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,291
Uh, no, that's not final.

75
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,500
Ten seconds.

76
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,959
Um...

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,834
Cahors France, 2016?

78
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,208
Congratulations.

79
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,458
Thank you, Miss Huether.

80
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,792
Ugh, I knew it was
the San Rafael Malbec,

81
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,041
and I second-guessed myself.

82
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,792
The master sommelier exam

83
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,184
is the most difficult test
in the world.

84
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,000
Lots of people
don't pass the first...

85
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,083
Or even second time.

86
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,542
Well, you did.

87
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,726
I can't believe
I have to wait another year

88
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,083
to try again.

89
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,625
Jenna, you don't have to be
a master somm to succeed.

90
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:50,959
Or for me to love you.

91
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,625
I do if I ever want to work

92
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,291
at a high-end restaurant
like Alluvial.

93
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,959
Just don't beat yourself up.

94
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,208
You know, statistically,

95
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,601
it's easier to become
an NBA player

96
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,709
than a master somm.

97
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,750
There's only 190 in the world.

98
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,125
Yeah, and only 27 women.

99
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,375
I really wanted
to be one of them.

100
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
On the bright side,

101
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,291
now that it's over,

102
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,375
you can put the cards away.

103
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,875
We can relax.

104
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,417
Look, you worked really hard.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
You owe yourself a break.

106
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I just got invited

107
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,875
to do a tasting
in Santa Barbara.

108
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Be my date?

109
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
Okay...

110
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,083
Okay.

111
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,208
But I am going
to take the test again,

112
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,667
and I am going
to bring my books.

113
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,959
Of course.

114
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,792
I have sold 12 bottles
of the Fleur de Ciel tonight.

115
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,500
Excellent work as always, Edwin.

116
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,208
I have half a bottle left.

117
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,917
Would you like to try it?

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,250
Sure, I'll have a taste.

119
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:52,083
It's as much about
who you enjoy the wine with

120
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,166
as the vintage itself.

121
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,291
Now, this winemaker

122
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,208
has won best winery in the world
two years in a row.

123
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,125
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

124
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,208
Cheers.

125
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,125
What do you think?

126
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,834
It's slightly off-balance.

127
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,208
There's a hint of acidity.

128
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,083
Uh, "Wine Enthusiast"
gave this bottle 98 points.

129
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,486
I had to beg
just to get 10 cases.

130
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:22,917
Right.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,917
I'm sure I'm just exhausted.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,250
Who am I to argue
when so many people love it?

133
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,625
Um, I'm going to head home.

134
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,917
Okay.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,041
See ya.

136
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,250
- Bye, Edwin.
- Ciao.

137
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,709
Enjoy. Congratulations.

138
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,583
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

139
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,667
Okay, Spanish wine.

140
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,750
France...

141
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,333
Germany...

142
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,667
- Hey, Dad.
- Well, let me guess.

143
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,291
Champagne, 1973.

144
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,375
Hmm...

145
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:03,542
nice guess,

146
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,309
but I am working on
Spanish wines right now.

147
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,500
You know, I heard

148
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,935
you were actually
taking some time off work.

149
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,875
Um, I wouldn't call it time off.

150
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,583
The test
is exactly a month away,

151
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,417
and I have a ton
of studying to do.

152
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,518
You got time
in all that studying

153
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,542
for a party?

154
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,583
Um, definitely not.

155
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,750
What if I told you

156
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,750
it was the 40th anniversary
surprise party

157
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,625
I'm planning for your mom?

158
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,542
Dad, that is wonderful!

159
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,250
Yes, I can definitely
make it home for the party.

160
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,625
Well, why don't you come up
for a couple of weeks before?

161
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,458
There's nothing
but peace and quiet up here.

162
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,625
It sounds really nice,

163
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:36,625
but I have my routine here,

164
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,750
and my books, and...

165
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,166
Also, the Carington Food
and Wine Festival is this week,

166
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,959
and the wine competition
is being judged

167
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,792
by Jennifer Huether.

168
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,041
Wait. You're kidding.

169
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,208
I know you too well

170
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,571
to kid about
something like that.

171
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,000
- So are you in?
- You know what?

172
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,291
Yes.

173
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,154
This sounds like
just what I need.

174
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,291
Yeah, that's your mom calling.

175
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,542
I'll text you later.

176
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,417
All right. Love you.

177
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,458
Come on. Let's go.

178
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,208
Come on.

179
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,834
Hey, you.

180
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,709
Hey! What are you doing here?

181
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,417
I just thought
I'd stop by, see you.

182
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
That's sweet.

183
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,083
Yeah, find out what's selling.

184
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,667
Hey, guess what?

185
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,834
My dad wants me to come home

186
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,837
and help out with
their 40th wedding anniversary.

187
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah, may be good for you
to relax before the test.

188
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,125
Yeah, but I want you
to come, too.

189
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,959
And not the whole time.
Maybe...

190
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,333
a week?

191
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,583
To test you?

192
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,667
No. To relax.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,041
And to test me...

194
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,500
What? Two weeks
is a long time to be away.

195
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,875
You know, I wish I could,
but, you know, the restaurant.

196
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,041
Okay. I understand.

197
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,542
But I will be there
for the party.

198
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,291
- Great.
- Okay.

199
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,917
- Thanks.
- Okay.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,476
- I'll see you tonight.
- See you later. Bye.

201
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,542
Bye.

202
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,542
Come on.
Let's go see who it is.

203
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:31,792
Hey, that's her!

204
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,625
Hi, Dad!

205
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:34,959
Hi!

206
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,417
Hey, so good
to see you, sweetie.

207
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,041
So good to see you, too.

208
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,500
Look who it is.

209
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,291
Hey, Baxter.
Hi, buddy.

210
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,667
Oh, look at you.

211
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,375
- Oh, Dad!
- You look so great.

212
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,000
Hi, Mom.

213
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,500
I missed you.

214
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,263
She needs to breathe.
She needs to breathe.

215
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,959
Look at you.

216
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,709
My master sommelier.

217
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,583
We are so proud of you.

218
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,625
Not yet, Mom.
The exam is still a month away.

219
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,250
Oh, well, you will pass
this time.

220
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,709
Well, supposedly,
I did really well

221
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,351
with the theory and the service
parts of the exam.

222
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,083
I just still need
to master the tasting.

223
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,375
You'll get there this time.

224
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,542
Hey, guess who I saw
at the post office today?

225
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,834
Who?

226
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,458
Allison, and she is
so excited to see you.

227
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,542
I can't wait to see her.

228
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,333
There are so many people
on the lawn.

229
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,959
Well, that's our new winemaker.

230
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:21,959
He's made some good changes.

231
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,375
Huh.

232
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,418
You think he could fix
the sign on the front gate?

233
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,500
We have been working
very hard on the land.

234
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,500
Why don't you let me
show you around?

235
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,166
Go, go.

236
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,542
Do you milk those?

237
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,309
They eat weeds.
They eat all kinds of things.

238
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,959
Okay.

239
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,542
Dad, I can't believe you planted

240
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,750
a whole new section on the hill.

241
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,267
Grandma Ellie
never wanted to plant here.

242
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,291
It's so dry,

243
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,393
especially
with fire season coming.

244
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,875
It's all about drainage.

245
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,226
Marcelo is into
doing everything...

246
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,750
naturally.

247
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,834
I don't know.

248
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,357
Aidan thinks
natural wines are a fad.

249
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,750
Everyone around here's
going organic.

250
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,208
No pesticides.

251
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,559
Well, they don't sell as well
or keep as long

252
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,166
as traditional wines.

253
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,518
They're a lot more expensive
to produce.

254
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,208
Plus, they tend to be a bit...

255
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,375
sour.

256
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,333
Why don't you tell me
what you really think, honey?

257
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,291
Come on. Let's go.

258
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,375
Okay.

259
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,709
Hey.

260
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,166
Thanks.

261
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,208
Oh, no. Dad, look. Aphids.

262
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,542
Ugh.

263
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,834
You have to be careful.

264
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,957
I wouldn't worry about it.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,750
I'm sure Marcelo's got a plan.

266
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,083
How have the reviews been?

267
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,375
Excellent.

268
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,709
He's really lived up
to his reputation.

269
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,250
And what reputation is that?

270
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,458
Well, he saved
a vineyard in France.

271
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,250
The vines had all
burned up in a drought.

272
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,417
He incorporated

273
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,041
an irrigation technique
from Germany

274
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,166
that basically brought

275
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,125
the whole operation
back to life.

276
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,375
Huh. Impressive.

277
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,875
Marcelo's worked
all over the world.

278
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,417
We're really lucky to have him.

279
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
Come on. Let's go look
at the new cellar.

280
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,250
Marcelo, Marcelo...

281
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,166
Hey, good morning, sweetheart.

282
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,375
Hey, Dad.

283
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,875
I need a favor.

284
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,417
Your mom thinks

285
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,142
I'm working the tasting room
this afternoon,

286
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,583
but I have to run into town

287
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,250
and talk to the caterer
about the party.

288
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,625
So, um, can you work
the tasting room today?

289
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,125
You can bring your book
if you want.

290
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,750
Sure.

291
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:21,750
It'll be like the good old days.

292
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,000
Aw, we wish.

293
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,000
Thanks, kiddo.

294
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,041
You bet.

295
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,417
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah.

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,375
Hello.

297
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,709
Welcome to Savern Vineyards.

298
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,458
Buenos tardes.
Good afternoon.

299
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,625
Oh, buenos tardes.

300
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,959
Are you here for a tasting?

301
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,641
Today, we're showing
our 2019 pinot noir.

302
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:55,768
I could give you
a tasting lesson.

303
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,417
Sure.

304
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Great.

305
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,834
The first thing you want to do
is look at the color.

306
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,250
What do you see?

307
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,417
Uh, red.

308
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,500
Yes, correct. Red.

309
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,375
Let's try to get
a little more specific.

310
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,792
Would you say it's more like
a bright poinsettia

311
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,000
or a soft carnation?

312
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,500
Actually, it reminds me
of the ceibo flower.

313
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,768
The one that grows back home
where I'm from.

314
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,667
Where's home?

315
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,875
Argentina.

316
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,083
Oh, they make fabulous wines
in Argentina.

317
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,333
I heard.

318
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,208
I'll have to find
a picture of that flower.

319
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,125
I can always use
more descriptors.

320
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,625
What... what region are you from?

321
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,959
Mendoza region,
a little town near the...

322
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,041
The Andes.

323
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,333
You know your geography.

324
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:45,083
You can't be a wine connoisseur
if you don't.

325
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,083
I need to learn more
about those famous Malbecs.

326
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,643
Well, the best way to learn
is to go there.

327
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,834
You should go.

328
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,333
I should.

329
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,041
I actually grew up here,

330
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,083
learning from my grandmother.

331
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,166
Ellie Savern.

332
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,750
This is her vineyard.

333
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,851
She was one of the first
female winemakers in the region.

334
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,333
That's quite a legacy.

335
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,792
So do you plan
to follow in her footsteps?

336
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,917
I...

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,959
I hope to, yes.

338
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,208
I'm actually a sommelier.

339
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,583
Wow.

340
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,959
Now we have to smell.

341
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,875
Close your eyes.

342
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,250
Mm...

343
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,542
now that we've let in
the aroma of...

344
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,166
do you smell plums?

345
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,166
Taste?

346
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Sure.

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583
Mm.

348
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,625
We're selling
our vintage reserve pinot

349
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,291
for $45 a bottle.

350
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,500
Are you interested?

351
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:47,792
Um...

352
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
actually,
I've got to get back to work,

353
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,709
unfortunately,

354
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,458
but it was very nice
to meet you.

355
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,542
Oh, yes.

356
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,685
Good to meet you, too.
I'm Jenna.

357
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,291
I'm Marcelo Castillo.

358
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,917
I'm actually the head winemaker
here at Savern.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,125
And I'm sure I'll be...

360
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,208
I'll be seeing you soon.

361
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,750
Uh...

362
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,351
Sales haven't been this high
since Grandma Ellie passed away.

363
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,250
I wanted Marcelo to enter
the Carington Wine Competition,

364
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,667
but he doesn't believe in them.

365
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,125
A winemaker who doesn't believe
in competitions?

366
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,542
Oh, don't give me that look.

367
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,083
He's very talented,
and that's what matters most.

368
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,333
I see.

369
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,667
Hey, look who I found
coming up the driveway.

370
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:30,935
Jenna, this is Marcelo Castillo.

371
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,875
Mucho gusto.

372
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:32,875
We actually met.

373
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,166
Sort of.

374
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,090
He came by when I was working
the tasting room.

375
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
I thought your father
was handling the tastings today.

376
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,875
Oh, I was.

377
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,879
She just stopped by
for a little visit, you know?

378
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,000
Hmm.

379
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,375
Well, Marcelo,

380
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,583
I'm sure you and Jenna
will have a lot to discuss.

381
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,166
She's a master sommelier,
you know.

382
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,625
Not yet.

383
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,583
Honey, there may be something
burning in the kitchen.

384
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, my chicken.

385
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
I'll be right back.

386
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,375
Dinner is in five minutes.

387
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,917
Uh, can I help you, Mom?

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,458
I am sure it's fine!

389
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,709
Hey. Uh...

390
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,250
Hello.

391
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,875
I apologize for not
introducing myself earlier.

392
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,625
You kept going,

393
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,625
and I didn't want to stop you.

394
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,041
Well, you could have.

395
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
You were really
enjoying that wine.

396
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,667
It was...

397
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,375
a kind of nice bottle.

398
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,750
For a natural wine.

399
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,241
I know, I heard from your dad.

400
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,750
You're not the first to doubt.

401
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,709
The problem is,

402
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,083
if something goes wrong,

403
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,458
there's no way to fix it.

404
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,542
You say problem,
I say challenge.

405
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,745
But you know all about that.

406
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,208
The exam. Yes.

407
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,166
Your parents
are really proud of you.

408
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,542
It's really
an impressive undertaking.

409
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,083
It's only impressive if I pass.

410
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,166
And if you pass,

411
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,583
what do you plan to do?

412
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,208
My boyfriend owns

413
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,458
a three-Michelin-star restaurant
in San Francisco,

414
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:02,542
and I would love
to get my foot in the door

415
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
having real influence
curating wines for restaurants.

416
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,500
And you're taking the exam
to work in a restaurant?

417
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,208
You get a significant
pay increase.

418
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,041
And it's
a very prestigious position.

419
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,805
And very competitive,
especially for women.

420
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,917
I see.

421
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,291
And...

422
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,250
my grandmother...

423
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,917
always wanted
to be a master somm.

424
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,470
But she never had time
for all the studying.

425
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,208
Well, also, running this winery,

426
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,333
so...

427
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,333
I...

428
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,625
I guess I'm here trying to do
what she couldn't.

429
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,625
I see.

430
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:48,667
Well, I'm certain that you have
great things ahead of you,

431
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,000
Miss Savern.

432
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,625
Jenna...

433
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,750
Jenna.

434
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,792
Nice to meet you again,

435
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,709
and goodnight.

436
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,875
Goodnight.

437
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,166
Jenna!

438
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,250
Hi!

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,417
Lucia, meet
my best friend, Jenna.

440
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,625
Hi, Jenna.

441
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,166
I've heard so much about you.

442
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,417
Lucia is amazing.

443
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,768
I couldn't run this place
without her.

444
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,041
It is so nice to meet you.

445
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,417
What are you ladies working on?

446
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,667
These are ginger-walnut scones.

447
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,792
Try one.

448
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,500
We're doing
all the sweets and treats

449
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,143
this year
for the town fair on Saturday.

450
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,333
You'd better come.

451
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,834
These are delicious.

452
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,000
Of course, I will be there.

453
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,417
Oh, here.

454
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,917
What's this?

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,709
My dad insists on paying you
for the anniversary cake.

456
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,959
Don't be silly.

457
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,561
I practically grew up
in your vineyard.

458
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,851
And I broke the swing, remember?

459
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, that's because
I pushed you too hard.

460
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,500
Your dad's the greatest.

461
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
He definitely deserves
a free cake.

462
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,333
So generous of you.

463
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,542
Thank you.

464
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,417
Hey, have you met
my parents' new winemaker?

465
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,875
- Marcelo?
- Yeah.

466
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,839
He's not that new.
You just haven't been around.

467
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,458
He came into
the tasting room yesterday

468
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,709
when I was working

469
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,875
and pretended to be
a random customer.

470
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,267
I was going through
my entire lesson.

471
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,875
He didn't say a thing
till the end.

472
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,333
I wouldn't overthink it.

473
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,434
He probably just didn't want

474
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,518
to interrupt you
in your element.

475
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,834
By the way, how's Aidan?

476
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,417
He's good.

477
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,917
He's busy at the restaurant,
but he'll be here for the party.

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,667
Well, I can't wait
for you to meet Derek.

479
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,375
Derek?

480
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,667
Wait, the journalist?

481
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,458
Is he officially
your boyfriend now?

482
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,875
- Yeah, he is.
- Ooh!

483
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,959
He just doesn't know it yet.

484
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,208
Oh.

485
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,875
Hey. You still studying?

486
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,500
Of course.

487
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,875
Jenna, you've been studying that

488
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,417
for three years now.

489
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,291
Maybe just trust yourself, huh?

490
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,625
Easier said than done, Dad.

491
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,458
Why don't you help Marcelo

492
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,834
figure out the wine pairings
for the anniversary party?

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,667
Uh, the two of us?

494
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,375
I can do it on my own.

495
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,792
Well, it'll be
more fun together.

496
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,959
As long as you get rid
of the flashcards.

497
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,625
Excuse me?
What's wrong with flashcards?

498
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,625
Nothing...

499
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,709
Nothing.

500
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,000
I just think

501
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,417
you can't really learn
about wine from flashcards.

502
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,420
You've got to get
your hands dirty from the land.

503
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,083
Unfortunately, "the land"
isn't going to teach me

504
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,166
about the appellation
d'origine contrôlée.

505
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,250
The what?

506
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,834
I'm kidding.

507
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,917
I know what the French
certification system is.

508
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,959
I lived in Provence
for three years.

509
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,250
Great.

510
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,750
Listen, if you still
want my help,

511
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:47,893
I can be free this afternoon.

512
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:48,917
Thanks, Marcelo.

513
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,333
That was pretty good.

514
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,208
Bye, Dad.

515
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,166
"The what?"

516
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
Go.

517
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,208
"The what?"

518
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,625
What's all this?

519
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,509
I thought we were meeting
in the tasting room.

520
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,583
It's a nice evening.

521
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,017
I thought I'd set up
a tasting outside.

522
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,834
Thank you for doing this.

523
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,792
Oh, my pleasure.

524
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,125
So, um...

525
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,500
how did you end up at Savern?

526
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,500
I always wanted
to live in California,

527
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,125
and I saw the position online.

528
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,291
But we weren't
an organic vineyard.

529
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:28,166
Well, I convinced your father
to make the transition.

530
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,208
I believe that
a sustainable vineyard

531
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,750
is a vineyard with a future.

532
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,101
So what are you going to do
about the aphids on the vines?

533
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,875
Am I the one taking the exam?

534
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,250
You're making a lot of changes.

535
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,184
I want to make sure my parents
are in good hands.

536
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,083
I completely understand.

537
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,333
Here, let's practice.

538
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:48,875
Okay.

539
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,917
Lots of herbs, pop of citrus.

540
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,083
Grüner Veltliner from Austria.

541
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,166
That's correct.

542
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,333
And what would
this go well with?

543
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,041
Blue cheese and pear salad?

544
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,291
Sounds great.

545
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,750
- Great.
- Yeah.

546
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,333
So, um...

547
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,542
what town are you from

548
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,458
in Mendoza
with the ceibo flower?

549
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,625
I grew up on a vineyard

550
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,041
in a little town called Olivia.

551
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,837
You know my grandmother's
middle name was Olivia?

552
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,458
No, I had no idea. Wow.

553
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah, anyway, unfortunately,
we lost the vineyard.

554
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,750
I can't imagine

555
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,434
what it would be like
to lose this place.

556
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,041
Home isn't easily replaced.

557
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're lucky.

558
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,083
Next pour?

559
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,875
Yes.

560
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,458
Tempranillo.

561
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,542
Rioja, Spain.

562
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,959
Exactly.

563
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,500
Very good.

564
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,823
You know, I love Spanish wines.

565
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,375
You know,
there's this little bar

566
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,667
called Casa de Guardia
in Málaga.

567
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,375
Where Picasso used to drink.

568
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,458
He was born there.

569
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:10,125
How did you know
I was going to say that?

570
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,375
I studied it.

571
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,208
I think this would go well
with the grilled veggies.

572
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,041
So, um...

573
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,250
why do you move around so much?

574
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,166
Well, I...

575
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,250
I love to travel.

576
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,417
It is the perfect way

577
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,125
to learn about
a country's history

578
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,041
while perfecting
the craft of winemaking.

579
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,166
That sounds a little
like a canned response.

580
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,375
Does it?

581
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,559
Well, maybe
I just haven't figured out

582
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,959
where I want to settle down yet.

583
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,083
Okay, last one.

584
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,417
Wow.

585
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,667
This is incredible.

586
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,291
Um, black currant, plums...

587
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,709
Is that cardamom?

588
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:14,125
This would be too expensive
to serve at the party.

589
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,291
What...

590
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,375
What? Is this a Malb...

591
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,559
Why do I always mess up Malbec?

592
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,917
I am never going to pass.

593
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't panic, don't panic.

594
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,333
Um, just close your eyes.

595
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:26,417
Take a deep breath.

596
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,041
Grab a glass.

597
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:31,959
What do you sense,

598
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,125
the way
your grandmother, Olivia,

599
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,542
taught you?

600
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,667
Tree leaves in the breeze.

601
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,500
Raspberries and plums
on a warm day.

602
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,102
This is from Savern Vineyards,
isn't it?

603
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,125
Meet our Special Reserve
Organic Malbec.

604
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,457
A hundred percent natural.

605
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,583
Wow.

606
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,250
Well done.

607
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:18,917
Aidan, this wine needs to be
on the menu at Alluvial.

608
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,333
It's like a Châteauneuf-du-Pape,
only fruitier.

609
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:25,458
Uh, yeah, Jenna,
I think you might be biased.

610
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:26,583
What do you mean?

611
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,893
Well, it's
your grandma's winery.

612
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,041
Besides, you know,

613
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,184
I couldn't possibly put
anything on the menu

614
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,083
that hasn't won an award.

615
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,083
I know. I just...

616
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,250
I'm...

617
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,083
I'm excited.
It's so good.

618
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,184
Uh, look, Jenna.
I've got to be on the floor.

619
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,041
Can I call you later?

620
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,417
Uh, yeah.

621
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,750
Yeah, sure.

622
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,917
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

623
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,166
Hi.

624
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,291
Hey, I'll make this quick.

625
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,166
Town fair, 20 minutes,
you and me, fun.

626
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,917
Alli, I can't.
I'm studying.

627
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,101
Have you gotten your parents

628
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,267
a gift
for their anniversary yet?

629
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,125
Uh, no. I haven't.

630
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,750
Um, good point.

631
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,417
Okay. I guess
I can meet you at the fair

632
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,250
and look for something there.

633
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,792
But just for an hour.
No more. Okay?

634
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,875
One hour.

635
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,291
Sounds good to me.

636
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,625
See you there. Bye.

637
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,667
It is a beautiful day.

638
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,875
It is. Oh, look.

639
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,250
The dunk tank awaits.

640
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,834
Um, that's a no.

641
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,291
How about apple bobbing?

642
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,625
How about none of the above?

643
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,559
You're just afraid
I'm going to beat your record.

644
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,768
What was that, like, 40 apples?

645
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,709
42, actually.

646
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:43,872
And you will never beat me.

647
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,759
Ah, my parents have been married
for 40 years.

648
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,851
What could I possibly get them
that they don't already have?

649
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,226
Well, I'm sure
we'll find something.

650
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,530
There's so much good stuff here.

651
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,083
Wait. Have I told you
about her?

652
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,792
Yeah, I think once or twice
or a hundred times.

653
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,000
She's the master somm

654
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,208
who brought fine wine

655
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,971
into the world
of entertainment and sports.

656
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,401
She really made a name
for herself.

657
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,434
If she can do it, you can, too.

658
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,542
Come on.

659
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,709
- Good find.
- Thanks.

660
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:12,792
Hey, look who it is.

661
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,792
- Hey!
- Hey.

662
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:16,750
Are you gift shopping as well?

663
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,166
Just for myself.

664
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,542
That's nice.

665
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,959
Yeah, I'm looking for something

666
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,518
to send home to my sister
and nieces in Buenos Aires.

667
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,709
Aw, that's so sweet.

668
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm looking for
my parents' anniversary.

669
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,542
I think I saw something earlier
that your parents might like.

670
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,875
Oh, great.

671
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,166
- Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

672
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,310
- This would make a great sign.
- That would make a perfect sign.

673
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,625
Jinx!

674
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,208
This is delicious.

675
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,709
Jenna Savern,
is that really you?

676
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,500
Hey, hi.

677
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,750
How are you?

678
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,554
Oh, I'm just the chairwoman
of this shindig,

679
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,875
just that little thing.

680
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,799
That's amazing.
They're very lucky to have you.

681
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,417
How long has it been?

682
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,792
I heard you're a master somm
in San Francisco

683
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,792
and you have a boyfriend.

684
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,250
Do I hear wedding bells?

685
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,333
What's his name?

686
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,291
Uh, well, his name is Aidan,

687
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,041
and he owns a restaurant.

688
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,125
Your mom told me
all about your accomplishments.

689
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,083
She is so proud of you.

690
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,417
And I can't believe

691
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,583
that Carington has its very own
master sommelier.

692
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,917
Actually, I take the exam
at the end of the month,

693
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,208
so not yet.

694
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,166
Oh, Jenna was a star
in fourth grade,

695
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,370
and she just keeps climbing.

696
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,834
So I guess you know
our winemaker, Marcelo.

697
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,667
We're old friends.

698
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,917
He keeps my horses in shape.

699
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,250
Yeah, I ride a bit.

700
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,333
Reminds me of home.

701
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,125
Philippe misses you.

702
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,083
I miss Philippe.

703
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,166
The horse.

704
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,250
I figured.

705
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,583
And before you ask,
I don't ride.

706
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,041
Jenna, you're still not over

707
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,166
that little accident
you had so many years ago?

708
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,166
Uh, no, no.

709
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,625
Still have the scar, see?

710
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,709
Look.

711
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,417
I don't see anything.

712
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,375
Me neither.

713
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,542
Okay, okay, well,

714
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,685
maybe the scars
are on my psyche,

715
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:50,709
but they are there.

716
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,083
Well, anyway, I am trying
to get Marcelo

717
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,834
to enter the Savern wines
in the festival,

718
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,208
but he keeps telling me no.

719
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,542
Really?

720
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,291
Yeah, I'm not interested
in titles and contests.

721
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,351
Well, you still have
a few days to sign up.

722
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,000
Oh, could you help me?

723
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,417
This afternoon
is the apple-bobbing contest,

724
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,917
and, believe it or not,
we're short on apples.

725
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,875
I could use a few extra hands
over at the Davrow Orchard.

726
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,125
I'd love to,

727
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,685
but I've got to go meet
my boyfriend, Derek.

728
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:19,267
And I really have to
get back home to study.

729
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,583
Come on, Jenna.

730
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,000
We have to help Peggy.

731
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,309
- You have to help Peggy.
- I don't have...

732
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,458
Yes. You can study tomorrow.

733
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,166
Thank you, thank you.

734
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,291
How often do you get home
to Argentina?

735
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,041
Not as often as I'd like.

736
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,375
A couple of years
in between jobs,

737
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,458
when I'm not working.

738
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,083
What's it like there?

739
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,375
It's beautiful.

740
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,500
Yeah.

741
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,851
You know,
it's kind of sad for me

742
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,333
because I really miss
the people.

743
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,542
And we used to have
these huge dinners at home

744
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,625
with my whole family.

745
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,041
Everyone's cooking and laughing

746
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,709
and drinking the wine
that we prepared ourselves.

747
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,041
It was the happiest time
of my life, really.

748
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,250
So what happened?

749
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,542
Well, I learned
everything I know about wine

750
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,333
from my father,

751
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:13,208
working the vines with him.

752
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,709
And, you know,

753
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,917
he just built our vineyard
from the ground up.

754
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,041
I mean, from the bees,

755
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,875
to the earth,

756
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,458
to the flowers he cultivated.

757
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,709
And our wine caught the eye
of this big distributor,

758
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,583
who, well, forced us to sell.

759
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,166
And my father passed
shortly after,

760
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,834
and the wine
never tasted the same.

761
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,542
I'm so sorry.

762
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,667
Ah...

763
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,083
I think we have enough.

764
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,166
I think we do.

765
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,410
- Should we head back?
- Yeah.

766
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,542
- Success.
- Success.

767
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,291
Perfect.
Thank you so much!

768
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,709
No problem.

769
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,500
One of our participants
just backed out.

770
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:04,583
Jenna, can you bob?

771
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,208
You were so good
when you were a kid.

772
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,458
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

773
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:11,834
Thank you.

774
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,000
Right this way.

775
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,000
Oops.

776
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,123
You're gonna be a natural.

777
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:15,959
I'm excited for this.
I can't wait.

778
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,041
I'm not excited.

779
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,667
Go, Marcelo, go!

780
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,750
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

781
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,834
What?

782
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,375
Just get in there.

783
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,083
- Whoo!
- You got it, you got it!

784
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,083
Front and center.

785
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,166
Oh, yeah, what the heck?

786
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,834
Yes, Lily is cleaning up.

787
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,125
Go, Lily!

788
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,208
Give it up for our champion.

789
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,250
Once again, Lily Prescott!

790
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,041
Congratulations, Lily.

791
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,083
You were the best.

792
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,959
I know.

793
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,166
And for you, sir...

794
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,075
She cheated, and I let her win.

795
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:06,875
That's for you.

796
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,583
Oh, wow, for me?

797
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,166
Thank you so much.

798
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,917
I will treasure this forever.

799
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,375
No shame in second place.

800
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,458
Listen, Peggy, can I have

801
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,559
some of those apples
to take home?

802
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,208
Of course.
You've earned it.

803
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,476
Oh, and I should have told you.

804
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,583
That girl wins every year.

805
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,125
Okay, I'll see you
both later, okay?

806
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,041
Thank you, Marcelo.

807
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,333
And have fun at the fair.

808
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,417
Peggy?

809
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,125
Peggy. Peggy.

810
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,250
What is the deadline
to enter the wine competition?

811
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,333
Hello.

812
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,834
Hey.

813
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,667
I could smell that
from down the road.

814
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,625
Oh, well,
Allison gave me her recipe,

815
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:02,125
and I wanted to put
Peggy's apples to the test.

816
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,041
My kitchen was a disaster area,

817
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,125
and your mom let me use her oven

818
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,041
as long as I save them a piece.

819
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,208
Have you had dinner?

820
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,208
No, but I have to have
some of that pie.

821
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,417
Right now.

822
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,792
Yes, you do.

823
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,834
Ooh, it smells so good.

824
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,458
Mm!

825
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:29,959
You know what this needs?

826
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,542
A scoop of vanilla ice cream

827
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,291
with, like,
sherry poured over top.

828
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,000
Now you're talking
like a master somm.

829
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,125
This... all this has been
really helpful.

830
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,208
Well, that's because for me,

831
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,792
wine is more about experiences
than...

832
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:48,875
than facts.

833
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,000
The master somm at Alluvial
said something similar once.

834
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,875
What is it about that place?

835
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,667
That is so special for you?

836
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,542
Aidan, my boyfriend,

837
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,375
poured his whole self
into that place.

838
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,643
Just like
what my parents have here.

839
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,125
It's...

840
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,625
it's his love, and...

841
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:10,834
I don't know.

842
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,125
I want to be a part of it.

843
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,834
If I could work there with him,

844
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,000
together,

845
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,125
I mean, that would be...

846
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,208
the dream.

847
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,417
I... I still...

848
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,959
I'm not sure
if I have what it takes.

849
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,792
What?

850
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,583
Jenna, you do.

851
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,375
You are so talented.

852
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,291
You can do anything you want.

853
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,125
You just have to trust
your instinct.

854
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,375
You're ready.

855
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,208
What are you making?

856
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,291
This is the centerpiece

857
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,166
for my parents'
anniversary party.

858
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,792
It looks nice.

859
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,417
Okay, like I was saying,

860
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,250
you know I would never ask you

861
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,625
to carry
one of my parents' wines

862
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,500
if I didn't think
it was perfect for Alluvial.

863
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:02,959
Well, it's...

864
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,291
hey.

865
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,559
Let's see how it does
in the wine competition.

866
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,000
Well, maybe when you're here
for the party,

867
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,883
you could take a bottle back
for Edwin to try.

868
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,750
You know,
I'd feel more comfortable

869
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:13,917
if it had some credentials.

870
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,458
Or if I had more credentials?

871
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,667
No, Jenna.

872
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,166
I know you're an advanced somm.

873
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,166
That's not what I'm saying.

874
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,875
What are you saying?

875
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,709
Just see how it does
in the competition.

876
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,875
I miss you.

877
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,208
Okay?

878
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,685
I know things have been
difficult for us lately,

879
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,709
but you've just been
busy studying.

880
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,291
To be honest,

881
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,656
I can't wait for it to be over
so we can just be us again.

882
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:37,917
Right.

883
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,417
Marcelo.

884
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,226
Marcelo, I want to talk to you
about something.

885
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,709
Jenna, you were asking me
about my plan for aphids.

886
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,250
Yeah.

887
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,875
- Wait. Ladybugs?
- Yeah.

888
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,417
They're good luck,
but also, they eat pests.

889
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,583
Help me introduce my friends
to their new home.

890
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,083
Yeah, um, I want to enter us

891
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,667
in the Carington
Wine Competition.

892
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,291
Yeah, but I think
it's too late to sign up.

893
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,834
I entered us.

894
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,458
I'm sorry.
I had to.

895
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:17,625
Ah.

896
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,333
If you believe in your methods,

897
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,559
you should stand behind them.

898
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,917
I think the wine
speaks for itself.

899
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,125
Thanks.

900
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,542
You're scared.

901
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,208
No.

902
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,083
Look, I'm...

903
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,709
I'm scared, too,

904
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,375
that I'm going
to fail the test again.

905
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,000
But that is no reason
not to try.

906
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,351
Are you going
to help me with that?

907
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,959
Yeah.

908
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,834
Once the owners start thinking
about competitions,

909
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,208
all they care about
is pleasing the critics.

910
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,083
And then the wine just loses

911
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,083
all integrity and purpose
for me.

912
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,458
I believe in what
you are creating right now.

913
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,875
I don't need attention.

914
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,083
Marcelo, please.

915
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,333
Do this for me.

916
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,542
For my family.

917
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,709
This is the only way

918
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,583
we can get your wine
distributed.

919
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,250
It deserves
to be in restaurants...

920
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,959
Why is that so important?

921
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,417
Can't it just be

922
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,125
an amazing wine that we make
for our friends and family

923
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,125
and people who actually love it,

924
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,291
from our hearts?

925
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,959
Well, why not share
what's in your heart

926
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,333
with the world?

927
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,875
You have a gift, Marcelo.

928
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,417
Marcelo?

929
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,458
Yes?

930
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,834
I...

931
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,750
I want to apologize.

932
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,500
For yesterday.
I overstepped,

933
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,709
entering the competition
against your wishes.

934
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:57,750
I thought I was doing
what was best for my family,

935
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:58,834
but...

936
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,875
I'm sorry.

937
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,458
How can I make it up to you?

938
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,243
Meet me out front in an hour.

939
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,625
And bring your boots.

940
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:20,792
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

941
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,375
Wait. Is this
what I think it is?

942
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,500
Okay.

943
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,458
Here we are.

944
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,000
Hello.

945
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,583
Hey, Peggy.

946
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,917
- Peggy.
- Come.

947
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,667
What are we doing here?

948
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,000
You'll see.

949
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,166
Honestly, no,
I don't like horses, remember?

950
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,333
I'm proud of you, Jenna.

951
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,542
Hey.

952
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,726
I've been telling you all along

953
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,500
that you need
to get back on that horse

954
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,583
and have fun again.

955
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,500
Uh, what's happening here?

956
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:49,983
Didn't you want
to make it up to me?

957
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,709
A horse r... No. No.

958
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,333
I think I've changed my mind.

959
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,583
Marcelo, you can go.

960
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,101
I'm going to stay here.
I'm going to watch.

961
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,805
- I'm watching.
- No. Your stallion awaits.

962
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,083
Uh, is it really a stallion?

963
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,750
He's not a stallion.

964
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,083
He's a gelding.

965
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,166
It's a horse.

966
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,417
And he's your friend.
Come on.

967
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,583
He's not my friend.

968
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,667
Come on.
Here we go.

969
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,792
Okay, so this is Philippe.

970
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,250
Hi, Philippe.

971
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,917
Okay, uh, no.
I can't. I can't.

972
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,917
- Oh, yes, you can.
- I'm not doing this.

973
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,792
Yes, I'm going to help you up.

974
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,667
This way.

975
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,250
So you put your hand here.

976
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,667
Okay.

977
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,834
Um...

978
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,197
Yes, and your foot.
That's right.

979
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,750
- You got it.
- You got it.

980
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,959
You got it.

981
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:31,834
You're a pro.

982
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:32,917
Okay.

983
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,542
Okay.

984
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,458
All right, Philippe.
Be my friend.

985
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,542
Thank you.
You ready?

986
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,792
Okay. Oh!

987
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,062
- Have a good ride.
- Thank you, Peggy.

988
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,375
- Peggy.
- You got this.

989
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,750
Okay, okay.
Not so fast, not so fast.

990
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,041
Come on, we're barely trotting.

991
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,709
Okay, just tighten your reins.

992
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,893
- Wait, wait, wait.
- There you go.

993
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,059
It's so bumpy.
Okay, wait, wait.

994
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,184
Where did you learn
to ride like this?

995
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,291
Please, talk to me.

996
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:04,500
Okay, when I was a kid
in Argentina, I love horses.

997
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,875
Always have.

998
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,417
My uncle had a ranch
in La Pampa,

999
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,125
and sometimes, we'd find
the occasional caballo criollo.

1000
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,166
What... what is that?

1001
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,250
Criollo is the wild horse
of Argentina.

1002
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,875
They're like Ferraris of horses.

1003
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,417
And, yeah,

1004
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,667
we'd round them up

1005
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,550
and bring them to the ranch
and break them in.

1006
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,834
Wait.

1007
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,375
You used to break in
wild horses?

1008
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,917
That's right.

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,083
Of course you did.

1010
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,667
Wow, look.
It's so beautiful.

1011
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,750
What vineyard is this?

1012
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:39,709
Noni Vineyards.

1013
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,875
You grew up here

1014
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,875
and you don't know
these little places?

1015
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,583
Well, I was off...

1016
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,750
Well, first to UC Davis,

1017
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,291
and then to Paris for a year.

1018
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,142
I've been in the restaurant
industry ever since.

1019
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,667
Okay.

1020
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,142
And then I even took a job
at a wine shop to study more.

1021
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,583
So I've been busy, okay?

1022
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,291
- I've been busy.
- All right.

1023
00:40:58,792 --> 00:40:59,834
Oh, wow.

1024
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,125
Do you see this grape?

1025
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,542
This is called "carménère".

1026
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,458
This is exactly the grape
that we had in our vineyard.

1027
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:08,875
Of course.

1028
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,351
Yeah. We're further east,
so it's fresher and cooler.

1029
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,250
Wow. The same one.

1030
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,709
You really should own
your own vineyard.

1031
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,625
I would love to someday.

1032
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:22,417
Well, what about this one?
It'd be perfect for you.

1033
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,625
Even the bees are here.

1034
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,083
So can we be done?
Are we done now?

1035
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,458
- Get me off?
- Let's keep going.

1036
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,750
- Wait. Really?
- Come on.

1037
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:35,834
Okay, Philippe.

1038
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,208
Come on.
You're doing great.

1039
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,667
- Oh!
- Yes, that's it.

1040
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:46,917
So what do you think?

1041
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,041
Am I forgiven?

1042
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,291
Argh...

1043
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,417
yes.

1044
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,750
Yeah.

1045
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,250
I'm very proud of you.

1046
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,101
You were very brave
trying horseback riding again.

1047
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,750
Thanks.

1048
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:00,017
And you should get some sleep.

1049
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,417
We are starting early tomorrow.

1050
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Early?

1051
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,667
Mm.

1052
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,166
The festival picnic, remember?

1053
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,750
Yes, we told Allison
we'd help her set up.

1054
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:10,959
Yes, right.

1055
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,583
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

1056
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:13,834
- Okay.
- Okay?

1057
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,166
Great. Good night.

1058
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,458
Good night.

1059
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,417
So my last day will be Friday.

1060
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,125
Do you really
have to leave immediately?

1061
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,458
The opportunity to work in Paris

1062
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:42,742
doesn't come around every day.

1063
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:45,709
Listen,

1064
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,851
I'd like to make
a recommendation

1065
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,917
for my replacement.

1066
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,583
Please. Of course.

1067
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,227
You know how much
I trust your judgment.

1068
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:52,959
Jenna.

1069
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,917
Jenna?

1070
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,875
She has a real sense for wine.

1071
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,959
She picks up on notes
even I miss.

1072
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,521
Talent like that
shouldn't be ignored.

1073
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:02,914
I'll certainly consider it.

1074
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,900
- It's been a pleasure.
- Take care.

1075
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,458
Wait. Edwin quit?

1076
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,291
Oh, gosh.
I'm so sorry.

1077
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,000
Are you looking
for a replacement?

1078
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,375
Uh-huh.

1079
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:29,875
Wait, Aidan?

1080
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Aid... Hello?

1081
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,166
Hel...

1082
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,375
Um, okay.

1083
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:36,625
I guess we got cut off.

1084
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,469
Yeah, it's a bad patch
for cell service here.

1085
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,917
Everything okay?

1086
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,792
Um, yeah.

1087
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,291
The head sommelier at Alluvial
just quit,

1088
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,959
and now Aidan's stressing

1089
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,184
about whether
he can take time off

1090
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,208
to come to the party.

1091
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,834
That's not for another week.

1092
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:54,637
I'm sure he can have it
figured out by then.

1093
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,983
That's the job you wanted,
isn't it?

1094
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:01,917
Mm-hmm.

1095
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,709
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

1096
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,142
How long have you guys
been together?

1097
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,959
Three years.

1098
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,667
That's serious.

1099
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,583
It's everything I want
in a relationship.

1100
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:14,959
He's smart.

1101
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,625
He's driven.

1102
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:18,083
He knows everything about wine.

1103
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,571
Then it should be
an easy search.

1104
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,542
He's got the answer
right in front of him.

1105
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,166
Is there...

1106
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,370
anyone special in your life?

1107
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,291
A long time ago.

1108
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:36,917
In Germany.

1109
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,166
Yeah.

1110
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,834
She wanted me to stay,
and I wasn't ready.

1111
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,458
Sometimes, I wonder
if that was a mistake.

1112
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:49,083
But I don't know.

1113
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:52,000
It didn't feel like...

1114
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,083
home.

1115
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:13,834
Oh, no.

1116
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,517
- What's going on?
- Well, where's Lucia?

1117
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,875
She's sick,

1118
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:17,959
today of all days.

1119
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,667
I've been such a mess
all morning.

1120
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,510
I've been trying
to finish baking and packing

1121
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:22,542
all by myself.

1122
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,333
And the last batch just burned.

1123
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,792
Okay, we're here to help.

1124
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:27,834
Look at this!

1125
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:29,500
I'm beyond help!

1126
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:31,834
Okay, Marcelo and I
will head to the fair

1127
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:33,059
- and set up your table.
- Yeah.

1128
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,792
You can stay here
and keep baking.

1129
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,333
Thank you.

1130
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,333
Thank you so much.

1131
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,583
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1132
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:39,667
The cupcakes!

1133
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,458
Good afternoon, ladies.

1134
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,917
This is
our late-harvest Zinfandel.

1135
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,959
It's made right here
in Carington.

1136
00:45:57,041 --> 00:46:01,333
It has nice notes
of hazelnut flavor

1137
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,667
with a hint of cherry
and cinnamon.

1138
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,583
It pairs perfectly

1139
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,166
with Allison's
chocolate cupcakes.

1140
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,792
Oh, I love it.

1141
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:13,893
You can really
taste the cinnamon.

1142
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,166
Did you know
it's a natural wine?

1143
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,917
Really?
It's perfect.

1144
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,208
Good. Enjoy.

1145
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:25,834
Okay, okay.

1146
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,792
Great.

1147
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:28,875
Okay...

1148
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,083
Hey, you're really good
with the kids.

1149
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,625
I'm not.

1150
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:38,989
I just pretend
to be their coach.

1151
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:41,542
Carriage rides!

1152
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,709
Last call for carriage rides!

1153
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,083
We should go.

1154
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,834
We? Me? No.

1155
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:47,917
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm good.

1156
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,792
No. No, no, no.

1157
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,375
No...

1158
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,500
No.

1159
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,709
That was a long day.

1160
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,542
Yeah.

1161
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,083
And you were great
in the wine service.

1162
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,083
Great. I mean, your passion
really comes through

1163
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,333
when you talk to people.

1164
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,083
Thanks.

1165
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,709
You know what?

1166
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:11,977
The land I showed you
on the horse ride?

1167
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,125
- Yeah?
- It's for sale.

1168
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,250
Wait. It is?

1169
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,583
Yeah.

1170
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,959
Well, are you going to buy it?

1171
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh!

1172
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,323
I don't think I could afford it.

1173
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,375
I mean, not yet.

1174
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,166
I send money home every month

1175
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,959
to my mom and my sister
in Argentina,

1176
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:28,333
so it would be difficult.

1177
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:30,667
What about investors?

1178
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:33,458
Or maybe a partner?

1179
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,250
I mean...

1180
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,000
I guess...

1181
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,250
it wouldn't be a bad idea,

1182
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,291
but it has to be
the right partner.

1183
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,542
Yeah.

1184
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:47,375
Well, I think
you should go for it.

1185
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,542
If it's your dream.

1186
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:53,000
That's the thing about America.

1187
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,309
Everyone says
go after your dreams,

1188
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,542
but very few people actually do.

1189
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,208
Except you.

1190
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:03,034
Well, we'll see how that goes.

1191
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,291
Oh, are you cold?

1192
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,375
No, it's fine.

1193
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,709
It's just a breeze off the...

1194
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:11,912
- Here, there you go.
- Lake.

1195
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:19,458
That's nice.
Thank you.

1196
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,125
Ask me about the viscosity
of alcohol dynamics.

1197
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,893
Actually, can we pick this up
tomorrow, please?

1198
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,959
Yeah, okay.

1199
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,601
Um, hey, how's it going
with replacing Edwin?

1200
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,000
Tough.

1201
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,476
You know, I'm interviewing
new people every day.

1202
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,875
Actually, Jeremy Kemp's
coming in

1203
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,083
for a second interview.

1204
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,166
Is he any good?

1205
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:51,792
Uh, he's very dry...

1206
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,291
Personality-wise...

1207
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,667
But he knows his wine.

1208
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,750
Of course.

1209
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:56,875
He's a master somm.

1210
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:58,250
Jenna.

1211
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,000
How soon do you need someone?

1212
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,917
As soon as possible.

1213
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,625
It's not easy
running the restaurant

1214
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,166
and being the somm
at the same time.

1215
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,875
I was thinking
after I took the exam,

1216
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:08,999
maybe you would consider...

1217
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,309
Jenna, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1218
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,417
Yeah.

1219
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:14,959
Hey. Hi, Aidan.

1220
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:15,917
Sorry to interrupt.

1221
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,291
Uh, hi, Mike.

1222
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,542
No, no, it's fine.

1223
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,333
I'll talk to you later?

1224
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,542
Yeah. Of course.

1225
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,625
Bye, hon'.

1226
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,834
Listen, I need your help
to get Mom out of the house

1227
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:29,000
so I can bring in
some tables and chairs

1228
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,291
in behind the cellar.

1229
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,291
There's a candle-making thing
over at the fair.

1230
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,250
Could you take her to that?

1231
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,083
Sure, Dad.
Of course.

1232
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,250
You're great.

1233
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,523
I think maybe
I should stick to wine.

1234
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,792
Well, being master sommelier
is talent enough.

1235
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,125
But I'm not, though.

1236
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,709
I'm not.

1237
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,309
Mom, you know I've already
failed this test before.

1238
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,709
Twice.

1239
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:04,500
And you acting like
it's already over and done with

1240
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:05,959
just makes me even more nervous.

1241
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,961
Especially when you keep
telling people about it.

1242
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,226
I suppose
I've gotten ahead of myself,

1243
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,625
bragging about my daughter, yes.

1244
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,917
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...

1245
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,000
I don't want to let you down.

1246
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,792
Honey...

1247
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:23,834
you could never,
ever let me down.

1248
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:27,039
I'll stop talking about it.

1249
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,250
Thanks, Mom.

1250
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,083
Yeah.

1251
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:35,750
You know, your father's
and my anniversary

1252
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:36,834
is coming up.

1253
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,000
Ah, yes, that is...

1254
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,375
just around the corner,
isn't it?

1255
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,625
Mm-hmm.

1256
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,542
Well, I'm starting to worry

1257
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,291
your father's forgotten
all about it.

1258
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,291
Dad!

1259
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,375
Mom thinks you forgot
about your anniversary.

1260
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,417
I was going to take her
out to dinner on Friday night.

1261
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,476
Okay, so what's your plan
for her on Saturday

1262
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,500
while we're setting up?

1263
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,458
Just send her
to the fair, I guess?

1264
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:04,750
Again?

1265
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:06,291
You should take her
to the Sea Ranch

1266
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,875
overnight on Friday.

1267
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:09,625
Don't you need
my help for the setup?

1268
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:10,917
What we need

1269
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,226
is for Mom
to get out of the house

1270
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,417
and not suspect anything.

1271
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,792
Marcelo and I
can handle it here.

1272
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,625
All right.
It's a good idea.

1273
00:51:16,709 --> 00:51:17,834
Great.

1274
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:21,250
Also, are you familiar
with Noni Vineyard?

1275
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,417
Oh, sure.

1276
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,041
That's my friend
Gil Crowley's place.

1277
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,291
I went to UC Davis with him.

1278
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,434
He named it after his daughter.

1279
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:28,667
Huh.

1280
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,935
It's been on the market
for a while.

1281
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:31,625
Are you interested
in buying a vineyard?

1282
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,750
Oh, no, it's not for me.

1283
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:35,834
- It's...
- Jenna!

1284
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,000
Jenna!

1285
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,083
Be right back, Dad.

1286
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

1287
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:44,750
We were just talking about you.

1288
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,125
Wait.

1289
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,601
Before you say anything,
I have a surprise for you.

1290
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,959
Can you come?

1291
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,166
- Now?
- Yeah, okay.

1292
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,709
Yeah?

1293
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,625
Hey, my dad knows the guy

1294
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:54,935
who owns that vineyard
that we saw.

1295
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:55,959
- Really?
- Yeah.

1296
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,000
Have you ever had
Argentinean food?

1297
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,709
Um...

1298
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,834
No! Not homemade.

1299
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:03,917
Oh, señorita.

1300
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,375
Okay, it'll be ready
in a moment.

1301
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,667
Okay.

1302
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,792
Yeah.

1303
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,166
Oh, it smells amazing.

1304
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,667
I have not been in
the winemaker's cabin since...

1305
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,083
since my grandma passed away.

1306
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,041
Well, your dad offered
to find me a place in town,

1307
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,875
but I usually rather live
in the land I'm working.

1308
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,101
I see you've made a few updates.

1309
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,125
Yeah.

1310
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,208
Only the essentials.

1311
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,125
You kept
my grandmother's paintings out.

1312
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,125
I like them.

1313
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,041
Oh, she was so gifted.

1314
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,875
- Aah!
- Oh, wait.

1315
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:34,417
- Can I help you?
- Sorry, sorry.

1316
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,643
Please, let me help you.
I can...

1317
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:36,667
I'm okay, thanks.

1318
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,583
Sit, please.

1319
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,792
- I...
- Okay.

1320
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:42,125
Okay, these are empanadas.

1321
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:43,375
Oh, they look perfect.

1322
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,458
Yeah.

1323
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,208
And wait for it.

1324
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,041
We've got churrasco.

1325
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,291
Okay. Oh...

1326
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,709
Churrasco...

1327
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:56,417
which is...

1328
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,250
gaucho-style steak.

1329
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,959
And you must...

1330
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,166
have a little bit of this.

1331
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,291
What is it?

1332
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,625
Chimichurri.

1333
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:07,125
But classic style. Verde.

1334
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,333
Oh!

1335
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:13,976
That is incredible.
I must have the recipe.

1336
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,291
Well, the recipe

1337
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:17,583
is actually watching my father
on the outdoor grill

1338
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:18,792
when I was a kid.

1339
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:21,250
But really, it's parsley.

1340
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,125
Fresh parsley.

1341
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:23,208
Parsley?

1342
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,559
Okay, parsley's
the secret weapon.

1343
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:25,458
Yes. Finely chopped.

1344
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:26,917
Uh-huh.

1345
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,709
And for tonight's pairing,
guess the wine?

1346
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:29,792
Yes, yes.

1347
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:30,709
Of course.
I'd love to.

1348
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,083
Yes, and I promise

1349
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,667
it goes really well
with the meal.

1350
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:39,834
All right.

1351
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,917
Thanks.

1352
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,291
Hmm.

1353
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,000
High tannins.
Cool, crisp.

1354
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,750
This is a Malbec from the Andes.

1355
00:53:57,917 --> 00:53:59,208
It's very earthy.

1356
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:00,750
Wait, I think
that's the parsley.

1357
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:05,375
Maipú region.

1358
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,041
Bodega Zucconda.

1359
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,125
2002?

1360
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,333
So close.

1361
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,458
Oh.

1362
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,625
This is actually
from my family's vineyard.

1363
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,458
Río Córdoba, 2002.

1364
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,000
That was a very special year.

1365
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,542
Only a few bottles of it remain.

1366
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,875
But that year,

1367
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:27,083
the cool air and the wind

1368
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,917
just helped the grapes produce
this incredible wine...

1369
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,208
Our best ever, really.

1370
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:34,547
And this bottle travels with me
everywhere I go.

1371
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,500
So, wait,
you opened this bottle...

1372
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
just for me?

1373
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,625
I can't think of anyone else
I'd rather share it with.

1374
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,917
Well, because...

1375
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,834
you appreciate it.

1376
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,709
I do.

1377
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1378
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
- Eat.
- Okay.

1379
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, I'm so full.

1380
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,709
That was the best meal
I've had my whole life.

1381
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:07,375
What?

1382
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,875
What about three Michelin stars?

1383
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:10,083
That's not everything.

1384
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,110
Well, I want
to show you something.

1385
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,083
I was cleaning the cupboard,

1386
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,417
and I found this.

1387
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,500
Tell me, is this you
as a little girl?

1388
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,959
Yes. Yes, it is.

1389
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:28,834
My grandma
must have painted this.

1390
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:30,166
I've never seen this before.

1391
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,458
Well, you know what?

1392
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:34,182
It would make
a great anniversary present.

1393
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,959
Are you sure?
That's so thoughtful of you.

1394
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:37,959
Thanks.

1395
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,458
You got it.

1396
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,375
There.

1397
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,333
Yeah?

1398
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,834
- What?
- Hey, be careful.

1399
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,083
Don't float away.

1400
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,542
Ah, Aidan.

1401
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,250
Hey!

1402
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,250
So when do you get here?

1403
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:02,875
Jenna, I'm so sorry.

1404
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:03,792
I have to tell you something.

1405
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,500
What's wrong?

1406
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,583
Are you all right?

1407
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,041
I was really hoping

1408
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,875
I'd be able to find
the right person for today.

1409
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:13,250
But I've been scrambling
all week,

1410
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,208
so I've decided...

1411
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,834
I can't come to the party.

1412
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,750
I'm so sorry.

1413
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,458
I mean, I've made offers,

1414
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,417
but so far, no one's accepted.

1415
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,300
I really thought
I could make it down in time,

1416
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,417
but I just can't leave
the restaurant right now.

1417
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,875
So you're not coming?

1418
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:32,625
Sorry.

1419
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,625
It's fine.
I'll see you when I get back.

1420
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:36,959
Okay. Bye.

1421
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,166
You okay?

1422
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:42,709
Do you want to talk?

1423
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,672
The sommelier position
has been open for a week,

1424
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:48,429
and Aidan didn't even think
to interview me.

1425
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:51,333
It's like
I'm not even in the running.

1426
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,333
I'm sorry, Jenna.

1427
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,910
Who knows when an opening
like this could happen again?

1428
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:02,959
Maybe you can work
at another restaurant?

1429
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,709
Is there something
he doesn't see in me?

1430
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,083
Hi.

1431
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,166
Hello.

1432
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

1433
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:32,500
Blanc de blanc?

1434
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:33,959
Absolutely.

1435
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,333
[{Allison] Jenna!

1436
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:39,750
- Hi!
- Hey, welcome.

1437
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,226
I've got the cake in the car.
Where should I put it?

1438
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,417
Perfect.

1439
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,417
The cake will go right here.

1440
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,333
I've got the you-know-what.

1441
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,875
Ah, perfect.

1442
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:47,959
Oh.

1443
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,081
They're five minutes away.

1444
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,125
Okay, everyone.
They're five minutes away.

1445
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,875
Get ready to hide.

1446
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:55,959
Okay, let's do this.

1447
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,792
Shh.

1448
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,291
Come on this way.

1449
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,792
Surprise!

1450
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,333
Happy 40th.

1451
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:21,667
You pulled it off, Dad.

1452
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,792
You, Mike, and you!

1453
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:27,959
Thank Marcelo.
He helped so much, Mom.

1454
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,125
Happy anniversary!

1455
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,750
Cheers to Mom and Dad!

1456
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:33,834
Yay!

1457
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,792
I would just like to say

1458
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,542
thank you to all of you

1459
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:46,125
for sharing
this magical night with us.

1460
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:47,542
It's good to know

1461
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,542
that after 40 years of marriage,

1462
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,945
we're still
surprising each other.

1463
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,959
I would also like to say

1464
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:59,750
a special thank you
to our daughter, Jenna,

1465
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:01,291
of whom I am so proud.

1466
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,395
It just means
the world to me, sweetie.

1467
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,458
Speech.

1468
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:11,834
- Me?
- Speech!

1469
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:14,709
Okay.

1470
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:18,208
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

1471
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:20,500
Mom and Dad,

1472
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:25,333
you have been an inspiration
to me throughout my life.

1473
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:27,959
You've shared
your passion for wine with me.

1474
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,166
You've always encouraged me
to follow my own path.

1475
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,166
Most importantly,

1476
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,375
you've shown me

1477
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:39,000
how a foundation of love
makes everything possible.

1478
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:44,834
You've taught me
what real love looks like,

1479
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,834
and...

1480
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,291
I'm forever grateful
to both of you for that.

1481
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,417
Thank you.

1482
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,166
And I know
that you've been making

1483
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,083
a lot of changes around here,

1484
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:03,792
but there was one thing
I noticed

1485
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,000
still needed
a little sprucing up.

1486
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:09,625
So...

1487
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:10,792
ta-dah!

1488
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,166
It's a new sign
for the front gate,

1489
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,125
with the date

1490
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,333
that Grandma and Grandpa

1491
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,417
first opened the doors
at Savern Vineyards.

1492
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,750
Oh, it's beautiful, Jenna.

1493
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:20,959
Mom and Dad,

1494
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:24,041
I know Grandma Ellie
would be so proud

1495
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,309
of everything you've done here.

1496
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,959
Well, we just love
what we get to do,

1497
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,625
and doing it together.

1498
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,542
Oh, and we have
one more surprise.

1499
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,625
Oh.

1500
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:35,834
That looks nice.

1501
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,458
Oh, Jenna.

1502
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:43,000
We thought
this was lost years ago.

1503
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,792
Marcelo found it.

1504
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:45,875
He fixed the frame.

1505
01:00:47,834 --> 01:00:48,750
Thank you, Jenna.

1506
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:50,291
I love you.

1507
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,083
Glad you love it.

1508
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,583
I'm so glad you love it.

1509
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,625
One more day left in Carington.

1510
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:17,667
Ready to go back?

1511
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:21,750
I'm going to miss
the sense of community here.

1512
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,291
That's for sure.

1513
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,291
I'm going to miss you.

1514
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,333
You know, I'm not too far away.

1515
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,208
I know.

1516
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,917
This cake is amazing.

1517
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,875
Pumpkin spice
makes everything better.

1518
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:36,083
What about pumpkin spice wine?

1519
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:39,583
Okay, maybe not everything.

1520
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,083
Right.

1521
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,250
Want to dance?

1522
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,709
Absolutely.

1523
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,041
As long as you're okay with...

1524
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,291
Please don't do that
in front of people again.

1525
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,625
Come on.
It's too late.

1526
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:51,709
- Let's go.
- All right.

1527
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,250
You know...

1528
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,083
dancing always makes me
feel better.

1529
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:10,417
Okay.

1530
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,500
Are you nervous
for the competition tomorrow?

1531
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,291
Mm-hmm.

1532
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,375
Good.

1533
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,542
It's good.

1534
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,667
It's good for you.

1535
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:36,709
You know, I was thinking

1536
01:02:36,792 --> 01:02:39,917
that the wine...

1537
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,917
could be called...

1538
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,166
"The Heart",

1539
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:47,417
because you poured
your whole heart into it.

1540
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:50,917
El Corazón.

1541
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,291
Even better.

1542
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,041
To honor where you're from.

1543
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
I like it,

1544
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,875
but how about
"Maestra del Corazón"?

1545
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,500
"Master...

1546
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:10,792
of the Heart".

1547
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:16,333
To honor you.

1548
01:03:41,834 --> 01:03:43,291
A little bird told me
you were upset.

1549
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,125
Don't worry about me.

1550
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,250
Of course,
I'm worried about you.

1551
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,291
You're my little girl.

1552
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,208
What happened with Aidan?

1553
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,792
His sommelier quit.

1554
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,208
He needs to hire a new one,

1555
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:01,208
but they only hire master somms
at Alluvial, so...

1556
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,625
Well, you're going to be one
in a few weeks.

1557
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,792
Well, everyone thinks so.

1558
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,000
Except Aidan.

1559
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:10,792
What do you think?

1560
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:13,750
I...

1561
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:14,834
I don't know.

1562
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Jenna...

1563
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,448
come and sit down for a minute.

1564
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,573
I'm going to tell you something
your grandmother told me.

1565
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,208
A relationship
is like a vineyard.

1566
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,583
You plant it, you water it,

1567
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,834
you nurture it...

1568
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,667
but you only get out of it
what you put in.

1569
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,625
But it takes love
for it to thrive.

1570
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:50,959
We've been together so long,

1571
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,291
I...

1572
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,291
I thought I loved him.

1573
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,041
But...

1574
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,750
how does he not know
how much this means to me?

1575
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:02,750
If that is your dream,

1576
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,375
maybe you should be
in on it together.

1577
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,333
Here you are.
Enjoy.

1578
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,000
Thank you.

1579
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,083
Here...

1580
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,166
Aidan.

1581
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,291
Hey, sweetie.

1582
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,208
- How are you doing?
- Oh, hey.

1583
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,166
What are you doing here?

1584
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,333
I came to support you.

1585
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,083
- Um...
- Aidan.

1586
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,709
Marcelo.
Nice to meet you.

1587
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:54,476
Oh, I've heard
great things about your wine.

1588
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,300
I've heard great things
about your restaurant.

1589
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,559
I... I thought
you weren't coming.

1590
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,125
Hey.

1591
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,375
You're holding up the line.

1592
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,184
We will talk later.
Try this, please.

1593
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:05,542
It's... it's Marcelo's wine.

1594
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:06,667
Oh.

1595
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:15,458
What do you think?

1596
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:17,625
It's, uh...

1597
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:18,709
definitely unique.

1598
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,761
This wine is going to be
the next big thing.

1599
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:23,959
I'm sure it will be.

1600
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,808
All participants
in the wine competition,

1601
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,125
please report to the main stage.

1602
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,667
We will start in five minutes.

1603
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,000
I guess we'll find out.

1604
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:39,458
I'll see you over there.

1605
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,709
Welcome to the main event...

1606
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:45,959
The Carington Wine Competition.

1607
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:52,667
This event has grown
from a small local festival

1608
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,834
to a premier wine competition,

1609
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:59,291
showcasing some of the best wine
in the Sonoma and Napa regions.

1610
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:04,208
The judges have informed me

1611
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,518
that they have selected
their winners

1612
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:07,959
with great difficulty.

1613
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,250
Every one of you

1614
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,959
has created something
with passion and heart.

1615
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,250
And for that alone,
you should all be celebrated.

1616
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,083
So, without further ado,

1617
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,208
third place

1618
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,208
in the Harvest Festival
Wine Competition

1619
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,417
goes to...

1620
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,125
the Princess Pinot Noir,
Chateau d'Entremont.

1621
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,750
Yeah. That's okay.
That's okay.

1622
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:33,667
And second place goes to...

1623
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,500
the Firecracker Merlot,

1624
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:36,875
Zellar Creek.

1625
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,417
And first place...

1626
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:47,583
Oh, from our very own town
of Carington, California...

1627
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:51,083
Apple of Eden Cabernet
from Davrow Farms!

1628
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,500
Congratulations
to all our participants,

1629
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,166
and would representatives

1630
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,625
from each
of our winning vineyards

1631
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:01,893
please come on up to the stage?

1632
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:02,917
Everyone else,

1633
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:04,291
enjoy the rest
of your afternoon.

1634
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,500
Keep drinking wine.

1635
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,083
Nothing?

1636
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,834
I can't believe it.

1637
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,834
I really thought
we were going to win.

1638
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:20,041
You okay?

1639
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,792
Yeah...

1640
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,250
better than I thought
I would be.

1641
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,417
I'm really glad we did this.

1642
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:30,834
You are?

1643
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,625
Yeah.

1644
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,208
Hello, I'm Jennifer.

1645
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,959
Jennifer.

1646
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,709
Ah, hello.

1647
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,875
Hello.
I'm Jenna Savern.

1648
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:42,458
It is an honor to meet you.

1649
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:44,583
Jennifer, hi.

1650
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,875
Aidan Parker.

1651
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,101
You've been to my restaurant
in San Francisco.

1652
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,041
Alluvial?

1653
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,458
Oh, of course.

1654
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,792
Aidan.

1655
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,291
And you must be
Marcelo Castillo.

1656
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:53,959
Yeah. A pleasure to meet you.

1657
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,976
I wanted to come
and speak to you personally.

1658
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,125
I tried your wine today,

1659
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,250
and it was fantastic.

1660
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:01,250
It was daring.

1661
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,875
It was original

1662
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,333
and creative.

1663
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:05,542
Thank you.

1664
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,810
You know, not all of the judges

1665
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:08,625
are on board with organic wine,

1666
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:10,349
but I really think
you're on to something.

1667
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:12,458
Wow.

1668
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,041
And if, on the off chance,

1669
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,125
you'd like to move to Australia,

1670
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:19,125
there's a position open
at our estate in Yarra Valley.

1671
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:21,750
This is my personal number.

1672
01:09:21,834 --> 01:09:23,314
Don't take too long
to think about it.

1673
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,208
Thank you.

1674
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,709
Incredible.

1675
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,667
Wait, this is
better than winning.

1676
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,917
Jennifer Huether
wants to work with you.

1677
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:39,625
In Australia.

1678
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,250
I know.

1679
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:45,291
Hey, you should go
talk to her now.

1680
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:46,542
No, no. She's...

1681
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:47,976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is your moment.

1682
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,792
You should go. Now.
There. Go, go, go, go.

1683
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:00,834
Um, Miss Huether?

1684
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:01,750
Oh, you can call me Jennifer.

1685
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:04,792
Okay, um, Jennifer.

1686
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,583
I'm taking
my master sommelier exam

1687
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:08,917
in two weeks,

1688
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,640
and I wanted to ask
if you had any advice.

1689
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:12,792
I'm a huge admirer.

1690
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,083
I think, really,

1691
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,750
the best advice I could give you

1692
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:19,375
is to go ready,
prepared and open,

1693
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,917
and really present.

1694
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,875
Put your fears aside

1695
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:26,625
and be there and enjoy it.

1696
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:29,625
Not many women
make it as far as you do.

1697
01:10:29,709 --> 01:10:32,417
We need to stick together
and push each other forward.

1698
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:35,417
Go get 'em, Jenna.

1699
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:46,709
Aidan, can we talk for a minute?

1700
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:48,166
Yeah, sure.

1701
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,875
So what really
brought you here today?

1702
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,250
Your dad called me.

1703
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:58,458
I'm sorry.

1704
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:00,667
Missing the party
was a huge mistake.

1705
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,810
I don't know how
I'm going to make it up to you,

1706
01:11:01,834 --> 01:11:03,041
but I hope I can.

1707
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,667
Aidan, I want to be
considered for the job.

1708
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:10,875
I'm ready.

1709
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:13,041
If you needed proof
that my palate was good,

1710
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,500
well...

1711
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,041
now you have it.

1712
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,208
I shouldn't have doubted you.

1713
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,583
Right.

1714
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:21,041
You could've trusted me.

1715
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,083
In two weeks,

1716
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,226
there's a very good chance
I will be a master sommelier,

1717
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,208
but either way...

1718
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:30,625
I want the job.

1719
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,083
To Marcelo, the man of the hour.

1720
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,166
Please.

1721
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,166
I haven't accepted
the position yet.

1722
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,792
Oh, well, don't hold back
on our account.

1723
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:52,375
You have taken our vineyard
to the next level,

1724
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,834
and we couldn't be
more grateful.

1725
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,000
I'll drink to that.

1726
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,000
Cheers!

1727
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,667
Cheers.

1728
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:00,792
Cheers!

1729
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:04,917
Ahem.

1730
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,458
And to Jenna,

1731
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:09,458
our new head sommelier
at Alluvial.

1732
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,208
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

1733
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,291
Aidan!

1734
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,583
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1735
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,125
Congratulations.

1736
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,917
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you!

1737
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,041
Jenna, that's amazing.

1738
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,375
Congratulations.
You deserve it.

1739
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:27,917
Okay, I'm going to let you
celebrate as a family.

1740
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,709
I have things...

1741
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,083
in the morning in the vineyard,

1742
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,500
so thank you.

1743
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:34,667
Of course.

1744
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,110
You probably need
to get some rest.

1745
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:38,250
Goodnight, everyone.

1746
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Goodnight.

1747
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:44,875
I'll be right back.

1748
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,333
Wait!

1749
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:53,000
Wait.

1750
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:55,917
I, um...

1751
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,083
I just wanted to say
thank you...

1752
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,500
for everything.

1753
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,320
Are you really
going to Australia?

1754
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,583
It's a fantastic opportunity.

1755
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,750
I learned a lot from you.

1756
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,834
I learned a lot from you, too.

1757
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,667
I'm going to miss you.

1758
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,000
Yeah.

1759
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,250
I'll miss you, too.

1760
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:06,458
Oh, would you take table four?

1761
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,000
Good evening.

1762
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,166
And here we are.

1763
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,875
The Maestra del Corazón.

1764
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,583
Is it good?

1765
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:28,834
Mm...

1766
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:29,917
wonderful.

1767
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,375
I'd never steer you wrong.

1768
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1769
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,542
Oh, hey.

1770
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,166
Remember to upsell,

1771
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,917
and we've got
that Rioja Gran Reserva.

1772
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,542
Which I love,

1773
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,667
but it wouldn't go
with the meals they ordered.

1774
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,166
Fair enough.

1775
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,250
Oh!

1776
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,291
Just a reminder.

1777
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,000
I'm leaving early tonight
to study.

1778
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,643
Uh, but you're still
coming in tomorrow?

1779
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,291
We just booked a reservation
for a party of 10.

1780
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,667
The day before the test?

1781
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,625
Jenna, we're overbooked, okay?

1782
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:00,709
I need my somm.

1783
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,625
I'll be here first thing.

1784
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:04,750
Okay.

1785
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,208
Enjoy your night off.

1786
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:08,291
Thanks.

1787
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,959
Hey, you.
How's the restaurant?

1788
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,333
Um, it's fine.

1789
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,417
Just fine?

1790
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,166
Hey, have you...

1791
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,625
have you heard
from Marcelo recently?

1792
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,458
Well, he's moving to Australia.

1793
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:50,125
He took the job?

1794
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,375
That's great.

1795
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,834
That's, um, that's really great.

1796
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:57,250
You need to call him.

1797
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,667
It's okay.

1798
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,166
- Jenna!
- I will call you after the test.

1799
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,250
All right.

1800
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,625
Crossing my fingers.

1801
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:04,792
Fingers and toes.

1802
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:07,625
Thanks. Okay.

1803
01:16:07,709 --> 01:16:08,834
Bye.

1804
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,333
Uh... what's all this?

1805
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:20,083
This is our new pinot noir.

1806
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,250
Never heard of it.

1807
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,417
Oh, it's going to make
a huge splash,

1808
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,780
and we're the first to serve it.

1809
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,709
Don't I have a say in this?

1810
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,768
Well, I thought it was my job
to make the wine list.

1811
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,041
I just want to be sure

1812
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,845
you're doing what's best
for the restaurant.

1813
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,250
I am here, aren't I?

1814
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,792
The day before
the biggest exam of my life.

1815
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,469
You know you have your job
either way, right?

1816
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,754
And hasn't it always been
your goal to work here?

1817
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,041
No...

1818
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:54,250
No.

1819
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,458
Maybe it was my goal
at one point

1820
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:58,291
to work
at a prestigious restaurant.

1821
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,834
But I think...

1822
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,583
I'm learning to dream bigger.

1823
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,250
I don't understand.

1824
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:08,250
I want something
that feels like...

1825
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,542
like what my parents have.

1826
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,125
Two people in love,

1827
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,291
building something together
as equals.

1828
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:18,500
But you have never
believed in me.

1829
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,917
I am not taking this test
to impress you.

1830
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:26,375
I'm taking it for me.

1831
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,810
It kind of feels like
we're breaking up.

1832
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,583
I do love you, Aidan.

1833
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,291
But I think maybe

1834
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:39,750
we've always had
different dreams.

1835
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:46,041
I'm so sorry.

1836
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,208
Jenna.

1837
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:56,792
Good luck on the test.

1838
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:24,375
Well, I guess this is it.

1839
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,291
We're sad to see you go.

1840
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,142
But you really set us
on the right path.

1841
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,166
Thank you.

1842
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,208
You sure did.

1843
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:34,333
We are going
to miss you, Marcelo.

1844
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:35,417
I'll miss you.

1845
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,583
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1846
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,333
Flight 817 from Miami

1847
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:48,792
now arriving at gate B7.

1848
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:20,583
Welcome back, Miss Savern.

1849
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:21,834
How are you feeling?

1850
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,166
Excited to be back, thank you.

1851
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:26,625
You have 30 minutes
to identify all six wines.

1852
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:27,709
Good luck.

1853
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,959
This smells like the ocean
on a foggy morning.

1854
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:48,083
Assyrtiko,

1855
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,333
Santorini, Greece.

1856
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:50,417
2020.

1857
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:55,542
Flavors of stardust apple
and slate.

1858
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,667
Riesling.

1859
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:01,792
Finger Lakes,
New York, USA, 2019.

1860
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,041
Miss Savern,
do you have an answer?

1861
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:33,500
Strong,

1862
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,583
full-bodied.

1863
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,291
It's perfectly balanced.

1864
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,750
This is a high-altitude
natural Tannat

1865
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:44,083
from Mendoza,

1866
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,250
2015.

1867
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,250
Argentina.

1868
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,125
Cheers!

1869
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,917
I'm proud to welcome you
as a fellow master sommelier.

1870
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:04,667
Congratulations, Jenna.

1871
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,291
Thank you so much.

1872
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:08,875
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

1873
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:09,959
I'm sorry.

1874
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:27,625
You're here!

1875
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:29,166
I thought...

1876
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,625
I couldn't miss your big moment.

1877
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,625
Ceibo flowers?

1878
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:35,959
Yeah.

1879
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,681
You really can find
anything in this city.

1880
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:40,583
They match my new pin.

1881
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:43,542
It looks good on you.

1882
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:44,985
Your grandmother
would be so proud.

1883
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:48,750
Let's get out of here.

1884
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:49,792
Yeah.

1885
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,500
I have something to tell you.

1886
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:02,083
Okay, I spoke
to your dad's friend, Gil,

1887
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:03,766
and he's willing
to sell me his vineyard.

1888
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,208
Yeah, I would
have to take out a loan,

1889
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:09,351
and he said he's been waiting
to sell to the right person.

1890
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:12,041
And you would do that
over moving to Australia?

1891
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:14,417
I was hoping to have
a master sommelier by my side.

1892
01:22:15,959 --> 01:22:17,393
- But if it's a lot of pressure...
- No, no, no.

1893
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:18,458
- No.
- No?

1894
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:20,667
Tell me everything.

1895
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,625
We would be equals.

1896
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:24,375
Partners.

1897
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:26,218
I'd make the wine,
you'd handle the business.

1898
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,041
Of course, you'd have a say
in every decision we make.

1899
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,709
Every decision, every plan,
everything.

1900
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:35,125
We'd make it together.

1901
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,458
Home is not a place.

1902
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:43,542
It's a...

1903
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,834
feeling.

1904
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,458
And for me,
I think it's a person, too.

1905
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,291
Jenna...

1906
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:55,667
you're my home.

1907
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,792
I want you to come with me.

1908
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,417
Yes.

1909
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,917
- Yes?
- Yes!

1910
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,083
Yes?

1911
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,542
It sounds like a dream.

1912
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,750
Te quiero, Jenna.

1913
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:08,834
I love you.

1914
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,709
Te quiero, Marcelo.
