WHY I HAD
TO KEEP MY DISTANCE.

AND I WILL USE THE GUN AGAIN.

[GROANING]

1167
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,064
YOU OKAY?

1168
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:26,468
[ERIC]
GET THE GUN!
GET THE GUN!

1169
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:35,176
[GUNSHOT]

[MOANS]

1171
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,220
HONEY! HONEY, YOU OKAY?

[SIRENS WAILING]

1174
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,334
COME ON.

[ERIC]
IS HE DEAD?

1176
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:24,359
[ELIZABETH]
I'M A WRITER NOW--
A SUCCESSFUL, SINGLE WRITER.

1177
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,628
ERIC AND I TRIED
TO WORK IT OUT,

1178
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,264
BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE
WAS NOTHING LEFT TO WORK OUT.

1179
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:32,434
OF COURSE,
GRIFF WASN'T DEAD.
[APPLAUSE]

1180
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:35,403
TWO WEEKS AGO,
I HEARD THAT HE'D ESCAPED
FROM THE SANITARIUM.

1181
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,606
THEY TOLD ME THAT HE SAID
THAT HE LIVED ONLY FOR ME.

1182
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,875
AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
I ALMOST ENVY THAT.

1183
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,211
I WISH I FELT
THAT WAY ABOUT SOMEONE.

1184
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,915
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE SOMEDAY, I WILL.

1185
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:48,516
GREAT BOOK.

1186

01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:00,829
AND YES, I AM
WRITING ANOTHER ONE.

1189
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,200
THIS IS EXCITING.
THE TURNOUT IS SO GREAT.

1190
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:07,535
I KNOW.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, LIZZY.

1191
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,938
I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOME WATER.

1192
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,806
CONGRATULATIONS, ELIZABETH.

1193
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,376
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FANTASY.

1194
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,246
HOW'S THAT?

1195
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,848
YOU SHOT THE BOSS.

1196
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:20,882
OH.

1197
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:26,421
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU TO DINNER.
I'M IN TOWN FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

1198
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:30,191
I DON'T THINK SO.
UM, THIS PRESS TOUR,
IT'S KILLING ME.

1199
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,229
BUT THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

1200
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,331

[GIGGLING]
NOW THAT IS
ONE GOOD-LOOKING MAN.

1202
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,238
WHY DIDN'T YOU ACCEPT?

1203
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,741
LAURIE, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING CASUAL.

1204
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:49,644
AND EVEN THE MOST
INNOCENT LITTLE AFFAIR

1205
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:51,946
CAN END IN DISASTER.

1206
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,082
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

1207
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:01,422
[GRIFFIN'S VOICE ECHOING]
YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU
SURELY CANNOT HIDE.

1209
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:07,395
I'M SORRY.

1210
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,364
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

1211
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:13,334
YEAH, I'M FINE, UH--

1212
