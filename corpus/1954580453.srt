00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,438
Kara: Pre-law is hell.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,869
The workload
is near impossible,

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,605
and if you want to get into

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,380
any of the decent
law schools,

6
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:15,409
don't even bother trying
unless you have a 4.0.

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,446
At least I had that much,
but even that wasn't enough.

8
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,993
You need a killer transcript,
volunteer hours

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,190
and of course money,
tons of money.

10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,363
And that's what
I didn't have, lots of it.

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,703
The thing is, easy money,

12
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,771
you always end up
paying for it.

14
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,907
Can I get some
fruit with that?

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,179
Yeah, here you go.

17
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,477
Thanks.

18
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,851
All right,
we've got a beer,

19
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,051
two shots and a vodka soda.

20
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,254
Here, Kara,
have a shot with us.

21
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,316
I can't. I'm working.

22
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,464
Come on, just one.

23
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,229
- Sorry.
- It's on us.

24
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,557
Sorry.

25
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,702
That's just perfect.

26
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,658
Are you okay?

27
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,926
I've got
to get cleaned up.

28
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,834
- We're slammed.
- I'm drenched.

29
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,736
What happened to you?

30
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,382
Oh, Just the usual:

31
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,847
serving drunks
and getting dumped on.

32
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,848
Hey, are you going
back to our room?

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,950
No, why?

34
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,721
Just wanted you
to grab me a shirt.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,050
Sorry. I'm going
to a party.

36
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,386
You should come, you know,
when you're done here.

37
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,992
I can't. I've got
a paper to finish.

38
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,625
Oh, well, you know
what they say:

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,870
all work and no play,
well, that's just lame.

40
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,709
- Hey.
- Hi.

41
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,739
That dress is so hot.

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,384
That ring.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,910
Hey, gorgeous.

44
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,146
Hi. What are you
doing here?

45
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,722
I just wanted to see you.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm happy you're here.

47
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,774
Text me if you
change your mind.

48
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,114
- Hey.
- Hi.

49
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,852
What the hell is going on?

50
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,549
I don't know.

51
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,221
He's like 82.

52
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,389
Shh, shh, shh.

53
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:15,763
Is that your new roommate's
dad or her boyfriend?

54
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,363
I have no idea.

55
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,735
Hey, Kara, I need to
talk to you for a sec.

56
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,138
I hate to do this,

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,270
but I kind of hired
too many people

58
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,575
at the beginning
of the term,

59
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,137
so I'm going to have
to cut you loose.

60
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,075
You're firing me?

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,380
Not firing,
letting you go.

62
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,011
I'll give you a call
if we need more help.

63
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,746
But I need a job now.

64
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,417
Okay.

65
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,197
Professor: If I had a client
who I knew was guilty,

66
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,071
could I morally
represent him?

67
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,440
Now, the law dictates that
he has a right to be defended,

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,770
but could you,

69
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,144
or more importantly
should you do it?

70
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,014
I want you to pose
that question to yourselves

71
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,453
and answer it in your next
essay due in a week.

72
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,052
Kara, can I see you
for a minute?

73
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,815
Yeah.

74
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,488
Are you still interested
in a summer internship?

75
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,334
Of course.

76
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,329
Well, I just heard that
the Women's Law Shelter
is looking for somebody.

77
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,432
Now, they don't normally
accept pre-law grads,

78
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,304
but it's worth a shot,

79
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,243
although you should know
that it's full-time,
and it doesn't pay.

80
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,508
Oh, I didn't realize.

81
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,767
Well if it's something
you can't manage,
I understand,

82
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,106
but if you could,
it would look great
on your transcript.

83
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,413
Okay, I'll
think about it.
Thank you so much.

84
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,705
You're welcome.

85
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,185
Roommate:
What do you think?

86
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,088
Does the color
wash me out?

87
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,960
No, it's fine.

88
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,333
$849?

89
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,734
Hey, who was that guy
with the Ferrari?

90
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,733
Oh, you mean David?

91
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,365
He's just a friend.

92
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,600
A friend?

93
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,865
Is that whose party you
went to the other night?

94
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,714
You would know
if you came.

95
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,447
You know,
it doesn't have to be
so hard, Kara.

96
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,551
You know, ever since
the semester started,

97
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,793
all I've seen you do
is work and study.

98
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,459
I have to.

99
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,017
No, you don't.

100
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,525
Look, why don't you
come out with me
tonight?

101
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,458
You can wear one
of my new dresses.

102
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,204
I highly doubt
I can afford a place

103
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,229
where I have to wear
a dress like that,

104
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,034
especially since
I lost my job.

105
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,436
Well that's perfect
because you won't have
to pay for a thing.

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,710
Come on,
it's just one night.

107
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,880
You deserve it.

108
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,945
All right. I'll see
if Justin can come.

109
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,819
No way. This is
a girls night only.

110
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,362
Trust me,
you're gonna love it.

Hey, baby. Mmm.

125
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:47,374
David, this is
my roommate, Kara.

126
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,244
- Hello.
- Hi.

127
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:53,813
I thought that
you could, you know,
introduce her.

128
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,724
Of course. Anything
for you, sweetheart.

129
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,147
( laughs ) I'll go
get us some drinks.

130
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,293
Okay.

131
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,887
Actually,
I think I'm okay.

132
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,019
Whenever you're ready.

133
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,699
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

134
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,568
I mean, David
is hardly just a friend,

135
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,898
and this, this is
obviously a meat market.

136
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,635
It's a lot classier
than that.

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,610
Really? Old men hooking
up with 20-year-olds
is classy?

138
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,180
These men have a hell
of a lot more class

139
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,980
than the frat boys
on campus.

140
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,222
Thank you.

141
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,887
Here, drink this
and mingle, or don't.

142
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,887
Shawna. Shawna, wait.

143
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,790
You look lost.

144
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,626
I'm looking for someone.

145
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,758
Why are you
so uncomfortable?

146
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:48,774
Everyone's enjoying
themselves except you.

147
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,099
Maybe I don't
consider this fun.

148
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,874
You don't consider
a party fun?

149
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,943
Let me guess.
You are a college student.

150
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,954
You take your studies
very seriously.

151
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,647
You probably work
weekends or even nights

152
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,020
when everyone else is out?

153
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,720
Is that a problem?

154
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,892
Not at all.

155
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,321
In fact, I respect it.

156
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,726
I know from
firsthand experience

157
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,658
what a struggle it is
to make ends meet.

158
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,763
But now I am in a position

159
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,725
where I might be able
to help others.

160
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,036
Okay, excuse me,
you are?

161
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,768
Grant Zager.
And you are?

162
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:33,645
Kara Jones.

163
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,347
Look, I appreciate your
respect, Mr. Zager,

164
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,921
but I don't need
your help.

165
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,589
I don't think
she's ready.

166
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,992
No, she's ambitious,

167
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:56,936
and you know how much
I love a challenge.

168
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,437
I know, I know,
and I wish

169
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,968
it would've turned out
differently, too.

170
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,243
Man on phone:
Okay, sorry.

171
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,611
Thank you, though, yeah.

172
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,344
Mom, are you all right?

173
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:11,316
Oh, Kara, sweetheart.

174
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,518
What's going on?

175
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,149
Well, it looks like

176
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,694
we lost the fight with
the insurance company.

177
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,820
I don't believe it.
I mean, this is
an accident.

178
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,285
I know, but they denied
the coverage,

179
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,855
and there's nothing
we can do.

180
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,563
I don't even know
if we're going to be able

181
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,195
to hold onto the house.

182
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,199
Maybe I should
move back home.

183
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,841
No, no, no, no.
We've talked about this.

184
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,067
Now your father and I
want you to be
close to campus

185
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,043
so that you can focus
on your work.

186
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,212
You've worked so hard.

187
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,710
We just want you
to be able to get into
a decent law school.

188
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,854
There's my girl.

189
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,778
Hi, Dad. Missed you.

190
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,746
You're back
at work already?

191
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,194
Yeah, first week back.

192
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,689
I feel great.

193
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,491
I was looking at
your VW out front.

194
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,993
How's it holding up?

195
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,855
It got me here.

196
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,563
How's your Vette?

197
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,495
Do you mean that
fully restored Vette

198
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,901
that I just drove up in?

199
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,404
Why don't you tell me?

200
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:10,075
Wow, sweet.

201
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,307
This is amazing.

202
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,752
Yeah, yeah,
it's hard to believe

203
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,978
it was just once
a rusty frame, huh?

204
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:17,984
Yeah.

205
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,845
You keep doing us proud,

206
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:25,693
it's going to make you
a pretty decent
graduation present.

207
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,632
Are you serious?

208
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,157
Just gotta
finish law school.

209
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,433
Mom told me about
the insurance.

210
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,533
( sighs )

211
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,496
It's my job to get you
through school.

212
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,466
If we have to make
a few sacrifices

213
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,405
to do that, so be it.

214
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,951
Get in there
and fire this bad boy up.

215
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,547
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

216
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,215
So how's
the job hunting going?

217
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,825
Bad. Most of the
part-time positions

218
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,958
have been filled for
the semester already.

219
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,564
Can your parents help out?

220
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,425
They owe so much for
my dad's medical bills

221
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,334
they can't even help
with tuition right now.

222
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,396
Well, don't worry about it.

223
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,406
I'm sure you'll find
a way to do it.

224
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,679
( cell phone rings )

225
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,779
( ringing )

226
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,111
Hello?

227
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,815
Man on phone:
Kara? Grant Zager here.

228
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,717
How did you get
my number?

229
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,450
Your roommate
gave it to me.

230
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,585
I hope
that's not a problem.

231
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,090
Yes, it is.

232
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:37,163
Oh. Well, you have
my number now.

233
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,364
I'm hoping you'll call.

234
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,766
Kara, take it
from someone

235
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,867
who did it
all on his own.

236
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,999
Everyone needs some help.

237
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,581
What do you think?

238
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,677
She'll call.

239
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,521
You gave him my number?

240
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,350
I guess he called you.

241
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,356
Why would you do that?

242
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,517
Because he asked for it.

243
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,755
Trust me, a lot of girls

244
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,390
would kill to be
with Grant Zager.

245
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,725
He's like
the sugar daddy jackpot.

246
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,831
So that's what David is,
your sugar daddy?

247
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,703
Look, don't get
all moralistic on me,
all right?

248
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,643
He's an adult
and I'm an adult.

249
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,038
We're not doing
anything wrong.

250
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,580
Well, you're
having sex, right?

251
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,637
So?

252
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,084
Okay, wait.

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,850
So how does
all this work?

254
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,851
Easy, I give him
what he wants,

255
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,623
and in return,
I get what I want.

256
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,351
As in money?

257
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,886
Yeah, lots of money.

258
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,462
Look, I make myself
available to him

259
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,861
whenever he wants
my company,

260
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,333
and in return,
he pays my tuition.

261
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:50,602
It doesn't bother you
that he's so old?

262
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,974
In the dark, everyone
looks and feels the same.

263
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,675
Look, just go out
with him once, just once.

264
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,348
I mean,
what could it hurt?

265
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,277
If you don't like it,
then forget it.

266
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,982
But if you do,

267
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,454
say goodbye
to all your problems.

268
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,238
I am so glad you called.

269
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,612
I thought we were
going to dinner.

270
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,281
We are.

271
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,307
In San Francisco.

272
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,030
Welcome aboard.

273
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,848
Buckle up.

274
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,028
Do you think
people will think

275
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,103
I'm your daughter
or your girlfriend?

276
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,672
( laughs )

277
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,170
Either way, right now
it doesn't make a difference

278
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:40,345
because every man
in this room

279
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,507
is jealous of me.

280
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,923
So tell me,
what are you studying?

281
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,891
Well, right now
I'm studying political
science as my major

282
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,221
because I want
to go to law school.

283
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,525
Just what this world
needs, another lawyer.

284
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,329
I'm kidding.

285
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,702
Hey, if you're any good,
I'll hire you.

286
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,641
Something tells me
you're going to be good.

287
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,837
Just leave it
in the middle, thanks.

288
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,940
So you've chosen
a very competitive field.

289
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,383
Now, what are you
going to do

290
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,508
to get a leg up
on the competition?

291
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,184
Well, I just applied
for an internship

292
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,052
with the Women's
Law Shelter.

293
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,781
It's a not-for-profit.

294
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,786
I've heard of it.

295
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,848
Here.

296
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:23,786
Thank you.

297
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,738
It's really good.

298
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,739
No. Champagne.

299
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:45,111
With caviar...

300
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,311
champagne.

301
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,853
It accents the flavor.

302
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,646
- So what did you study?
- Oh, same as you.

303
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,116
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,164
You're a lawyer?

305
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,129
Oh, not even close.

306
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,227
I studied law
for a couple of years,

307
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:07,499
but then I realized
I was much better suited
for the investment world.

308
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,600
So what I do now is
I buy broken companies,

309
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,705
I fix them up,

310
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,908
I make them profitable,
then I sell them.

311
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,311
It's a good business.

312
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,982
You're just like
my dad.

313
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:25,521
He really likes buying
these broken-down cars
and restoring them.

314
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,018
A car lover?

315
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,190
We have something
in common,

316
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,189
though I would prefer

317
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,462
if you don't compare me
to your father.

318
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,732
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--

319
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,201
That's all right.

320
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,199
I just want you to see me
as something else.

321
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:47,543
So how are you paying
your way through school?

322
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,210
My parents
help a little,

323
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:56,580
but my dad
got into this car
accident last year,

324
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,183
and his medical
insurance said that
he wasn't covered,

325
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,685
so now they have to pay.

326
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,718
How much?

327
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,192
$80,000.

328
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,860
That's about what you need
to get through law school.

329
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,732
Yeah.

330
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,300
So here's the thing.

331
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:20,869
I think one of these
every month could help.

332
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,877
I have a boyfriend.

333
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,323
We both have lives.

334
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:37,558
I just think
they could be enhanced...

335
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,462
By a special relationship.

336
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,244
Think about it.

337
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,313
Come on.

338
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,545
Where did he take you,
The Grove, 360?

339
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,720
San Francisco.

340
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,177
Are you serious?

341
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,686
Yeah, he took us there
on his private jet.

342
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,359
Oh, my God, you are
such a lucky bitch.

343
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,028
Did you join
the mile-high club?

344
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,857
No, it wasn't like that.

345
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,132
He actually
was a gentleman.

346
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,831
I knew it.
Grant's such a score.

347
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,574
But you guys
have a deal, right?

348
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,741
I don't know.

349
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,208
I just told him
I'd think about it.

350
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,308
Seriously, what is there
to think about?

351
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,410
Grant is the whole package.

352
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,552
With him you're able
to do whatever you want.

353
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,817
Professional conduct.

354
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,420
This is regulated
by a very specific code

355
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,793
detailing what
is considered good behavior

356
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,992
and unacceptable behavior.

357
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,834
So unless you want
to get into trouble...

358
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,944
Professor:
Kara?

359
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,146
Kara?

360
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,848
Have you made a decision
about the internship?

361
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,951
Can you do it, or am
I asking someone else?

362
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,194
Yeah, I can do it.

363
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:21,390
Wow. You look spectacular.

364
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,858
Shall we?

365
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,666
Grant: Is there
anything I can do

366
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,028
to make you
more comfortable?

367
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,796
How about a drink?

368
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,095
Sure.

369
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,963
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

370
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,398
So...

371
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,268
So...

372
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,697
Shall we
take it upstairs?

373
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,410
Maybe you prefer
another room?

374
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:20,211
The gym, the pool table,
the garage?

375
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,313
( chuckles )

376
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,576
I'm just kidding.

377
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,516
( exhales ) Relax.

378
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,691
Okay.

379
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,519
I'm not going to ask you
to do anything

380
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,085
that you don't want to do.

381
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,204
I want you
to enjoy yourself.

382
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,657
Come.

383
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,157
You okay?

384
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,482
You were wonderful.

385
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,799
That ought to
take care of your
student debt, huh?

386
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,196
So did he
ease you into it,

387
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,905
or did he just take you?

388
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,767
( all laugh )

389
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,736
He was actually...

390
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,176
He was very considerate.

391
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,881
You're lucky.

392
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,052
My guy's wife
isn't into role play,

393
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,950
so guess who gets
to play dress-up?

394
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,293
Your sugar daddy's married?

395
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,219
You're surprised?

396
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,424
Besides, you have
a boyfriend, don't you?

397
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,955
Look, I'm sure
you're fine.

398
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,002
Grant seems like
a classy guy.

399
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,157
Besides, just do what I do.

400
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,366
You just close your eyes

401
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,899
and pretend like it's
the hottest guy ever.

402
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:37,135
And then when you open them,
it's all over.

403
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,113
Okay,
so what's going on?
What's the latest?

404
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,415
Well, I just applied
for an internship.

405
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,419
That's great. With whom?

406
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,552
The Women's Law Shelter.

407
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,116
I mean, it doesn't pay,

408
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,964
but it'll look really good
on my transcript if I get it.

409
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,561
Are you
going to be able

410
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,362
to keep your job
at the pub?

411
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,274
Yeah, for sure.
Don't worry.

412
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,497
Here. Just a little
something to help out.

413
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,205
Thank you, guys,

414
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,377
but really,
I mean, I'm fine.

415
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:15,047
I think you guys need it
more than I do right now.

416
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,477
Really, I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

417
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,457
So what's going on
with you, hmm?

418
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,788
Is there something
you don't want
your old man to know?

419
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,165
What are you talking about?

420
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,897
GPS, young lady.
You turned it off.

421
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,004
I can't track
my little girl anymore.

422
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,206
- Dad.
- Barry.

423
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,307
( laughs )

424
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,168
Um, I'm kind of
grown up now.

425
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,036
I figured it was time
to cut the cord.

426
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,845
Oh, oh, we're playing
the grown-up card.

427
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,848
I guess that means
I can't take her out

428
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,980
for an ice cream
sundae later on.

429
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,024
You know,
I wouldn't do that.

430
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,349
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

431
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,053
I never said I didn't like
ice cream anymore.

432
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,656
- Oh, then you're back in.
- Thank you.

433
00:25:58,658 --> 00:25:59,988
You're back
on the team, honey.

434
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,692
Yeah, baby, nice.

435
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:08,904
All right, it's a deal.

436
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,171
( engine won't start )

437
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,572
Come on.

438
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,438
( cell phone rings )

439
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,249
Hello?

440
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,348
Kara, Grant here.

441
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,720
Oh, hi.

442
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,148
Something wrong?
You sound upset.

443
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,524
Oh, nothing.

444
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:30,852
I just can't get
my car to start.

445
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,886
Obviously
you're going to need

446
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,692
a lift to my place
tonight.

447
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,134
Tonight? I'm--

448
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,229
Um, I have plans.

449
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,071
Cancel them.
I'll see you at 8:00.

450
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,114
You need a jump?

451
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,367
- Yes, please.
- Okay, pop the hood.

452
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,851
All right. Yeah, just
leave it running, okay?

453
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,015
Okay.

454
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,523
Hey, so we still on
for the movie tonight?

455
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:11,595
Um...actually I can't.

456
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,327
I've got
a paper to write

457
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:14,902
and a test to study for.

458
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,930
Okay.

459
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,065
I promise I'll
make it up to you.

460
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,370
It's no big deal.

461
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,242
Just let me know
when you're free.

462
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay.

463
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,087
( sighs )

464
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,817
I hope you didn't eat.

465
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,322
Peter's going to pick up
some dinner for us.

466
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,626
Will he be joining us?

467
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,959
Do you have
a problem with him?

468
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,329
Peter is...
he's a very good friend.

469
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,236
We grew up together.

470
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:56,338
( cell phone rings )

471
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,642
Sorry.

472
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,043
You can answer that
if you want to.

473
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:04,046
Oh, this is just...
it's my mom.

474
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,880
I'll just
call her back later.

475
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,515
Do you have
a good relationship
with your parents?

476
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,321
I do.

477
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,322
Lucky you.

478
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,794
How about you?

479
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,293
Do you have any family?

480
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,304
This is a pretty big
house for one person.

481
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,968
If you're asking me
if I'm married, no.

482
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,869
Why should I get married

483
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,041
when I can have a relationship
with somebody like you?

484
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,641
( laughs )

485
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,813
If this works out
between us,

486
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:37,152
I'd like to help your father
with his medical bills.

487
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,979
You would do that?

488
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,354
Sure.

489
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,952
It was $80,000?

490
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,624
It's no problem.

491
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,492
Oh, my God.
Come here.

492
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,909
I have something for you.

493
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,621
They're so beautiful.

494
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,861
Put them on.

495
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,859
How do they look?

496
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,896
Dance with me.

just for doing what
you girls like to do.

508
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,775
What is that
supposed to mean?

509
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,184
Don't play games with me.

510
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,515
I don't have
anything you need.

511
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,121
You sound jealous.

512
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,675
Hey.

513
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,307
Hey.

514
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,752
Hi.

515
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,007
Are you okay?

516
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,446
What are you doing here?

517
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,781
My dorm's
just down the street.

518
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,186
What about you?

519
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,789
Are you just
rolling in, too?

520
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,860
I was just at my boyfriend's.

521
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,090
Which one?

522
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,156
( laughs )

523
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,495
Where were you?

524
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,870
Oh, you know,
just playing dress-up.

525
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,339
Let's see, tonight

526
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,538
I was "dirty
flight attendant."

527
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,279
Does it bother you,
having to do that?

528
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,181
Does it bother you?

529
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,748
It's not so bad, I guess.

530
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,594
Yeah, well, that's
because you're lucky.

531
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:10,030
Grant's good-looking,
and he's a gentleman.

532
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,299
Not all of them
are like that.

533
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,498
Some will
make you do things,

534
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,740
things you
wouldn't even do with
your own boyfriend,

535
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:23,807
things that no matter
how many times you shower,

536
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,609
they'll never
come off you.

537
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,352
Leah, I'm sorry.

538
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,547
- Get off me.
- Leah.

539
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,454
( knocking )

540
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,847
Hey, you still studying?

541
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,386
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

542
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,791
So I brought you
a midnight snack.

543
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:42,994
Thanks.

544
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,033
I thought you were just
bringing me a snack.

545
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,996
That was just my cover.

546
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,388
Um...I'm kind of tired.

547
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:13,417
Would you mind if
we just, like, hung out?

548
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,185
Is that okay?

549
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,864
Sure, sure.

550
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,372
Everything okay?

551
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,475
Yeah, everything's fine.

552
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,305
Whoa.

553
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,375
What?

554
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,123
That is one big rock.

555
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,178
Who'd you get that from?

556
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:47,316
Oh, I just borrowed
these from Shawna.

557
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,486
To study?

558
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,926
Actually,
speaking of studying,

559
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,473
I should probably
get back to it.

560
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,669
I have so much stuff
to do tomorrow,

561
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,471
I'm just really
overwhelmed.

562
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,344
I'll, like, come over
to your place tomorrow?

563
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,584
Sure, whatever.

564
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,208
- Is that okay?
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,762
So before I forget,
you got your internship.

566
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,763
How do you know?

567
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,865
I made some calls,
I pulled some strings,
so it's yours.

568
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,899
I don't know
what to say.

569
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,865
Say you're happy.

570
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,144
I'm happy.

571
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:42,253
See, this relationship
can work out for both of us.

572
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,087
Oh, um...

573
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,660
Peter's
like right there.

574
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,255
Just close your eyes.

575
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,982
Hey, Shawna, you know
where Kara is?

576
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,422
She's your girlfriend,
not mine.

577
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,717
I know, I just--

578
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,818
I tried texting her,
and she never got back to me.

579
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,190
It's just not like her.

580
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,518
Maybe she's
in the library.

581
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,794
You know how they are
about phones in there.

582
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,663
Yeah, maybe.

583
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,661
Those are some nice
earrings you loaned her.
Nice rocks.

584
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,965
What earrings?
I didn't loan her
any earrings.

585
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:43,567
Leah, this is Justin,
Kara's boyfriend.

586
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,735
Did Kara mention to you

587
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,044
where she was going tonight?

588
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,605
Oh, um...

589
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,015
Don't worry.
I get it.

590
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,987
Ahem.

591
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:01,893
Hey.

592
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,898
Where were you?

593
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,631
You said
you'd come by tonight.

594
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,995
I'm so sorry.

595
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,074
I totally forgot.

596
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,872
And you couldn't
even return my texts?

597
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,938
I forgot to check my phone.
I'm sorry.

598
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,105
I just had to get out.

599
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,754
Dressed like that?

600
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,520
You know, I ran
into Shawna tonight,

601
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,019
and she told me
she never lent you
those pair of earrings,

602
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:34,593
so where'd
you get them, Kara?

603
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,490
From whoever
you were with tonight?

604
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,626
No, I was just out
with some girlfriends.

605
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,731
Oh, don't lie to me,
all right?

606
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,402
I mean, I can
smell him on you.

607
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,168
So who is he?

608
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,171
Justin, please--

609
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,813
Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

610
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,739
Just tell me he's not
one of those sugar daddies.

611
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,882
I don't believe this.

612
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,146
You don't understand.

613
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,955
I understand
just fine, Kara.

614
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,828
Check this out.

615
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,474
My new sugar daddy
gave it to me
last night.

616
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,139
Was this before
or after you saw Justin?

617
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,438
Hey, I did what I could
to cover for you,
all right?

618
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,641
But, I mean, how long
did you think

619
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,283
you could keep it
a secret?

620
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,908
Look, forget about
Justin, all right?

621
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,314
You're only 21.
Have fun.

622
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,576
Is that what you're
having, Shawna, fun?

623
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,846
About 12 carats of it.

624
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,655
Plus this guy
has serious potential.

625
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,387
- As what?
- My future husband.

626
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:44,193
Are you serious?

627
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:46,526
What, don't you think
I'd make a great
trophy wife?

628
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,801
I thought you
were just doing this
to get through school.

629
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,070
I am. I'm securing
my future,

630
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,069
academically
and financially.

631
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,501
Plus this guy
will probably croak

632
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,006
before I even
hit my peak.

633
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,508
So you're just
a gold digger, then?

634
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,439
Yeah, those rocks
that Justin was
talking about,

635
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,105
I'm sure you went
digging for them.

636
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,854
Look, don't pretend
like you're any better
than me.

637
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,950
At least I know
what I am and I own it.

638
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,734
You seem
very quiet tonight.

639
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,597
I'm fine.

640
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:21,057
I've had enough
experience with women

641
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,496
to know that
when she says, "I'm fine,"

642
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,242
she's probably not.

643
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,314
That's all right.

644
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,007
I've got
something planned

645
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,038
that will make you
happy tonight.

646
00:38:54,865 --> 00:39:00,195
So you haven't said anything
about my new set of wheels.

647
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,705
It's nice.

648
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,438
Nice? This is nice?

649
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,514
Well, I'd have to drive
it first to know that.

650
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,353
Of course. You are
an auto mechanic's daughter.

651
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:16,221
Well, I hope you like
the drive, because it's yours.

652
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,821
What?

653
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,763
I figured
you needed a new car.

654
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,828
Am I right?

655
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,727
Um...( laughs )

656
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:27,499
This is...this is...
this is way too much.

657
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,999
I don't know
what to say.

658
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,270
Don't worry.

659
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,298
You will
make it up to me.

660
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:34,644
( laughs )

661
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,589
How old are you?

662
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,159
I'm not going to
tell you how old I am.

663
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,329
Why not?

664
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,687
Because it will probably
freak you out,

665
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,826
and you'll leave me.

666
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,872
Okay, well,
I'm just going to
ask you questions

667
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,239
until I figure it out.

668
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,797
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

669
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,505
Okay, go ahead.

670
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,667
So when you were a kid,

671
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:16,176
did you guys
have electric power?

672
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,151
( laughs )

673
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,787
The year after I was born.

674
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,147
Uh-huh?

675
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:25,415
- They invented it.
- Oh.

676
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,294
Hmm. Interesting.

677
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,532
( laughs )

678
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,398
Now I'm going
to ask you a question.

679
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,997
Okay.

680
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:38,129
What is the kinkiest thing...

681
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,566
you have ever done
sexually?

682
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,513
I knew you were
going to ask me this.

683
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,478
Well, other than
doing it with a guy

684
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,878
that went to high school
with Abraham Lincoln,

685
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,450
I don't know.

686
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:55,249
I kind of have a thing
for chocolate syrup.

687
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,593
What about you?

688
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,689
What's the kinkiest
thing you've ever done?

689
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,731
I like to be choked.

690
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,327
Oh, okay.

691
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,630
( laughs )

692
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,703
Wait, you're serious?

693
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:16,473
It's the most unbelievable
high you have ever had.

694
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,335
Wait, really?

695
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:22,154
Get on top of me.

696
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,149
When the moment
is right,

697
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,385
you take your hands
and put them here, okay?

698
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:38,901
And you squeeze hard
right there. Harder.

699
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,797
Just like that.
Harder. Yeah.

700
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,669
Oh, it's just amazing.

701
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,281
The next time
you're here...

702
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,775
I want you
to do that to me.

703
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,921
I...I don't know.

704
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,349
I don't know
if I can do that.

705
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,954
Yes, you can.

706
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:07,055
It's okay.

707
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,258
You'll learn.

708
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,970
You already paid me
for this month.

709
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:26,139
I think this more
than adequately covers

710
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,984
your father's
medical expenses.

711
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,517
Yes. Yes, it would.

712
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:39,161
I don't know
what to say.

713
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:44,787
I admit I'm a little bit...
eccentric.

714
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:48,096
And I have certain needs.

715
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:53,399
This check is yours
if those needs are met.

716
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,584
Mrs. Jones' voice:
They denied the coverage,

717
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,824
and there's nothing
we can do.

718
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,149
I don't even know
if we're going to be able
to hold on to the house.

719
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,955
Take your hands,
put them here.

720
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,688
Harder. just like that.
Harder.

721
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:18,093
Grant's voice: I think this more
than adequately covers

722
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,956
your father's
medical expenses.

723
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,828
I like to be choked.

724
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:23,804
( gasps )

725
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,502
( crashing )

726
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,436
Wow. Where'd you say
you got this?

727
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,744
This dealer by school.

728
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,376
They said it came in
brand-new

729
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,311
except for
the front end damage,

730
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:41,446
so I made a really
good deal with him.

731
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,391
Don't worry. I wouldn't
have done it if I couldn't.

732
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:48,792
Hmm.

733
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,628
I'll tell you what.

734
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,574
Why don't
you leave it tonight?

735
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:00,639
I'll knock out
the front end.

736
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,809
Let the old man go
through it, all right?

737
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,167
Tires, tune-up.

738
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,775
You never know what you
get when you buy used.

739
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,038
Thanks, Dad.

740
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:09,376
Yeah.

741
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:13,581
Oh, speaking of old man,
happy birthday.

742
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,585
Sweetie.

743
00:44:16,588 --> 00:44:17,918
Barry:
So, yeah,

744
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,162
we have a lawyer
in the family, all right?

745
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,889
Because of a bike
with training wheels.

746
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,325
Yes, seriously.

747
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,060
She wasn't having it
when she was a kid,

748
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,425
so I promised her one day.

749
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,973
I said, okay, when
I get home from work,

750
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,598
I'll take
the training wheels off.

751
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:32,673
It's my kid.

752
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,901
She doesn't wait
for anything.

753
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,835
So I get home.
My wife is in the kitchen.

754
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,240
She's in a state of shock
because she can't find her.

755
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,543
So I get in the car.

756
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,384
I'm driving around
looking for her.

757
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,479
Then I see her.

758
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,550
And I pull up next to her

759
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,908
and go, "Hey, sweetie."

760
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,646
She goes, "Dad, look!
No training wheels!"

761
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:48,992
And she's going along.

762
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,217
I said,
"Baby, turn it around,

763
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,222
let's head home."

764
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,393
She goes, "Dad,

765
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:56,831
I only know
how to go straight."

766
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:59,358
She's been going full steam
forward ever since.

767
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,074
Ah, to Kara,
best daughter
a guy ever had.

768
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:04,467
Oh, and happy
birthday, old man.

769
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,199
( cell phone rings )
Hey, that's right.

770
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,304
I'm an old man today.

771
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,935
Come on, sweetie.

772
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,340
Yeah.

773
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:13,082
Hook me up tonight.

774
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,478
Hey, it's Kara.
Sorry I missed your call.

775
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,610
Please leave a message.

776
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:17,984
( beep )

777
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,954
Mrs. Jones:
So your father tells me

778
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,723
you bought yourself
a car.

779
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,122
A used car.

780
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,993
( cell phone rings )
You know, honey,

781
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,891
we're not gonna be
able to help you much
with tuition next year.

782
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,564
No, I know. It's okay.

783
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,163
I got a second job waitressing
at a new restaurant,

784
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,295
so tips are great.

785
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:40,171
Great. Hey, I thought
Justin was coming today.

786
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,771
I know. He couldn't.
He had too much work.

787
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:46,184
( cell phone rings )
Who keeps calling?

788
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:49,807
Uh, this is my roommate.

789
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:52,954
I think she, uh,
might need something.

790
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,951
I'll be right back, okay?

791
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:00,786
Hello?

792
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,022
Where have you been?

793
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,086
I'm at my parents.

794
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,925
Well, you need to leave now.

795
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,430
I have a function
at the club.

796
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,332
I want you
to be there with me.

797
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,204
I had them put you
on the list

798
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,742
so we can meet there.

799
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,237
I can't. It's my Dad's
birthday.

800
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,740
I don't care
what it is, Kara.

801
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:20,082
I expect you in an hour.

802
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,178
No, I need to be here.

803
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,850
Do I have to remind you
about our arrangement?

804
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,049
Look, I thought
you gave me this car

805
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:29,251
so I could spend more
time with my family.

806
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:32,664
When it doesn't
interfere with my plans.

807
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,887
I expect you in an hour.

808
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:38,533
No. I'm sorry, Grant.

809
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,900
Kara! Kara!

810
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:56,446
Hey, I was wondering
if I could ask you
a biggie.

811
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,807
Sure.

812
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,116
I'm short on cash
and I just need
a little bit

813
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,688
to hold me over until
I land my next daddy.

814
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:05,217
What happened
to Mr. Jessup?

815
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,763
He dumped me.

816
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:09,058
How much?

817
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,090
$500?

818
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,833
I don't even know
if I have that.

819
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,133
Do you have anything
that I can pawn?

820
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:21,795
I mean, Grant's
a generous guy, right?

821
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:26,336
Look, I promise
I'll pay you back.

822
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,679
I have some earrings.

823
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:35,382
Great. I'll pick them up
after class, yeah?

824
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,146
And like I said,
I'll pay you back.

825
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,320
Grant Zager.

826
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,265
What can I get you?

827
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,941
Looking for Kara Jones.
She works here.

828
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,570
Not anymore.
We had to let her go
a few weeks ago.

829
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,076
Excuse me.

830
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,318
Grant?

831
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,859
Grant?

832
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,131
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

833
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,532
Disappointed.

834
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,495
How was your father's
birthday?

835
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,195
It was nice.

836
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,736
How was your event?

837
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,081
Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't have a date.

838
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:08,737
Hey, I'm sorry.

839
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:13,216
I have been extremely
generous with you.

840
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:16,347
And even though you're
not willing to give me

841
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:20,364
what I really want,
what I asked for
the other night,

842
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,958
the only thing I have ever
expected in return

843
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:27,201
is that you be there
when I need you.

844
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,766
Kara: But you told me
at the last minute.

845
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,505
I mean,
you have to give me
some advance notice.

846
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,281
That's not the way
this works.

847
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:45,978
Hey, listen.

848
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,554
Excuse me?

849
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:50,192
Looking for a guy
named Grant Zager?

850
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,818
Is that you?

851
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,823
No. I work for him.
Who are you?

852
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,825
I'm Kara Jones's father.

853
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,327
Apparently, your boss
bought my daughter a car.

854
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,699
I just want to know why.

855
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:02,297
I want
to make you happy.

856
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,030
I really do.

857
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:06,366
Is he home?

858
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,501
Yeah. You can't go
in there.

859
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,235
Is my daughter in there?

860
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,410
Yeah. Tell you what.
Why don't you give me
your phone number

861
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,909
and I'll have Mr. Zager
contact you.

862
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,640
Just keep your hands
away from me.

863
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:18,045
Kara!
Kara, you in there?

864
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,079
This is private
property, okay?

865
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,423
You need to leave now.

866
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,988
I just want to ask the
man a simple question.

867
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,348
You Zager?

868
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,056
I am. Who are you?

869
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,758
Dad, what are you
doing here?

870
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,460
Dad?

871
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:34,262
Peter, it's okay.

872
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:38,997
Why you dressed
like that?

873
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:40,443
What are you-- what
are you doing here?

874
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,668
Dad, he's just a friend.

875
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,170
Why did he buy you
a car?

876
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,836
He didn't.

877
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,880
Then why is his name
on the registration?

878
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,816
Hmm? Does he give you
money, too?

879
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:03,434
Mr. Jones, I'm just trying
to help your daughter

880
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:06,628
cover some of her
expenses, that's all.

881
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,071
You know, just because
you live in a big house

882
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,867
and you make
a lot of money

883
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,138
doesn't mean you can talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

884
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,337
I know exactly
what's going on here!

885
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,069
It's not what you think.

886
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,405
He's giving you
money for sex!

887
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,510
Or am I wrong?

888
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,851
Am I missing
something here, huh?

889
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,147
What's the matter
with you?

890
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:25,478
What? You can't get
a woman your own age?

891
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:28,283
What, are you some
kind of pervert?

892
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:29,646
Don't walk
away from me, pal!

893
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:31,654
This is not some hooker
you pick up in a bar!

894
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,486
This is my little girl!

895
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,092
She is not
your little girl.

896
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,556
She is a grown-up,
all right?

897
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,825
And she is beautiful.

898
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:44,874
Dad!

899
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,299
Grant:
You son of a bitch!

900
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,435
Get the hell
out of here now!

901
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,370
Kara, come on!
Get in the car!

902
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,535
I'm staying here.

903
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,854
I am 21 years old, okay?

904
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,577
I can choose who I want
to spend my time with.

905
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,453
There's nothing wrong
with what I'm doing here.

906
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,921
You love this guy, huh?

907
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,121
Then it's about
the money.

908
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,193
And where I come from,
that's wrong.

909
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,291
You don't understand
what's going on here, Dad.

910
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,363
He's been really good to me.

911
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,562
He's the most generous man
I've ever met.

912
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,668
Dad, I didn't mean it
like that.

913
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,697
Dad, I'm sorry.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry!

914
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,743
That guy
is a piece of crap!

915
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,968
I'm just trying to get
through school, Dad.

916
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,113
What does that make you?

917
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,337
Huh? What does that
make you?

918
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,942
I'm just trying
to pay for school.

919
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,213
Dad, I'm sorry.

920
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,279
Dad, please forgive me.

921
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,522
Come home
when you smarten up!

922
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:34,918
Dad!

923
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,289
Are you okay?

924
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,762
No, I am not okay.

925
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,901
How did he get a hold
of the car registration?

926
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,098
He's fixing it.

927
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:49,899
What do you mean,
he's fixing it?

928
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,171
It's a brand-new car.

929
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:54,599
I sort of
got into an accident.

930
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,465
Unbelievable.

931
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,374
Look, I'm sorry.

932
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,376
I wasn't thinking clearly.

933
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:03,048
It's what happens when somebody
asks me to strangle them.

934
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:06,047
What did you think
this was going to be,

935
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,250
a love affair?

936
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,052
You know what? This
really isn't working,

937
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:14,715
and I think it's best
that we don't see each
other anymore.

938
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:15,955
Grant! Hey.

939
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,590
Peter will give you
a lift home.

940
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,825
He'll come and pick up
the car tomorrow.

941
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,072
Wait.

942
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,469
What about the check?

943
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,636
For my family?

944
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,664
Goodbye.

945
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,840
Hi, Dad.

946
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,322
VW's ready.
Keys are in it.

947
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,988
Thanks.

948
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:19,257
Dad, I just did what
I thought I had to do

949
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,487
to get into law school.

950
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:24,631
I just wanted to keep
making you proud.

951
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:28,429
Do you think
it makes me proud

952
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,202
that you prostitute
yourself?

953
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,201
He was going to pay off
your medical debt.

954
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:36,344
$100,000.

955
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,740
I don't want his money.

956
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:39,582
I raised you
better than that.

957
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:45,752
I'm so sorry.

958
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:52,350
Well, I've gotta take
Grant's car back to him, so...

959
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,027
Well, let me get
the door for you.

960
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,862
No, Dad!

961
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,774
There you go.

962
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,210
Hi, Kara.

963
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:13,879
You wanted to see me?

964
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,148
Yes, come on in.

965
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,879
Why don't you have a seat?

966
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,245
Okay.

967
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:24,724
Well, I just heard

968
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:27,262
that the shelter
changed their mind.

969
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,358
They're not gonna
offer you the internship.

970
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,860
Why?

971
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,131
I don't know.

972
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,499
Just that
they made a mistake.

973
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,428
I'm so sorry.

974
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,843
Barry's voice:
That guy is a piece of crap!

975
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,270
What does that
make you, huh?

976
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,605
What does that make you?

977
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,111
Stop, stop, stop!

978
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,047
What did you think
this was going to be,

979
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,151
a love affair?

980
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,150
Hey, what's wrong?

981
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,156
Everything.

982
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:03,488
He dumped you, didn't he?

983
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:06,364
Yep. My Dad showed up.

984
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,804
Made a big scene.

985
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,969
Told you, these guys
don't like drama.

986
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,698
Yeah, well,
now I'm screwed.

987
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,644
He took away the car.

988
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,270
Put a stop payment
on my last check.

989
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:20,175
Dorm fees are due
in like two days.

990
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:22,277
I spent all my money
on fall tuition.

991
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,849
I'm totally broke.

992
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:25,678
So call your parents.

993
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:28,253
I can't. My parents
are broke, too.

994
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,092
And, besides,
they want to disown me.

995
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,788
Justin hates me.

996
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,532
I don't know what to do.

997
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,087
Then you have
to go back to Grant.

998
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,895
You have him on your side,
you don't need anybody else.

999
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,298
He doesn't want
to see me again.

1000
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,730
Yes, he does.

1001
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,765
He's a lonely old man
with a drawer full of Viagra.

1002
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,941
If there's one thing I've
learned from all of this,

1003
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:51,009
is that these guys
like to feel needed.

1004
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:55,038
So just dry
your pretty little eyes.

1005
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:56,645
Better yet, don't.

1006
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,347
Go tell him
how much you need him.

1007
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,757
Kara? Hi.

1008
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,095
Hi.

1009
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,830
How do they look?

1010
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:19,965
I thought you were
gonna pawn them.

1011
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,410
I am. Just figured
I'd wear them first.

1012
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:26,337
You know, maybe
score myself another
daddy with them.

1013
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,507
Speak of the devil.

1014
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,802
Give me a sec,
will you?

1015
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:53,597
Missed you.

1016
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:56,674
Really?

1017
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,914
Did you miss me?

1018
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,281
Grant, please give me
another chance.

1019
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,922
We had a deal, and I
should have honored it.

1020
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,518
I promise I'll be
where you want me to be

1021
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:12,752
when you want me to be.

1022
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,916
And my father,
he'll never bother us.

1023
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:18,125
I can have any woman
in this room.

1024
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,963
I don't need
your problems.

1025
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:24,796
Let me show you I can be
what you want me to be.

1026
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,938
Okay.

1027
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,405
Have your friend
over there

1028
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,983
come back with you
to my house.

1029
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,851
And we'll see
if you really mean that.

1030
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:59,071
Leah: Oh, my God!

1031
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,099
This house!

1032
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,893
Oh, your house
is amazing.

1033
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,891
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable?

1034
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,962
Have a drink.

1035
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:27,131
And I'll meet you
upstairs in the bedroom.

1036
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:28,461
Okay.

1037
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,812
I can't do this.

1038
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:43,051
Yes, you can.

1039
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,307
Look, take this.

1040
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:53,889
Trust me, it'll help.

1041
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,691
If you don't do this,

1042
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:58,133
he'll just find
someone else who will.

1043
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,428
So do me a favor

1044
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,571
and don't spoil this
for the both of us.

1045
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,697
You're not the only one
who needs the money.

1046
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,777
Come here.

1047
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,276
Kiss her.

1048
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:33,985
Come on.

1049
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,331
Kara? Kara?

1050
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,530
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1051
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,603
Forget about her.

1052
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,301
I'll do anything
you want.

1053
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,437
( coughs )

1054
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,045
Yeah, like that.

1055
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,419
You're a bad boy,
aren't you?

1056
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:09,355
Oh, yeah.

1057
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,030
Oh, yeah!
Come on! Harder!

1058
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:23,066
Let's see
if I get my money's worth.

1059
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,381
Yeah, hmm?

1060
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:30,107
Is that what you want?

1061
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:33,054
( gagging and coughing )

1062
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,250
( vomiting )

1063
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,877
Okay, how was that?

1064
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:03,177
It's all right, huh?

1065
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,748
What's the matter?

1066
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,221
Come on.

1067
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,949
Leah!

1068
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,624
Oh, my God!

1069
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,564
Oh, God!

1070
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,639
Leah, come on, let's go.

1071
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,242
Leah, come on.

1072
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,883
Hey, Leah? Leah?

1073
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:38,509
Leah? Leah?

1074
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,975
Oh, my God!

1075
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,724
Grant! Grant! Grant!

1076
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,520
Grant!

1077
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:48,092
Grant! Grant!

1078
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,789
Grant! Oh, my God,
Grant, it's Leah!

1079
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,996
I know, I know.
She's drunk.

1080
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,198
No, she's not drunk!

1081
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,370
She's very, very drunk.

1082
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,567
No, she's dead!

1083
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:00,099
- No, no!
- Yes, she's dead!

1084
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,403
No! No! She's...

1085
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,181
Look at her!
She's not moving!

1086
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,682
I don't understand.
She was just here.

1087
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:12,852
Well, of course
she was here.

1088
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,180
Who moved her?
What do you--

1089
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,924
Listen to me!
She didn't feel well.

1090
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:17,149
- No, no.
- She drank too much.

1091
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,324
She was
just right there!

1092
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:20,863
Peter got her a cab.

1093
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,858
He didn't want her
getting sick in the car.

1094
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,693
But I don't understand.

1095
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,996
She was just here.
I saw her.

1096
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:28,697
Are you on something, Kara?

1097
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,729
'Cause that's what drugs do.

1098
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,173
They distort the mind.

1099
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,298
This is why
I don't take 'em.

1100
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:33,772
But I swear
she was just there.

1101
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,800
- Kara, listen.
- You're not listening.

1102
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:37,666
Okay, I think
you should take a rest.

1103
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,514
You need to lie down.
We'll go downstairs--

1104
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:40,979
- I'm going home.
- Kara, stay--

1105
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:41,978
I wanna go home.

1106
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,349
Kara:
No, I'm leaving!

1107
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:44,807
I don't wanna be
anywhere near you
anymore!

1108
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:46,445
- Kara!
- Let me go!

1109
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,320
I'm going home!

1110
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,390
Where's the car?

1111
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,659
Peter takes it home
with him every night.

1112
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,729
Are you sure you can drive?

1113
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:00,098
I'm fine.

1114
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:01,197
Kara!

1115
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,509
( cell phone rings )

1116
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:16,612
( ringing )

1117
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,653
It's all under control.

1118
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:20,119
What am I gonna do
about Kara?

1119
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,677
Just do
what you always do.

1120
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:22,815
Give her what she wants

1121
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,149
and she'll
forget about it.

1122
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,732
Aah!

1123
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,138
Hey. Have you seen
my tennis shoes?

1124
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:52,406
I wanna go to the gym
before I crash out.

1125
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,420
What's wrong with you?

1126
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,050
Have you seen Leah?

1127
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:03,116
No. Why? Do you think
she finally hooked up?

1128
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:07,156
She did,
with me and Grant.

1129
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:09,974
Ooh! I take it
you made up with him.

1130
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,727
This isn't a joke,
Shawna.

1131
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:14,465
Okay. Well,
it was just one night.

1132
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,741
Just forget about it.

1133
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,410
I can't. It was awful.

1134
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:20,378
Leah, she gave me
this stuff,

1135
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,777
you know, to get me
through it.

1136
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,779
I got really sick, so
I went to the bathroom.

1137
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:28,721
And when I came out,
Leah was...

1138
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,189
What?

1139
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:32,587
I think she was dead.

1140
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,519
What are you talking about?

1141
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,985
I don't know. I just
kept shaking her,

1142
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,555
but she didn't move.

1143
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:40,803
Well, did you call 911?

1144
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,257
I mean, she probably
overdosed or something.

1145
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,625
No, I didn't,

1146
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,803
'cause when I finally
found Grant, she was gone.

1147
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:48,142
He said he sent
her home in a cab.

1148
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,968
God, Kara, don't
mess with me like that.

1149
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:53,475
Look, I'm not
messing with you.

1150
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:54,637
I saw her.

1151
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,684
You were on drugs?

1152
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,850
Do you know what that stuff
does to your head?

1153
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,980
I talked
to her roommate.

1154
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,984
She said
she never came home.

1155
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,186
Leah does this kind
of stuff all the time.

1156
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,488
She goes on benders

1157
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,860
and just comes back
whenever she feels like it.

1158
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:11,189
Trust me, she'll call you
back by the end of the day.

1159
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,634
She's fine.

1160
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,467
What the hell
are you doing?

1161
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,111
I'm sorry.

1162
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,254
It's okay.

1163
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,094
Forget about her.

1164
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,660
I'll do anything
you want.

1165
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:44,958
You're a bad boy,
aren't you?

1166
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:46,591
Aah! ( choking )

1167
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,003
What's the matter?
Leah? Leah?

1168
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,867
Leah!

1169
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:59,113
Oh, God!

1170
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:06,381
( cell phone rings )

1171
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:09,623
( ringing )

1172
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,819
( ringing )

1173
01:08:12,823 --> 01:08:16,693
Come on, come on, pick up.

1174
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,793
( ringing )

1175
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,297
Aah!

1176
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,781
Hey, I brought you
some coffee.

1177
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:44,254
Thanks.

1178
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:47,394
There's some dinner
inside if you're hungry.

1179
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,056
Barry, she's still
our daughter,

1180
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:56,403
and she needs you.

1181
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,431
Kara?

1182
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,398
Hi.

1183
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:28,727
Hi.

1184
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,702
What are you doing here?

1185
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:34,501
Grant says you haven't
been returning his calls.

1186
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,274
Just been really busy.

1187
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,510
How is that
your business?

1188
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,910
Well, It's my business
'cause I look out for him.

1189
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:44,453
You know that.

1190
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,352
He's waiting for you
in the car.

1191
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,191
He's got something for you.

1192
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:53,861
Come on.

1193
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,635
You are a hard girl
to get hold of.

1194
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,646
When I make a promise...

1195
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,024
I keep it.

1196
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,729
Leah: How do they look?

1197
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,361
Grant:
Peter got her a cab!

1198
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:39,166
He didn't want her
getting sick in the car.

1199
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,114
Grant, I can't
accept this.

1200
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,537
I'm sorry.

1201
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,837
Okay.

1202
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,324
I have a class
I have to get to.

1203
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:00,921
I promise I'll call you.

1204
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,438
She knows. She knows.

1205
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,705
Why'd you let her go?

1206
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:24,883
What the hell
am I supposed to do,

1207
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,011
keep her as a hostage?

1208
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:30,816
I didn't mean
to kill that girl.

1209
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,390
I am not gonna lose

1210
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,859
everything I have
worked for all my life

1211
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,789
because of
a couple of dumb coeds!

1212
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,125
I'll take care of it.

1213
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,000
How? What are you
gonna do?

1214
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:44,498
Look, I'm a part
of this thing now, too.

1215
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:46,001
No, absolutely not.

1216
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,572
She's gonna go to the cops.

1217
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,800
Can you do the time?

1218
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,195
'Cause I've done
my fair share,

1219
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,566
and I'm not going back.

1220
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:54,314
And I sure the hell
ain't gonna let you do it.

1221
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,311
I was messed up.

1222
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,512
I was this close
to being dead.

1223
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,983
You came back for me.
You saved my ass.

1224
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:00,082
I don't forget that.

1225
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,223
No, we're gonna pretend

1226
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:02,817
that this conversation
never happened.

1227
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,149
Let me handle it.

1228
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,302
She didn't go home
in a cab.

1229
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,528
What are you
talking about?

1230
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,503
Leah. Grant said
she went home in a cab,

1231
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,771
but she didn't.

1232
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,439
How do you know that?

1233
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,165
I found this in Grant's car.

1234
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:26,465
I gave them to Leah,

1235
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:28,536
and she was still wearing
them when I found her.

1236
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:30,175
That doesn't mean
anything.

1237
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,210
Of course it does.
It means that he lied.

1238
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:35,515
So what? So she went home
in his car. Who cares?

1239
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,318
Leah is missing.

1240
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,120
I swear, if she doesn't
come tonight,

1241
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:40,392
I'm going to the police.

1242
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,520
Don't be such
a drama queen, all right?

1243
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,956
You could blow this
for all of us.

1244
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,161
The last thing
these guys want

1245
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:47,562
is anybody getting
into their business.

1246
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,764
My God, Kara,
you don't seriously think

1247
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:51,726
that Grant did
something to her, do you?

1248
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:16,857
( beeps )

1249
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,099
( beeps )

1250
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,241
GPS on.

1251
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,841
( cell phone rings )

1252
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,844
( ringing )

1253
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,776
( ringing )

1254
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:13,982
Hey, Dad.

1255
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:18,453
Yeah. You turned on
your GPS.

1256
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,285
Was that a mistake?

1257
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,820
No, no.
It wasn't a mistake.

1258
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,530
Dad, you still there?

1259
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,030
Yeah.

1260
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:31,932
Look, I just want you
to know that--( gasp )

1261
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,495
What?

1262
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,044
Kara, what--

1263
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,610
Kara?

1264
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:42,178
Hey, what's going on?

1265
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:43,878
I don't know.

1266
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,310
Something's wrong.

1267
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,445
What?

1268
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:48,719
I'm gonna find out.

1269
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:49,978
Do you want me
to come along?

1270
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,846
No. Stay here in case
she comes home.

1271
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,538
( cell phone rings )

1272
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,638
I'll call you
when it's done.

1273
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,430
( muffled cries ) Help!

1274
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,846
Uh!

1275
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,537
( cocks gun )

1276
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,940
( gasps )

1277
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,045
Kara!

1278
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:11,315
What are you gonna do?

1279
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,590
Oh, it's not what
I'm gonna do to you.

1280
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,189
It's what
you're gonna do.

1281
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,031
Tie your arm off
with it.

1282
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,557
Tie it off!

1283
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:22,162
No one would ever believe
I would do this.

1284
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:25,195
Really? Remember
all the drugs you did
the other night?

1285
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,131
They're still
in your system.

1286
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:29,436
That's gonna tell
a different story,
isn't it?

1287
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,239
Now do it.

1288
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,970
'Cause
if I have to do it,

1289
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:35,605
I'm gonna hurt you
a hell of a lot worse.

1290
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:38,951
Tie yourself off!

1291
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:41,078
Please, please.

1292
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,156
Please, no.

1293
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:06,967
- Please?
- Do it!

1294
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,473
Kara?

1295
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,817
No!

1296
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,111
( crying )

1297
01:20:12,108 --> 01:20:15,578
It's okay, sweetie.
Let's get out of here.

1298
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:17,178
( cell phone rings )

1299
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,310
( ringing )

1300
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,284
Leave it alone!

1301
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:22,252
( ringin continues )

1302
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:31,492
Hey, what the hell's
going on, huh?

1303
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,664
You said you were
gonna call me.

1304
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:36,133
You said this was
gonna be done already.

1305
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,872
Did you--

1306
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:41,297
Is she... Peter?

1307
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:46,208
I think Peter
broke your arrangement.

1308
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,080
Oh, my God.

1309
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,263
Get the plane ready.
I'm on my way.

1310
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,402
Yes, Grant Zager,
that's right.

1311
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,865
He has a plane at
the West Side Airport.

1312
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:18,844
Man on phone:
Yes, ma'am.

1313
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,147
I need this plane off
the ground in five minutes.

1314
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,592
Mr. Zager?

1315
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,116
We need to ask you
a few questions.

1316
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,595
( siren,
police radio dispatch )

1317
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,067
( siren peals )

1318
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,952
Hey, Dad.

1319
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:39,945
Hey, sweetie.

1320
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:40,886
Need some help?

1321
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:45,530
All I can get.
Got a 3/8?

1322
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:46,688
3/8.

1323
01:22:46,696 --> 01:22:47,696
Thanks.

1324
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,404
That should do it.

1325
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,706
You feel like
taking a ride?

1326
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,989
Kara: I learned a lot
in my last year of college.

1327
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:14,718
No matter how badly
you want something

1328
01:23:14,724 --> 01:23:16,564
or how ambitious you are,

1329
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:21,829
there are some things
that just aren't worth it.

1330
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:23,061
My teacher would call it

1331
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:26,525
the underlying morality
of the law.

1332
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:29,435
Me? I call it
selling your soul.

1333
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:31,368
Because when
something makes you feel

1334
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:33,044
that empty inside,

1335
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:36,482
you might as well be dead.

1336
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,349
And everything you had hoped
to gain is worthless.

1337
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,849
If anyone ever tells you

1338
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:45,051
that you don't have to work
hard to get what you want,

1339
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:47,324
well, they're lying.

1340
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:52,593
Because dreams need
to be chased and fought for.

1341
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:57,095
And easy money,
it's never just that.
