335
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:02,129
and Labor Day Amos
had gone out on strike.

336
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:04,431
Amos and elves:
Silent night, holy night!

337
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,834
We will not give up the fight...

338
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,268
<i>Woman: Liberte!</i>

339
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,871
Stop all your shouting.
Stop all the noise.

340
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,241
There's no one I trust
to deliver these toys.

341
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:18,078
Delivery. Lincoln,
here's your hot pastrami.

342
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,847
Washington gets cold salami.

343
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:21,382
Columbus asked for rigatoni.

344
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,783
St. Pat ordered
fried bologna.

345
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:26,053
Piece of fish, sirloin steak,
meat knish, carrot cake.

346
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,655
And April Fool...
I don't know why...

347
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,890
Ordered compact discs on rye.

348
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,958
Yum!

349
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:34,061
[Loud crunching]

350
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,598
- What?
- You're the one!

351
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,066
I'm the what one?

352
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,801
You are the one
to deliver the toys

353
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:43,771
to 200 countries,
to good girls and boys.

354
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,006
Just put on this red suit
and get in the sleigh.

355
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,342
What are you, cuckoo?
Forget it. No way.

356
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:49,410
Please.

357
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,477
- No.
- Please?

358
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:51,478
- No!
- Please?

359
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:52,246
- No...
- Please...

360
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,915
Narrator: And so for an hour,
these two kept on going,

361
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,185
with one of them please-ing
and one of them no-ing.

362
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,319
- Please?
- No.

363
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,487
Please?

364
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:03,190
No! Why in the world should
I schlep through the snow,

365
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,926
bringing millions of presents
to kids I don't know?

366
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,028
Will anyone pay me?
Will anyone tip?

367
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,763
What if I slip
and fracture my hip?

368
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,332
Look at the weather.
It's cold and it's shivery.

369
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:15,436
There's no way on earth
I will make this delivery.

370
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,004
[Door shuts]

371
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,972
Bummer.

372
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,210
Narrator: Murray spent each
Christmas Eve on his own,

373
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:26,981
remembering days when he
wasn't alone.

374
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,916
_

375
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,113
_

376
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,390
You dated her?

377
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,425
Get out of my deli.
Get off of my land.

378
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:41,662
What part of "no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no"

379
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:42,763
don't you understand?

380
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,765
I'll tell you the reason
you shouldn't say no.

381
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,601
I just need one minute,
and then I will go.

382
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:49,937
- One minute?
- 60 seconds.

383
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:50,838
[Ticking]

384
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:51,939
So what's the reason?

385
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:55,643
Because it's Christmas.
Lights, please.

386
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:57,578
[Lamp switch clicks]

387
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,647
Christmas, you know,
is that one special season

388
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:02,550
when people do good things
without a good reason.

389
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,919
The grouchiest men
will wear musical ties

390
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:08,355
and buy Christmas presents
for folks they despise.

391
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:12,026
The cheapest of cheapskates
will spend all his money,

392
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,628
and people make fruitcakes
from concrete...

393
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:15,563
And honey.

394
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,065
Tonight think of others
instead of yourself.

395
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,899
[Ding]

396
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:23,170
Your minute is up,
Mr. Edison Elf.

397
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,207
_

398
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,280
Libby, mistletoe!

399
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:34,782
[Chuckles]

400
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,317
- Ooh!
- Murray!

401
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:38,052
Ha ha. It's ok.

402
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,854
Merry Christmas, Murray.

403
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,660
- I'll do it.
- Oh, Murray!

404
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:49,697
No hugs, no hugs,
no hugs, no hugs.

405
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,832
Narrator: Murray put on
the suit.

406
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:55,135
The belly was baggy.
The shoulders were saggy.

407
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:56,403
The bottom was draggy.

408
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,939
I'm pretty fat,
but I think Santa's fatter.

409
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:00,441
The caboose is quite loose,

410
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,576
but I guess it won't matter.

411
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:05,346
[Cheering and applause]

412
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:07,848
Columbus:
<i>Bravissimo</i>, Murray!

413
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,083
I wish you good luck.

414
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:10,784
Cupid: I love what
you're doing.

415
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,486
April Fool:
My zipper is stuck.

416
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,888
Narrator: They hopped in the sleigh
and sped off like a comet.

417
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:17,257
Murray: What are you doing?
I'm going to vomit.

418
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,627
I've got one rule,
but, surely, it's basic.

419
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,696
If you go too fast,
I'm gonna get sleigh-sick.

420
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:23,797
Why don't you drive?

421
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,201
On, Dumbo and Jumbo.
On, Mason and Dixon.

422
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:30,137
On, Cosmo and Kramer
and Richard M. Nixon.

423
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,773
That wasn't even close.

424
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,581
Narrator: They made their first stop,
Eddie fearing the worst.

425
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,984
Murray fell down the chimney
and landed head-first.

426
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,520
Ow! Oof.

427
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:50,190
Not terrible. A little dry.

428
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:52,593
Eggnog, huh?
I never had it.

429
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:56,296
Blecch! So that's why
they only drink it once a year.

430
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,500
Narrator: He didn't come back
till a quarter to 2:00.

431
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,869
Murray! I worried.
What happened to you?

432
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,304
Down by the fireplace,
kids hung up socks.

433
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,474
So I loaded the socks up
with bagels and lox.

434
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,308
Presents.

435
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,177
You're supposed
to bring presents.

436
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,679
Kids don't love lox?

437
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:13,213
Narrator: They went
to the next house.

438
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,448
It didn't go better.

439
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,717
Murray got bit by
a big Irish setter.

440
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:17,451
[Growling]

441

[Echoing]
Aah!

443
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,260
Narrator: He stepped on
a turtle at house number 3.

444
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,261
[Crunch]

445
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:31,231
In house number 4,
he knocked over the tree.

446
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:33,000
[Crashing]

447
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,735
What was that noise?

448
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,437
- Mice.
- Oh.

449
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:37,604
Wait. Who said that?

450
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,139
[Voice in higher pitch]
Cat.

451
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:43,310
Oh. Betty Fred,
get my gun.

452
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,978
[Gun is loaded]

453
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:45,913
[Fires gun]

454
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,716
I've been bit by a dog
and shot by a gun.

455
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:51,385
I must tell you, shorty,
I'm not having fun.

456
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,254
I'm old and I'm cold,
and this suit doesn't fit.

457
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,990
If the next stop goes badly,
I'll just have to quit.

458
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,093
Narrator: Edison Elf
couldn't blame him.

459
00:21:59,128 --> 00:21:59,793
He tried.

460
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,261
I have faith in you, Murray.

461
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:04,164
Narrator:
The little elf lied.

462
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:10,604
Murray jumped down the chimney
and landed so hard...

463
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,580
The thud knocked the snow
off the trees in the yard.

464
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:15,338
- He got to his feet with a...
- Oof.

465
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,405
- And an...
- Oy.

466
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:19,413
And he found himself facing
a 6-year-old boy.

467
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:22,282
Santa Claus!
Santa Claus! Santa Claus!

468
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,718
Where? Oh, right.
You mean me.

469
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes, I'm Santa, I swear.

470
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:27,888
Do your Santa Claus laugh.

471
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,323
Please, please, please, please?

472
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:32,659
Huh? Sure. Heh heh.
Tee hee.

473
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:34,962
Hoo. Ha. Oh, boy.

474
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,531
Narrator: Murray snorted and snickered
and chortled and chuckled.

475
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,134
And as he chuckled,
his belt came unbuckled.

476
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,736
His pants, which were loose,
fell down straight to his knees.

477
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:46,039
"Murray Weiner" was stitched
on his silk BVDs.

478
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,374
Well, I'm going to jail.

479
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,577
Santa Claus, please.
Would you kindly explain

480
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:54,214
why you and your underpants
have different names?

481
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,382
Narrator:
Betrayed by his boxers,

482
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,152
let down by his pants,
he knew a good story

483
00:22:58,187 --> 00:22:59,586
would be his best chance.

484
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,989
Don't you know Murray Weiner is
a famous designer?

485
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,792
Calvin Klein may be fine,
but Weiner is finer.

486
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:06,360
Are you sure you're Santa?

487
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:07,995
You don't have a beard.

488
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,464
Your suit is all baggy.
You smell kind of weird.

489
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,467
I shaved off the beard.
Mrs. Claus said it tickles.

490
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:16,069
And I went on a diet...
Club soda and pickles.

491
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,739
That should explain why
I'm beardless and bellyless.

492
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,441
The pickles would also
account for my smelliness.

493
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:24,444
So there, I've explained.
I've made everything clear.

494
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,113
Murray: Now,
I should be going.

495
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:27,614
Wait. Name your reindeer.

496
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,484
Narrator: Murray hemmed and he hawed.
He did not know this stuff.

497
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,353
So he huffed and he puffed
and proceeded to bluff.

498
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:36,089
There's Bambi and Rambo
and Dopey and Doc,

499
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,158
Scotty and Sulu,
Uhura and Spock.

500
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:39,827
Murray looked at him hopefully.

501
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,794
How did I do?

502
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,098
You're a big phony fake!
I guess Santa is, too.

503
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:46,366
[Sobbing]

504
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:47,267
[Sniffles]

505
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,102
Santa's not phony.
I've got the proof.

[Crunch] Stop!

845
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:47,228
Statue of Liberty, Edison Elf.

846
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:49,564
The two of you saved
myself from myself.

847
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,666
Statue of Liberty:
Oh, pleased to meet you.

848
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:52,500
Big fan.

849
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,102
Now, who wants to go
on a sleigh ride?

850
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:57,505
- Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

851
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,908
Murray: On, Lipstick and Dipstick.
On, Pixie and Dixie.

852
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:04,412
On, Kramden and Norton
and Alice and Trixie.

853
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:07,648
Narrator: And I heard him exclaim
as he rode out of sight...

854
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:12,720
Murray: Murray Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

855
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,743
Narrator: And as Murray Weiner
sailed off in the sky,

856
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:23,013
the people of Stinky Cigars
waved good-bye.

857
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,183
- <i>Au revoir, mon cheri.</i>
- Don't be a stranger!

858
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,852
- <i>Grazie</i>, Murray.
- Thank you, Lone Ranger.

859
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,288
Narrator: Edison Elf would
go on to get work,

860
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:33,924
selling his stuff on
the Elf Shopping Network.

861
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:37,160
<i>Edison on TV: My latest
invention gives diapers a voice.</i>

862
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:40,130
<i>It tells you it's wet
with the song of your choice.</i>

863
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:44,334
<i>Recording: ♪ Should auld
acquaintance be forgot... ♪</i>

864
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:47,170
<i>That is amazing!</i>

865
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,739
[Hums]

866
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:52,542
Narrator: And Murray would
start every day with a smile.

867
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,178
He became a new man.
Well, at least for a while.

868
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:57,914
We'd like to split
a pastrami sandwich.

869
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,883
- With mayonnaise.
- On white bread.

870
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,218
Lincoln: And could you
cut the crusts off?

871
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:04,187
Washington: And we get
the senior citizen discount.

872
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:05,822
Lincoln: I have a coupon.

873
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:08,158
Get out!

874
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:10,493
[Chuckles]
Murray.

875
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:11,761
[Hums]

876
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,331
And so ends our story.
That's all that you get.

877
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:15,966
<i>Recording: ♪ Should auld
acquaintance be forgot... ♪</i>

878
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:18,535
I'd love to say more,
but my diaper's wet.

879
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,902
Happy New Year, y'all.
