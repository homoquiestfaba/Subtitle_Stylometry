00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,895
[woman speaking in Spanish]

2
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,948
[siren blaring]

3
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,700
[screaming]

4
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,870
[gunshot]

5
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,543
[greeting]

6
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,264
[talks in Russian]

7
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,282
Now, Senator Friedman, you have been a harsh critic...

8
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,160
of the President in recent months
over his treatment of Russia.

9
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,997
Russia is back. Their president
has stated unequivocally...

10
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,458
their desire to knock us back to 1985.

11
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,794
They've reignited their nuclear program.

12
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,130
Just Iast week they dropped three Akula
class subs in the Bering Sea.

13
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,800
Our myopia over the Middle East...

14
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,845
has caused us to miss the big bear that's
just sitting in the middle of the room.

15
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,308
Now, Senator Darden, you have numerous
business interests inside Russia.

16
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,811
Do you share Senator Friedman's fears here?

17
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,814
My interests, as you call them, in Russia...

18
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,817
are strictly as a trade partner for
the good people of my state.

19
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,987
All this saber rattling is basically
Senator Friedman's attempt...

20
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,489
to get his budget up for next year.

21
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,325
Oh, Please. Russia now has ten times
the number of covert agents...

22
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,995
within United States borders as
it did during the Cold War.

23
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,665
What are we talking about? Besides,
wouldn't it be wise for you...

24
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,043
to divest your interest of what you
have in Russia at a time like this?

25
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,338
I am very transparent about all
of my financial transactions...

26
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,009
which is why, you know, that I
did those things. Excuse me.

27
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,887
The President would suggest that fear
is not helpful right now, Senator...

28
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,725
that fear is obviously a very big component
of any politician's toolbox...

29
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,061
but that it is not going to help toward progress.

30
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,397
Leaving.

31
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,732
Thank God.

32
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,529
[telephone rings]

33
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,364
(Darden) Hello?

34
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,575
(man) You haven't accessed the money.

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,869
Yeah, well, it's been a little warm around here.

36
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,079
We had a deal, Senator. We have expectations.

37
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,374
I don't give a good goddamn about your expectations.

38
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,917
Don't call here again.

39
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,711
[phone off the hook]

40
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,212
Bastard's making a deal.

41
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,547
Yeah, or blowing one off.

42
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,549
Where does that Ieave us?

43
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,218
Darden just made contact. It
Iooks Iike he's moving now.

44
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,179
[elevator bell]

45
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,906
Oh shit! He's down! He's down! Behind the building!

46
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,580
[sirens blaring]

47
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,626
(Barton) This is a domestic case!

48
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,128
You have no jurisdiction, authority, or right to be here.

49
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,255
We've been trailing this guy for the past month.

50
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,758
This is a crime scene, not a goddamn terrorist attack!

51
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,301
You're going to have to wait.

52
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,929
Yeah? What am I supposed to wait for?

53
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,263
[horn honking]

54
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,599
For him.

55
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,351
[mixed voices]

56
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,230
There you go, sir.

57
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,285
Director Highland. Sir, why is the CIA--

58
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,250
This is Agent Weaver. Yes, sir.

59
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,836
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,630
We're out!

61
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,799
Who the hell was that?

62
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,052
Director Bell. He wants us out.
No questions and not a word.

63
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,973
You guys were on the stakeout?

64
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,476
Yes, sir. He's had contact with Moscow
off and on for a month now.

65
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,186
But he never went any further--

66
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,313
We know that. What happened here tonight?

67
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,983
Someone grabbed him from behind.
Right in our blind spot.

68
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,277
It all happened so goddamned fast.

69
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,714
(man) Keep your eye on it!

70
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,011
[cheering]

71
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,020
Excuse me? Do you know the time?

72
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,356
No, no. I don't have a watch. Sorry.

73
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,359
It's okay. Just, my husband said he'd be here by nine.

74
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,819
Oh.

75
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,406
Which boy is yours?

76
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,409
Decker, the second baseman.

77
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,037
Oh, yeah. He's good.

78
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,705
Got a strong arm.

79
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,208
[chuckles] I'm Molly.

80
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,710
Paul. Hey.

81
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,378
Which one's yours?

82
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,922
(coach) One more, guys!

83
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,050
Oh, no, I don't, I don't have--

84
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,220
No, I Iive nearby here.

85
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,056
I come by just to see a game once in a while.

86
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,851
That's really nice.

87
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,065
[dog barks]

88
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,207
Not a care in the world, huh?

89
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,752
Jeez!

90
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,093
I never thought I'd see the day when someone
got the drop on Paul Shepherdson.

91
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,428
Yeah, yeah. How did you get in here?

92
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,097
It's what we do.

93
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,391
The phone rings, too, you know.

94
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,981
It's Cassius.

95
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,026
He's back.

96
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,656
Tom.

97
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,575
Cassius is Iong gone.

98
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,620
He hasn't even been heard from in over 20 years.

99
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,123
Tell that to Senator Darden.

100
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,625
He's Iying in an alley with his throat slit.

101
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,836
Then it's a copycat.

102
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,922
That's what everyone is saying. Well, almost everyone.

103
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:59,014
Tom, there was a point where I knew
this man better than myself.

104
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,309
Cassius is dead.

105
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,686
For once, Paul, I think you're wrong.

106
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,442
[mixed voices]

107
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,953
(agent) Welcome back, sir.

108
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,968
Gentlemen.

109
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,388
Paul, this is Director Roger Bell.

110
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,848
Mr. Shepherdson.

111
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,516
The FBI?

112
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,518
Bureaucracy has changed, my friend.

113
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,687
We have to share the burden now.

114
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,522
As you know, Paul was responsible...

115
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,524
for tracking down the Cassius Seven...

116
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,568
The Soviet assassins we code-named...

117
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,237
for the Roman senators who killed Julius Caesar.

118
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,032
And you caught them all but one,
from what I understand.

119
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,242
Missed Cassius himself?

120
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,536
That's right.

121
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,206
But this is not his work. I'm sure of it.

122
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,541
Oh, I think it is.

123
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,418
Who the hell is this?

124
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,213
This is one of my men. Agent Ben Geary.

125
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,257
Probably knows more about your
assassin than anyone we've got.

126
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,927
Or the CIA, for that matter.

127
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,555
Paul, we'd like the two of you to work together.

128
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,433
Is that so? So tell me, Geary...

129
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,269
what were you doing when the wall came down?

130
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,563
I was watching it on television.

131
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,233
Just Iike everyone else in this room.

132
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,735
[laughter]

133
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,862
Could you pull up the case file, please?

134
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,742
Okay, here is good. Notice how the cut starts...

135
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,245
right in the center of the throat, moving upwards.

136
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,914
Typically, a cut starts high, moves lateral...

137
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,750
as the right-handed killer pulls
the knife from ear to ear.

138
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,586
Not Cassius. His cuts were always exactly the same.

139
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,257
Right-handed, but up, and starting
in the middle of the neck.

140
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,259
I've never been able to figure out why.

141
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,970
Still, it's a copycat.

142
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,431
This guy's the best you've got?

143
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:09,102
Mr. Shepherdson, I wrote my
Master's thesis on Cassius.

144
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,312
And I have tracked down and interviewed...

145
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,441
every one of the few witnesses of
his crimes who are still alive.

146
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,444
I've even re-created and personally
walked the approaches and exits...

147
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,113
of all his known kills step for step. I know this man.

148
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,659
And there is no doubt in my mind.
This is the work of Cassius.

149
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,411
You know him?

150
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,789
Harvard, right?

151
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,667
Yes, that's right.

152
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,296
And you were the son of a foreign attaché in Turkey.

153
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,467
My father worked at embassies all over the world.

154
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,968
How do you know this?

155
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,678
I read your thesis.

156
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,805
You did?

157
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,141
And I know you were trying for months to talk to me.

158
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,686
I'll tell you why I refused. Because you
have never been on the ground.

159
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:56,649
Because you don't know him. And
because you're a Iibrarian.

160
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,693
Mr. Shepherdson.

161
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,988
Let's just say, Geary, that I'm
wrong and you expose him.

162
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,990
What do you think comes next?

163
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,660
You think maybe he's gonna come after you?

164
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,122
That is exactly why I'm here.

165
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,335
[exhales]

166
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,504
I'm going home.

167
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,715
And I'd like to be left alone. All right?

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,967
We've got Brutus.

169
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,846
What?

170
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,350
Igor Ivanovich Kozak, aka Brutus...

171
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,186
is alive and locked up in Brinkerman Penitentiary.

172
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,064
That's impossible. He killed him in Salzburg in 1989.

173
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,192
I shot him in the chest. He fell three stories.

174
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,735
And survived.

175
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,195
Why didn't you tell me?

176
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,905
You wanted to retire, Paul.

177
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,908
I'm afraid retirees Iose certain privileges.

178
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,661
You know what?

179
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,705
I'm done here, Tom.

180
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,962
Get me Highland.

181
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,303
Come on, I know you're there. Get me Highland.

182
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,764
(operator) Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

183
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,309
Director Highland wants you
to know he has a meeting...

184
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,102
with the President tomorrow morning.

185
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,897
He said you'd know what that means.

186
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,843
Good morning. Two regulars, please.

187
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,970
Good morning, sir. Coming right up.

188
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,519
Spooks aren't supposed to be creatures of habit.

189
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,814
It's a Iuxury one can only afford when one is in charge.

190
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,399
Thank you.

191
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,943
(clerk) Thank you very much.

192
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,737
Thanks.

193
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,165
I gave you 20 years, Tom.

194
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,835
You promised me I could have a Iife.

195
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,505
I never cared much for the coffee at The White House.

196
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,883
I think it's got something to do
with the 150-year-old china.

197
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,013
I've been Director through three presidents, Paul.

198
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,849
And Iet's face it. I wouldn't have gotten
the job in the first place...

199
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,435
if you hadn't helped us with the Cassius Seven.

200
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,523
In 15 minutes, the President is gonna tell
me I don't have this job anymore...

201
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,526
if we can't nail the guy that killed Senator Darden.

202
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,486
It's not Cassius, Tom.

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,322
You never caught him.

204
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,121
Because he's dead.

205
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,374
Then prove it.

206
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,341
[talking in French]

207
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,222
[woman speaking in French]

208
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,575
Mr. Shepherdson?

209
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,801
So, Paul Shepherdson.

210
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,137
Been an analyst for the company
here in Paris for three years.

211
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,014
What do you wanna see me about?

212
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,266
The Cassius Seven.

213
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,646
I've had a breakthrough.

214
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,273
I can take them down for you.

215
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,167
(agent) I'll take care of it. Just
give me about 15 minutes.

216
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,877
Oh, hey.

217
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,504
And? And, and, and, and?

218
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,839
I don't know.

219
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,340
Director Bell was there?

220
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,425
Everyone was there.

221
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,220
Jesus! I've been at this place a year Ionger than you...

222
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,014
and I've never even seen the Director in person.

223
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,185
They're gonna put you in the field, man. I'm sure of it.

224
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,354
They haven't said anything, yet.

225
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,232
You were right about this thing the whole time, huh?

226
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,568
[telephone rings]

227
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,195
Agent Geary. Yes, sir.

228
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,114
Yes, sir.

229
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,325
Yes, sir. I'll be there.

230
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,745
And?

231
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,004
I'm in.

232
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,111
This is crazy.

233
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,448
'Cause I have spent so much time
studying your work with Cassius.

234
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,241
I feel Iike I know you.

235
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,785
You don't.

236
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,414
Yeah. No, I just mean I-I, you know,
I put myself in your shoes.

237
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,917
I just tried to think how you would think.

238
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,086
I've all of these crime scene photos.
A lot of them you're in.

239
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,757
Actually, I should probably get you
to sign one of them. Right?

240
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,468
That would definitely be a first.

241
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,971
When you were in Budapest in 91,
did you notice a specific pattern?

242
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,140
No, Agent Geary.

243
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,770
Tell me why-why would a guy...

244
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,606
who writes a thesis on an international spy...

245
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,776
join the Bureau and not Central Intelligence?

246
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,447
Well, I believed that Cassius was hiding in the U.S.

247
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,575
Think about it. What better place
for a Soviet spook to retire?

248
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,997
You believe that enough to base a career on it?

249
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,667
Uh, yeah. You could say that.

250
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,460
Can I ask you something?

251
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:59,131
If that means you'll stop talking, yeah.

252
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,009
Why didn't they tell you about Brutus?

253
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,846
If it was your job to catch the Cassius Seven,
what were they scared you'd do?

254
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,101
Kill him.

255
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,833
What's in the bag?

256
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,209
Motivation.

257
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,670
You think he's gonna talk?

258
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,130
Not to me.

259
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,471
[guard's indistinct talk]

260
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,768
(guard) He's been cleared!

261
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,168
[clears throat]

262
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,884
[talks in Russian]

263
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,053
You speak Russian, huh?

264
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,388
I studied in school. Yes.

265
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,850
Here's some Russian for you.

266
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,109
I've read that you worked with Cassius.

267
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,904
It's a different Iife ago.

268
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,572
Do you know where he's hiding?

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,909
Why would you--

270
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,913
Is Cassius alive?

271
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,373
He killed a Senator.

272
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,712
Who are you?

273
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,305
I understand that you've been Iooking
for one of these for about 10 years.

274
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,891
[violin music playing]

275
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,605
[volume goes up]

276
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,941
Give it to me.

277
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,236
Tell me something that I don't know
about Cassius and it is yours.

278
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,989
A chance to hear the outside world?

279
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,950
Give it to me, you son of a whore!

280
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,285
Tell me something about Cassius. Did he train you?

281
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,954
What does he look like?

282
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,249
[music continues]

283
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,803
[music stops]

284
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,265
I guess you can spend the rest of your Iife in silence.

285
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,935
Guard?

286
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,813
[shouts] Wait!

287
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,653
Okay.

288
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,699
He made his name as a soldier.

289
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,828
But rather than take the easy
route through the academia...

290
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,497
he honed other skills.

291
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,207
And he trained you?

292
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,377
He trained us all ...his way.

293
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,338
He only wanted the best.

294
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,132
For that he wanted proof.

295
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,518
Only six of us survived.

296
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:44,190
And together we became your Cassius Seven.

297
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,066
And you never saw him again?

298
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,068
No.

299
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,198
We got our targets from him
through the usual channels.

300
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,034
But he planned the kills.

301
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,746
His intel was always the best.

302
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,541
His instinct for when to strike, always sharpest.

303
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,376
What happened to him?

304
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,712
He made mistake.

305
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,757
He lived outside parameters.

306
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,550
What kind of parameters?

307
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,887
Parameters of an assassin.

308
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,555
What did you do to him?

309
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,057
Give him the radio.

310
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,725
No, no. I wanna hear specifically--

311
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,393
I said give him the radio!

312
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,646
Just do it! Give it to him.

313
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,735
AII right. Let's go.

314
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,780
Come on!

315
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,952

[gate opens and closes]

319
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,754
What the hell was that?

320
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,090
Why didn't you Iet me finish my Iine of questioning?

321
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,758
Because he was Iying.

322
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,927
I tried to kill him once for a reason.

323
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,096
Yeah, but the wire makes perfect sense.

324
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,473
It explains why the cuts always
start from the middle...

325
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,934
and then work their way up. This opens up everything.

326
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,978
I gotta get in there early tomorrow morning...

327
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,605
and compare the cuts with other
wire killings in Europe.

328
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,566

What do we got?

00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,350
Cramping and vomiting blood.

339
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,809
Okay, get him into three.

340
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,146
[groaning]

341
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,567
Somebody get these restraints off!

342
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,069
Excuse me.

343
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,030
Can I get a bowl? Bowl, please!

344
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,198
Got it.

345
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,869
Batteries.

346
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,748
Stay back!

347
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,921
(doctor) All right, get me security!

349
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,571
(Paul) You swallowed the batteries, didn't you?

350
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,200
Easier to escape from a hospital than a prison.

You were there, weren't you?

354
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,927
I know nothing about--

355
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,929
You were there. It was you.

356
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,432
I never killed anyone in Geneva.

357
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,768
You are a Iiar.

358
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,770
Who are you?

359
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,274
I'm the one who shot you in Salzburg.

360
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,239
I'm also the one who trained you in Moscow.

361
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,667
Cassius?

362
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:20,632
I never... I never knew about
Geneva until after the fact.

363
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:25,012
They brought in someone with-with no ties to you.

364
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,514
Yeah, the others said that, too.

365
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,644
Did they tell you it was someone
from the Black Caucasus?

366
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,314
A soldier, I think.

367
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,028
We could find him together.

368
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,322
We are from the same place.

369
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,620
I've Iooked up to you my whole Iife.

370
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,166
[no audible dialog]

371
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,887
[no audible dialog]

372
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,613
[bells tolling]

373
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,395
[horn honking]

374
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,576
[woman screaming]

375
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,248
[telephone ringing]

376
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,295
[talking in Russian]

377
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,647
[telephone ringing]

378
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,523
(Geary) Agent Geary.

379
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,984
(Paul) Agent Geary. We need to meet.

380
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,974
[voices whispering]

381
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,020
Oh.

382
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,152
You need to drop this investigation.

383
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,699
How exactly am I supposed to drop it?

384
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:18,370
Cassius doesn't care who he has to eliminate.

385
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,331
If he comes after me, I'm prepared. Not you.

386
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,209
You've got a wife. You have two kids.

387
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,213
Yeah. I think they understand
what I'm doing is important.

388
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,550
Have you thought about what you're
gonna do if you find him?

389
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,593
That is all I think about.

390
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,887
And now that it's real, I want it more.

391
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,891
I want to know him. I want to understand him.

392
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,601
And then?

393
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,688
And then I wanna put him away, for good.

394
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,904
(Oliver) Whoa. What is all this shit?

395
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,573
It's research.

396
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,116
Research.

397
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,412
Volks-Volkskrant-Volks.

398
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,248
De Volkskrant. It's a daily newspaper in Holland.

399
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,084
The third page there's a story about a wire killing.

400
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,254
Ten days before the Soviets held
their first open election.

401
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,797
Cassius?

402
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,966
Yeah. I think so.

403
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,260
You've gotta put in a word to get me on this case.

404
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,763
Please. I'm up to my ass in banking
bullshit. I'm serious.

405
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,475
[telephone rings]

406
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,435
Agent Geary.

407
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,770
Where?

408
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,438
[muffled voices]

409
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,940
[telephone rings]

410
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,151
Once you're done getting shots of the body...

411
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,821
really get the cut patterns. I
want close-ups of the neck.

412
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,741
[distant siren blaring]

413
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,138
And then he came in here?

414
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,556
Yes, sir.

415
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,871
[no audible dialog]

416
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,668
Hey, Paul.

417
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,004
Agent Geary. What do you got? See you Iater.

418
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,883
Apparently Brutus swallowed the batteries
from the radio that we gave him.

419
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,011
I'm guessing he put out some calls.
Found a place to Iay Iow.

420
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,389
Word got back to Cassius.

421
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,225
He's never one to allow Ioose ends.

422
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,019
Loose ends, meaning he spoke to us.

423
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,897
Probably. Yeah.

424
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,400
Well, we should get all the phone records...

425
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,528
of every cell phone hospital extension here.

426
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,904
AII right. Okay.

427
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,744
You know, I always had this theory...

428
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,833
that Cassius would return to the scene of his crimes.

429
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,920
Watch his investigators.

430
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,549
You think he's that vain?

431
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,094
Well, I think that some of it's vanity.

432
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,014
Some of it is he wants to see what he's up against.

433
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,066
You see that guy in the back? Brown jacket.

434
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,444
Coat's Russian made.

435
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,741
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

436
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,035
(Geary) Shit! Move!

437
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,164
[panting]

438
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,127
AII right. Why don't we split up?

439
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,629
Yeah.

440
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,172
You go that way.

441
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,477
[exhales]

442
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,715
[clanking]

443
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,934
[exhales]

444
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,898
I've got nothing.

445
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,941
Yeah, me neither. Let the Bureau know.

446
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,110
He's wearing a brown suede jacket.

447
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,237
Sandy blond hair, close cropped.

448
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,074
No. That wasn't him.

449
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,409
He was too tall.

450
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:36,081
Too military. Wrong build. Too young.
A million reasons. It wasn't him.

451
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,291
What the hell were we doing chasing this guy?

452
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,711
He ran. I figured he'd be arrested for something.

453
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,137
You hungry?

454
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,952
Hey, Paul. This is my wife, Natalie.

455
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,162
Hello, Mr. Shepherdson.

456
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,497
Hey. Paul.

457
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,748
Paul.

458
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,963
It's been a Iong time since I went
to someone's house for dinner.

459
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,674
I, uh, I never Iearned how to do it right.

460
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:32,011
Well, it's easy. You just smile and
nod and tell me how good it is.

461
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,638
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,474
Ma'am? Did you hear that?

463
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,143
Well, right this way, sir.

464
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,438
Let me welcome you to our humble commode.

465
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,696
[kid humming]

466
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,706
Wanna help me get dinner ready?

467
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,333
Dinner ready?

468
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,836
I'm not gonna be much help. I'm sorry.

469
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,881
It's easy. Just move the dad from
the backyard to the kitchen.

470
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,966
That's your dad? Let's see.

471
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,513
Hey, Paul. Come meet this Iittle guy.

472
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,390
[chuckles]

473
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,184
It's Nicholas.

474
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,519
Wow.

475
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,855
Yeah. Looks Iike you.

476
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,064
No.

477
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,691
Yeah. Got your nose.

478
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,860
Everyone says he Iooks Iike my dad.

479
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,571
Which is nice 'cause we Iost him Iike ten years ago.

480
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,072
Yeah, I'm sorry.

481
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,365
No, no, it's fine.

482
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,867
He's definitely your kid.

483
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,535
Do you have any children, Paul?

484
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,245
No. No, I don't.

485
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,538
Do you want a drink?

486
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,373
Yeah.

487
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,751
Yeah, sweetie. Come on.

488
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,544
You got his head?

489
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,755
Come on, Lucy. Let's go set up, sweetie.

490
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,423
Paul, what are you Iooking for?

491
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,050
Vodka martini?

492
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,760
Sure.

493
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,720
Dry. With, uh, an onion if you've got it.

494
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,722
You know what?

495
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,725
I think you've been chasing Cassius a Iittle too Iong.

496
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,019
That's his drink.

497
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,608
Yeah. Well, trying to get into his head...

498
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,070
I guess I picked up some of his habits.

499
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,448
You know what? In that case, I'm gonna join you.

500
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,791
The kids are down. Finally.

501
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,921
Now, I know you're gonna say this is weird...

502
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:34,092
but I feel a connection with him. I do. With Cassius.

503
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,928
He's not the kind of guy that you can connect to.

504
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,766
Well, sure. If not a connection, then
a tremendous amount of respect.

505
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,435
AII right. Let's just set the record straight now.

506
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,313
He's not worthy of your respect or admiration.

507
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,274
He's a cold-blooded ki//er.

508
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,985
He doesn't have a family like you.

509
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,612
He doesn't have a wife Iike yours.

510
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,948
His Iife meant nothing.

511
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:02,453
The only good thing he ever
did was disappear. All right?

512
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,790
You don't think there's something
to be respected in the fact that...

513
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,001
he is the best at something?

514
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,338
Respect is the Iast thing I have
for an animal Iike him. Okay?

515
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,132
Yeah. But--

516
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,137
Hold that thought. I'm gonna take a piss.

517
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,639
Ben?

518
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,808
I'm just stating the facts.

519
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,145
Paul, he's obsessed.

520
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,813
Yeah, I know.

521
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,149
And he has been ever since I've known him.

522
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,192
Cassius.

523
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,153
And you!

524
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,407
You know, I'm-I'm just ready for it to be over.

525
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:48,333
Your husband is messing with a creature...

526
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,669
he thinks he understands, but he doesn't.

527
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,006
He's allowed your husband...

528
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,510
to Iive this Iong because he wasn't much of a threat.

529
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,555
What do you mean, allowed him to Iive?

530
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,141
Do you think he knows who my husband is?

531
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,647
I'm sure he does.

532
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,151
You really read my thesis?

533
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,864
Yes. Yes, I read your thesis.

534
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,866
Yeah?

535
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,618
And?

536
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,665
AII right. I think...

537
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,253
that you missed an essential question.

538
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,048
Okay. What's that?

539
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,885
You pinpointed the wheres and the hows of Cassius...

540
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,389
but you never ask the question why.

541
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,726
Why were his targets increasingly more random?

542
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,895
Why did he disappear?

543
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,232
When you can answer those whys...

544
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,192
then you'll know him.

545
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,252
Thank Natalie again, will you?

546
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,130
Oh, we checked the calls from the hospital.

547
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,297
Yeah?

548
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,092
Nothing.

549
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,802
Tch. Too bad.

550
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,430
Yeah.

551
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,473
See, you know the thing that--

552
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,684
Okay, here's what I don't understand.

553
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,146
How did Cassius know that they
moved Brutus to a hospital...

554
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,606
instead of just working on him at the prison?

555
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:39,777
The Russians probably paid somebody off in the prison.

556
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,321
They'd want him dead just to shut him up.

557
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,323
Right. Right.

558
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,950
Good night, Geary.

559
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,293
[dog barking]

560
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,319
[helicopter flying by]

561
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,538
Gentlemen?

562
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,832
I think you guys know Martin Miller.

563
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,376
He's our Chief Analyst on domestic Russian ops.

564
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,171
Go ahead, Marty.

565
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:44,342
Almost six months ago, two B.P agents
were murdered and their truck stolen.

566
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,179
The truck was located a week later in
a parking lot near TUS wiped clean.

567
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,390
Now, these guys were smart. They parked
far enough away from the cameras...

568
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,893
that we couldn't get any facial recognition.

569
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,854
Local cops and Border Patrol
assumed they were Mexican.

570
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,148
Then we found this.

571
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,568
A camera in a squad car.

572
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,238
That's right. Luckily, Tucson police were testing...

573
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,740
high-resolution cameras in a few cars.

574
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,910
All Russian. All known operatives.

575
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,704
AII now in the United States.

576
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,415
(Geary) There's the guy with the Russian jacket.

577
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,501
That's right. And it gets better.

578
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,426
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

579
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,520
Son-of-a-bitch.

580
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,399
Bozlovski.

581
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,609
That's right. Johann Bozlovski.

582
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,238
Former Spetsnaz and KGB.

583
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,868
In 1990, Bozlovski and his 10th Mountain
Brigade in the Black Caucasus...

584
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,746
went into Warsaw and executed known
allies of the solidarity movement.

585
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,125
I Iooked for him for a year...

586
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,127
after the wall came down.

587
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,713
He just, just vanished.

588
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,927
Like Cassius.

589
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,888
What are you thinking, Paul?

590
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,600
We have a known Soviet hit man.

591
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,270
Disappears into Libya or Afghanistan.

592
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,273
Same time our intel tells us Cassius does the same.

593
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,483
Twenty years Iater, he shows up.

594
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,987
United States Senator gets his throat slit.

595
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,990
[exhales] I-I don't know.

596
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,451
I mean, Bozlovski's Spetsnaz.

597
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,953
And... he's so visible.

598
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,457
Well, yeah. Maybe that's what they wanted.

599
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,627
And wouldn't a more visible alter ego...

600
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,296
just muddy up the waters for everyone chasing him?

601
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,800
How did we know Boz was in Warsaw in 1990?

602
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,469
How did we know that?

603
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,138
Because the Russians told us so!

604
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,308
Soviet disinformation was the
biggest weapon they had...

605
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,976
before the wall came down.

606
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,478
That's true.

607
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,104
[exhales]

608
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,610
Yeah.

609
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,488
Bozlovski makes sense.

610
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,198
It's him. He's the one.

611
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,950
What do you guys need from us?

612
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,161
Nothing. Nothing. He'll disappear again...

613
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,914
if he knows we're onto him.

614

Amber?

622
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,248
Yeah, that guy deals in Russian goods.

623
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,625
Anything from the homeland.

624
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,377

Amber's a prostitute?

If the Russians used their women instead of missiles...

629
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,674
we'd all be wearing furry hats right now.

There you go.

Now, Leo, you didn't call anyone and
tell them we were coming, did you?

692

No. No, no. No, I swear.

Then I'm coming for you.

00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,232
AII right.

709
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,401
You get me to Bozlovski...

00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:19,244
You. Call for backup, or whatever
they told you to do at Quantico.

713
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,663
You stay there by the door. You don't Ieave.

714
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,416
Go.

715
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,043
He comes, too?

716
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,003
No, no, he stays at the door. Go on.

00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,485
I hear you've been asking questions about me.

720
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,654
You know my name.

721
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,656
Johann.

722
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,866
[door closes]

723
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,496
Coming in through Mexico, smart. Very smart.

724
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,791
How do you know this? What agency are you with?

725
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,586
They say you killed a Senator.

726
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,673
They think you're Cassius.

727
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,633
[whistles]

728
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,137
Uh-oh.

729
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,680
[chuckles]

730
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,807
What do you think?

731
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:08,312
You think I'm stupid enough to call
ahead from my own phone?

732
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,982
You think I give a damn what happens to some whore?

733
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,819
Yes. I've played Cassius before.

734
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:20,657
If they want me to be Cassius, I become Cassius.

735
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,618
But you're not him.

736
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,872
Really?

737
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,295
How can you be so sure?

738
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,841
Because I'm Cassius.

739
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,397
[shooting]

740
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,484
[groans]

741
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,480
[clap of thunder]

742
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,404
[siren blaring]

743
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,864
[muffled voices]

744
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,578
You were here?

745
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,205
Yes, sir.

746
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,628
And I ran immediately upstairs.

747
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,839
[indistinct radio]

748
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,602
[dialing]

749
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,027
[telephone ringing]

750
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,631
Hey. OIIie. Come on. You did the work
on the Moussali capture, right?

751
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,634
Applied some Iike theoretical geography
to his whereabouts?

752
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,803
Yeah, that's right. Tracking a fugitive...

753
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,681
is essentially the same thing as tracking
an endangered species.

754
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,975
You rule out the places they can't or won't go...

755
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,186
until you have a reasonably few places to Iook.

756
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,021
You want in on this thing? Come on.

757
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,484
So, what is it I'm Iooking for?

758
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:04,154
Late in Cassius' career, his murders
were no longer just pro-Soviet.

759
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,989
He was killing Russians, too.

760
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,492
And also English, Polish, Czech, you name it.

761
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,160
When was this?

762
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,662
Around 1988.

763
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,623
It never made any sense.

764
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,544
I think I missed something here.

765
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,713
Why do you think you missed something?

766
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,840
You have some new information?

767
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,884
Paul Shepherdson.

768
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,470
Yeah?

769
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,640
What?

770
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,061
He's been at the company for Iike 25 years!

771
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,522
Yeah, I know, man. That's why
I need you on this. Okay?

772
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,565
I've been over this shit Iike a thousand times...

773
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,026
to the point at which I always
see the exact same thing.

774
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,862
Find something different.

775
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,701
Okay. Yeah, sure. I--

776
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,580
But if you're right, I mean, that
means the entire time...

777
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,042
he's been hunting himself?

778
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:00,710
So, he killed the Senator?

779
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,004
If we're right about this, yeah.

780
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,051
[telephone rings]

781
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,886
Agent Geary.

782
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,763
I've got a question about a file here.

783
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,057
It's blue and it's got a note attached that says...

784
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,934
"Too many questions. Not Cassius."

785
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,561
Uh, No. That one's a hoax.

786
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,105
It's like a crude copycat murder.

787
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,565
Okay, cool. I'll exclude it.

788
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,109
[squeaking]

789
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,740
I'm gonna run for coffee. Want something?

790
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,951
Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

791
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,746
[door opens]

792
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,458
[door closes]

793
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,087
[soft music]

794
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,117
[grunts]

795
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,788
Ooh.

796
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,248
Jesus!

797
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,169
Paul! Hi! Thank you!

798
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,629
You need to be careful.

799
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,464
Yeah. Oh, Iet me--

800
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,174
Stay up there. [clears throat]

801
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,844
Okay.

802
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,973
I want you to tell your husband to ask off this case.

803
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:40,477
Have him say that it's just too
much for him, for his family.

804
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,855
What-whatever he has to say, just get him out.

805
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,815
Paul, what do you expect me to do?

806
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,026
You know, I told you. I can't watch over him anymore.

807
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,153
He's getting very close to a dangerous man.

808
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,030
He won't Iisten to me.

809
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,990
He won't Iisten to anything I have to say, so--

810
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,493
He's gonna die, Natalie!

811
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,328
What?

812
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,955
Do you hear me now?

813
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,668
Cassius has taken out men...

814
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,670
much more experienced than Ben.

815
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,839
He doesn't give a damn about you, about your family.

816
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,175
He will kill your husband.

817
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,135
Like snapping his fingers.

818
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,399
And he will feel nothing.

819
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,877
I pieced together the photos of every murder
and I laid them out chronologically.

820
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,213
Oh, that red Iine right there indicates...

821
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,757
where his killing became erratic and inexplicable.

822
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,386
So, all you've gotta do is set up a null
hypothesis and try and prove it.

823
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,723
And when you can't prove it, that means
your original hypothesis must be true.

824
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,932
Wait, wait.

825
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,226
Take some fact.

826
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,062
You said you believe Cassius returns
to the scene of the crimes.

827
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,231
And you've got photos of every murder.

828
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,109
So set up a hypothesis of, say,
Stephen Hawking is Cassius...

829
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,738
which gives you a null hypothesis of
Stephen Hawking is not Cassius.

830
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,240
So, go through the photos and try and prove the null...

831
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,993
that Rolling Thunder is not Cassius.

832
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,912
If you can, that means your hypothesis
is incorrect. If you can't...

833
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,956
then depending on your "P" value of course...

834
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,625
you've statistically proven your
hypothesis must be true.

835
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,754
Or that Stephen Hawking is Cassius.

836
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,964
Yeah.

837
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,801
Some of us didn't sleep our way through
Logic and Stats at Harvard.

838
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,970
Damn, this coffee really works.

839
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,597
I'll be right back.

840
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,141
Jesus Christ.

841
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,763
[whispers] Hey.

842
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,723
Hey.

843
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,269
Hey. Come here, big guy.

844
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,438
He misses his daddy.

845
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,106
Yeah?

846
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,952
Sweetie, what is it?

847
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,829
No, just, you know how much
I care about you guys, right?

848
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:56,125
Oh, God. Yeah. I do.

849
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,003
Ben?

850
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,344
I just--

851
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,350
I-I just came home to tell you
I've got to pull an all-nighter.

852
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,480
It's all gonna be over soon.

853
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,815
Yeah.

854
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,652
Ben.

855
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,445
Yeah?

856
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,533
You know, Paul told me--

857
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,369
Paul? When were you talking to Paul?

858
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:35,373
Well, he came by the store today and
he told me how dangerous this all is.

859
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:40,211
Honey. Don't Iisten to a word that that guy says, okay?

860
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,715
He's just an old man who thinks
that the war is still cold.

861
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,677
Trust me. This is all gonna be over soon.

862
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,387
You promise?

863
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,431
Yeah. But I-I gotta go.

864
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,188
Natalie?

865
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,323
It's-- Never mind.

866
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:42,065
I dug deeper into Bozlovski's Iife Iike you asked.

867
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:46,277
The guy's nothing but a killing
machine. Anywhere. Anytime.

868
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,905
He's used every single weapon you can think of...

869
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,784
from an M-24 from 800 meters to a rusty nail.

870
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,930
Where was he June 1988?

871
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,774
We had him flying into Geneva as
an Irishman named Ted O'Leary.

872
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,945
He was there for four days.

873
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:19,787
Where are you?

874
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,959
Holy shit.

875
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,045
Bozlovski?

876
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,148
[siren blaring]

877
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,535
Hm.

878
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:01,055
Oh, my God.

879
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,560
Bozlovski killed your family.

880
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,982
So, all this time...

881
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,240
you were Iooking for revenge.

882
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,605
[telephone rings]

883
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,649
Agent Geary.

884
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,485
Where are you?

885
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,654
You got my message on your windshield.

886
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,823
I know the truth.

887
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,492
You've been Iooking for Cassius
a Iong time, haven't you?

888
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,203
Yeah. And now I've found him.

889
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,956
It would seem so.

890
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:31,520
Where is Paul Shepherdson?

891
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:35,524
Hey! You wanna keep your business your business?

892
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,194
Or do you want every Fed in the
District down here up your ass?

893
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,655
So, goddammit, Where is he?

894
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,589
Good to go.

895
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,883
All right, open it up!

896
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,121
[shooting]

897
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,324
What happened?

898
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,205
Open the gate! Open the goddamn gate! Now!

899
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,581
Come on!

900
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,005
[groans]

901
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,233
[gunshots]

902
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,086
How did I miss it, Paul?

903
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,422
How did I miss it?

904
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:29,592
The entire time, Cassius was right next to me!

905
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,135
Put the gun down, Geary!

906
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,137
What? I'm supposed to trust you now?

907
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,057
Yeah. Let's talk about trust.

908
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,272
Five down! Cassius.

909
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,650
Seventy across. Yepatb!

910
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,652
Eliminated.

911
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,447
Thirty-two down. Bolxoh.

912
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,782
Exit.

913
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:57,328
This is 30-year-old Soviet code.

914
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,164
So, how old were you when-when
your family came over here?

915
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,959
What were you, about ten? Ten?

916
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,296
You never had a choice, did you?

917
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,673
So then you wrote a thesis that couldn't be ignored.

918
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,009
The FBI came after you. They signed you up.

919
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:15,137
You even started a family. You started a real family!

920
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,222
To make it stick.

921
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,646
You've been a double your whole Iife.

922
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:52,341
You cut the Senator's neck because
you knew you were the expert...

923
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,388
who could convince the Americans
it was Cassius who did it.

924
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:03,352
An investigation would flush Cassius out.

925
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,982
My orders are to kill you...

926
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,193
and return to Moscow.

927
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,529
My plane Ieaves tonight.

928
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:15,572
Alone?

929
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,168
Then that's all you'll ever be.

930
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,347
Cassius.

931
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,520
Cassius is getting away.

932
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,059
Hey, Iisten to me.

933
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:28,604
He's wounded. He's cornered.

934
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:31,106
He's not gonna talk. He's not gonna play fair.

935
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,442
He's not gonna be taken alive.

936
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,694
Right.

937
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,451
Geary!

938
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,285
[exhales]

939
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,247
[grunts]

940
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,985
[groans]

941
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,822
Come on.

942
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,907
Paul?

943
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,455
Fuck.

944
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,420
Go home.

945
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,214
[whispers] You go--

946
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,818
[exhales]

947
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,144
[siren blaring]

948
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,569
Check Cassius' watch.

949
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:30,322
Pull the knob.

950
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:37,287
That's how he did it.

951
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,456
Explains the cut pattern.

952
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:57,516
Bozlovski's the one with the slit throat.

953
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,896
I heard a shot.

954
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,568
And when I turned around, I saw Paul going down.

955
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,283
But not before he'd gotten Cassius'
own wire around his neck.

956
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,828
Cassius shot Paul?

957
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,333
The ballistics will prove it.

958
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,590
But not before Paul finally got his man.

959
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:34,344
That's right.

960
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,389
Well done, Agent Geary.

961
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:45,272
You might wanna check on that ship.

962
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,317
Cassius was here for a reason.

963
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,717
(Bell) What's this?

964
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:16,136
These came off the boat, sir.

965
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,396
Ben!

966
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,484
Tell me something.

967
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,488
Would you ever consider working for us?

968
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:38,492
(man) Excuse me, sir?

969
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,788
Think about it.

970
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:18,693
