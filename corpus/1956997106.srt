Because, drivingis more fun.

35
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,916
Did you bringToby's leash?

36
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:54,874

It's boring.

38
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,209
Then read a book.

39
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,920
There is no excuseto be bored - ever.

40
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,921

56
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,298

Stop! You're not cool!

59
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,805
If you can't take alittle funky stuff,

60
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,180
I don't know what's up.

61
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,242
Getting nervous?

62
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:34,162
Not nervous exactly, morelike excited, and nervous.

63
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:37,039

00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:37,832
I feel bloated.

65
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:39,166
Do I look bloated to you?

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,959
N'naa, you've hadlike three olives,

67
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,335
I don't think thatwould cause bloat.

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,336
No, but are yousure?

69
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:44,504

74
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:58,515
Why do you think I shouldbe having reservations?

75
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,852
No, of course not,not at all.

76
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,353

00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:58,749
I dated an Italianguy once...

157
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:02,335
and he dumped mefor my best friend

158
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,795
and then he turned aroundand married her sister

159
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,340
and I heard he evenslept with the mother.

160
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,800

00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:18,348
Nothing. Nothing.

164
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:21,808
Your fiancé isprobably a great guy.

165
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,732

Just another minor setback.

184
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:53,465
Well it's a cinch to fix butI just don't have the part.

185
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,718
I can send a guy to Omahatomorrow to get it.

186
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,468
I guess that'swhat we'll do then.

187

Any place to stay around here?

188
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,638

378
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:21,599

379
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,518

380
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:26,645

00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,912

00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:40,914

416
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,942

418
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:13,988

Well how would you feel ifI fondled your underwear?

431
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,473

00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,146
Can we give youa ride somewhere?

433
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:56,938
Not unless you'regoing to Aspen.

00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,189
We're not.

435
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:00,191
I didn't think so.

436
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,693

437
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:06,030

452
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:41,767
Today has just beena total disaster.

453
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:45,686
I've been on a plane, a bus,a truck and now of course

454
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,896
there's no rental caragency in this city,

455
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:50,982

456
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:56,487
and I just...please...

457
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,612

00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,118
Please.

459
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:14,542
Guess we should beproperlyintroduced.

460
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,419
I'm Tom Pullman andthisis my daughterHillary.

461
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:17,503

00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:19,421
You're name soundsso familiar.

463
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,547
Have we met before?

464
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:21,632
I don't think so.

465
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:22,924
You sure?

466
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,842

467
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:29,721

468
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:33,432

00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:36,560
We should get going.

471
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:40,271
Okay, I guessit's hopeless anyhow.

472
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:52,697
Do you mind ifI plug this in?

473
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:54,074
Sorry, the lighterdoesn't work.

474
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,617
It doesn't?

475
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,035
Oh man, my batteryis almost out.

476
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,453
Don't worry, that thingprobably won't work

477
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:00,955
out here anyway.

478
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,331
Don't be silly, there'sreception everywhere.

479
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,294
Wait a minute...

480
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:11,630

00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,049
But you don't understand, Ihave wedding plans to make;

483
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,217
I have to call my office.

484
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,093
I can't afford tobe out of contact.

485
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,970
What do you wantme to do about it?

486
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,972
I don't know, don't you havea CB radio or something?

487
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:24,640
Roger that,no Big Mama.

488
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,309
Sorry, they didn't teachtrucker in my high school.

489
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,060
I'm sure they didn't.

490
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,815
Oh hell!

491
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,400

I really do needto use the phone.

496
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:06,632
There's a town up ahead;

497
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:08,925
we can stop thereif you really have to.

498
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,845
I do, I really, really do.

499
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:14,930
Where are we anyhow,should we be on a highway?

500
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,432
This is a more direct route,

501
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:20,101
besides you see more of thecountry on the back roads.

502
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,686
Oh I've seen enough of thecountry in the last 2 days

503
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,770
to last me a lifetime.

504
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,856
Give mecivilizationany day.

505
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:27,608
You can have it.

508
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:39,033
That is so cool.

509
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:40,659
Isn't that cool?

510
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,453
Way cool.

511
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,661
So what's your husband,

512
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,371
I mean the guyyou're marrying, like?

513
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:49,875
He's funny andsmart and he adores me.

514
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,710
So romantic.

515
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:53,169
What's he do?

516
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,712
He owns a cablecompany in Italy.

517
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:55,671
He's Italian?

518
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:57,048
Yeah.

519
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:00,508
Oh.

520
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,677
What do you mean 'oh'?

521
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,553
Nothing, just oh,like uh huh.

522
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,222
Are you sure?Yes.

523
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:09,224
Geez lady it wasan exclamation,

524
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:11,017
not an editorial comment.

525
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,061
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'mjust a little sensitive

526
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:16,438
on the subject lately becauseeveryone I talk to seems to

527
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,023
have this attitudeabout Italians.

528
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,649
You saying my daughter'santi-Italian?

529
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:20,775
I like Italians.

530
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,193
No, I'm sureyou do...

531
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,236
I'm sure she does.

532
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,529
I'm sorry, forget it.

533
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:26,696
I'm really sorry.

534
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,323
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:05,269
Hey Dad, I'm gonnatake Toby for a walk.

536
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:06,603
No!

537
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:10,690
Okay honey, don't betoo long okay, okay?

538
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:17,404
Want to go for a walk?

539
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:18,654
Good boy.

540
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,554
Oh, no thank youI'm not eating.

541
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:51,139
I'd just likea double latte.

542
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:53,474
With or without soy milk?

543
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,891
Regular milk is fine.

544
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,561
He's kidding.

545
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,936
Oh you don't have soy milk?

546
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,480
We don't have lattes either.

547
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:03,274
Just regular oldfashioned coffee.

548
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,441
What blend?

549
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,484
Folgers.

550
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,570
Well I guess that'swhat I'm having.

551
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,447
Make that two.

552
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,119
This certainly is rustic;

553
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:22,331
sort of early faux dive.

554
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:26,667
Nothing faux about it.

555
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:34,965
Oh this cream looks likeit's older than I am.

556
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,550
That old huh?

557
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:38,427
Funny.

558
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,512
Could we justhavesome fresh cream?

559
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,348
Sure.

560
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:47,517
There you go.

561
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,810
If you're really hungry I'vegot some fresh baked scones.

562
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,520
Oh, you do?

563
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:52,730
No.

564
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,360
Everybody's a comedian.

565
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,235
Dad, dad,Toby ran away!

566
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,862
What are you talking about?

567
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:04,031
He went after a rabbit and Icouldn't hold on to his leash.

568
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:06,532
Oh geez.

569
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,117
Come on we've gotto find the dog.

570
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:10,160
He'll come back won't he?

571
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:11,411
I don't know, he goesa little brain dead

572
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:12,871
when he's chasing rabbits.

573
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,538
He could be in Wyoming by now.

574
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:15,790
We'll have more luck ifall three of us look.

575
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,291
Come on.

576
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,918
Sure.

577
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,627
Come on.

578
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,138
Toby!

579
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:37,015
Come on!

580
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,558
Nice doggy,come on,

581
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,477
I've got awedding to go to.

582
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,021
Please don't do this to me.

583
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:45,397
Come on.

584
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,564
Doggie!

585
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,358
Come on boy.

586
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:49,566
Toby!

587
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:53,529
Doggie!oh doggie.

588
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:55,029
Toby...

589
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,919
He's lost.

590
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,003
We'll find him.

591
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:15,087
But how canyou be sure?

592
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,213
It's just am.

593
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:17,714
Don't you have a dogwhistle or something?

594
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:19,133
If he's notcomingwhen we call,

595
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:20,425
then what goodwoulda dog whistle do?

596
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:22,760
I don't know I was justthinking out loud here.

597
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:23,970
Well don't.

598
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:27,764
What happens ifwe don't find him?

599
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:29,433
We're not leavinghere until we do.

600
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,434
Are you suggesting thatwe stay here over night?

601
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:32,643
We don't havemuch choice.

602
00:35:32,768 --> 00:35:34,437
There's a motel overnext to the restaurant,

603
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:35,437
we'll stay there.

604
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,688
But I have to get to Aspen.

605
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,565
Look lady, it's not myfault the dog ran away.

606
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:39,607
Are you blaming me?

607
00:35:39,732 --> 00:35:41,191
Yeah, as a matterof fact I am.

608
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:43,235
If it wasn't for you we neverwould have stopped here.

609
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:44,361
That's just great!

610
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:46,320
Fine, go ahead, blame me,

611
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,448
but I'm not staying inthis God-forsaken place.

612
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:50,782
Then get another ride'cause we're not leaving.

613
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,117
Fine, I will.

614
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,543
Whoa!

615
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:07,629
Oh my goodness.

616
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:15,969
Stop it.

617
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:17,262
Yeah, hardy har, har.

618
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:20,473
Help me out of here.

619
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:40,113
The last step'sa doozey.

620
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,490
So much for my winter white.

621
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:44,409
You look fine.

622
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,410
I do?

623
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,661
No.

624
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:49,246
You're a mess.

625
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,663
And Doby'sstill missing.

626
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:51,706
Toby.

627
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,500
Whatever.

628
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,376
Come on, we should get youinside before you freeze.

629
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,021
This is all you have?

630
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,773
Well the other 7 units areall tore up for repairs.

631
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,191
You should comeback this summer,

632
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,400
we're putting in a sauna.

633
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:29,904
Oh like a Siouxsweat lodge?

634
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,530
Hell no.

635
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,198
Swedish sauna.

636
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,533
Oh, this place isgoing to look great.

637
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:39,161
DSL, games room andan espresso machine.

638
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,955
It's gonna be sweet.

639
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:43,831
But you must have someplaceelse where one person

640
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:44,874
could sleep.

641
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,500
Could sleep in oneof the other rooms;

642
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,168
got no windows yet.

643
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:50,795
Be pretty cold.

644
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:53,673
But there are only2 beds in here.

645
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:56,550
I'll get a rollaway.

646
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:13,355
Dad, I think somethingjust ran under the bed.

647
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,398
Probably a mouse.

648
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:15,357
A mouse?

649
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,816
Or a rat.

650
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:18,359
A rat?

651
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:20,570
Yeah.

652
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,407
Here we go.

653
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,783
That was fast.

654
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:33,830
Do you know that you have aninfestation of mice or rats?

655
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:35,540
Sure do.

656
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:38,458
Don't worry though,they're friendly.

657
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,588
Snug as three bugs in a rug.

658
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,256
Well it certainly is cozy.

659
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:46,756
Well I'll letyou get settled.

660
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:49,759
If you need anythingelse the name's Chaba.

661
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,218
I'll let you settleup in the morning.

662
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:52,678
Thank you.

663
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:11,735
I told you threetimes

664
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:15,906

665
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,449
Yeah, you do that.

666
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:28,957
Don't worry, I'm sureyour dad will find him.

667
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,209
How do you know?

668
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:34,295
He just strikesmeas the kind ofguy

669
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:35,546
who's not gonnaquit until he does.

670
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,970
So tell me somethingabout yourself.

671
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,555
What do you want to know?

672
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,473
I don't know.

673
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:49,682
What grade are you in?

674
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:51,433
Eight.

675
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,976
Do you like it?

676
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,144
It sucks.

677
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:56,937
Yeah 8th grade does suck.

678
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:58,564
I was a whale in 8th grade.

679
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,775
No way, you're like a stick.

680
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:05,153
Trust me I was a total,I was a total whale.

681
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,987
My nickname wasMoby

682
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,947
and it was not inhonor of thesinger.

683
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,616
I find thathard to believe.

684
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,453
So where's your momspending Christmas?

685
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,415
Bad question?

686
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:23,000
No.

687
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:25,002
Yeah, it's prettyhard to talk about it.

688
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:27,921
I'm sorry, forget I asked.

689
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,674
She's dead.

690
00:40:33,384 --> 00:40:35,803
Oh Hilly, I'm sosorry, I didn't know.

691
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:37,011
It's okay.

692
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:38,346
I'm used to it.

693
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:40,348
There's no way youcould have known.

694
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,892
When did she die?

695
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:47,603
When I was little, rightbefore I turned two.

696
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:50,523
I'm so sorry.

697
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,440
Yeah me too.

698
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:55,735
It would have beennice to know her.

699
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,444
I don't everreally remember her.

700
00:40:57,528 --> 00:40:59,363
It's really hard.

701
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:02,824
You have no idea.

702
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:04,534
Yeah I do.

703
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:07,077
My mom diedwhen I was seven.

704
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:11,164
Then you understand.

705
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:13,124
Yeah, I do.

706
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:20,547
Did you find him?

707
00:41:23,424 --> 00:41:25,676
I'm sorry honey, no.

708
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,343
Don't worrywe'll find him.

709
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:29,887
There's nothing morewe can do tonight.

710
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:52,572
How long has shebeen in there?

711
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:54,407
I don't know,a while.

712
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:57,576
Wish she'd hurry up.

713
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,411
I need to usethe facilities.

714
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:00,579
You're a guy.

715
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,830
Go outside.

716
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:15,716
Yeah the shoot'sgoing really great.

722
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:28,559
Are you havingsecond thoughts?

723
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:32,771
Second thoughts, Claire,no I love you.

00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:35,565
I just hope we madethe right decision.

725
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:41,779
I was talking aboutthe Venetian thing.

726
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:42,695

00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,245
No, no, it's nothing.

782
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,584

Five bucks.

787
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:36,883

That's funny.

791
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:56,399
I'm gonna waitin the truck.

792
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,359
Me too.

793
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,030
Damn.

794
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,836
See, it hardly costus any time at all.

795
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,838
Oh, oh.

796
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:27,257
That can'tbe good.

797
00:47:38,016 --> 00:47:39,850
Can you fix it?

798
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,643
Yeah, I think it'sjust a bad spark plug.

799
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:47,857
So Hilly told meabout your wife.

800
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:50,191
She did?

801
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:51,443
Yeah.

802
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:52,986
It must have been hard.

803
00:47:55,487 --> 00:47:57,823
Sorry, it's noneof my business.

804
00:47:57,906 --> 00:47:58,865
I shouldn't havebrought it up.

805
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:01,409
It's fine.

806
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:03,202
I'm just surprisedshe told you.

807
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:04,786
It's not somethingshe talks about.

808
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,955
She's a sweet kid.

809
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:08,290
Isn't she great?

810
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:09,832

00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,129
Oh my god, are you okay?

813
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,340
Let me see, let me see.

814
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:21,925
Oh, you already have a bump.

815
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,219
It's fine.It's nothing.

816
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:26,763

824
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:42,567
It's no biggy,it's my lip.

825
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:43,234
You all right?

826
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,860

827
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:46,904

828
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:48,739

833
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:58,080
You can't use aband aid on a lip.

834
00:48:58,205 --> 00:48:59,997
Hold this on there,keeps the pressure.

835
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,880

836
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:11,256

866
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:07,850

It'll just takea second, please.

931
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:40,264
I don't thinkthat's a good idea.

932
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:41,764
Please?

933
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,646
Okay, but just for a minute.

934
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,939
We're really takingour chances here.

935
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:54,108
Okay, I'll be quick, I'lljust find the signal.

936
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,279
No bars, no bars.

937
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,822
oh, one bar,

938
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,406
Go that way, that way,

939
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,117
no bars again, wait, onebar, one bar, a little more,

940
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,703

941
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,456
I got nothing, I gotnothing, I got nothing.

942
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:13,624
Oh god, I got nothing!

943
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:14,666
Will you stopyelling at me?

944
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:15,667
What are you doing?

945
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,293
I'm trying to findyou reception.

946
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:18,169
You're doing a terrible job.

947
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:19,003
Do you want to drive?

948
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:49,653
Oh no!What's wrong?

949
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:50,987
We're stuck.

950
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:52,696
Can't you put it in fourwheel drive or something?

951
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:53,989
I don't have four wheel drive.

952
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,240
Who doesn't have four wheeldrive these days?

953
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:57,158
I don't, it's an old truck.

954
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:07,124
Ow!

955
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:16,007
Can you get out?

956
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:17,216
No we can't get out.

957
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,842
Why'd you backinto this ditch?

958
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:20,260
Do you think I meant to?

959
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:22,345
This is all because of youand that stupid cell phone.

960
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:23,388
Give that to me.No.

961
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:24,389
Give it to me.

962
00:55:24,514 --> 00:55:25,556
No. No, you're justgoing to break it.

963
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:26,556
You got that right.

964
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,058
Will you two stop it?

965
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,568
Okay, so what do we do?

966
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:45,072
Well, we don't havea lot of options.

967
00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:47,573
We can stay here and wait forsomeone to give us a tow...

968
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:48,741
We haven't seen anothercar on the road

969
00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:49,701
in the last two hours.

970
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:51,077
Or we can walk out.

971
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:52,703
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

972
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:54,246
You got a better idea?

973
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:56,497
What about helicopter rescue?

974
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,581
Are you crazy?

975
00:55:57,665 --> 00:55:58,749
What about the Mounties?

976
00:55:58,874 --> 00:55:59,750
I think they're in Canada.

977
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,085
Well, is that far away?

978
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,419
Hello?

979
00:56:02,502 --> 00:56:03,712
Okay forget aboutthe Mounties,

980
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:05,255
why don't we send up a flare?

981
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,715
What good would that do?

982
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,091
It might attractthe attention

983
00:56:09,216 --> 00:56:10,342
of a St. Bernardor something.

984
00:56:10,426 --> 00:56:11,717
What, do you think there'sarmies of St. Bernards

985
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,719
roaming themountainsides

986
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,763
waiting to rescuestranded motorists?

987
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,764
Okay forget aboutthe St. Bernard.

988
00:56:17,848 --> 00:56:19,141
You're Grizzly Adams,you think of something.

989
00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:20,434
Why would you call me that?

990
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:22,226
I am nothing likeGrizzly Adams.

991
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:23,269
Okay forget it.

992
00:56:23,394 --> 00:56:24,437
I'm sorry I said anything.

993
00:56:24,562 --> 00:56:26,230
I just find it hard tobelieve that this is

994
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:28,773
the only option for us,to walk out.

995
00:56:28,898 --> 00:56:32,943
Think of it as one oflife's little adventures.

996
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:35,946
We're in themiddle of nowhere.

997
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:37,155
Actually,that's not true.

998
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,073
My mom's place is just10 miles up the road.

999
00:56:39,157 --> 00:56:40,658
If we start walking now wecan probably make it

1000
00:56:40,783 --> 00:56:42,033
before nightfall.

1001
00:56:42,117 --> 00:56:42,951
Walk?

1002
00:56:43,076 --> 00:56:44,286
We'll freeze todeath.

1003
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,288
I've got an extra pair oflong johns here in my bag.

1004
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:47,621
Oh, you're not Grizzly Adams?

1005
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:49,790
Got to be preparedfor all possibilities.

1006
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:50,875
I have never metanyone

1007
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,625
who carried a second setof long johns.

1008
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,586
You never met my dad.

1009
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:58,839
Here, I hope they fit.

1010
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:00,757
Where do I change?

1011
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:06,429
Jack ass.

1012
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:08,013
Take this too, here.

1013
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:26,820
Is everybody ready?

1014
00:57:26,945 --> 00:57:28,780
Yup.

1015
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,114
Let's go.

1016
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:31,616
Mush!

1017
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,284
What?

1018
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,827
Is that what you say?

1019
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,369
That's witha dog sled.

1020
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,955
Oh, well what do yousay when you're hiking?

1021
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:44,083
I don't know, 'mush' soundspretty good to me.

1022
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,502
Mush!

1023
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:47,794
Come on boy, mush!

1024
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,116
Well there you are!

1025
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,993
I was beginning to thinkyou wouldn't make it.

1026
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:28,702
Where's your truck?

1027
00:58:28,786 --> 00:58:29,662
Long story.

1028
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:30,621
I'll tell you later.

1029
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:33,456
Come in.

1030
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,376
This is about the bestChristmas present I could get.

1031
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:38,377

Not Lorenzo.

1048
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,246
He never evenlooksat another woman.

1049
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:23,705
Mhm.

1050
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:26,875

00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,800
Same difference.

1056
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:45,222
So when's this weddingsupposed to take place?

1057
00:59:45,306 --> 00:59:46,724

The pass is closed.

1061
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:53,562
Big slide.

1062
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:55,105
They've been working onclearing it for days.

1063
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,982

With the flap in the back.

1075
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,923
Just like Grizzly Adams.

1076
01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:29,424

1092
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:09,594
Oh, I was just looking around.

1093
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,095
I'm sorry.

1094
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:13,139
You're mother didn't tell methat this was off limits or...

1095
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:19,101
It's not, I guess.

1096
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:21,687
Who did these?

1097
01:03:21,771 --> 01:03:22,855
They're amazing.

1098
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:25,815
I did.

1099
01:03:28,902 --> 01:03:31,445
Are you serious?

1100
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:32,946
I didn't know youwere an artist.

1101
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:36,115
I'm not anymore.

1102
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:37,867
These were all donea long time ago.

1103
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:41,620
Why are they here?

1104
01:03:41,703 --> 01:03:42,621
They're brilliant.

1105
01:03:42,746 --> 01:03:44,246
They should be exhibited.

1106
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,332
They were.

1107
01:03:50,502 --> 01:03:53,671
Now I know why theseseem so familiar.

1108
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:57,758

Well what happened?Why did you stop?

1112
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:11,811
Life intervened.

1113
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:18,650
After Angie...

1114
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:21,318
after my wife died,

1115
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:24,612
I just couldn'tsee the point.

1116
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:26,656
And there was Hilly.

1117
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,449
That's right.

1118
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,661
I'd love to photograph them.Could I?

1119
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,746
Why?

1120
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,082
Because they're beautiful.

1121
01:04:46,338 --> 01:04:48,006
You gonna watch TV all day?

1122
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:49,757
Sure.

1123
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:52,677
Why don't you gooutside and play?

1124
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:56,179
I was outside allday yesterday.

1125
01:04:58,807 --> 01:04:59,849
There are poorkids in the world

1126
01:04:59,932 --> 01:05:01,308
who'd givetheir eye teeth

1127
01:05:01,392 --> 01:05:02,643
to be in thecountry for Christmas.

1128
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:04,103
They can have it.

1129
01:05:04,186 --> 01:05:06,187
Besides I'm getting tiredof hearing about gangsters,

1130
01:05:06,312 --> 01:05:08,648
rappers, cribs.

1131
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:10,732
The least you could do isput on the food network.

1132
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:12,150
Yuck.

1133
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:14,027
Or better yet go and find outwhat you're dad is up to.

1134
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,319
We need a few thingsfrom the store.

1135
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:26,704
This one's my favorite.

1136
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,373
Want to know why?

1137
01:05:29,498 --> 01:05:30,498
I was midwayinto the piece

1138
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:33,376
when I discovered thisflaw in the metal.

1139
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:35,544
See it, here?

1140
01:05:35,669 --> 01:05:37,671
Oh yeah, I neverwouldhave noticed that.

1141
01:05:37,754 --> 01:05:38,797
It's subtle,

1142
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:41,549
but completely at oddswith my original design

1143
01:05:41,632 --> 01:05:45,051
and I almostabandoned the piece.

1144
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:49,014
But then the more Iconsidered thisimperfection,

1145
01:05:49,097 --> 01:05:50,890
the more it seemedlike a gift

1146
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:53,392
so I followed it

1147
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:54,727
to see where itwanted me to go

1148
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:57,562
and, I know itsounds strange,

1149
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,564
but it's as if thispiece of metal

1150
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:02,566
revealed itself to me.

1151
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:04,318
I don't think it'sso strange at all.

1152
01:06:04,401 --> 01:06:05,401
No?

1153
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:06,485
No.

1154
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:09,530
What'sgoing on?

1155
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,660
I was just talking toClaire about this piece.

1156
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:17,828
Oh, okay.

1157
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:21,372
Yeah, he was just talkingto me about the piece.

1158
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:22,749
Cool.

1159
01:06:22,874 --> 01:06:25,083
Grandma said she neededsome stuff from the store.

1160
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:26,752
Okay.

1161
01:06:26,835 --> 01:06:29,254
I think shemeans like now.

1162
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:32,256
Tell her to hold herhorses,I'll be there in aminute.

1163
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:33,424
You tell her.

1164
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:35,258
I'm going to go play inthe clean country air

1165
01:06:35,383 --> 01:06:37,802
for all the poorkids who can't.

1166
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:44,600
Guess I'm goingto the store.

1167
01:06:44,683 --> 01:06:46,476
I guess so.

1168
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:12,413
This is sucha good idea.

1169
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:13,915
I've never donethis before.

1170
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:15,958
It's justpopcorn.

1171
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,043
But it's so festive.

1172
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:19,795
Oh we don't doit to be festive.

1173
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:22,213
We do it becausewe're broke.

1174
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:25,423
You didn't tell meher dad was an artist.

1175
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:27,425
You didn't ask,besideshe's not anymore.

1176
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:28,760
He's a teacher.

1177
01:07:34,598 --> 01:07:36,474
You like himdon't you?

1178
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:39,727
Yeah I think he'sa really nice man.

1179
01:07:40,852 --> 01:07:42,980
No, I mean you like him.

1180
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,481
I'm not sure whatyou're getting at.

1181
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,483
No big deal.

1182
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:48,609
He likes you too.

1183
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,112
He does?How do you know that?

1184
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:54,406
Are you kidding?

1185
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:56,824
He acts like a totalspaz around you.

1186
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:02,537
Well that's very niceand I'm flattered,

1187
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,248
but I'm about to getmarried to someone else.

1188
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,833
He could be the wrong guy.

1189
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,167
You never know.

1190
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:22,678
Just heard some good news.

1191
01:08:22,803 --> 01:08:24,054
Apparently they're goingto have the road to Aspen

1192
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:25,680
cleared by tomorrow morning.

1193
01:08:25,763 --> 01:08:28,641
Oh great.

1194
01:08:28,725 --> 01:08:30,643
Yeah, so we can driveyou up there early.

1195
01:08:30,726 --> 01:08:32,978
That's great.

1196
01:08:33,061 --> 01:08:34,187
You don't seemvery happy.

1197
01:08:34,312 --> 01:08:36,105
I thought you weredying to getthere.

1198
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:37,606
I was...

1199
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,651
I am, it's just alittle unexpected.

1200
01:08:40,734 --> 01:08:42,193
Well, expectthe unexpected,

1201
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,695
that's what I always say.

1202
01:08:43,778 --> 01:08:45,530
So I got to finishmaking dinner.

1203
01:08:45,613 --> 01:08:47,614

1205
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:57,831

1206
01:08:57,914 --> 01:09:00,625
Absolutely, yeah.

1207
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:10,550
This looks good.

1208
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:11,759
Mom's homecooking.

1209
01:09:11,884 --> 01:09:13,385
What, aren't youhaving any roast beef?

1210
01:09:13,469 --> 01:09:15,012

1211
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:16,721

1212
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:17,722

01:09:17,847 --> 01:09:18,890
Dad, tell her.

1214
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:20,224
It's true, sheis.

1215
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:21,558
It's a moralchoice.

1216
01:09:21,683 --> 01:09:23,477
Uh huh, so what doesthat make me, immoral?

1217
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,728
You have freedom of choice.

1218
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,729
You're free to eat thatflesh if you want to.

1219
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:30,232
Oh, you're killing myappetite you know.

01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:33,693
So did you gethim?

1221
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:34,736
Oh I didn't get him.

Cool.

1229
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:52,249
What is this, a conspiracy?

1230
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,543
It's not a judgmentalthing, it's more of a...

1231
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:57,087
I know, it's a moral choice.

1232
01:09:57,212 --> 01:10:00,423
Okay, well you two havesome moral vegetables

1239
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:14,899
A picture of my mom.

1240
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:17,359
Can I see?

1241
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:24,782
Oh wow.

1242
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:29,494
She's so beautiful,just like you.

1243
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:32,580
I'm not beautiful.

1244
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,165
You are.

1245
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,250
You think?

1246
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,042
I know.

1247
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:48,259
Is that Grandma'snightgown?

1248
01:11:48,342 --> 01:11:49,510
Yeah.

1249
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,012
That's hot.

1250
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:53,138
I think so.

1251
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:06,149
You're up late.

1252
01:12:06,232 --> 01:12:08,025
So are you.

1253
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:09,693
Can't sleep huh?

1254
01:12:09,776 --> 01:12:13,029
A little apprehensiveabout tomorrow I guess.

1255
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:15,656
Oh, right.

1256
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:21,578
I heard youtalking with Hilly.

1257
01:12:22,786 --> 01:12:24,830
I really appreciatewhat you said to her.

1258
01:12:24,914 --> 01:12:26,540
Oh, well I meant it.

1259
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:28,374
She's a special girl.

1260
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,667
Well thanks.

1261
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,377
It's really nice for herto hear that from a woman.

1262
01:12:32,502 --> 01:12:33,879
I'm sure she'sheard it from you.

1263
01:12:34,004 --> 01:12:37,507
Oh yeah, but I'm herdad, I don't count.

1264
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:41,135
You count more than you know.

1265
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:43,970
Can I ask you something?

1266
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:52,560
You don't have toanswerif you don't want to.

1267
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:53,728
What?

1268
01:12:53,853 --> 01:12:56,564
What's the big rush...

1269
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:58,523
to get married I mean?

1270
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:04,737
I don't know,

1271
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:09,199
I mean I love Lorenzo andI really like the idea

1272
01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:10,534
of whatmarriage represents.

1273
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:13,285
And what's that?

1274
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:19,874
Having a partner,security, stability...

1275
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,501
haven't had a lotof that in my life.

1276
01:13:21,584 --> 01:13:23,001
Yeah, me either.

1277
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:27,047
Well, you've had it.

1278
01:13:28,172 --> 01:13:30,424
Yeah, once.

1279
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:33,134
Well that's better than never.

1280
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,179
This is my chance I guess.

1281
01:13:37,763 --> 01:13:42,351
Well, Lorenzo'sa very lucky man.

1282
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:56,195
Well I better tryand get some sleep.

1283
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:57,612
Good night.Good night.

1284
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:40,605
Sorry.

1285
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:44,608
That was really stupid.

1286
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:45,401
That was myfault.

1287
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:46,152
No, it was my fault.

1288
01:14:46,277 --> 01:14:47,486
You didn't do anything.

1289
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:48,987
It was my fault and...

1290
01:14:49,112 --> 01:14:50,113
you know what...

1291
01:14:50,196 --> 01:14:52,449

01:15:53,413 --> 01:15:55,457

01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,292

1316
01:16:51,877 --> 01:16:53,670

Wow, that'ssome house.

01:17:49,339 --> 01:17:51,800
Don't be ridiculous,come in and meet Lorenzo.

1320

1329
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:04,733
Claire, what a surprise!

1330
01:19:07,694 --> 01:19:10,112
I wasn't expecting you now.

1331
01:19:10,196 --> 01:19:11,197

1332
01:19:12,406 --> 01:19:14,533

01:19:17,327 --> 01:19:19,578
I didn't fly, we drove.

1335
01:19:19,703 --> 01:19:22,706
Drove, oh, youshould have called.

1336
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:24,374

1337
01:19:24,499 --> 01:19:27,168
Ah, we must havebeen skiing.

1338
01:19:27,252 --> 01:19:29,545

1342
01:19:37,552 --> 01:19:39,220
This...?

1343
01:19:39,303 --> 01:19:45,307
Michele and I are going overthe schedule for the wedding.

1344
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:47,560
In bed?

1345
01:19:47,643 --> 01:19:49,644
It's more comfortable.

1346
01:19:49,727 --> 01:19:51,229
Oh god.

1347
01:19:57,568 --> 01:19:59,361
Nice to meet you.

1348
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:05,115
Dad, what's going on?

1349
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,241
Well sweetheart

1350
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:08,577
sometimes two mencanhave the same kind

1351
01:20:08,702 --> 01:20:11,453
of feelings for eachotherthat a man and a womando.

1352
01:20:11,579 --> 01:20:12,997
Oh god, is the birds andthe bees conversation

1353
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,290
about gay people?

1354
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,415
Oh yeah, kind of.

1355
01:20:15,498 --> 01:20:17,208
Please spare me.

1356
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:19,085
I've known all about gaypeople since BrianMcConnelly

1357
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,669
came out in the 5th grade.5th grade?

1358
01:20:20,752 --> 01:20:24,089
Isn't that a little young tobe coming out of a closet?

1359
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:25,756
I don't know, what does agehave to do with anything?

1360
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:27,466
You are what you are.

1361
01:20:27,592 --> 01:20:30,427
Yeah, I guess that's right.

1362
01:20:56,781 --> 01:20:59,242
Is there anythingI can do?

1363
01:21:02,494 --> 01:21:04,788
Tell me thisisn't happening.

1364
01:21:04,912 --> 01:21:06,623
I wish I could.

1365
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:12,461
I thought I camehere to get married.

1366
01:21:12,544 --> 01:21:15,212
I feel like such a fool.

1367
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:20,467
Sometimes lifehas other plans.

1368
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:26,805
Screw him.You're hot.

1369
01:21:31,476 --> 01:21:32,143
Claire...

1370
01:21:34,187 --> 01:21:35,812
it breaks my heartto see you cry.

1371
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:37,314
Please come inside.

1372
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,608
We must talk.

1373
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,442
We have nothing to talk about.

1374
01:21:41,525 --> 01:21:43,069
Claire, please.

1375
01:21:46,613 --> 01:21:47,489
You okay here?

1376
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:49,658
Want us to give you a ride?

1377
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,328
No you should go.

1378
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:57,330
I really appreciateeverything you've done,

1379
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,332
both of you.

1380
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,210
Please just go.

1381
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:34,735
Cara--

1382
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,860
Don't Cara me,you lying, cheating,

1383
01:22:35,944 --> 01:22:38,697
two-faced...Italian.

1384
01:22:38,822 --> 01:22:40,906
Hitting me will solve nothing.

1385
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:42,658
Maybe not, but itfeels really good.

1386
01:22:44,576 --> 01:22:46,035
How could youdo this to me?

1387
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,037
Was marrying mejust a charade?

1388
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:51,415
No, no, I love you,I still love you.

1389
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,749
But you're gay.

1390
01:22:54,376 --> 01:22:56,752
Well I won't exactly say gay.

1391
01:22:56,877 --> 01:22:58,212
Lorenzo!

1392
01:22:58,337 --> 01:23:00,839
All right I'm gay...

1393
01:23:03,049 --> 01:23:04,759
I guess Ialways knew it

1394
01:23:04,884 --> 01:23:09,013
but I never wanted to admitit to myself until now.

1395
01:23:09,888 --> 01:23:12,724

1396
01:23:12,807 --> 01:23:14,726

1397
01:23:14,809 --> 01:23:19,146

1398
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:23,649

1399
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:36,909

There you go.

Let's see,what could it be?

1422
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:39,341
What's this?

1423
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:40,592
It's Emeril'snew cook book.

1424
01:25:40,676 --> 01:25:42,468
Emeril.

1425
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:45,513
I thought youliked Emeril.

1426
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,973
I do, I do, it's just...

1427
01:25:48,056 --> 01:25:49,766
the Naked Chef ismore up my alley.

1428
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,475
That guy is cute.

1429
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:54,311
Yes, you got goodtaste girl.

1430
01:25:54,395 --> 01:25:55,312
I can return it if you want.

1431
01:25:55,396 --> 01:25:57,021
No, no, he'sa great chef.

1432
01:25:57,147 --> 01:25:59,524

1433
01:25:59,649 --> 01:26:01,192

Merry Christmas.

1437
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:23,835
Merry Christmas.

1438
01:26:28,505 --> 01:26:30,549
What are you doing here?

1439
01:26:30,632 --> 01:26:33,509
I was hoping maybe I couldhitch a ride to Chicago?

1440
01:26:33,593 --> 01:26:38,138
By a strange coincidence Ihappen to be going that way.

1441
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:40,765
Then I guess today'smy lucky day.

1442
01:26:40,891 --> 01:26:43,475
It's a long drive.

1443
01:26:43,559 --> 01:26:45,185
I like car trips.

1444
01:26:45,269 --> 01:26:46,228
Bad roads.

1445
01:26:46,353 --> 01:26:48,354
Makes it more exciting.

1446
01:26:48,438 --> 01:26:49,731
No lattes.

1447
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,357
I love Folgers.

1448
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:54,067
No cell phonereception.

1449
01:26:54,151 --> 01:26:56,528
Who needs it whenthe company's good?

1450
01:27:06,453 --> 01:27:09,079
This is not how I thought I'dbe spending Christmas day.

1451
01:27:11,206 --> 01:27:13,583
All of life is an adventure.

1452
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:20,255
No way!

1453
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:24,050
Oh Hilly.

1454
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:27,761
Look who's here!

1455
01:27:27,844 --> 01:27:29,095
For God's sakeyou two,

1456
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,555
invite the poor woman in.

1457
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:35,935
Come on, you're just intime for Christmas dinner.
