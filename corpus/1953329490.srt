1
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,669
Never did eat your lunch, did ya?

2
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,806
I'd better
get back to the office.

3
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,876
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,923
Why don't you call your boss and
tell him to take the afternoon off.

5
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,425
It's Friday, anyway.
Huh?

6
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,428
Yeah? What do I do
with my free afternoon?

7
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,430
Walk you to the airport and--

8
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,934
Laze around here a while longer.

9
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,936
Checking out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,441
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in when you come in,

11
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,943
but when your time's up--

12
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,917
I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,919
I have to go.

14
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,525
I can come down next week.

15
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,822
No.

16
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,126
Not even just to see you,
have lunch? In public.

17
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,634
Oh, we can see each other.
We can have dinner.

18
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,638
But respectably.

19
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,643
In my house, with my mother's picture
on the mantel,

20
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,646
my sister helping me
to broil a steak for three.

21
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,773
I'd kinda like to
meet your sister.

22
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,850
She, um--

23
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,852
She look anything like you?

24
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,820
- Sam.
- No?

25
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,323
All right.

26
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,326
Marion, whenever possible
I want to see you,

27
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,330
and under any conditions,

28
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,298
even, uh, respectability.

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,527
You make respectability
sound so disrespectful.

30
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,625
No, I'm all for it.

31
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,530
Look, a couple years, I'll have
my father's debts paid off at the store.

32
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,043
And I told you, alimony stops as soon
as she gets married again.

33
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,444
Ohh. I haven't even been
married once yet.

34
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,041
Yeah, but when you do,
you'll swing.

35
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,388
So, let's get married.

36
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,756
You really wanna live
in a hardware store in Fairvale,
eat beans out of a can with me?

37
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,489
- Oh?
- Yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.

38
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,532
Tell you what--
When I send my ex-wife her money,

39
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,169
you can lick the stamps.

40
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,535
I'll lick the stamps.

41
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,842
Marion, you wanna cut this off,

42
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,437
go out and find yourself someone
who's, uh, available?

43
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,446
I'm thinkin' of it.

44
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,844
Don't you go break my heart, now.

45
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,584
Don't miss your plane.

46
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,682
Hey, wait.
We can leave together, can't we?

47
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,557
I'm late, and you have
to put your shoes on.

48
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,869
Is Mr. Lowery
back from lunch yet?

49
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,872
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris St. property.

50
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,875
- You know, the oil lease man?
- Right, right, right.

51
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,377
So, that's why he's late.

52
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,379
You getting a headache?

53
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,381
It'll pass.

54
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,385
Headaches are like resolutions..
You forget about 'em
as soon as they stop hurting.

55
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,614
You got aspirins?

56
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,489
I have something.
Not aspirins, but--

57
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,994
My mother's doctor gave these to me
on the day of my wedding.

58
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,089
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

59
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,134
Any calls?

60
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,138
Oh, Teddy called me, and my mother
called to see if Teddy called.

61
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,437
And, oh, your sister called to say she'd
be going to Tucson to do some buying...

62
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,034
and she'd be gone
the whole weekend, and--

63
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,113
Whoo!

64
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,115
Hot as fresh milk.

65
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,118
You girls oughta get your boss
to turn on the air-conditioning.

66
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,916
He can afford it today.

67
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,219
Marion, will you get those copies
of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

68
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,919
- Of course.
- Tomorrow's the day.

69
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,423
What a sweet little girl.

70
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,228
- Not you, darlin'. My daughter.
- Oh.

71
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:54,739
She's my baby, but tomorrow she stands
up there and gets married away from me.

72
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,776
Here, I'd like you
to have a look at my baby.

73
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,845
Eighteen years old,

74
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,552
and never known an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

75
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,782
Come on, Tom.
The air conditioner's on in my office.

76
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,153
You know what I do
with unhappiness?

77
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,158
I buy it off.

78
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,491
- You unhappy?
- Oh, not inordinately, no.

79
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,498
Oh.

80
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,870
I'm buyin' this house
as a wedding present for my baby.

81
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,895
Now, that's not buyin' happiness.

82
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,906
That's buyin' off unhappiness, see?

83
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,737
Yes, sir.

84
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,507
Four hundred thousand dollars, cash.

85
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,139
Not to worry, now.

86
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,707
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose. Count 'em up.

87
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,516
- I declare!
- I don't.

88
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,647
That's how I'm able to keep it.

89
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:49,525
Tom, uh, cash transactions of this size,
uh-- most irregular.

90
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,725
Yeah, well, so what?
It's my private money. Now it's yours.

91
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,233
Suppose we just
put this in the safe,

92
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,238
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good--

93
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,333
Speaking of feeling good,
what happened to that bottle
you said you had in your desk?

94
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,645
Mmm.

95
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:13,344
You know, sometimes I can
keep my mouth shut.

96
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,547
Lowery, I'm dyin'
of thirst-a-roonie here.

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,861
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

98
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,057
Put it the safe deposit box
at the bank.

99
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,363
- We'll get him to give us
a check on Monday instead.
- Okay.

100
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,765
Oh! Ahh.

101
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,281
He was flirting with you.

102
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,417
Guess he must have noticed
my wedding ring.

103
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,489
Uh-huh.

104
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,492
Lowery.

105
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,897
Come in.

106
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,035
- The copies.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,038
If you don't mind, I'd like to go
right on home after the bank.

108
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,041
- l-I'm feeling a slight headache.
- You go ahead on home.

109
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,011
Me and your boss are gonna go out and
get ourselves a little drinkin' done.

110
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,014
Of course.
Do you feel ill?

111
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,516
Oh, it's just--
just a little headache.

112
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,248
You need a weekend in Las Vegas.
Playground of the world.

113
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,415
I'm gonna spend the weekend in bed.
Thank you.

114
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,551
Only playground
to beat Las Vegas.

115
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,020
Mmm.

116
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,686
Marion, what--
what are you doin' up here?

117
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,693
Where in the world did you get
all that money?

118
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:14,129
Y eah. It's more than I need
to get out of debt.

119
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,067
So I said, "Sandy,

120
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,472
you see anything there you haven't
at least had a fifth of before?"

121
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,477
Sandy looks all up and down--

122
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,910
Sandy looks all up and down the bar,
and he says, "No."

123
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,663
5-27, you comin' in 10-1?

124
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,364
5-31, try again in your new location.

125
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,082
21-13, are you available
for check five duty?

126
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,583
Hold it right there.

127
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,256
- In quite a hurry.
- Y es.

128
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,228
I-I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

129
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,562
I almost had an accident last night
from, from, uh, sleepiness,

130
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,125
so I decided to pull over.

131
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,661
- You slept here all night?
- Y es.

132
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,708
As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open, so--

133
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,108
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've--

134
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,738
I mean, just to be safe.

135
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,251
- I just pulled over.
Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,811
- Then I'm free to go?
- Is anything wrong?

137
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,824
There's nothing wrong,

138
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,827
except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

139
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,829
Now, just a moment.

140
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,559
Turn your motor off, please.

141
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,536
May I see your license
and registration?

142
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,439
- Why?
- Please.

143
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,202
Have a nice day.

144
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,599
Hey, Larry!
How soon do you want this?

145
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,301
Pick up line one.

146
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,607
It's about time.

147
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,598
O.B.'s working on that.

148
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,944
Be with you in a second!

149
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,069
5-28, was that Victor-Charlie-Bravo?

150
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,869
5-28, 10-4.
Victor-Charlie-Bravo.

151
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,518
I'm in no mood for trouble.

152
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,520
What?

153
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,523
There's an old saying
that the first customer of the day...

154
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,525
is always the most trouble.

155
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,528
But I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna
treat you so fair and square...

156
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,030
you're not gonna have
one human reason--

157
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,533
Can I trade in my car
and take another?

158
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,037
You can do anything you have a mind to.
Bein' a woman, you will.

159
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,039
- Is that yours?
- Yes. Yes.

160
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,702
- There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just--
- Sick of the sight of it.

161
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,941
Well, have a look around, see if there's
anything that strikes your eye.

162
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,109
Meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

163
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,812
I was just about to make some coffee.
You want some--

164
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,652
No, I'm in a hurry. I just wanna make
the change and start--

165
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:16,160
A person ought not to be in a hurry,
but it's too nice a day to argue.

166
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,163
So, I'll just shoot your car
in the garage.

167
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,165
O.B.!

168
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,234
Y eah, boss?

169
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,042
- What's up?
- Can you take this one,
give it the once-over?

170
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,011
Sure. No problem.
I'll give it the standard.

171
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,316
Say, that's the one
I'd have picked for you myself.

172
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,818
- How much?
- Go ahead. Spin it around.

173
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,048
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it looks fine.

174
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,920
How much will it be
with my car?

175
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,425
- You don't want the usual
day-and-a-half to think it over?
- No.

176
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,157
- You are in a hurry.
Somebody chasin' ya?
- Well, of course not.

177
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,166
Please.

178
00:18:55,234 --> 00:19:00,331
Well, that's the first time I ever saw
the customer high-pressure the salesman.

179
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,432
But I figure, uh, roughly,

180
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,340
your car plus...

181
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,175
four thousand?

182
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,841
Four thousand.
Four thousand.

183
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,444
Ah, you got time
to argue price, though, huh?

184
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,147
All right.
Four thousand dollars.

185
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,659
I take it, uh, you can prove that
that car is yours.

186
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,355
- I mean, out of state license and all.
- I have all the necessary papers.

187
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,956
- ls-- Is there a ladies' room?
- l-ln the building.

188
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Thank you.

189
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,163
Hey!

190
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,600
Forgot your bag.

191
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,971
Put 'em in the back, please.

192
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,716
Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer...

193
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,717
high-pressure the salesman.

194
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,719
Is somebody chasin' her?

195
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,722
I'd better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

196
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,191
- She look like a bad one to you?
- Acted like one.

197
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,685
Funny thing is,
she paid me in cash.

198
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,908
Y es, Mr. Lowery?

199
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,911
Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

200
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,608
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

201
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,915
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

202
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,615
Call her sister.
If no one's answering at the house--

203
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,625
I called her sister where she works--
Hard Core Vinyl Record Store.

204
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,628
She doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

205
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,630
Run out to the house.

206
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,633
She may be unable to answer the phone.

207
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,932
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

208
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,340
No, I haven't
the faintest idea.

209
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,344
I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

210
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,849
She said she didn't feel well, wanted
to leave early and I said she could.

211
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,217
That was the last I saw--
Wait a minute.

212
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,222
I did see her some time later, driving.

213
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,919
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

214
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,122
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

215
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,597
Quick.

216
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,897
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $400,000.

217
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,905
I'll get it back,
and if any of it's missin'...

218
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,965
I'll replace it
with her fine, soft flesh.

219
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,977
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

220
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,673
A girl works for you for ten years,
you trust her.

221
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,683
It must be some kind of a mystery.
I can't--

222
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,686
Check with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her.

223
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,688
You still trust her?
Hot creepers, man.

224
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,691
She sat there while I dumped it out,
hardly even looked at it,

225
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,956
plannin', and even flirtin' with me.

226
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,395
You trust her.

227
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,634
Gee, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't hear you in all this rain.

228
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,645
Go on in, please.

229
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,609
- It's a dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

230
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,847
Oh, we have 12, in fact.

231
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,856
Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies.

232
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,951
They moved away the highway.

233
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,520
- Oh, I thought I had gotten
off the main road.
- I knew you must've.

234
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,534
No one ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

235
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,161
Oh.

236
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,172
Ah, but it's no use
dwelling on our losses.

237
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,041
We just keep on lightin' the lights
and following the formalities.

238
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,846
Uh, and, uh,
your home address.

239
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,249
Town will do.

240
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,648
Los Angeles.

241
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,062
Cabin one.

242
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,691
It's closer, in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.

243
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,964
Oh, I want sleep more than
anything else. Except maybe food.

244
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:16,463
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside Fairvale.

245
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,874
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles.

246
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,004
I'll get your bags for you.

247
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,235
Uh, it's stuffy in here.

248
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,604
Well, the mattress is soft,
and there's hangers in the closet,

249
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,613
and there's stationery
with "Bates Motel" written on it,

250
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,616
just in case you want to make
your friends back home envious.

251
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,515
Ah. Mmm.

252
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,712
And, um,

253
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,722
uh, the, uh--

254
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,125
Over there.

255
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,650
- The bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,666
If you want anything at all just tap on
the wall, 'cause I'll be in the office.

257
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,532
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.
- Norman Bates.

258
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,573
- You have something
that most girls don't have.
- I have?

259
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,442
There's not a name for it, but it's
something that puts a person at ease.

260
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,581
Well, thank you again.

261
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,278
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to that diner, are you?

262
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,048
- No.
- Would you do me a favor, then?

263
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,056
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.

264
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,887
Nothing special.
Just sandwiches and milk.

265
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,629
But I'd like it if you came up
to the house.

266
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,588
I don't set a fancy table or anything,
but, uh, the kitchen's awful homey.

267
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,338
- I'd like to.
- All right.

268
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,541
Well, then you get settled in,
take off your wet shoes...

269
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,544
and I'll be back
as soon as it's ready...

270
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,444
with my trusty umbrella.

271
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,822
No, I tell you! No!

272
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,121
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper.

273
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,217
By candlelight, I suppose,

274
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,264
in the cheap, erotic fashion
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

275
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,266
Mother, please!

276
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,268
And then what?

277
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,270
After supper, music?
Whispers?

278
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,636
Mother, she's just a stranger.

279
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,267
She's hungry,
and it's raining out.

280
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,244
"Mother, she was just a stranger."

281
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,747
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if--

282
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,249
Well, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

283
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,252
Do you understand, boy?

284
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:54,951
Go on. Tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite
with my food or my son.

285
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,962
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

286
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,191
Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,699
Shut up!

288
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,237
I've caused you
some trouble.

289
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:43,537
No, uh, Mother--
my mother--

290
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,541
Oh, what's the phrase?

291
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,511
She isn't quite herself today.

292
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,349
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

293
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,353
I-I really don't have that much
of an appetite.

294
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,355
Uh, I'm sorry.

295
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,324
I wish I could apologize
for other people.

296
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,327
Don't worry about it.

297
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,334
Well, as long as
you've fixed us supper,

298
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,030
we might as well eat it, huh?

299
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,778
It might be nicer and warmer...

300
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,785
in the office.

301
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,301
It's stopped raining.

302
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:53,367
Eating in an office is just...
too officious.

303
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,777
I have the parlor back here.

304
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,433
Sit down.

305
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,644
Thank you.

306
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,805
You're very kind.

307
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,610
Oh, it's all for you.

308
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,619
Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

309
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,558
You eat like a bird.

310
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,564
You would know, of course.

311
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,566
Not really.

312
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,570
I hear that the expression
"eats like a bird" is really a falsity,

313
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,664
because birds really eat
a tremendous lot.

314
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,835
I don't really know
anything about birds.

315
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,538
My hobby is stuffing things.

316
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,673
You know-- taxidermy.

317
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,186
Yeah. Yeah, l-l-I guess
I'd rather stuff birds,

318
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:16,160
well, because I hate the look
of beasts when they're stuffed.

319
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
You know?

320
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,756
Foxes and chimps?

321
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,699
Some people even stuff dogs and cats.
I couldn't do that.

322
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,606
No, l-l-I think only birds
look well stuffed...

323
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,700
because, um, they're kind of passive
to begin with.

324
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,244
That's a strange hobby.
Curious.

325
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,940
It's uncommon too.

326
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,349
I imagine so.

327
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,353
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really.

328
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,447
Uh, needles, thread, sawdust.

329
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,085
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

330
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,096
A man should have a hobby.

331
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,462
Oh, it's more than a hobby.

332
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,467
A hobby's supposed to pass your time,
not fill it.

333
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,400
Is your time so empty?

334
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,962
No. I run the office.

335
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,975
Tend the cabins, grounds.

336
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,477
Do little errands
for my mother,

337
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,208
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

338
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,114
Don't you go out
w-with friends?

339
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,085
Uh, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

340
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,894
You haven't had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

341
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,895
Only my share.

342
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,931
Where are you goin'?

343
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,327
I didn't mean to pry.

344
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,599
I'm looking for
a private island.

345
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,301
What are you running away from?

346
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,503
Why--
Why do you ask that?

347
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,006
No.

348
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,209
People never run away
from anything.

349
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,322
Rain didn't last long, did it?

350
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,120
You know what I think?

351
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,127
I think we're all in our private traps,
clamped in 'em.

352
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,528
We can never get out.

353
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:05,229
Oh, we scratch and claw,
but only at the air,

354
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,566
only at each other.

355
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:12,234
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

356
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,336
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

357
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,748
I was born into mine.

358
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,985
But I don't mind it anymore.

359
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,284
Well, you should.
You should mind.

360
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,759
I do.

361
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,387
I just--
I say that I don't.

362
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,401
Y-You know, if anyone
ever spoke to me...

363
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,869
the way I heard--
the way she talked to you, l--

364
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,168
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that,

365
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,179
I feel like I could curse her out
and leave her forever.

366
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,181
Or at least defy her.

367
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,012
Well, but I know I can't.

368
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,019
She's ill.

369
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,816
She sounded strong.

370
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,723
Uh, no.
I mean, ill.

371
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,359
She had to raise me all by herself
after my father died.

372
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,867
I was only five.
Must've been quite a strain for her.

373
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,429
It's not like she had to go to work
or anything like that.

374
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,439
H-He left her a little money.

375
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,668
Anyway, um,

376
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:22,338
a few years ago
Mother met this man.

377
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,381
He talked her into
building this motel.

378
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,884
He could've talked her
into anything.

379
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,452
And when he died too,
it was just--

380
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
just too great of a shock for her.

381
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,164
And the way that he died--

382
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:46,368
I-I guess it's nothing you should be
talking about when you're eating.

383
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,770
But, anyway, uh,

384
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,775
it was just too great
of a loss for her...

385
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,472
and, you know,
she had nothin' left.

386
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,882
Except you.

387
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,873
Yeah.

388
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,077
A son's a poor substitute
for a lover.

389
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,748
Why don't you go away?

390
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,951
- To a private island, like you?
- No. No.

391
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,554
Not like me.
Just--

392
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,000
I couldn't do that.

393
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,867
Who'd take care of her?

394
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,499
She'd be all alone up there.

395
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,667
The fire'd go out.

396
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,770
It'd be cold and damp,

397
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,779
Iike a grave.

398
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,519
If you love someone,
you can't do that to 'em.

399
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,889
Even if you hate 'em.

400
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,326
Understand, l--

401
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,596
I don't hate her.

402
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,998
I hate what she's become.

403
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,298
I hate the illness.

404
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,198
Well, wouldn't it be better...

405
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,207
i-if y-- if you--

406
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,305
if you put her someplace or--

407
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,215
Do you mean an institution?

408
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,344
A madhouse?

409
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:16,154
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

410
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,321
Put her in... someplace.

411
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:23,231
I'm sor--
I didn't mean to sound uncaring. I--

412
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,226
What do you know about caring?
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

413
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,240
The laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you?

414
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,037
My mother, in there?

415
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,340
She's harmless.

416
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,346
She's as harmless as one
of these stuffed birds.

417
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,246
I am sorry, l--

418
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,217
I on-- I only felt l--

419
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,415
- You felt what?
- It seemed that she was--
she's hurting you.

420
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,823
I-- I meant well.

421
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,496
People always mean well.

422
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,329
They cluck their thick tongues
and they shake their heads...

423
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:02,497
and they suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

424
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,679
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

425
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,687
I hate to think about it.
She needs me.

426
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,654
It's not as if she were a maniac
or a raving thing.

427
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,752
She just...

428
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,763
goes a little mad sometimes.

429
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,664
We all go a little mad sometimes.

430
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,667
Haven't you?

431
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,272
Y es.

432
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,273
Sometimes only one time
can be enough.

433
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,278
Thank you.

434
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,405
Oh, um--
Thank you, Norman?

435
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,083
Norman.

436
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,087
You're not goin' back
to your room already.

437
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,089
Oh, I'm very tired,

438
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,183
and I have a very long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

439
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,694
Really.

440
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,196
I stepped into
a private trap back there,

441
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,497
and I'd like to go and try
to pull myself out of it
before it's too late for me too.

442
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,503
Well, you sure you don't wanna stay
just a little while longer,

443
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,505
just for talk?

444
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,909
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

445
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,504
I'll bring you some breakfast.
What time?

446
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,550
Very early.
Dawn.

447
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,055
All right,
Miss, um, uh--

448
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,317
Crane.

449
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,326
Crane.
That's it.

450
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,328
Good night.

451
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,687
Mother?

452
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,851
Oh, God!
Blood! Blood!

453
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,894
Blood, blood,
blood, blood,

454
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,896
blood, blood,
blood, blood.
