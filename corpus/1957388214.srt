00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,991
Would that help?
You tell me.

175
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:49,511
Rand, I'm here for you
and for Connie, you know that?

176
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,751
You know, even when you're here,
you're distracted.

177
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,711
Do you spend any real time with her?
Yes, I do.

178
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,911
Look, I know you're nervous
about this boyfriend thing,

179
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,431

180

what I'm talking about.

exactly what you're talking about.

with Connie.

Hey, why don't we go out to dinner
next week, just the two of us?

184
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,391
Because you can't plan
a week ahead.

to you but with one car,

you coming over.

From what you've told me so far,

the State could charge
you with involuntary manslaughter.

noise about it being intentional.

you a medal.

Seriously, Honey,
I know we've talked

00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,070
about the physical part,
but it's an emotional step, too.

00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,630
It can be very confusing.

I'm not confused.
I'm not even thinking about it.

Charlotte Bedford is dead
for one reason.

848

Sibyl Danforth killed her,
pure and simple.

849
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,670
Now, the defence will tell
you that Sibyl Danforth

850
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,670
is a remarkable person,
an excellent wife and mother.

851
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,230
That's irrelevant.

852
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,230
What's relevant
is that her criminal recklessness

853
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,550
resulted in the death
of a 29-year-old wife and mother.

854
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,870
And her cavalier use
of a kitchen knife

855
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,390
means that a baby will never know

856
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,950
the woman
who should have raised him.

857
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,230
Now, the facts will show that from
the first moment that Charlotte

858
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,510
and Asa Bedford first sat down
with Sibyl Danforth she behaved

859
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,070
with this sort of
incomprehensible negligence

860
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,550
that could only result in tragedy.

861
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,550
Did Mrs Danforth consider
that a labouring woman

862
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:10,310
might be trapped in an isolated house

And in the early hours
of March 14th,

864
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,110
when she did realise
that Charlotte Bedford was in trouble

865
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,710
and trapped miles and miles
from the help she needed,

866
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,870
what did she do?

867
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:24,190
She had her push and push and push

868
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,390
hours beyond what any doctor
would have allowed.

869
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,710
Without anaesthesia.

870
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,630
Without pain killers.

871
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,790
She had her push so long,
she thought she'd killed her.

872
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,950
But she hadn't.

873
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,310
The fact is,
Charlotte Bedford didn't die

874
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,310
from her agonising ordeal.

875
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,030
She bled to death

876
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,630
because Mrs Danforth took a ten-inch
kitchen knife and cut her open.

879
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,230
Ladies and Gentlemen,

880
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:10,670
women have been having babies
at home since the beginning of time.

881
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,670
And they've been tended
by knowledgeable,

882
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,070
tireless and loving midwives
like Sibyl Danforth.

883
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,750
The State wants to talk facts?
OK. Let's do it.

884
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:28,910
Statistics show that today a planned
home delivery is every bit as safe

885
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:33,590
as a hospital one,
for mothers as well as for babies.

886
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:37,630
Statistically, Sibyl Danforth's
babies did every bit as well

887
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,390
as the ones born
in North County Hospital.

888
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,350
And the mothers did better.

889
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,990
That's right. Better.

890
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:50,670
The fact is that in all these years
of delivering hundreds of babies,

891
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,470
tending to hundreds of mothers,
one woman died.

892
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,510
Charlotte Bedford.

893
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,270
And don't misunderstand me,
that is a terrible tragedy.

894
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:07,390
And one that Sibyl Danforth
will mourn for the rest of her life.

895
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,470
But the fact is
that she did not act recklessly

896
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,350
and she did not kill anyone.

897
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,750
She saved someone.

898
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,310
Sibyl did what any decent
and courageous person

899
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,990
would do faced
with the same horrific choice.

900
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,830
Two deaths or one?

901
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,310
She rescued that baby
from his dead mother.

902
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,550
Ladies and Gentlemen,
that is not criminal negligence.

906
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:55,150
So, Dr Gerson, as an OB-GYN
and formerly a midwife,

907
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,710
how would you assess
Charlotte Bedford

908
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,310
as a candidate for home birth?

909
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,910
A tragedy waiting to happen.

910
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:06,470
She was frail, underweight,
anaemic and she had a history

911
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,270
of high blood pressure.
Thank you.

912
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,950
Would you say that pregnant
women are often anaemic?

913
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,710
Perhaps, to some degree.

914
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,470
And, as a doctor,
how would you treat that condition?

915
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,990
Iron tablets.
Ferrous sulphate, usually.

916
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,150
You reviewed Sibyl's records.
What did she do?

917
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,630
She gave her iron tablets.
And did her condition improve?

918
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,190
Yes, but...
Thank you.

919
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,430
I have a form detailing
Mrs Bedford's medical history.

920
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,670
Do you see the words,
"high blood pressure", circled?

921
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,230
No.
So, there's no indication

922
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,950
that Mrs Bedford confided
her history

923
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,270
of high blood pressure to Sibyl.

924
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,190
But she had it.

925
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,670
And bottom line, Counsellor,
no responsible person,

926
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,190
midwife or doctor,

927
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,910
would have allowed
Charlotte Bedford to labour at home.

928
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,070
Dr Gerson, you began as a midwife.

929
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,550
Why did you become a doctor?

930
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,910
Because I felt, as a midwife,
I wasn't adequately trained.

931
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,470
And do you feel that most midwife's
are inadequately trained?

932
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,550
Yes.

933
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,990
Do you feel that they should be
banned from delivering babies?

934
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,590
Yes, I do.

935
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,430
And so now you finally have
the chance to get rid

936
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,590
of at least one midwife, don't you?

937
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,630
Objection.
Withdrawn.

938
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,790
Now, Miss Heston,
did Mrs Danforth check

939
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,550
Charlotte for a pulse again
before she did the C-section?

940
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,670
No.

941
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,430
Did she do anything to confirm
Charlotte was dead?

942
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,750
No, Sir, not that I saw.

943
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,110
Thank you.

944
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:50,430
Miss Heston, prior to March 14th,

945
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,470
had you ever been
in an emergency situation?

946
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:58,910
Like what?
Anything? Car crash.

948
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,590

No, nothing like that.

950
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,190
Nothing. Do you know CPR?

951
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,750
A little bit. Uh, a few days
after Charlotte died...

952
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,590
Have you had any CPR training?

953
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,430
No.
No.

954
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,190
Have you ever seen an operation
prior to March 14th?

955
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,630
Uh, pictures...
Miss Heston, had you seen one?

(REPETITIVE TAPPING)

957
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:29,230

from a living or a dead body,
have you?

No.
No again.

you to make the wild assumption

961
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,830
that the blood you saw that night
was coming from a living woman?

962
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,790
It was the way that it spurted.

963

I didn't ask
what you thought you saw.

964

What in your background
lead you to believe

965
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,550
that based on the bleeding,
Mrs Bedford was alive?

966
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,150
You didn't see it, if you...

967
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,750

would you instruct the witness

led you to believe
that Mrs Bedford was alive?

be stricken from the record.

There's just
something that confuses me.

In your statement you say that you
were standing by the window.

01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,310
Was the sun up?

1006
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:20,550
Umm, I'm not sure.
It was still dark from the storm.

1007
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,550
So, the main light on the bed

1008
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,550
would have been
from the bedside lamp?

1009
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:28,710
Yes, but it was bright enough.
I could see Charlotte.

1010
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,790
And you believed she was dead?

1011
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,390
Yes, at the time.

1012
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,830
You loved your wife?
Oh, god, yes. Very much.

1013
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,390

Was it in that frame of mind

1016

that you thought you saw
the blood spurt?

01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:53,830

1020

Are you absolutely positive
that you saw blood spurt?

1021
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,750
Mr Bedford,
is that your sworn testimony?

1022
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,950
Umm, I'm not sure.

1023
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:26,190

So, Dr Tierney,
as County Medical Examiner,

1027
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,470
what did you find when you examined
Charlotte's reproductive organs?

1028
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:47,110
She'd had a placental abruption.
But it had started to clot over.

1029
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,830
So, that isn't what killed her?
No. But it left her weakened.

1030
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:52,830
In Sibyl Danforth's statement,
she said that Charlotte appeared

1031
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,830
to have had a stroke.
Is that the case?

1032
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:58,950
No. The brain would have shown
significant changes. It didn't.

1033
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:04,110
So, apart from this placental
abruption, what did you find?

1034
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,190
In my opinion, Mrs Bedford vagaled.

1035
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,110
Would you elaborate?
Yes, of course.

1036
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,030
Right here in the back of our heads

1037
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,910
is a pair of cranial nerves
called the vagus nerves.

1038
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,110
In layman's terms,
they help carry information

1039
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,950
from the heart to the brain.

1040
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:22,550
And in a particularly long labour,
and I'm speaking here

1041
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,590
of hours and hours
of very deep breathing,

1042
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:28,630
very, very hard work,
the brain can eventually go hypoxic,

1043
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,950
sort of shut down
from lack of oxygen.

1044
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,270
The heart will slow down,

1045
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,270
it could even stop,
and you pass out.

1046
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,830
Some doctors say you vagaled out.

1047
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,670
Can you die from this?
Yes, of course,

1048
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,910
if it's not treated.

1049
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,430
Was this lack of oxygen to the brain
the cause of death?

1050
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,750
No. I think Mrs Danforth's CPR
actually brought her back.

1051
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,470
What do you base this opinion on?

1052
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:53,670
There were close to 750ml
of blood in the abdomen.

1053
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,110
With such an extensive
loss of blood,

1054
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,830
the heart would have had
to be pumping.

1055
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,670
So, would it be correct to say
that Charlotte was alive

1056
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,550
when Mrs Danforth cut her open

1057
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,470
and that she subsequently
bled to death?

1058
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:07,030
In my opinion, yes,
that's what I stated in my report.

1059
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,510
Thank you.

1060
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,270
Dr Tierney,
you think Sibyl revived her?

1061
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:16,590
She must have.
There was too much blood.

1062
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,190
She must have.

1063
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,350
Do you have anything to support
this opinion?

1064
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:21,910
Nothing else is necessary.

1065
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,190
Dr Tierney, if you wanted
categorical proof

1066
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:26,270
that a woman died
during a C-section,

1067
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,550
how much blood would you expect
to find in the abdominal cavity?

1068
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:33,310
Categorically, perhaps 1,000ml.

1069
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,070
But you didn't find
that much, did you?

1070
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,630
No.
So, your opinion is based

1071
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,110
on a flawed hypothesis.

1072
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,230
Objection.

1073
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,830
Withdrawn.

1074
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,710
I have nothing further.

1075
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,950
Dr Tierney, in this case,

1076
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:50,350
considering all of your findings,
was 750ml enough blood to convince

1077
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,430
you that the Caesarean
was the cause of death?

1078
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,070
Yes. Most certainly.

1079
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,870

(GAVEL BANGS)

1084
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,670
So, Dr Hewitt,
you have no doubt

1085
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:14,070
that Charlotte Bedford was dead
when Sibyl operated?

1086
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:18,110
None whatsoever. It's absurd
to even ask the question.

1087
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,110
I've worked with Sibyl Danforth

1088
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,990
as her backup doctor
for close to a decade.

1089
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,510
She is an exceptional midwife.

1090
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:29,390
And if she tells me the woman
was dead, then she was.

1091
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,990
Unfortunately, I've had to perform
autopsies on several women

1092
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,990
who've died from Caesareans.

1093
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:38,710
And I've never seen
less than 1,100ml of blood

1094
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,470
in the peritoneal cavity.

1095
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:43,030
That's more than Dr Tierney found
in Mrs Bedford.

1096
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:48,070
Yes. Significantly.
A full pint, in fact.

1097
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,110
So, is it your opinion then, Doctor,

1098
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,270
that Mrs Bedford died
of lack of oxygen to the brain?

1099
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,550
It is.

1100
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,550
And that she was already dead
when Sibyl saved the baby?

1101
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,510
Absolutely.
Thank you.

I'd like to clarify.

that Mrs Bedford was dead,

We have, Your Honour.
No!

On the charge
of involuntary manslaughter,

you about the diaries.

Why don't you come
back to the house.

I don't think so. But thank you.

I couldn't have endured
this without you.

An OB-GYN.

1317
01:21:28,304 --> 01:21:31,424

Without that she knew her mothers
and their babies could be at risk.

1330
01:22:13,264 --> 01:22:15,744

she would give up anything...
