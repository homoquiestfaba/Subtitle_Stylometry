00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,233
OF COURSE I'M SURE.

184
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,770
ALL RIGHT. NOW, HE SAY
WHY HE HIT YOU, THEN?

185
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,889
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
HUH? YOU KNOW?

186
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,891
I TOLD HER, IF SHE
EVER SAW HIM AGAIN,

187
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,893
I WAS GONNA KICK
THE SHIT OUT OF HER,

188
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,897
AND SHE DID,
SO I AM, BROTHER.

189
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,363
YOU ARE WHAT?

190
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,649
I'M GONNA KICK
THE SHIT OUT OF HER.

191
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,902
DON'T MAKE THREATS
IN FRONT OF ME, GODDAMN IT.

192
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,672
NO, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

193
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:57,682
I DIDN'T JUST DO IT.
I HAD MY REASONS, MAN.

194
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,658
AND THERE WAS THIS GUY
IN THIS DREAM I HAD,

195
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,125
BUT WE WEREN'T
DOING ANYTHING.

196
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,661
HE WAS JUST THERE.
HE WAS JUST IN MY FUCKING DREAM,

197
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,479
AND THEN HE HIT ME.

198
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,797
BECAUSE OF A DREAM?

199
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,765
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

200
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,301
SO, CARLA, LISTEN.
IF YOU KNEW HE WAS GONNA GET MAD,

201
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,303
THEN WHY'D YOU EVEN
MENTION IT TO HIM?

202
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,171
IT JUST CAME UP.

203
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,306
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MATTER?

204
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,308
HEY, YOU WATCH
THE LANGUAGE NOW. I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

205
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,427
I'VE ARRESTED YOU
BEFORE, HAVEN'T IT?

206
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,929
YELLOW ROSE BAR?

207
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,182
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'D I DO?

208
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,683
FIGHTING?

209
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,283
THAT'S RIGHT.
LAST MONTH.

210
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,285
SHIT, THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

211
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,822
THAT'S THE GUY WHO
WAS SCREWING AROUND WITH MY GIRL.

212
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,289
THAT'S THE GUY.

213
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,442
HE'S THE ONE I FUCKED UP
THAT NIGHT, BROTHER.

214
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,445
THE ONE YOU FUCKED UP
THAT NIGHT.

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,411
YEAH.

216
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,448
WELL, I MUST'VE BROUGHT
THE OTHER GUY IN, THEN, NOT YOU.

217
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,449
I MUST'VE BROUGHT
THE OTHER GUY IN

218
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,450
BECAUSE THE GUY
I BROUGHT IN

219
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,451
WAS THE FUCKED UP ONE.

220
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,836
YEAH?

221
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,804
HE WAS FUCKED UP
ENOUGH.

222
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,091
ON TOP OF THAT,
HE WASN'T SCREWING YOUR WIFE.

223
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,058
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

224
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,595
ACTUALLY, I RECALL HIM
SAYING SOMETHING ELSE TO PISS YOU OFF.

225
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,098
HUH?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

226
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,218
HE SAID HE WAS
IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE.

227
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,604
HA HA!

228
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:04,106
OH, HERE IT IS.

229
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,072
HE SAID,

230
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:08,110
"I WOULDN'T
TOUCH YOUR WIFE IN HER DREAMS."

231
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,076
ACTUALLY, I
REMEMBER HIM SAYING

232
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,613
HE WOULDN'T
PISS ON HER IF SHE WAS ON FIRE,

233
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,116
BUT THEN YOU HIT HIM.

234
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,082
I MEAN--

235
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,620
YOU TRIED
TO SHITCAN THAT GUY.

236
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,873
HE COULD'VE
TAKEN OUT 12 OF YOU.

237
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,090
NO, NO. SEE...

238
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,627

I BROUGHT IN THAT NIGHT, BROTHER.

239
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,095

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

242
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,137
LET'S TAKE HIM IN.
LET'S TAKE VICTOR IN.

243
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,639
SHE CLOCKED HIM
WITH A BOTTLE.

244
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,141
SELF-DEFENSE, MAN.

245
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:43,145
I DON'T THINK
HE HIT HER AT ALL.

246
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,646
LET'S GET THIS DONE.

247
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,150

250
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:55,372
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

251
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,358
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE DOES TO ME.

252
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,325
Francis:
SHUT UP, CARLA.

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,362
