1
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,693
That's her, all right.

2
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,561
Captain...

3
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:30,030
Why don't we
just go in there
and pull her out?

4
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,066
It's the mayor's
daughter, Harris.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,001
One false move
and the whole thing
crumbles.

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,338
The ransom note said
the place was booby-trapped.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,807
We go waltzing in there,
house goes boom,

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,742
dead mayor's daughter.
Not on my watch.

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,777
I guess it's up
to Garrett now.

10
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,579
Unfortunately.

11
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,915
You don't think he's up to it?

12
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,117
It's a simple money exchange.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,884
He takes the money
to the warehouse.

14
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,655
The kidnappers
tell us the safe way in.
Yeah, he's up to it.

15
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,824
The problem is,
he'll do it his way.

16
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,060
Sam Garrett always
has to do it his way.

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,995
Man:
we should keep
all the money,

18
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,331
let that little bitch
stew inside the house.

19
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,766
No way.
We don't fuck
the boss.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,803
We follow the plan,
or it's our asses.

21
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,250
How are you doing?

22
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,955
I wasn't supposed to hear
that little interchange,
was I?

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,957
Well, you know,
actually...

24
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,428
What the fuck
was that?

25
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,496
Come on.
Let's check it.

26
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,171
( engine starts )

27
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,845
Go, go!

28
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,297
Is this Compton or East LA?

29
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,733
Gotta be Compton.

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,490
( gunfire continues )

31
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,037
( hissing )

32
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,923
Aaah!

33
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,766
Something's wrong.
I can feel it.

34
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,535
( horn honking )

35
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,937
( honking )

36
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,567
( gunfire )

37
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,710
This is not good.

38
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,387
That's it!
I'm moving to Lauderdale!

39
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,459
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

40
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,028
I don't know.

41
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,737
I can't see her anymore.

42
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,379
( helicopter overhead )

43
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,915
You didn't make the exchange.

44
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,883
I don't have time to explain.

45
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,119
- You're ad-libbing again,
Sam.
- Yeah, I know.

46
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,054
- Is the girl still in there?
- We don't know.

47
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,990
I would like to know why
you've chosen once again
to directly disobey...

48
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,059
Where the hell do you think
you're going?!

49
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,830
Son of a...

50
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,375
( helicopter whirrs )

51
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,170
( muffled noise )

52
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,676
( ringing )

53
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,945
( ringing )

54
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,784
Oh, you bastards.
Fuck the boss.

55
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,120
Sam:
My, my, my.

56
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,956
What language
you young people use.

57
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,627
You learn
to talk like that
in private school?

58
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,562
Or just how
to shake down
your old man?

59
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,131
- A phony kidnap scheme.
- Do you know who I am?

60
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,766
I'm the fucking
mayor's daughter.

61
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,367
You have the right
to remain silent,

62
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,669
which I suggest
you do.

63
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,805
- You can't do this to me!
- Well, I'm doing it.

64
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,007
What is it?
You get the call
after the money drop,

65
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,442
disappear,
and then it's "missing
and presumed dead"?

66
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,478
Is that it?

67
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,346
There's a bomb
on that table.

68
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,348
I know it's a bomb.
I've seen millions
of these.

69
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,017
Look... Start, stop.

70
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,052
Stop.

71
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,922
No stop?

72
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,261
Get down!
Get down!

73
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,596
Here they come.

74
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,098
Sam:
get down!

75
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,212
( people yelling )

76
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,419
What the fuck
is going on?

77
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,688
Get the cuffs
off of her.

78
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,289
Captain, she staged
this whole thing.

79
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,158
- They're hurting me.
- Shut up.

80
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,293
That's the mayor's daughter.
The kidnap victim.

81
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,263
You got proof?
You got witnesses? Anything?

82
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,132
- Where's my father?
- I said, shut up.

83
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,500
Captain...

84
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,772
Captain, listen.

85
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm going through
a transitional period
in my life right now.

86
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,181
I need to know that both
emotionally and financially,

87
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,349
I'm going to have
the continued

88
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,986
and unwavering
support of the LAPD.

89
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,254
- You're full of shit.
- I know.

90
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,924
I've got no options.
I've got to investigate.

91
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,026
It's political.
She's the mayor's daughter.

92
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,995
That's what she said
when she blew up the house.

93
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,330
Take unpaid suspension,
collect unemployment.

94
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,332
That's the best I can do
until I sort this out.

95
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,534
Let me take the case
and I can sort it out.

96
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,504
- I can't do that!
- There's perps out there
with submachine guns!

97
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,872
She wasn't
in this thing alone.

98
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,809
Sam, you'd be a hell of a cop
except for one thing...

99
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,344
You do not know
when to quit.

100
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,879
Where's my dad?

101
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,048
Both:
Shut up!

102
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,277
( ringing )

103
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,880
Yeah.

104
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,016
Female voice:
this is Ready Credit
calling for Sam Garrett.

105
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,752
( fake Chinese accent )
Oh... Mr. Garrett,
he no here!

106
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,354
He go very far away!

107
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,156
Long, long trip!

108
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,125
Two, maybe
three month! Yeah.

109
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,627
Call back two,
maybe three month.
Thank you. Bye bye.

110
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,963
Female voice:
I need to leave him
a message, sir.

111
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,932
( wrapper crinkling )

112
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,561
Go away!
Nobody's home.

113
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,475
Breaking and entering
is against the law,
you know.

114
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,743
Want a beer?

115
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,047
You need to upgrade
your lifestyle a bit.

116
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,382
I can't
afford a lifestyle,
thanks to you.

117
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,019
What's the story
on the mayor's daughter?

118
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,454
Nothing.

119
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,390
She's in therapy.
We can't get at
the case files.

120
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,392
So basically,
I'm screwed.

121
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,330
Be patient, son.
In the meantime,

122
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,466
I've got
a proposition
for you.

123
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,768
How would you
like to become
a big TV star?

124
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,004
"The world's drunkest
out-of-work cops"?

125
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,338
Captain:
I'm serious, Sam.

126
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,940
I've got a friend
who's producing

127
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,508
one of these new
reality TV shows.

128
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,111
You know, a bunch of idiots
stuck on an island together.

129
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,847
I know.
The winner gets to be
on "Celebrity Checkers"

130
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,916
and the loser goes
on the Shopping Channel.

131
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,751
I don't think so,
Ellis.

132
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,120
Look.

133
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,655
His cast is not playing well
with the test audiences.

134
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,024
They're not heroic enough.

135
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,426
He thought if he could add
a real live, red-blooded,

136
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,696
all-American cop into
the mix, he could improve
his demographics.

137
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,033
He asked me
if I could spare one.
You I can spare.

138
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,668
What's the pay?

139
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,471
The grand prize
is 10 million bucks...

140
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,606
If you win.

141
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,943
Plus, you get 30 grand
to spend one week

142
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,378
in a tropical
Pacific paradise.

143
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,214
Why me?
What's the catch?

144
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,550
There's no catch.
The producer is
a friend of mine.

145
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:19,259
That's very nice, Captain.
I appreciate your generosity.

146
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,294
But what's in it
for you?

147
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,332
All right.

148
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,235
The same producer has
made me a tentative offer.

149
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,137
You've got to keep this
to yourself.

150
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,073
My landlord
and I aren't speaking.
Who am I going to tell?

151
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:37,177
I am going to be
the new host

152
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,779
of "The World's Biggest
Police Busts."

153
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,516
It's a great salary,
it's a nice nest egg.

154
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,254
Do me this favor,
and I will find a way

155
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,724
to get you back on the force,
with full back pay.

156
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,862
Let me think
about it.

157
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,998
( phone rings )

158
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,769
Recording:
This is Garrett,
leave a message.

159
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,306
Female voice:
This is the Acme Finance
Company, Mr. Garrett.

160
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,041
We would appreciate it
if you'd call us...

161
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,109
( machine stops )

162
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,748
What's the show called?

163
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,018
"Treasure Hunt."

164
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,061
Host:
A tropical island...
Beautiful sandy beaches,

165
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,297
fabulous Pacific sunsets,

166
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,700
waves lapping upon
silky untrodden shores.

167
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,835
And hidden somewhere
among it all...

168
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,438
$10 million in cash.

169
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,440
Now, let's meet
our contestants:

170
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,042
here comes Mindi Rain,

171
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,777
professional fashion model
from Chicago;

172
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:49,216
John Turner,
a security guard from Texas.

173
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,951
The lovely Tina Mason

174
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,987
works in a Los Angeles
used record store

175
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,723
and rescues stray dogs
in her spare time.

176
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,359
Phillip Edwards,
retired Navy SEAL

177
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,628
with three tours
of duty in Vietnam,

178
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,797
and the beautiful Kim Nelson,
a teacher from New York

179
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,799
who owns her own school.

180
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,801
How about that Steven Chaney?

181
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,605
A newspaper reporter
with a degree in English
Literature.

182
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,707
Susan Billings,
a stockbroker

183
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,743
and marathon runner,

184
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,212
and a genuine American hero,

185
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:22,049
detective Sam Garrett,
on special leave

186
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,084
from the LAPD.

187
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:30,123
Modern day pirates,
stranded on a deserted island.

188
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:34,561
One week to stay alive,
or maybe die trying.

189
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:38,565
And they're all here
for... A "Treasure Hunt"!

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,935
That's right.

191
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,737
I like that.

192
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,573
God, we look great.

193
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,608
Speak for yourself.

194
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,511
I don't know, I thought
you looked stunning.

195
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,846
Yeah, really hot.

196
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,782
Why don't you boys
put your brains

197
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,684
back in your pants,
where they belong,

198
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,486
and we'll all
get along just fine.

199
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:05,525
- Thanks for the help, pal.
- What did I say?

200
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,494
( glass clinking )

201
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,096
You people...

202
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,999
The most famous people
on network television.

203
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,069
In less than 24 hours,
you're gonna be marooned

204
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,605
on a beautiful
island paradise.

205
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,941
And here's
executive producer,
Stuart McMahon,

206
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,743
to tell you why.

207
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,545
- Thanks, Jack.
- You bet.

208
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,680
And thank all of you
for joining our treasure hunt.

209
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,782
I'm very glad you're here.

210
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,553
And I think
we all know why we've come.

211
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,655
For $10 million,
in cash,

212
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,057
buried somewhere
on Palm Key Island.

213
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,093
You will all be given
treasure maps

214
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,595
with certain
key clues missing,

215
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:46,233
and a piece of parchment,
with a pirate's poem.

216
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,335
These final clues,
they might be the ones

217
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,937
that help you land
the treasure.

218
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,939
It's all in
your travel bags.

219
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,175
Good hunting,

220
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,210
and try to stay alive.

221
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,447
What do they mean,
"try to stay alive"?

222
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,515
I wasn't aware of anything
in our contract

223
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,185
that would allow you to put us
in any kind of danger.

224
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,587
No, no. It's all
in good fun, Ms. Mason.

225
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,556
- Jack, explain.
- Certainly, Stu.

226
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,924
We have hired our own...

227
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,560
"Pirates."

228
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,163
They're ex-Navy SEALs,

229
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,864
and their job
is to take you all

230
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,066
out of the hunt.

231
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,402
They're silent and deadly.

232
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,939
You will not hear a sound
until they take you down.

233
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,808
You sure this isn't cable?

234
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,577
Oh, no.
It's perfectly harmless.

235
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,645
They carry paintball guns.

236
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,514
The paintballs
just sting a little bit.

237
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,450
Besides,
we can't really
let them kill you,

238
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,652
because this show airs
during the family hour.

239
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,823
That's it folks.
Eat, drink, enjoy...

240
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,294
This is the last good meal
you're gonna have in days.

241
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,030
Congratulations.

242
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,466
Can I talk to you
for a minute, Stuart?

243
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,001
Yeah, sure.

244
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,579
If this is about
another cash advance...

245
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:07,814
- No, no, Stu.
- Forget it.

246
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,183
I'm not helping you out
of any more financial messes.

247
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,684
I got you this job,
that's enough.

248
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,621
I'm not going to ask you
for more money, Stu.

249
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,524
I've got everything
taken care of now.

250
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:21,928
I want to thank you...
For your generosity.

251
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:28,635
Okay. That's fine.
I'm glad to do it.

252
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,703
Anyway, get to bed,
all right?

253
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,872
You've got a busy day
tomorrow.

254
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,877
Everything's
taken care of, Stu.

255
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,881
Thank you.

256
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,383
Thanks.

257
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:48,421
I'm sorry
about that exchange
at the table.

258
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,190
I got a little annoyed
at that Turner guy.

259
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,926
That's all right.
He just had too much to drink.

260
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,895
As a matter of fact,
so have I.

261
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,465
You meant well
and it was a nice
thing to say.

262
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,200
I shouldn't have
overreacted.

263
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,003
It's the world we live in.
If I had done that
in the workplace,

264
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,072
you could have me fired
for sexual harassment.

265
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,476
For the next week,
this is the workplace.

266
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,379
And in my office you can
say anything you'd like.

267
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,113
It just better be good.

268
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,783
I'll do my best.

269
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,187
So, why are you doing this?

270
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,690
I was running low
on beer and hot dogs.

271
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,927
How about you?
Looking for your 15 minutes?

272
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,962
Maybe.

273
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,238
This is gonna be
a boatload of fun.

274
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,055
You folks ready
to get it on?

275
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,526
Turner:
this isn't exactly
what I expected.

276
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,401
This isn't
what we saw last night.

277
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,003
Can't we wait
until it's nice?

278
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:14,474
You want nice?
Go on vacation.

279
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,977
This is
national television.
We got six days.

280
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,013
That helicopter is heading
to the other side
of the island,

281
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:24,617
where the showers,
the wet bar,
and the hot food are located.

282
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:28,020
The first to find the treasure
gets to enjoy that side,

283
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:31,190
until the chopper
takes you back
to civilization.

284
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,026
Some of us have jet lag
and a little hangover.

285
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,162
What's to keep us from hiking
to the other side

286
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,264
and taking a nap
and a shower?

287
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,132
We do have you outnumbered.

288
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,335
And we sign the paychecks.

289
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,672
Remember that. Play along.
Enjoy yourselves.

290
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,475
The crew and I will stay
with you at base camp,

291
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,377
through the trees.

292
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,011
And I can promise you
that our huts,

293
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,013
well, at least mine,

294
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,015
is just a little bit nicer
than yours.

295
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,884
How nice?

296
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,052
We have to maintain climate
control in my hut.

297
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,721
That's where
the satellite uplink

298
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,223
is located
for the day's tape.

299
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,659
We're going to be shooting
videotape of all of you

300
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,629
as you get used
to your surroundings
and start the treasure hunt.

301
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,499
I promise you.
You're gonna forget
we're even there.

302
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,234
All right?
Let's make some TV!

303
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,404
Come on!

304
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,171
Watch it up ahead.
It's narrow, okay?

305
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,441
I don't want to lose
any of you right off the bat.

306
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,545
Let's go!

307
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:29,248
- Come on! Move it!
- We're coming!

308
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,884
How are you gonna survive
a week like this?

309
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,098
What's with all these huts?

310
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,568
Why so many?
There must be 50 of them.

311
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,771
Ladies and gentleman,
these huts were built for
last year's

312
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:28,608
multimillion dollar
blockbuster hit...

313
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,910
"Monkey See, Monkey Do."

314
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,981
- I hated that movie.
- At least they're
still standing.

315
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:38,417
All right, it's time for you
to split into teams.

316
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,587
Start strategizing.

317
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,722
Let's find some treasure!

318
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,256
Strategizing?

319
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,926
That's probably
the longest word he knows.

320
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,628
All right, teams,
come on.

321
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,362
This is going to be
a piece of cake.

322
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,666
I've seen guys like this
in the service.
They're wimps.

323
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,435
Since you've made me
the team leader,

324
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,404
I think we should
come up with a plan.

325
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,940
If we're going to play,
we might as well play hard.

326
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:05,111
This is war.
Let's huddle up.

327
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,379
No touching.

328
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,281
Only my dogs
get to do that.

329
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,551
It's just instinct.
I'm a herding animal.

330
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,492
Relax.
He's being cute.

331
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,261
Gender traitor.

332
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,664
Oh, God!

333
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,334
I think she digs me.

334
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,369
It's a good start.

335
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,351
Julie?

336
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,087
- What satellite are we
bouncing off of?
- Westar 3.

337
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,623
I'm rolling
the show open now
for levels.

338
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,559
Give me
a schedule rundown.

339
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,994
7:00 p.m.... Jack sends
the unedited video

340
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,363
from today's tape to us
via satellite uplink.

341
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,667
We'll start cutting
into the first episode
for airing on Friday.

342
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,469
Jack does a live stand-up
Friday with the cast to close
the show.

343
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,437
And what about
tonight's show?

344
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,239
Tonight's episode
is a bio piece,

345
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,208
scheduled to promote
the Friday premiere.

346
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,777
So we've got
edited interviews,

347
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,279
B-rolls on contestants,
profiles, etcetera.

348
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,915
That's all tape.
I want something live tonight.

349
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,350
Already taken care of.
We'll cut to a live shot

350
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,887
of the island, followed
by some of today's tape.

351
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,923
Don't give away
any secrets.

352
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,225
No, no, it's video
of the contestants
on the beach,

353
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,027
moving into their huts,
stuff like that.

354
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,764
Call Jack. See if he can do
a live stand-up intro

355
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,299
to tonight's show.

356
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,167
More immediacy.
That's what we need.

357
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,670
I don't know if he can.
The island's got bars up.

358
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,907
I'm getting a little noise.
I can't guarantee a clean
signal.

359
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,643
- It must be the weather.
- I didn't know we were
expecting any.

360
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,580
All right, I'll go see Bill
at the forecast center.

361
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,615
All right.

362
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,685
Summer of 1968...
That was the last one?

363
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,486
All right.
Thanks, Danny.

364
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,555
All right, Bill.
Tell me some good news.

365
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,024
I've got my eye
on a system.

366
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,259
A big weather system
just east of Midway.

367
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,828
Is it a storm?

368
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,130
It will be as soon as
this small air mass

369
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:07,366
from the south hits
the main front... Then boom.

370
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,603
- But it's not a storm.
- No. Not yet.

371
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:12,338
Just give it time.

372
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,641
You just tell me when
it is a storm, will you?

373
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,143
The ratings
for the pre-show special
were through the roof.

374
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,779
I'll be damned
if I'm going to blow that
on a few drops of rain.

375
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,414
Hell, a typhoon will be good
for the ratings.

376
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,550
Big waves mean big numbers.

377
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,954
I'm not sure we can justify
risking people's lives
over ratings.

378
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,588
It ain't "we," it's me.

379
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,424
Our audience wants to see
these people in jeopardy.

380
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,861
They want to see the cast
picked off one by one.

381
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:37,563
And I always give
my audience what they want.

382
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,966
If you're not careful,
they're all gonna get

383
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,001
picked off that island,
at once.

384
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,026
Hey.

385
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,129
Drinking?

386
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,664
It gets me
through the day.

387
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,499
Day's over.

388
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,501
You see?
It works.

389
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,570
- What are you reading?
- It's Bloody Morgan's
biography.

390
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:21,841
He wrote it himself
in an English prison.

391
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,610
All these pirates
fancied themselves poets.

392
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,313
I guess on-board ship
there was nothing better
to do.

393
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,717
Except each other.
What's it got to do with us?

394
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,652
They like
to sprinkle clues

395
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,755
into the verses.

396
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,758
Like, "A place for
stout ship and sail,

397
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,228
where the four winds
never find.

398
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,697
Due west
from Kingston jail,

399
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,767
golden bounty
in kind."

400
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,003
It's a description of
a lagoon,
surrounded by palm trees,

401
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,039
off the coast
of Jamaica.

402
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,374
It's where Bloody Morgan's
treasure was buried.

403
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,543
The same kind of clues
in this parchment.

404
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,446
You think understanding
this pirate stuff

405
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,715
is gonna help you find
the treasure?

406
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,050
It could.

407
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:08,054
I don't know.
It's a theory.

408
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,189
But if I work
this out properly,

409
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,525
we could get to that treasure
before anyone else.

410
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,095
If I were you,
I'd keep it to myself.

411
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,832
You've got to be careful
what you say around here.

412
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,667
There's a lot of money
at stake.

413
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,707
As a cop you develop
an instinct about people?

414
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,310
Sort of a feeling
in your gut?

415
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,512
Sometimes.

416
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,849
Usually it just turns out
to be gas.

417
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:41,087
But I think it's still safe
to be suspicious of everybody.

418
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,756
As a matter
of fact,

419
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,591
for the next
couple of weeks,

420
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:49,161
I think
a little paranoia
is justifiable.

421
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,430
You know
what I mean?

422
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,701
Gotcha.

423
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,051
You really lord this police
stuff over all of us,
don't you?

424
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,354
Just because you're
team leader? I hate cops.

425
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,489
Everybody hates cops.

426
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,425
I hate cops.

427
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,328
I saw what you
did to that man.
You scared him to death.

428
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,762
Am I forgetting something?

429
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,232
Aren't you and I supposed
to be on the same team?

430
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,500
You saw everybody
listening to us.

431
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:32,204
Your cash split would be
better if you slimmed down
the team.

432
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,973
Get that poor man
so paranoid,

433
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,342
one of those
ex-Navy SEALs gets him.

434
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,011
I suppose you've made
your alliance

435
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,813
with your favorite
cast members...

436
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,449
Like that
Susan bitch.

437
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,650
You know, Tina,

438
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,653
you've been watching
way too much reality TV.

439
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,456
Whatever.

440
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,662
- Just a second.
- Sure.

441
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,171
Do you think there's
a storm coming?

442
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,873
I don't know.

443
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,041
Clouds are coming in.
It's getting windy.

444
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,810
I can hear
the breakers building.
Could be.

445
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,848
So, what was that
all about?

446
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,851
I don't know.
Either she's in
a real bad mood today,

447
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,987
or she doesn't like me
very much.

448
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,489
Tina? Nah.

449
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,457
She's young,
but she's harmless.

450
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,792
Really?

451
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,228
She just called you
"that Susan bitch."

452
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,430
She did?

453
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,332
Accused me of spreading
dissension and anger

454
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,700
among the contestants.

455
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,703
Maybe we should form
an alliance.

456
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:41,240
Susan!

457
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:45,011
You like me!
You really like me!

458
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,980
Not particularly.

459
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,417
But as team leader,
you have your uses.

460
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,785
If you go down,
I'll shed a tear.

461
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:54,921
But just one.

462
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,024
Think about it.

463
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:03,629
Bill:
Right here.

464
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,998
Just west
of Lisianski Island.

465
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,734
These two systems
will probably hit
near Midway.

466
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,971
Form the biggest
hurricane to hit
the Pacific in years.

467
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,739
And head
in what direction?

468
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,108
North by northwest.
Straight for Palm Key.

469
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:18,744
So the cast and crew
are definitely in danger.

470
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,580
- Have you told Stuart?
- Didn't do any good.

471
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,183
His attitude was,
"So what if they're
stranded?"

472
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,953
I know.
"Death is temporary.
TV is forever."

473
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,710
This is chopper 1138.
We're approximately

474
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,213
two clicks away
from the insertion zone.

475
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,748
Jared, we're coming up
on the drop zone.

476
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,885
- You ready to hit it, Rance?
- Locked and loaded.

477
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,720
Locked and loaded.

478
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,590
Those folks won't know
what hit them.

479
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,635
( helicopters whirring )

480
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,757
You're up early,
Detective.

481
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,459
What's going on?

482
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,461
Could you go back
and come out again?

483
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,264
Try to show a little more
surprise for the camera.

484
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,733
I thought this was supposed
to be reality.

485
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,401
Yeah, TV reality.

486
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,272
Asshole.

487
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,475
- Sam, sticks and stones...
- Oh, shut up.

488
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,613
( alarm buzzing )

489
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,449
All right, boys.
Let's move out!

490
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,717
Let's go!

491
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,321
( siren blasting )

492
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,855
Rise and shine, folks!

493
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,392
- What's happening?
- What is that noise?

494
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,660
Sam:
Just keep repeating,
"It's only TV."

495
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,129
Are those
helicopters?

496
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,898
It's pandemonium
and panic here on Palm Key,

497
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:56,034
as the island is apparently
under armed invasion!

498
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,073
We're down.
Head for the extraction point,
and wait for us.

499
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,275
Pilot:
Copy that. Roger.

500
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,413
Let's go.

501
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,182
What is this bullshit?

502
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,317
Yeah.

503
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,385
How's anybody supposed
to get some sleep?

504
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:16,522
- I need my eight hours.
- Don't count on it.

505
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,258
The first challenge
of the island...

506
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,328
The first lesson
of the jungle...

507
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,264
Be alert,
be watchful,

508
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,466
and maybe
you'll survive.

509
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,301
Was that
the Navy SEALs?

510
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,405
You never know,
my young friend...

511
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,007
Until you feel
their hot breath

512
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,277
and their
cold steel

513
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,613
take you down.

514
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,550
- ( phone rings )
- Excuse me.

515
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,555
It's his boyfriend.

516
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,328
( ringing )

517
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,396
Yeah.

518
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,165
How did we do?

519
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,933
Absolutely fantastic,
gentlemen.

520
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,436
You scared them like sheep
to the slaughter.

521
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,538
Good. I'll see you
in the morning.

522
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:10,108
Sleep well.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

523
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,678
Great.

524
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,247
Get some rest, guys.

525
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,260
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning.

526
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,329
Just packing
our gear.

527
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,665
- Hey, Sam.
- Good morning.

528
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,734
Ready to find
that treasure?

529
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,304
I'm all a-twitter.

530
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,573
You think
I'm a real worrier,
don't you?

531
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,510
To be honest,
I don't think
about you much.

532
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,379
Here's the deal.
Somebody's gonna win
a lot of money

533
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,648
and the rest of us
are going to go home.

534
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,383
Maybe, maybe not.

535
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,252
Get a look
at that shoreline.

536
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,125
It's a lousy day.

537
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,362
I used to cover hurricanes
for the "Herald" in Miami.

538
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,298
See how choppy
those waves are?

539
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,936
Sam:
What's it mean?

540
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,938
Take a guess.

541
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,577
All right, team one,
let's go.

542
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,316
I think
it's this way.

543
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,284
Susan:
Detective?
Team leader?

544
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,252
Sorry, Sam.

545
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:03,021
If we're supposed
to follow this map
in order,

546
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,423
then where's
the competition?

547
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,293
The maps are all different.
And all the clues.

548
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,461
They just lead
to the same place.

549
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:10,862
Turner:
Yep, this way.

550
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,131
I think we're right
on the money.

551
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,168
Turner. He must have
overheard me last night.

552
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,371
So let's follow Turner.

553
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,374
Won't do us any good.
Like Steve said, all the maps
are different.

554
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,576
What's that first stanza
of the pirate's poem?

555
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,380
"A pint of grog
is nearly game,

556
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,849
by pool that's cool
on nearby plain."

557
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,251
That's a stupid poem.

558
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,455
- I know it is.
- What's "grog"?

559
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:39,591
It's rum. And game means
"old or spoiled."

560
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,728
"Old and spoiled."
That would be like
our team leader.

561
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,530
I prefer "vintage."

562
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,998
Tina:
This poem doesn't
make any sense.

563
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:50,201
Sometimes you can't go
with the literal meaning
of the words.

564
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,538
Tina:
whatever.

565
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,485
Sometimes you can.

566
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,192
You are the bomb.

567
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,396
Bomb? Aren't you a little old
to be talking like that?

568
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,965
Ooh... A little
grouchy today?

569
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,767
Curmudgeonly.
It's more dignified.

570
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,939
Okay, guys.

571
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,008
New heading.

572
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,545
North.

573
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,850
If those guys get
picked off,

574
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,487
maybe you and I
can form a loyalty
alliance.

575
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,555
You know,
when we get
the treasure?

576
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,958
Like sisters
against the world?
A "Thelma & Louise" thing?

577
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,094
Yeah, I loved
that movie.

578
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,463
Do you remember that cop
that followed them around?

579
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:54,332
- Uh-huh.
- I'm following him
right to the cash,

580
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,067
and you can try
and compete...

581
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:59,638
If you think
you can handle
this "Susan bitch."

582
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,008
Well, la-de-da.

583
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,462
So...

584
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,796
How do we start?

585
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,032
- Start what?
- You know, a little trust.

586
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,768
We get in bed together
and get the treasure first.

587
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,638
That's great.
But who's to say
you won't betray me?

588
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:35,807
It's $10 million.
I totally intend to.

589
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,109
Now I'm starting
to like you.

590
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,245
I feel the same way.

591
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,480
Hey.

592
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,051
"In bed together"?

593
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,799
I think this is
the place to look.

594
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,267
Look right there.

595
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,169
Turner:
Let's spread out
and start looking.

596
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,236
Where?

597
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,539
It could be
anywhere.

598
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,344
Turner:
This looks like
a likely spot over here.

599
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,986
What's your story, mate?

600
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,788
What are you
talking about?

601
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,123
The GI Joe-Rambo deal?

602
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,059
I just wanna be ready
for anything, okay?

603
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,329
You remind me
of a captain I had
in Vietnam.

604
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,499
I think he saw "Patton"
once too often.

605
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,233
Maybe you guys have
the same tailor, huh?

606
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,473
Okay, Mr. Edwards...
Not that it's any
of your business...

607
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,512
Five years ago I was working
for Great Eastern Armor.

608
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,314
Every night,
we made a little milk run
to the local bank.

609
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,149
One night we got hit...

610
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,350
Hard.

611
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,653
Three of my friends
were taken down.

612
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,055
I spent a year
in recovery.

613
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,626
I swore no one would ever
take me down again.

614
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,294
Nobody.

615
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,964
Take a break in place.
I'm just talking shit.

616
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,035
Yeah, quiet's nice, too.

617
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,460
Check this out.

618
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,066
I found something.

619
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,771
I'll take that,
Mr. Edwards.

620
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:46,972
Go to hell.

621
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,440
- I'm the team leader.
- I didn't vote for you.

622
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,643
Find your own damn clues.

623
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,479
Those aren't the rules.
We're supposed to share
in the discovery.

624
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,916
- A team effort, remember?
- Exactly. So let's have it.

625
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:01,119
You are looking like assholes
on national television.

626
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:05,791
- Exactly.
- Okay, you win.

627
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,897
Pick it up, old man.

628
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,464
- "Old man"?
- You heard me.

629
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,802
Get your hands
off him!

630
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,753
I thought you said
you were a teacher.

631
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,388
- I am.
- What kind of school?

632
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,759
Martial arts.

633
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,461
That's right, boys.
A new pecking order.

634
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,165
Bitch.

635
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,567
Goddamn it.
You and I got to talk.

636
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:52,638
Damn it... A woman.

637
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,878
Yeah, could you hold
for a minute?

638
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,580
This better be important.
I got the network affiliates

639
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,882
on a conference link-up.

640
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,451
You wanted to know
when it's a storm?

641
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,586
Well, it's a storm.

642
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:21,232
Sam, wait a second.
I just got an idea.

643
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,102
Listen to this line...
"Davy Jones' locker

644
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,705
is as shallow
as low tide."

645
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,073
What's that sound like
to you?

646
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,841
- It's a tidal pool.
- Exactly.

647
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,211
That's where
the treasure is buried.
I'd stake your life on it.

648
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,113
That's comforting.

649
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,148
We're still gonna need
the exact coordinates.

650
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:39,250
There must a hundred
tidal pools on this island.

651
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,486
But only one on this map.

652
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,055
They're not gonna let us
find the money that quickly.

653
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,725
It's worth a shot.
Anything better to do?

654
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,493
I'll be brave.

655
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:51,129
She's got a point.

656
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,599
That was a little
obvious, wasn't it?

657
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,902
I had
a good teacher.

658
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,040
Stuart:
What? Talk to me!

659
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,108
It's getting bad.

660
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,110
Hurricane warnings.
Gale force.

661
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,745
I suppose you better
contact the island.

662
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,414
I did, nobody's listening.
You need to get a chopper in.

663
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:10,581
Get those people
out of there!

664
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,184
I can't blow a 13-week
network commitment

665
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:14,853
for a little rain
and wind. Come on!

666
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,755
These people
are being paid

667
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,556
to be on that island
and survive,

668
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,125
so damn it,
let 'em survive.

669
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,659
You are such
a bastard.

670
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,161
Really?

671
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:27,032
And what part of "currently
seeking new employment"

672
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,167
don't you understand?

673
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,307
What is happening
down there?

674
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,236
What kept you guys?

675
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,449
Shut up and dig.

676
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,920
Not me.
I am strictly white collar.

677
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,322
Just do it, Rance.

678
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,602
- Did you bring my stuff?
- Yeah.

679
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:41,807
A check for one million,
fresh passport...

680
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,910
You're gonna
be fine, Jack.

681
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:48,413
If this passport isn't fine,
I'll be dead.

682
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,282
How much you owe, Jack?

683
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:54,519
You mean, just to the IRS,
or to Vegas and Miami?

684
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:55,787
Oh, I don't know.

685
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,956
Just pick a number
out of the air.

686
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,125
Enough to get me killed.

687
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,993
Enough to get you
killed.

688
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:04,963
That's what I can't
figure out, Jack.

689
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:06,932
If you're such
a big a celebrity,

690
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:08,967
how's a fake passport
going to help you

691
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,401
once you get off
the island?

692
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:14,239
This show hasn't been
picked up by the foreign
TV buyers yet.

693
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,407
After this week,

694
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,443
I'm sure it won't be.

695
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,587
All right, I give up.
What kind of car are
you going to buy?

696
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,089
- Ooh, a Cadillac. No!
- This way.

697
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,523
No, no.
A beemer.

698
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,028
Tina:
This is gonna be fun!

699
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,897
Tina:
Oh, yes!

700
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,866
Let's go.
Whoo!

701
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,200
What was that?

702
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,571
Get ready, guys.

703
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,339
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

704
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,308
There wasn't
supposed to be
any killing.

705
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,843
I didn't get
into it for that.

706
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:54,245
Stop your whining.

707
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:57,348
You got in for the money,
the same as the rest of us.

708
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,218
Rance:
Got it!

709
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,292
( laughs )

710
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,328
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- We hit a Jackpot.

711
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:11,596
Yee-hah!

712
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,965
( men laughing )

713
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,801
- Fantastic.
- I thought it was
gonna be a check.

714
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,770
( muffled male voices )

715
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,779
Hey, are they supposed to be
hunting for treasure?

716
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,982
I thought they were
supposed to be hunting us.

717
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,984
Those aren't
paintball guns.

718
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,887
The easiest money
you ever made.

719
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,892
We got company.

720
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:43,661
- Jack: Oh, my god.
- Take them out.

721
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,230
- What do you mean...?
- Take 'em out!

722
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,033
( gunfire )

723
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:52,670
Move, move, move!

724
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,406
No! Stop it,
goddamn it! Stop them!

725
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,347
I hear guns.

726
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,549
I'm sure it's just
the paintball guns.

727
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,117
I carry a gun
for a living.

728
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:08,019
Real weapons don't
sound like that.

729
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,155
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

730
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:12,057
Where did
the cameraman go?

731
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,192
He said something about
getting some batteries.

732
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,861
Is the weather getting
really bad, or is it me?

733
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,463
It ain't you,
sister.

734
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,238
Susan:
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

735
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,975
There they go!

736
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,086
Man:
Split!
Right, right!

737
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,322
Two!

738
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,604
Stay with me.

739
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,572
Move it, move it!
Let's go!

740
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,013
Oww!

741
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:10,181
Got one! Move it, move!
Come on!

742
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:12,417
Go, go, go, go!

743
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,886
Come on, move it!

744
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,622
Let's go!
She's went down here.

745
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,924
Man:
spread out!
Find her!

746
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,063
Keep looking!
Let's go!

747
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,436
Check there!
Damn it.

748
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,538
- Oh-hh!
- Shh.

749
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,740
- Man: Wait! Whoa!
- Don't make a sound.

750
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,811
- I can't breathe.
- Shh! Shh-shh.

751
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:44,049
- Nothing, nobody.
- I ain't got time
for this shit. Let's go.

752
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,619
Okay.

753
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:52,890
This is gonna hurt,
but it's a free ride.

754
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,892
- ( groans )
- Come on.

755
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,064
( thunderclap )

756
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,005
So, how did we do, Jack?

757
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,640
Think we're ready
for prime time?

758
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,976
( retching )

759
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,049
I'm gonna go check
on the guys.

760
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,151
Go ahead.

761
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,220
- ( Jack retches )
- ( laughs )

762
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,170
Hey!

763
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,151
Come on!

764
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,786
I think we should go back!

765
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,055
- I think we should go back!
- Don't stop!

766
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,057
He's a cop.
He knows what he's doing!

767
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:01,359
Get to camp!

768
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,263
( wind gusting )

769
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,671
Which way?

770
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,873
I don't know,
I think it's this way.

771
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,313
Ow.

772
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,350
( gasps )

773
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,521
( yelps )

774
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,592
Come on!

775
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,997
( screams )

776
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,700
Just go!
Go on!

777
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,869
No! I'm not leaving
without you!

778
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,337
I can't!

779
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,973
Come on!
I'm bigger and I'm older.

780
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,775
Let's go!
Come on!

781
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,852
This is getting
really bad.

782
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,088
Treasure or no treasure,
I'm going back to those huts

783
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,192
- until this blows over.
- I'm with you, lady.

784
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,428
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I'm onto something!

785
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,929
Edwards:
Get over here.

786
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:17,802
This wasn't supposed
to be like this!

787
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,806
You're telling me!

788
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,042
I thought it was supposed
to be sunshine and bikinis.

789
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,378
That's not
what I mean!

790
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:33,351
( thunderclap )

791
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,052
Kim:
What's going on?

792
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,854
She's hurt.

793
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,324
- One of the paintballs
get her?
- No, she's been shot!

794
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:42,393
- Shot?!
- They're using live ammo!
Real bullets!

795
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:44,161
We've got to get back
to camp! Come on!

796
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,663
Let's get out
of here!

797
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,876
I wounded one
of the contestants!

798
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,845
I didn't know how much time
you wanted us to waste,

799
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,480
so we came back here!

800
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,882
There's another team
out there!

801
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,084
What do you
want me to do,
kill everybody?

802
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,754
Fuck them!
Let's take the money
and get out of here!

803
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,489
They can implicate us!

804
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,858
You kind of dropped
that ball, didn't you, Jack?

805
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:17,061
The way I see it,
it's your worry, not ours.

806
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,029
We're all anonymous.

807
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:22,367
You? You're on the cover
of those TV mags.

808
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,001
At least in this country.

809
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,637
And with all those
bodies all over the island,

810
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:29,240
I don't think you'll ever
be able to use that passport.

811
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:31,342
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

812
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,612
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

813
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:37,848
- Now what happens?
- Bad news, Jack!

814
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,850
Your ratings are in,

815
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,220
and we're your
mid-season replacement.

816
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:48,293
No! No, no, no!

817
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,500
Give me the radio!

818
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:00,638
I'm going to higher ground
to call a chopper in
for extraction.

819
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,239
Let's go!

820
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:03,674
Okay, move out.

821
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,550
Make sure this
goes out right away.

822
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,686
It's got a name...
Hurricane James.

823
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,522
Named after
the great sea explorer,

824
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:20,791
captain James Cook.
He died on an island
in the Pacific.

825
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,893
Yeah, right.
So when does it blow over?

826
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,228
It doesn't.

827
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,497
The hurricane is
nature's great
slate cleaner.

828
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:28,933
It goes where it wants,
destroys everything
in its path,

829
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,701
and moves on.

830
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,637
So, what happens next?

831
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,039
The fun begins.

832
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:48,819
We have to go back!
We have to go find them!

833
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:49,887
No, we stay here.

834
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,158
Look!
They're coming!

835
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:55,560
Hey!

836
00:54:58,162 --> 00:55:01,198
Kim:
I'll take Susan
and look for bandages.

837
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,800
- Good!
- Listen,

838
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,602
we need a hired gun
on this deal.

839
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,003
It's down to you or me!

840
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,038
Or me!
I'm a licensed
security guard

841
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,774
it the state of Texas,
you know.

842
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:12,743
Great, a Texas security guard.
God help us.

843
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,646
Mr. Chaney, I work
in a dangerous business!

844
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,615
I carry a gun
for a living, okay?

845
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,083
Yeah, yeah, I know.

846
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,851
In the state of Texas
they require

847
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,688
a thousand hours of training
to carry a hair dryer,

848
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,322
and only 40
to carry a gun.

849
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,858
Let's just let Phil do it!
He's ex-military!

850
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:30,194
No, I'm too old and tired
to lead! You do it!

851
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:31,529
Yeah!

852
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:34,499
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, I'm okay with that.

853
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:36,300
All right, look...

854
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,202
We know they're
coming after us,

855
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,770
So here's what we do:

856
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,839
Steve, you and Turner
go and check the hut

857
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,008
for food or weapons,
or anything you can dig up!

858
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,676
- Okay!
- I'll take
the first watch.

859
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,745
- I'll take
the first watch.
- No, I'll do it!

860
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,680
- No, I got it.
- Be careful!

861
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,132
Bad news...

862
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,300
The chopper pilot
refuses to fly.

863
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,802
What do you mean,
"refuses"?

864
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,838
We paid him enough money.
I'll cut his...

865
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,941
- Why?
- He says a storm system's
tearing up the whole Pacific.

866
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,709
He doesn't want to risk
an ocean flyover.

867
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:21,278
How are we supposed to get
to the fucking pickup ship?

868
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,648
There's a chopper
on the other side of
the island.

869
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,750
- We can take that.
- All right. Let's move!

870
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,486
If that pilot won't fly,
I'll put a gun to
his fucking head!

871
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,155
You don't think
they're gonna try
the same damn thing?

872
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,390
Our number one priority
as of this moment,

873
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:35,560
is to eliminate
these people.

874
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,361
Yes, sir!

875
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,296
No witnesses,
no crime.

876
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,065
Let's go.

877
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,100
Dumb shit!

878
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:53,243
What...
What is that line?

879
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,612
Tsunami.

880
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,146
Tidal wave.

881
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,815
Stirred up
by the hurricane.

882
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,951
It should make landfall
on those folks in six hours.

883
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:03,153
All right. That's it.
I'll call in the choppers

884
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,755
and get those people
out of there.

885
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,824
It's too late.
Choppers are grounded.

886
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,693
You're going to go down
in TV history

887
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:11,796
as the first producer
to kill off his entire
first season cast.

888
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,664
Should make a hell
of a bargaining tool

889
00:57:13,698 --> 00:57:15,432
next time you negotiate
actors' contracts.

890
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,668
They're not
going to die!
I won't let them.

891
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,369
You won't?

892
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:20,938
That island
may not survive.

893
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,673
That's not even
the best part.

894
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:24,609
See that tail section
of the wave?

895
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,478
That may hit us.

896
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:29,580
If it does...
We're driftwood.

897
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,200
Hello?

898
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:52,369
- Hello?
- Recording: Hello.

899
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,905
This is
your carnival princess
coming to you...

900
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:58,208
This is Palm Key Island.
Somebody help!

901
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,413
Help. Hello?
We're under attack!

902
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,883
- Help!
- ( buzzes )

903
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:20,097
( thunderclap )

904
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:38,883
How's she doing?

905
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,385
Kim's a good nurse.

906
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:44,421
I got a merit badge
in this in Girl Scouts.

907
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:45,790
I think I stopped
the bleeding,

908
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:47,524
but she's gonna
need antibiotics.

909
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:51,128
- Anything in the huts?
- Nothing but bandages.

910
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:52,563
We found some
satellite gear.

911
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:54,699
We might be able to use it
to call for help.

912
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:57,067
Yeah, maybe Steve
can help you figure it out.

913
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,936
If there's time.

914
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,606
Well, we better
get going.

915
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,240
Susan, you ready
for some aerobics?

916
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,475
Sure.

917
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,713
You may feel like hell,
but you look great.

918
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,417
Hey.

919
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,853
Thanks for pulling me out
back there.

920
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,189
Don't mention it.

921
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,563
I found all
the canned goods,
cheese and crackers

922
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,766
and stuff I could.
Water, too,

923
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,434
but no weapons.
Only my knife.

924
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:31,936
I got a couple
of radios.

925
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,072
Steve, you think you can get
that satellite uplink working?

926
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,206
I don't know, maybe.

927
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,442
You were right.
They're coming from the north.

928
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,711
- They're five minutes away.
- Satellite uplink?

929
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,180
No time! Here's what
we're gonna do.

930
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,649
We're gonna head south,

931
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:46,450
then we're gonna
double back.

932
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,753
Get the other women,
and let's move out!

933
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,870
There they are!

934
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,205
Do 'em!

935
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,476
( distant whistling )

936
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,045
Incoming!
Go, go, go!

937
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:39,603
( yells )

938
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,206
Steve, help!

939
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,608
Come on!

940
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,077
( rocket whistling )

941
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:49,814
Let's go!
Come on!

942
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,249
Steve:
Come on!

943
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:09,299
Come on!

944
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,741
Steve:
Wait, wait!

945
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,644
I think the explosions
have stopped.

946
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,781
Who do we have to fuck
to get off this island?

947
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,116
My money's on
the helicopter pilot.

948
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:01,618
These guys aren't finished
with us yet, goddamn it!

949
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,121
- Let's get to the chopper!
- Let's go!

950
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,867
Okay, gentlemen...

951
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:19,269
No more witnesses.

952
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,605
Let's go get us
a chopper.

953
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,849
( constant thunder )

954
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,346
Sailor:
This is the U.S.S. Intrepid.

955
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,948
We are tracking the storm

956
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,715
on all primary
and secondary grids.

957
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:07,451
The latest coordinates
indicate

958
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,487
a north by northwest track
at approximately five knots.

959
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,823
We have two reports
of foundering vessels.

960
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:15,725
The first, 70 clicks
southeast of Palm Straits,

961
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,494
bearing 1-5-0.

962
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,164
The second, 55 clicks north
of our current position,

963
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:21,631
bearing 1-7-9.

964
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,533
We will advise
as to weather conditions

965
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,669
as you approach the vessel,
chopper commander.

966
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:29,073
Please state current position
and estimated ETA

967
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:30,841
Woman:
This is chopper command.

968
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:34,344
We are approximately 20 clicks
from distress coordinates.

969
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:37,047
ETA, 1400 hours, over.

970
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:41,285
- Prepare the secondary
rescue team.
- Aye, sir.

971
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,353
Secondary rescue team,
prepare to launch.

972
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:46,123
Repeat, secondary rescue team,
prepare to launch.

973
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,459
Load all necessary
personnel aboard chopper
bravo tango zero.

974
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,865
Soldier:
Go, go, go!

975
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,566
Move it, move it!

976
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,784
Chopper Command:
Chopper bravo tango zero...

977
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:16,520
I want you
out of there ASAP,

978
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,855
before the winds pick up
any further.

979
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:20,290
Roger that.

980
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:39,643
Get us something,
anything.

981
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,545
Okay, call me back.

982
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:42,846
Can the Coast Guard help?

983
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,282
They've only got
three, four hours
flying weather left

984
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,451
and they have too many
other grids to cover.

985
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,885
Downed planes.
Sinking boats.

986
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:50,054
Shouldn't they have warned us?

987
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:51,488
They couldn't. Nobody could.

988
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:53,690
This storm appeared
out of nowhere.

989
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,292
I hope to god
it leaves the same way.

990
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,594
- I haven't got time to hope.
- ( phone rings )

991
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,663
Station?
Yes.

992
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:09,940
Whoa.

993
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:14,511
Island team to pick-up.
What's your position? Over.

994
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:19,883
I'm 200 nautical miles
southwest of the island.

995
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,919
These conditions are
impossible. I'm taking an
alternate course.

996
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:25,289
If the weather gets
much worse than this,

997
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:26,723
we won't be able to fly.

998
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,925
You cannot alter
our pickup time!

999
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,327
I don't have any choice.

1000
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,397
If I continue to plow
through this, I'm gonna sink!

1001
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,799
- How much time?
- I don't know!

1002
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,467
Well, give me a guess!

1003
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,639
Bryant!

1004
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,416
Oh, my God...

1005
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,389
( people screaming )

1006
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,836
( static )

1007
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,106
Shit!

1008
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,811
Fuck 'em.

1009
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,349
( rapid thunder )

1010
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,838
Kim:
Jesus, it looks like
where I grew up on the farm.

1011
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,707
- Hey, Garrett.
- There's a cot over there.

1012
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,042
That lamp is new.

1013
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:54,010
Sam:
Yeah, it is.
And these matches.

1014
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:55,512
- Okay, okay.
- ( Susan groans )

1015
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,247
This is all just
a little too convenient.

1016
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:59,716
Maybe it was something
we were meant to
stumble across

1017
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,285
for a scene
in the show.

1018
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,120
Or maybe a hideout
for the Navy SEALs.

1019
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:06,022
Navy SEALs don't
kill innocent people.
That's bullshit.

1020
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,924
Whatever.
If this is their cabin,

1021
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,259
won't they
come back soon?

1022
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,295
I hope we won't
be here that long.

1023
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,896
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thanks.

1024
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,165
- Let's talk outside.
- Come on.

1025
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,844
How is she?

1026
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,746
I'm not really sure.

1027
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,615
Her body temperature
is dropping

1028
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,350
and she's lost
a lot of blood

1029
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,552
with all the exertion
and the trauma.

1030
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,821
Sam:
Think she'll go
into shock?

1031
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:39,623
It's a possibility.

1032
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:41,891
I don't know
what I can do about it.

1033
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,673
- Hey.
- Hey.

1034
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:59,443
She's not giving you
very good odds, is she?

1035
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,312
You heard that?

1036
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:04,314
I'm sorry.

1037
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:06,450
It doesn't matter.

1038
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,085
I wanted an adventure
and I got one.

1039
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,788
Yeah.
How come?

1040
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:15,992
I guess I realized
that stocks and bonds
were all I knew.

1041
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,428
I mean,
my entire world

1042
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,897
was this office
in Oklahoma City,

1043
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,432
and the gym.

1044
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:24,868
I wanted to live.

1045
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:27,437
- I wanted to have some fun.
- So, that's it?

1046
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,108
Just running around naked,
communing with nature?

1047
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:34,077
I've always been
an optimist.

1048
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,213
I also thought I might
win the big prize.

1049
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,150
And if you did,
what then?

1050
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:42,352
Back to your office
in Oklahoma City?

1051
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:44,354
No, I was...

1052
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:46,223
I was going to open
a homeless shelter

1053
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:48,091
for runaway kids.

1054
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,460
Have I been flirting
with Mother Teresa?

1055
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,465
I had a kid sister

1056
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,467
who went out to Hollywood
with big dreams,

1057
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,603
and she lost
all of them.

1058
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,206
And then we lost her.

1059
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,409
It happens to kids
like her every day.

1060
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:07,444
Yep, I see it a lot.

1061
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,247
I can't imagine
being a cop.

1062
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,081
I like it.

1063
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:14,384
You get to carve out
your little piece of
the world.

1064
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,152
Try to make a difference.

1065
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:18,855
I guess I've been
flirting with a saint, too.

1066
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,624
By no means.

1067
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,560
No, my motivations
are purely selfish.

1068
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,762
If I have a good day,
I sleep better.

1069
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,365
So, Sam...

1070
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,268
What would you
have spent the money on...

1071
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,703
If you won?

1072
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:35,772
Hot dogs and beer.

1073
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,476
You think I'm kidding?

1074
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,890
Rance:
How are we supposed
to get out of here

1075
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,160
- with no rendezvous ship?
- Don't worry about it.

1076
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,629
We'll take the chopper
and fly to Hawaii.

1077
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:02,466
There's a guy in Maui
that will give us
fresh passports.

1078
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,133
Suppose he takes
only cash?

1079
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,935
That won't be
a problem.

1080
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,351
Think the storm
has passed?

1081
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:22,586
I don't know.

1082
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:24,388
I'm just glad
the rain has let up.

1083
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:27,891
Steve, you've
covered hurricanes,
what do you think?

1084
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,093
No... This is just
the calm

1085
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:32,095
before it all
hits the fan.

1086
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:33,930
Little pockets
of easy weather

1087
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,499
are all over these
storm systems.

1088
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,334
We better enjoy it
while we can.

1089
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,736
How far do you think
we are from the beach?

1090
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,272
It's not
that big of an island.
Maybe a couple of hours.

1091
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:45,008
We're ready
to go.

1092
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,612
Okay,
let's move out.

1093
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:54,117
Watch your step.

1094
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,379
( screams )

1095
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,814
Turner:
What happened?

1096
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,855
What the hell was that?!

1097
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:35,325
Okay, check it out!
You guys go that way!

1098
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,527
Split up!

1099
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:39,195
Shit!

1100
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,965
What are you looking at?
Okay, let's move.

1101
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,335
Oh, my God!
They fell!

1102
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,404
Kim:
I can't believe
I did this!

1103
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:50,006
How can I be
so fucking clumsy?

1104
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,307
Hey.
Are you okay?

1105
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:54,110
- I think so.
- Son of a fucking bitch!

1106
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,579
- How bad is it?
- It's a sprain.

1107
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,280
We'll just walk
a little slower.

1108
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,549
We can't. They'll find us
on this road.

1109
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,485
They blew up the camp.
They think we're dead.

1110
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:03,219
Not for long.
We're walking the same path.

1111
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,655
It's a matter of time before
we knock heads with them.

1112
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,023
Wait a minute.
If a couple of us

1113
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,658
could double-time
back to that chopper,

1114
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:10,193
we could fly our asses
out of here.

1115
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,328
If that chopper
is still there.

1116
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,698
If Sam and Phil could
take the shortcut
along that path,

1117
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,533
they'd hit the beach
in half an hour.

1118
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,502
- It's a tough climb.
- We can make it.

1119
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,804
- You can't leave us here!
- Turner: She's right!

1120
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,607
The rest of us will have
no chance on this road.

1121
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,476
There's no protection.
There's no place to hide!
We won't have a chance.

1122
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,579
- You will, if we
lower the odds a little.
- What are you thinking?

1123
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:32,482
If we double back
and take them by surprise,
they won't expect it.

1124
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,250
- You okay with that?
- Good to go.

1125
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,419
Sam...

1126
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:37,754
If you wait any longer you're
not gonna be able to fly.

1127
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:40,924
- You've got to go now.
- We're gonna need one
of your radios.

1128
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:44,360
Steve, you and Turner
keep an eye on the jungle
in case they come after you.

1129
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:46,996
- Let's go.
- Stay on channel 2.

1130
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,998
- Right.
- We can't fight those guys!

1131
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,501
- They're professionals.
- So are you, and so am I!

1132
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:53,703
You're the big
bad-ass security guard!

1133
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,540
You've been wanting
to lead this group,
now's your chance.

1134
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,508
What do we do
if they come back?

1135
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,877
Use your head...
And keep moving.

1136
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:05,949
- Okay, let's go up here.
- Let's go.

1137
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,000
We never should
have split up!

1138
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,369
It's our
only chance.

1139
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,204
( moaning )

1140
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,567
( groans )

1141
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:30,834
( cracks )

1142
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,184
Aaah!

1143
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,160
You have the right
to remain silent!

1144
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,830
Anything you say
will be used against you!

1145
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,348
( chuckles )

1146
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,984
- ( rifle cocks )
- Hey, brother...

1147
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:57,320
- Time to die.
- ( whirring )

1148
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,355
Ooh!

1149
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:06,429
( sighs )

1150
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,834
I'm getting too old-time
for this shit!

1151
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,302
So am I!
Let's go find
that chopper.

1152
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:19,843
Hold it!
What's that?

1153
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,277
Shit.

1154
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,615
It's Logan!

1155
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:37,927
The contestants
are still alive.

1156
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,462
That's bullshit.

1157
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,397
It can't be them.
We torched the bastards.

1158
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,699
Who else?

1159
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:45,434
Did you see any burning bodies
in the village?

1160
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,637
I didn't think so.

1161
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:49,939
It looks like we've
got a fight on our hands.

1162
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:51,675
From who?
These TV pricks?

1163
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,376
One man dead,
one man missing...

1164
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:55,745
Maybe we underestimated
these "pricks."

1165
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,514
These "pricks" now
have weapons.

1166
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,950
So do we.

1167
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:03,987
Rance:
Fuck 'em.
Let's get off this island.

1168
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,254
Let's go.

1169
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:18,401
Leave the transmitter on.

1170
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:19,903
What?
Why?

1171
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:21,805
I'm sending reports
to the local TV station

1172
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:23,606
trying to warn residents
on the island.

1173
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,008
My last few
live reports.

1174
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,210
I've routed
the rooftop camera,
satellite maps,

1175
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,978
barometer...
Anything I can send.

1176
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:30,780
Not tonight.
Come on, come on.

1177
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,115
I've seen enough.
Let's go.

1178
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,050
No one's going
anywhere now, Stu.

1179
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:37,120
No boats, no helicopters
are gonna fly in this.

1180
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,422
For good or bad,
we're here for the duration.

1181
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,225
Oh, and Stu...

1182
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:43,993
Yellow's not
your color.

1183
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,896
You know what?
You're fired, too.

1184
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,498
You wanted
reality TV?
You got it.

1185
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:52,368
Bill:
How would you like to do
some real work for a change?

1186
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,537
Put something useful
on the airwaves.

1187
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,472
Do what we got
in this business to do,

1188
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,107
before it became
all about the money.

1189
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:00,676
Maybe save some lives.

1190
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:05,882
All right...

1191
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,851
All right,
show me what to do.

1192
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,759
We have to get out
in the open.
This road's about to flood!

1193
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,560
- No, no!
- We'll get electrocuted!

1194
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:20,096
We have to keep moving!
It's the fastest way!

1195
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,402
I'm stiff!
Why am I stiff?

1196
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:27,937
Runner's high.

1197
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:34,210
There it is,
we made it.

1198
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:36,045
Not yet.

1199
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:46,923
Hey! Great to see somebody.
Anybody.

1200
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:49,492
- Where you people been?
- Did they send help?

1201
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:51,027
I haven't heard
from anybody

1202
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,096
since I dropped you people
on the beach.

1203
01:18:53,129 --> 01:18:55,264
I'm having
a hurricane party.

1204
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:57,200
Have a drink.

1205
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,268
Get this thing started!

1206
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:02,671
No, I'm not
flying up in this shit.
That's how you get killed.

1207
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:04,573
( cocks gun )
So's this.

1208
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,361
( screams )

1209
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,431
Mindi!

1210
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:30,199
Help!

1211
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:31,901
Help me!

1212
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:36,605
( screaming )

1213
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,309
We have to help them!

1214
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:42,846
No! No, there's
nothing we can do.

1215
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:44,347
We have
to keep moving!

1216
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,249
Come on!

1217
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,062
Hold up!

1218
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:00,796
Hold up!

1219
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,634
Sam?

1220
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:08,571
Sam, come in!
It's me, Steve!

1221
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:10,173
Yeah, Steve,
I hear you.

1222
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,875
Give me your position.
Where are you?

1223
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:15,444
About a mile south
from where you left us.

1224
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:18,882
We lost two.
Mindi and Turner.

1225
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:22,318
- Mercs do it?
- No, lightning.

1226
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:26,755
Okay, I got you.
We're right above you now.
Stand by.

1227
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:29,492
- Take us down.
- Where?

1228
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:36,399
Steve, is there any kind
of a clearing nearby you?

1229
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,001
Yes!

1230
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,568
Right in front of us!

1231
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,405
It's a little plateau.
It looks like it might
be drier.

1232
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:43,706
Okay, I see it!

1233
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:45,341
( gun cocks )

1234
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:49,145
Steve, you copy?

1235
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,480
Steve, come in!

1236
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,822
Looks like
our ride's here, guys.

1237
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,261
What the hell's
going on down there?

1238
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:10,799
I don't watch your show,
Sammy, so I haven't
seen your bio.

1239
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:13,970
You're good.
Real good.

1240
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,406
How's this grab you?

1241
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:23,446
( screaming )

1242
01:21:31,254 --> 01:21:32,855
Put it down
in that clearing.

1243
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,757
If I take it down
I might not be able

1244
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,425
to get it
back up again.

1245
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:38,227
I'm just bouncing
around in the wind!

1246
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:40,463
I said,
take us down, now!

1247
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,567
I can't wait
to meet you, Sammy.

1248
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,769
I hope you brought
the guns,

1249
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:50,173
or I start picking
your friends off,
one by one.

1250
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:02,318
You ever done
any sniper work?

1251
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:05,021
- A little bit.
- One more thing...

1252
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:06,956
I'm gonna need
your knife!

1253
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,551
All right.
Jeffries.

1254
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,023
Watch them.
Rance!

1255
01:22:40,056 --> 01:22:41,657
Follow me.

1256
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,027
Put the money in the bags!
Let's go.

1257
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,431
What are you thinking,
little girl?

1258
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,469
I'm not staying
on this island.

1259
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,655
Put your hands
behind your head.

1260
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,923
Sammy!

1261
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:17,460
Where's the old man...
The vet?

1262
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,095
I heard he was
with you.

1263
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:20,796
He's dead!

1264
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,465
Dead?

1265
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:24,600
How?

1266
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:27,670
Heart attack.
On the trail.

1267
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:30,939
I'll check it out.

1268
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:47,990
Sammy, how many of my men
did you kill?

1269
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,825
How many you
got left?

1270
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,229
Is this the way it's gonna
go down, Sammy?

1271
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:54,530
Huh?

1272
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,697
Jeffries:
Thank you, ladies...

1273
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,899
But it's time
to call it a night.

1274
01:24:32,135 --> 01:24:34,002
( gunshot )

1275
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:43,546
- Are you okay, baby?
- Yeah! Are you okay?

1276
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:09,905
Wait!

1277
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,809
Here's your money.
I just need a ride!

1278
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,244
Please?

1279
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,313
Yeah...

1280
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:20,115
I could use
a hostage.

1281
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,054
There goes
a real piece of work.

1282
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,759
Get in there!

1283
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,228
Take us up, now!

1284
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:34,096
All right!
No guarantees.

1285
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,932
Just do it!
Do it!

1286
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:57,453
I've got the map.

1287
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,455
- Let's get the hell
out of here!
- Okay.

1288
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:03,058
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Go.

1289
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,965
It's gonna be
a bad one!

1290
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,501
But we'll be safe
up in this tree.

1291
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,438
With the surf coming in here
we could be hit by
a tidal wave

1292
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:17,172
and wipe out
these fucking trees!

1293
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:20,243
Guys, look at this.
There's a cave on the side
of this cliff.

1294
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,578
It's high enough
above the beach
to keep us safe.

1295
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:25,314
The cave is on
the south side
of the island!

1296
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:27,283
It could give us
just enough shelter,

1297
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,184
but we've got
to move fast!

1298
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,420
No, we can't!
Susan's in bad shape!

1299
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:35,157
- Susan isn't dead yet.
- All right, let's go!

1300
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:48,871
And we're up in three,
two, one... Now.

1301
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:51,206
Eastern edge of the storm
is approximately

1302
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,942
six miles west of Waimea
Point, at last reading.

1303
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:58,614
Maximum sustained winds,
140 miles per hour.

1304
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:00,783
We expect landfall
on the outer island

1305
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:03,552
in less than 20 minutes.

1306
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:05,921
- We're clear.
- All right.

1307
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,790
Let's go again
in five minutes.

1308
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:09,892
You think they'll
make it on the island?

1309
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:11,860
I don't know
if the island
will make it.

1310
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:13,762
God help them.

1311
01:27:13,796 --> 01:27:15,498
God help us all.

1312
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:27,042
We're gonna crash!

1313
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,178
Get us up above this thing!
There's a million in it
for you.

1314
01:27:30,212 --> 01:27:33,382
I don't know where "up" is!
It's all black outside.

1315
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:39,254
- Sweet Jesus.
- I don't think you're
on his A-list.

1316
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:42,525
Bastard!
You're gonna kill us!

1317
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:44,059
Go!

1318
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,579
Will we be safe
in here?

1319
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,714
Safest place
on the island,
I guess.

1320
01:28:05,748 --> 01:28:07,450
That's not saying much.

1321
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:09,284
Hey, how's she doing?

1322
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:10,986
I think
she's in shock.

1323
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,596
- ( alarm sounds )
- Here it comes.

1324
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:41,384
Holy shit!

1325
01:28:44,387 --> 01:28:46,889
Hang on! I'm trying
to get above it!

1326
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,824
( screams )

1327
01:29:47,683 --> 01:29:51,053
Kim:
Oh, my God, guys.
It's the money.

1328
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:03,899
You know, that rescue team

1329
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:06,735
will probably be here
any minute.

1330
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:11,474
Let's get to work.

1331
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,316
- Command: Any sign of them?
- Not yet.

1332
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,785
Keep looking.

1333
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:25,420
Pilot:
Wait a minute...
We have visual confirmation.

1334
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:26,955
The island is still intact.

1335
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:29,525
Send in the airlift
rescue choppers on the double.

1336
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:46,542
I guess you aren't
coming back, huh?

1337
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:48,577
What do you care?

1338
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:51,146
You've got
a big new TV career.

1339
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:52,581
It didn't work out.

1340
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:54,683
They said I'm
not camera friendly.

1341
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:56,084
Tough town.

1342
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:57,553
Tell me about it.

1343
01:30:57,586 --> 01:30:59,454
I hear you're signed
for "Treasure Hunt 2."

1344
01:30:59,488 --> 01:31:01,356
I guess that makes you
the big TV star now.

1345
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:03,425
Doesn't he look
like one?

1346
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,860
You must be
"Mother Teresa."

1347
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:06,394
You can
call me Susan.

1348
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:08,096
- Susan?
- Yeah.

1349
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,232
- Sam's a good cop.
- Yes, ma'am, he is.

1350
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,134
If he ever wants
to come back on the force,

1351
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:13,569
I'd love to have him.

1352
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:15,604
I took care of his little
political problem.

1353
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,573
Page one.

1354
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:19,842
Well, thank you, Captain.
I will be back...

1355
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,343
Right after the hiatus.

1356
01:31:21,376 --> 01:31:23,178
And after you help me
build my homeless shelters.

1357
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,047
That's right.

1358
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,349
- Cheers.
- No, ma'am.

1359
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:30,352
You drink one for me.
I'm still on duty.

1360
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,827
Susan:
He seems like
a nice guy.

1361
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:41,597
Sam:
He's kind of an asshole,
but he's okay.

1362
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,668
Would you mind getting us
another round of drinks?

1363
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:49,204
- I'm not your wife.
- Not yet.

1364
01:31:49,237 --> 01:31:52,274
Is that a proposal?

1365
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:54,910
Well, call it
a proposition.

1366
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:56,945
The first of many.

1367
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:01,349
That'll cost you more.

1368
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:12,360
Now, isn't that nice?
