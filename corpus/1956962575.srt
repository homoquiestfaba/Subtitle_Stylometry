1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,988
(knocking)

2
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:23,092
- Me and Gus been playing
checkers every Tuesday,

3
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:24,630
must be 20 years now.

4
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:27,654
Of course we been playing one kind of game

5
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:29,263
or another since we were kids.

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,782
But now it's checkers.

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,325
Most folks think I'm
crazy to keep playing him.

8
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:47,447
It's not that he's smarter
than me or a better player,

9
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:49,985
he's just got this way
of wearing you down.

10
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:55,986
(slow music)

11
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:02,969
- That's quite a move flag,
you've been cooking that

12
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:04,903
one up for quite a while haven't you?

13
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,546
(sighs)

14
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,054
- Take your medicine Gus all
the stalling in the world

15
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:23,296
isn't gonna help you now.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,730
- Shoot.

17
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,109
Oh well.

18
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,049
(laughing)

19
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,069
- Maybe it was cocky way
he took those checkers

20
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:44,493
off the board, maybe it
was the way he wrote down

21
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:45,864
my losing, I don't know.

22
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,067
All I know is my whole trouble
with Gus started right after

23
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,497
that game.

24
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:56,521
- Okay that's 1,278.65.

25
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,736
I suppose you wanna let it ride.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,883
- Where'd that piece come from?

27
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,626
- I put it there three moves
ago, I guess you weren't

28
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,449
looking very close.

29
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:13,711
- No I was looking very closely,
I'm sure it wasn't there.

30
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,105
- Just like you're sure I
took your shovel last week.

31
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,226
- Found the shit didn't you Flagg?

32
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,373
- I ain't playing no game
of checkers where the pieces

33
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,099
move by themselves.

34
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:29,903
(western music)

35
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,801
â™« I think I hear the train here coming

36
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:40,201
â™« Coming down to Caribeo way

37
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:45,371
â™« Go my ticket in my hand, I've
always been a traveling man

38
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:48,524
â™« That trains coming, today's the day

39
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:52,785
â™« Don't remind me but I'm leaving

40
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,771
â™« Doesn't really matter in the end

41
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,061
â™« All the money that I wasted

42
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,116
â™« The whiskey that I've tasted

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,049
â™« it still comes down
to who you call a friend

44
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,494
â™« Well come with the
boy down to the station

45
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:13,605
â™« Did need farewell as I go

46
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:18,581
â™« Don't you shed a tear as
the train rolls down the line

47
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,397
â™« I'm on my way to glory don't you know

48
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:42,983
â™« Come with the boys down to the station

49
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,579
â™« Did need farewell as I go â™«

50
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:50,580
- Hey pull it around.

51
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,258
Pull it around.

52
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:00,224
Â™« I'm on my way to
glory don't you know â™«

53
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,808
(rooster cawing)

54
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,300
(cow mooing)

55
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,003
(sheep bleating)

56
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,773
- Ada.

57
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:44,130
Ada!

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,195
Ada.

59
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,813
(slow music)

60
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:03,117
- Good morning Ed.

61
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,285
- Ada.

62
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,069
- [Voiceover] Well I think
she's just after his money.

63
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:11,813
Hm.

64
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:13,333
What makes you think that?

65
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:14,136
- Hey Gus.

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,330
- Hi Ada.

67
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,549
- [Voiceover] I don't think
this is about this woman

68
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:19,600
or how she treats your daddy,

69
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:22,687
I think you're mad at him
for the way he treated you

70
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,822
and your mama.

71
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,839
This is Anne Marie no PhD
just common sense Purdy.

72
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,277
And I'm talking with Paula.

73
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,301
- 12 dollars.

74
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,992
- [Voiceover] Having a
little sex with daddy maybe?

75
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:42,493
My daddy's riding around in
his wheelchair having sex.

76
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,945
- Where'd she get that stuff?

77
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,499
- Not from me.

78
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,078
- [Voiceover] At 95 you should
be able to live with whoever

79
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,791
you want don't you think darling?

80
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:57,961
- She's always been real good
at figuring these things out.

81
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,432
At least for other people.

82
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:03,545
Flagg was gonna fix
that fence this morning.

83
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,210
- He was up half the night
fixing the Campbell's pump.

84
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,726
- Morning Flagg.

85
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,543
(slams door)

86
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,748
- Flagg.

87
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,211
- You know what woke me up this morning?

88
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,974
- Your zest for life.

89
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,726
- No it was the sound of sheep
pissing on my pump house.

90
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,721
- I always said you had
remarkable hearing for your age.

91
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,753
- I can't have sheep
pissing on my pump house

92
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,053
polluting my water.

93
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,678
- I've known you since you
fell off the turnip truck

94
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:37,732
Flagg Purdy and this
ain't about sheep piss.

95
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,208
- You never told me you
were gonna bring sheep in

96
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:39,812
over there.

97
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:41,830
- Well I guess forgot to mention
that since it's my pastor

98
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,327
and my well I figure I
can graze elephants there

99
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:44,896
if I want.

100
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,752
- Well Purdy's have been
using that well since you were

101
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:49,155
a gleam in your daddy's one good eye.

102
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,874
Purdy's have always used that well.

103
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,417
- And I never charged you for it.

104
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,856
- That's right Flagg.

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,586
- And I told you how I felt
about listening to that radio

106
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,189
program didn't I?

107
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,382
- [Gus] Flagg lets talk it over come on.

108
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:00,670
- No talking about it.

109
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:02,260
I will not have the sheep over there.

110
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:05,001
- I think you know better than
to come in here demanding.

111
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,369
- I'm not demanding anything
I'm telling you if you keep

112
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,501
your sheep over there I'm gonna sue you.

113
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,524
- You're gonna what?

114
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:13,789
- I'm gonna sue you.

115
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:16,748
- Now you don't mean that Flagg.

116
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,258
- You mule headed flat lander.

117
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:19,988
- You can compliment all you like.

118
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:21,184
I ain't gonna tolerate it.

119
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,239
- Okay, okay you go ahead
and sue and in the mean time

120
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,968
you get off my property.

121
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,524
- You ask me you're both
sounding like a couple

122
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,659
of puffed up roosters.

123
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,401
- And you can forget about
checkers next week too.

124
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,379
Yes sir, forget about it.

125
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,174
(sheep bleating)

126
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,378
He's spreading something
out there I know he is.

127
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,131
We ain't gonna get away with
it if you don't take 'em

128
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,588
away, we're gonna have
lamb stew all winter.

129
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,355
- How doing Flagg?

130
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,905
- I been better.

131
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,717
- When you think you'll be
around to clear that brush?

132
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,691
- Well I just canceled a
fence job so I can be over

133
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:05,956
almost anytime.

134
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,336
- Well I hope so.

135
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,772
You know what they say.

136
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,823
Time waits for no man.

137
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,771
- Nice sheep Flagg.

138
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,048
(laughing)

139
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,135
- These are the no luck
generation of deaf children.

140
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,178
- I heard that.

141
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:33,015
- Que dijo?

142
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,571
- Not importante.

143
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:36,016
Come on.

144
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:45,814
(sheep bleating)

145
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,376
- If I let him get away with
it he will be grazing elephants

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
out there.

147
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,226
Spoke to cousin Dale
about a lawyer in town.

148
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,893
I hate to bring the law into
it but we have no choice.

149
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:03,858
- Well you could make amends.

150
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,542
- Why can't he make amends for a change?

151
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,540
Why is it always me?

152
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:08,073
He's the one that started it.

153
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,651
- Be the one to finish it.

154
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,056
- No, it's too late.

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,716
He said some things he
shouldn't have said.

156
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,619
And besides, there is a
principal at stake here.

157
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,588
- What principal is that?

158
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,119
- Well I forget.

159
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:24,512
But we gotta protect our rights Ada honey.

160
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:27,328
Otherwise people'll be
walking all over poor folk.

161
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:34,240
- Seems to me Gus is pretty
much poor folks like us.

162
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,464
- There you go, protecting him again.

163
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,931
- It don't seem right to sue a friend.

164
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,569
Goodnight.

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,270
- He's been getting his way
since he was three years old.

166
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,447
Time somebody taught him
not to be so stubborn.

167
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,608
- [Voiceover] Well it'll take
a little while for people

168
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,601
to know that I'm back in town but...

169
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,553
No, no, no, there's plenty
of legal work in a town

170
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:10,631
this size.

171
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:12,431
With all the lawyers and
judges spouting their opinions

172
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:14,968
on TV, everybody's ready to
sue with a drop of a hat.

173
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:20,150
Listen I gotta go, somebody just came in.

174
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:21,819
I love you too Mom.

175
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:22,657
Okay, okay.

176
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,812
Bye bye.

177
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,380
Mr and Mrs. Purdy.

178
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,597
What can I do for you?

179
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:30,771
- We know each other?

180
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,373
- I used to hang out with Travis.

181
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,497
- Oh of course.

182
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,738
How are Scooter?

183
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,397
- Please sit down.

184
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,057
- You the fella that
took Travis joy riding in

185
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,473
the sheriff's car?

186
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:42,276
- Yeah.

187
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,410
(chuckles) That was quite a thing.

188
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,918
- Sheriff didn't think so.

189
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,172
- Well he got over it.

190
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:50,413
- And now you're a lawyer.

191
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,313
- If you think my criminal
background's gonna get

192
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,809
in the way of me giving
you good legal council,

193
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,288
I'll be happy to recommend
another lawyer in town.

194
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:02,056
- (clears throat) Well
my cousin Dale said...

195
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,267
- I just opened so I'd be cheap.

196
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,844
- Yeah.

197
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:09,884
- What seems to be the problem?

198
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,674
- Well this got this neighbor,
owns the general store

199
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,634
and he over charges people.

200
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,475
So they have a choice of either
shopping with him or going

201
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:19,774
all the way into town.

202
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,190
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

203
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,418
Now you've been friends with
Gus for a long time right?

204
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:27,122
- Yes sir until he started
polluting our drinking water

205
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,685
with sheep piss.

206
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:29,603
- Sheep piss?

207
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:31,842
- Sheep piss.

208
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,379
- (chuckles) Exactly how's
he been doing that Mr. Purdy?

209
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,004
- Well the way I see it,
he's been spreading special

210
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:41,465
treats around my pump house.

211
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,043
And when the sheep come
to eat the treats...

212
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,239
- That makes the...

213
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:46,458
- Exactly.

214
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:49,238
I have never seen sheep piss
so much in my entire life.

215
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,763
- Mr. Purdy I'm gonna
give you a fair assessment

216
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,143
of your case.

217
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,697
But what I'm gonna need
from you are the facts.

218
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,425
Not colored by your anger with Gus.

219
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,735
Mrs. Purdy you gonna be
a party to this case?

220
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,671
- Well I am worried about
our drinking water too.

221
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:11,271
I know you gotta get
this off your mind Flagg

222
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,453
and I will stand by you.

223
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,961
But I don't believe in suing.

224
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,313
So I won't be in on the party.

225
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,494
- What are you doing there you
running up our bill already?

226
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:26,676
- I can't run up your
bill until you hire me.

227
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,232
- Well I can't hire you
till I know you ain't been

228
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,891
in trouble with the law since you was 13.

229
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,744
- Are we counting parking tickets?

230
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:49,512
- Good luck Gus.

231
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,776
Ain't a nicer man in the county.

232
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,442
- We're with you Gus.

233
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,952
- I can't wait to get
the details on this one.

234
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,211
- Here comes the trouble maker now.

235
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,614
- Poor Ada having to go through all this.

236
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,355
- Hell I'd do the same
thing if somebody messed

237
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,848
with our water.

238
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,557
- I don't think you can park here Flagg.

239
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:12,856
- Oh yeah you can.

240
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,327
If it's your case you can.

241
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,413
- You wouldn't wanna
wade your 10 bucks on his

242
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:21,854
chances would you?

243
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,508
- What are you giving odds?

244
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:27,669
- Morning Ada.

245
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:28,693
- Good morning.

246
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,807
- Lynette hi.

247
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,252
- Mama wait.

248
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,055
(soft beat)

249
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,043
- Hey Papa.

250
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:52,985
- Hey sweetheart.

251
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,204
- [Voiceover] I just want
you to know I'm right back

252
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,110
here okay.

253
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,641
- [Flagg] Good, good.

254
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,080
- All right good luck Papa.

255
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,582
- I don't need to luck sweetheart,
I got the law on my side.

256
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,216
- Ladies and gentlemen.

257
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:08,285
For the past 30 years, the
Purdy family's been getting

258
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:10,479
their drinking water from the well.

259
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,400
It's currently owned by
their neighbor, Mr. Gus Falk.

260
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:17,700
Now in our state if the Purdy's
have been using the well

261
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,440
without comment or objection from Mr. Falk

262
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,341
for at least 10 years
which is the case here.

263
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:27,462
Well then they have the right
to continue getting clean,

264
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,058
uncontaminated drinking
water from the well.

265
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:35,820
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

266
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,513
My opponent has stated
his case very clearly.

267
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,532
There's just one problem.

268
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,157
He has no case.

269
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,802
Now it's true that Mr. Falk
never objected to the Purdy's

270
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:48,521
use of the well.

271
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:53,118
However, on at least one
occasion, he granted Mr. Purdy

272
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,657
specific permission to use
the well in exchange for

273
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:01,530
Mr. Purdy building a
pump house over the well.

274
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:06,457
Now it's through that
permissive use, that Mr. Falk

275
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:11,373
retains ownership of the
well, without interference

276
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,206
from Mr. Purdy.

277
00:15:15,593 --> 00:15:17,298
- Mr. Purdy has Mr. Falk ever
talked to you about the well

278
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,679
that you draw your water from?

279
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,478
- Yes he did.

280
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:22,419
- What?

281
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,217
- Yes he did.

282
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,669
- [Lawyer] Are you sure Mr. Purdy?

283
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,074
- Yeah I'm sure I told
him to keep his sheep away

284
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:28,455
from my pump house.

285
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,250
- I mean before that.

286
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,258
- No I don't recall he ever
talked to me before that.

287
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,208
- You mean before the sheep
started grazing near the well.

288
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:41,047
- It ain't the grazing I'm
concerned about it's the pissing.

289
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:46,496
- Mr. Purdy could you
please use some other word

290
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
to describe, perhaps
urination would be better.

291
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,437
- Sure judge I'll be happy to.

292
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:57,350
You see, the urination
is what causes the piss

293
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,068
to pollute the drinking water.

294
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,180
- I understand that Mr. Purdy.

295
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:02,480
- And I'll tell you something
else, he's got 20 acres

296
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,534
of land for them sheep to urinate on,

297
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:07,180
so how come they're always
pissing in my pump house?

298
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,641
- I'm sure that they don't
make a decision to go...

299
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:10,720
- I'll tell you why.

300
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:13,820
Diarrhetic treats and he's
the one that's doing it.

301
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:15,598
- Objection your honor,
there's no evidence to

302
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:16,874
substantiate...

303
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:18,449
- Sustained.

304
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:24,257
- Mr. Purdy, do you remember
when you built that pump house

305
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,049
for Mr. Falk?

306
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,649
- I don't recall maybe 10 years ago.

307
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,193
- Well let me refresh your memory.

308
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:32,688
It was 14 years ago this summer.

309
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,825
- 10, 14 what difference does it make?

310
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:37,843
- And do you recall the
conversation you had with Mr. Falk

311
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,805
why you were building the pump house.

312
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,627
- Now how in the world am I
gonna remember a coversation

313
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,752
I had 14 years ago.

314
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,086
- Mr. Purdy would you
please be more responsive

315
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,221
to the questions.

316
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,324
- Okay judge.

317
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,595
Oh I don't (mumbles).

318
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:56,243
- Mr. Falk thanked you for
building that pump house

319
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,874
since it improved the
value of his property.

320
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,139
Mr. Purdy.

321
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:04,289
- Mr. Purdy.

322
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:06,723
- Sorry judge, I don't remember any stuff.

323
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,526
Don't pay no mind.

324
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,848
They'll come around once
they see we're in the right.

325
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,320
- So you gonna come to
Jenny's volleyball with us?

326
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:22,557
- You haven't been to
a game all year Flagg.

327
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:24,744
- Could be good you know,

328
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,367
to kind of keep your mind
off of all this stuff.

329
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:29,642
- I don't need to take
my mind off nothing.

330
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,045
- [Jenny] Well never mind
I don't really care anyway.

331
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:33,938
Just so you know your
lawyer's gonna cost a lot more

332
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:35,506
than digging a new well wood.

333
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,276
This is so embarrassing.

334
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,962
- You gonna let your daughter talk to me?

335
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,877
- Well she's your daughter too.

336
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:44,555
You get half the blame.

337
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,383
- When your toilet backs
up on Christmas Eve you'll

338
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,226
be singing a different tune.

339
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,126
- [Gus] When Flagg was
building that pump house

340
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,609
I told that since it would add
the the value of my property

341
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,711
I'd continue not charging him for water.

342
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,766
He couldn't get that
through his thick skull.

343
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,075
- It would get through all
right if you ever said it.

344
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,185
- Mr. Reed please control your client.

345
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,754
- I'm sorry your honor.

346
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,367
- Say objection.

347
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,190
- Well I can't object to his recollection.

348
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,466
- Why not everybody objects to mine.

349
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,028
- Quiet down.

350
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,853
- Mr. Falk has there ever
been a written agreement

351
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,431
about the Purdy's use of the well.

352
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,871
- I never saw one.

353
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:30,183
- You ever use the well yourself?

354
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,507
- I never needed to but
I'm planning to use it

355
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:33,586
one of these days, when I
put up some mobile homes

356
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,544
on the land.

357
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,037
- Mobile homes.

358
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,692
- Mr Purdy.

359
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:48,742
- Well, we really have a
dilemma here then don't we?

360
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,569
I mean it all boils
down to Mr. Purdy's word

361
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:52,077
against yours.

362
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:54,859
- That ain't exactly true.

363
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:57,801
- Who are you?

364
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:01,841
- Ed Mclvor I thought I
might as well put in my two

365
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,380
cents here.

366
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,977
- (sighs) What do you
know about this case?

367
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:12,463
- And you say you were
present when Mr. Falk

368
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:16,120
and Mr. Purdy discussed
the pump house Mr. Purdy

369
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,604
was going to build on
the adjacent property.

370
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:22,563
- Gus told Flagg he'd count the pump house

371
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:26,405
as payment for the water, that's all.

372
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,177
All this fuss over nothing.

373
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,437
Until the poker game.

374
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,729
- What poker game?

375
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,923
- The one we used to play
every Wednesday night

376
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:39,430
until Gus and Flagg got in a fight.

377
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:40,708
Ain't played since.

378
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,530
- Well what does this
got to do with the well?

379
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:45,409
- Flagg called Gus a cheater, Gus got mad

380
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,847
and said he couldn't
use the water anymore.

381
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,537
- I didn't mean that.

382
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:52,224
I was mad.

383
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,082
- Mr. Falk sit down.

384
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,765
Will you and Mr. Purdy
stop jumping up and down

385
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,942
like this is a kangaroo court.

386
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,965
- [Lawyer] When was this poker game?

387
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:02,602
- 11 years ago.

388
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,456
- Did Mr. Purdy stop using the well?

389
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,795
- He don't know Flagg
very well does he Bill.

390
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,607
- Why didn't you come
forward with this information

391
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:13,640
before now?

392
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,405
- How'd I know you needed
it, the only reason

393
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,726
I come down to the courthouse
no one around to talk to.

394
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,763
Everyone's here wasting their time.

395
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,908
- Thank you Mr. Mclvor.

396
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:28,622
No further questions.

397
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,064
- Mr. Reed?

398
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:34,693
- No, no questions your honor.

399
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,226
- Wasn't me.

400
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,265
- Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury have you reached

401
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,129
a verdict?

402
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,622
- We have your honor.

403
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:22,968
- Although I strongly
disagree with the verdict.

404
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,691
Unfortunately in this case
we must follow the law.

405
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:31,048
The jury finds that the Purdy's
have used the well without

406
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:34,769
Mr. Falk's permission
for at least 10 years.

407
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,372
And therefore have the right
to continue getting clean

408
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,003
water from that well.

409
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:45,763
(chatter)

410
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,344
- Order, this trial is not over.

411
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,133
Quiet down now.

412
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:58,801
- She said quiet.

413
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:01,958
- [All] Yes (mumbles).

414
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,767
- What about the piss?

415
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:10,264
- Mr. Purdy I have had
just about enough from you.

416
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,161
- Your honor I apologize you are right.

417
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:15,870
But he does have a point.

418
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:18,089
- Yes, yes I know.

419
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:20,386
To protect the plaintiff's
right to use the well

420
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,823
for domestic water purposes,
I will allow him to protect

421
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:27,962
the area within 10 feet
of the well with a fence.

422
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,947
Court is adjourned, ladies
and gentleman thank you

423
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,696
for your service, you are excused.

424
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:49,420
Hey, hey, hey!

425
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,963
Hey where are you going?

426
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:52,514
Hey, hey!

427
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:56,102
Hey, hey wait.

428
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,426
Won't start?

429
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,919
- Nope, won't start.

430
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,684
- Change the gas since last summer?

431
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,180
- No, I didn't.

432
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,980
- You know old gas is gonna
clog up the carburetor.

433
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:26,042
I can flush it out and drain for you.

434
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,193
- Oh that's okay Flagg,
I'll do it myself okay.

435
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:39,020
Thanks for coming by.

436
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:42,485
- Tractor working?

437
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,780
- Okay Flagg.

438
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,862
- You got about four feet of
fence knocked out in front.

439
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,417
Want me to take care of that?

440
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,258
- Nope, I got it Flagg, thank you.

441
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,423
- Okay.

442
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:53,568
- [Man] Okay Flagg.

443
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,285
(slow music)

444
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:10,465
- Sorry Flagg I couldn't wait no more.

445
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,649
Ray's getting real nervous
about not seeing him coming.

446
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,971
- Seen who coming?

447
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,991
- Feds.

448
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:18,373
FBI, CIA, DEA.

449
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:19,685
- Yeah right.

450
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,263
Okay well I'll see you next week.

451
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,770
- About that you know Scott
and Ernie aren't too keen

452
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,651
on your whole bow and arrow thing.

453
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:27,364
We're taking AK47's.

454
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,109
- Well I'll stick with my
bow and arrow that way I give

455
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,002
them a fighting chance.

456
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:35,085
- No you know, I think we're
just gonna be more without you.

457
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,201
- This wouldn't have
anything to do with my win

458
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:39,849
in the court case would it?

459
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:42,178
- My daddy says you stole Gus's well.

460
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,860
- Well your daddy's wrong boy.

461
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:50,506
You boys are going to
need a doctor when they

462
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,242
get through burning up poison oak.

463
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,067
- Did you touch that with your hands?

464
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,623
Did you touch that with...

465
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:58,530
Boys!

466
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:00,687
Get away from there.

467
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:01,987
- [Ada] Oh I'm real glad you liked them.

468
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,481
I'm happy with the brown.

469
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,356
- I gotta go.

470
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,817
- See ya.

471
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,364
You finished the Durban's already?

472
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,803
- Boys are doing it.

473
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:24,497
- Oh well I guess you can't blame 'em.

474
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:26,432
It's been nearly a month.

475
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:28,398
- You'd think they was Gus's
relatives the way you were

476
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:30,229
siding with them.

477
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:32,086
What'd Rachel want?

478
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,628
- Oh she just came by to say hello.

479
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:35,929
- Guess she's got more
important things to do

480
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,949
than talk to me.

481
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,185
- No she was late for a...

482
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,762
meet.

483
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:50,806
(slow music)

484
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:28,286
- I'm sorry Ada.

485
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:31,248
But people don't think
it's right for me to have

486
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:33,066
the Purdy name in my store.

487
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:37,029
- I'd never thought I'd see
the day you'd hide behind

488
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,327
the neighbors Gus Falk.

489
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:41,587
- It's nothing against you personally Ada.

490
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:55,605
(sheep bleating)

491
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,057
- I hear the Millers
wanna build a car port.

492
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:07,787
- They already got somebody.

493
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,331
There isn't any work for me anywhere.

494
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:11,095
I don't know how we're gonna get by.

495
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,611
- Well something's bound
to turn up sweetheart.

496
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,001
- Yeah when I'm dead and buried.

497
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:32,512
- What happened?

498
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,008
- Some kids at school were
saying bad things about

499
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,669
Mr. Purdy.

500
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:38,163
- They'll forget about
it in a few days Jen.

501
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,033
- No they won't.

502
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,914
Why did he have to do this?

503
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,307
- It's just his way.

504
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:45,152
He's got his principals.

505
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:47,136
- I don't really care about
his stupid principals.

506
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,908
I'm not going back to that school.

507
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,569
- What's wrong with that school?

508
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,250
(groans)

509
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,585
Now what did I say?

510
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,485
- Oh it's what the kids
at school are saying.

511
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:03,030
- It ain't the kids
Ada it's their parents.

512
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:06,003
I never took anything in my
life that didn't belong to me.

513
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:07,743
- Well I know that Flagg.

514
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,589
But people see it differently.

515
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,070
- Well I can't be responsible
for what people think.

516
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:14,791
Get.

517
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:16,229
Get the hell out of here.

518
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:17,763
Lie down!

519
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:20,161
- [Ada] Just wants to be near you Flagg.

520
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:23,958
- What's that sign for?

521
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:27,886
- Gus won't sell my eggs anymore.

522
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,967
- He can't do that.

523
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,743
- Well he done it.

524
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,428
- I'm...

525
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:32,541
- Now we had enough of that.

526
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:33,946
- No I won't stand for that.

527
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,106
- Now where are you going?

528
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,858
- I'm going to the supermarket in town.

529
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,565
I'm gonna buy a lot of
groceries and I'm gonna drive

530
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:41,198
past his place real slow.

531
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:55,996
- [Kid] There's Jenny's old man.

532
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,670
- [Voiceover] Yeah you think
he paid for the groceries?

533
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,014
- No, no he probably stole them too.

534
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,682
(laughing)

535
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,745
What, what?

536
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:08,616
(mumbles)

537
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,649
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

538
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:11,386
Can't believe she has
an old man like that.

539
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,474
- Hop in Ed.

540
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:34,714
- My legs are doing just fine.

541
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,107
- No come on let me give you a ride.

542
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,094
It's the least I can do.

543
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,172
You helped me win the case.

544
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,865
- If I knew what I was
doing I'd never done it.

545
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,475
- I have a right to clean water.

546
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,027
- I ain't denying your right.

547
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,927
I don't like the way you
went about getting it.

548
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,980
- I did what I thought was right Ed.

549
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,590
- Flagg, you're a mean,

550
00:29:57,357 --> 00:30:00,229
stubborn, self righteous man.

551
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:03,834
Just like your Pa, only worse.

552
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:06,434
- I'm not like my father.

553
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,345
(chuckles)

554
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,489
I'm not like my father.

555
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:20,512
(slow music)

556
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,330
- What happened?

557
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,801
- Talk about it later.

558
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,584
(sighs)

559
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:04,410
Now what did I do?

560
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:06,042
I can't say anything right.

561
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,624
- She was worried about you.

562
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:12,025
- Can't do a damn thing,
can't say a damn thing.

563
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,405
Doesn't piss somebody off.

564
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:16,250
- Now you go get out of those wet things

565
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,445
you'll catch your death a cold.

566
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,302
Fix you a cup of hot tea.

567
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,260
- Tea ain't gonna help me none.

568
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:39,023
- It's passed 10 o'clock Flagg.

569
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:46,631
Brought you some coffee.

570
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:56,638
You want me to fry you up some sausages?

571
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,894
Coffee's there if you want it.

572
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:04,598
- It's come Ada.

573
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:10,641
- What's come?

574
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:13,380
- The coldness in my legs.

575
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:15,976
It comes to all the Purdy's near the end.

576
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:24,153
- They don't feel cold.

577
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,533
- They're cold on the inside.

578
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,343
- Now I'll get the hot water bottle.

579
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,120
- Ada, call the children.

580
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:31,649
- What for?

581
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,215
I wanna say goodbye.

582
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:41,025
- I think maybe you got a little cold.

583
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,623
- I need to see them.

584
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,000
- Okay I'll start calling.

585
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:53,139
- Ada, I'm sorry I ain't
been a better husband to you.

586
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:58,516
- I knew what I was getting
when I married you Flagg Purdy.

587
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:07,319
All right then you go for you
and for you, thanks so much.

588
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:10,338
You know I'll be exclusively
selling eggs from right here

589
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:12,705
so I do appreciate you coming out.

590
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,423
Okay thanks Linda.

591
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:15,777
See you next week.

592
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,279
- [Jenny] Hi.

593
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:19,694
- More trouble at school?

594
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:22,202
- No, teacher meetings.

595
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:25,301
- Well there's some water
heating on the stove,

596
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,909
would you take the hot
water bottle into your Pa.

597
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,254
- He's still in bed?

598
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:36,883
Hi.

599
00:33:36,907 --> 00:33:38,566
- What are you doing home?

600
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,081
Did you quit school?

601
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,927
- No, why would I do that?

602
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:47,151
- Well I know the kids have
been giving you a hard time.

603
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,348
- Thanks.

604
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,923
But, I took care of them.

605
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:56,241
- I'm sorry I missed your game Jenny.

606
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,624
- It's okay we got killed anyways.

607
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:00,866
- Don't matter I should,

608
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,568
I should have been there anyway.

609
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:06,311
- Well you know what
basketball seasons coming up

610
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,587
and I think they're gonna start me

611
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,661
so, you can come to one of those games.

612
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:12,598
- I won't be here.

613
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,394
This is for you

614
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,560
So you're not late for your games.

615
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,404
- Your Timex.

616
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:26,784
Thanks Papa.

617
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:38,084
- [Ada] Well it's his way
of saying he loves you.

618
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:39,879
- He could just say it.

619
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:43,470
- He's feeling a little
down because the trial.

620
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:46,048
- But he won.

621
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:47,081
- Well.

622
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,904
- This is so stupid.

623
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:51,023
- You wanna help me call
your brothers and sisters?

624
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:53,635
He wants to see them.

625
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,346
- I'll call Anne Marie.

626
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,697
- He didn't say nothing about Anne Marie.

627
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,757
My darlings.

628
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:37,266
Hi.

629
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,962
Hi.

630
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,679
You've been minding your
Ma and Pa not fighting?

631
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:42,607
- Yeah.

632
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:46,345
- Well then there just might
be some ginger bread cookies

633
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:48,697
on the kitchen table for you.

634
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:53,344
Travis Jr.

635
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,735
You ain't bringing no worms
into my kitchen are you?

636
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:58,198
Thank you.

637
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,969
- Wash your hands before you...

638
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,649
- Hey Travis.

639
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,238
Look at you.

640
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:13,268
How beautiful grandma.

641
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:16,054
You are so beautiful.

642
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:18,597
Well I'll get the sleeping
bags for the children.

643
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:21,336
- Oh don't trouble yourself
I'm driving back tonight.

644
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,809
We don't want Porter and
Travis Jr. to miss school.

645
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,848
- Yeah and I'm gonna
stay with Tammy's folks.

646
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,958
- Well I'm glad you came.

647
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,071
The way you sounded on
the phone I wasn't sure

648
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:33,476
you'd come.

649
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,746
- Well, he thought about it some more.

650
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,898
- How are your chickens mama?

651
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,395
- Fine.

652
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:42,253
- How's Flagg?

653
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,992
- I don't know what the big
deal is if it's just a cold.

654
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:48,115
- [Ada] Well he's acting like
he's about to meet his maker.

655
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,738
- Well it isn't like he
asks you to come everyday.

656
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:52,573
Is Eldon coming?

657
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:54,373
- He should be coming later.

658
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:57,518
- Oh great, we haven't
seen him in a long time.

659
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,829
Isn't that great Travis?

660
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:00,235
- Yeah.

661
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,637
Hey mama we passed Flagg's
truck on the way in.

662
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:05,017
Can I fix the flat while I'm here?

663
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,883
- Oh that'll be fine Travis.

664
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:11,135
Say hi to grnadpa.

665
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,774
- Hello everybody.

666
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:13,749
- Hi grandpa.

667
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,828
- Thank you, thank you.

668
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:15,815
Watch your knee.

669
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,252
Watch your knee on grandpa.

670
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,807
Thank you dear.

671
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:20,656
Thank you.

672
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,126
Oh look is that for me?

673
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:25,032
To Grandpa.

674
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:26,913
Look at that.

675
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:29,067
I don't know what it is
but I like it very much.

676
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:32,934
(sighs)

677
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:33,979
Let me see the baby.

678
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,000
- Here she is.

679
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,446
- Let me see the baby.

680
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:42,813
I'm sorry I'm not gonna get
to see you grow up Brittanya.

681
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:46,180
- Flagg you're gonna see
all the children grow up.

682
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:48,315
- Are you taking your nap grandpa?

683
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,997
- No grandpa's dying Porter.

684
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,099
You gonna remember grandpa when he's gone?

685
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:53,773
- Mhm.

686
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,118
- Yeah.

687
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,393
- I remember when you yelled at daddy.

688
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,716
(chuckles)

689
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,295
- Grandpa was just kidding sweetheart.

690
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,711
- Where you going grandpa?

691
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:04,935
- You ask your Pa to tell you Travis Jr.

692
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,051
- Now Flagg don't be
giving them any money.

693
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,233
- No, no now I can give
my grandchildren something

694
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:11,673
to hold to.

695
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,275
- Share that with your
brother and your sister.

696
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:14,830
- Hey share.

697
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,037
- Share it you hear me.

698
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,279
- You're supposed to share.

699
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,149
Give me!

700
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,391
Give me!

701
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:21,993
- Hey, hey okay come on.

702
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:23,177
- I'll see you before you head for home.

703
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,121
- [Flagg] Now don't forget
your grandpa now hear.

704
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:32,391
(coughing)

705
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,420
I'm okay.

706
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:50,901
Sit (mumbles) Travis.

707
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,101
We may not have another chance to talk.

708
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,042
- Ma told me that Scooter
Reed was back in town.

709
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:20,502
- Yeah he did a pretty
good job on the trial too.

710
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,714
Just haven't gotten his bill yet.

711
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:27,756
- I guess you can wake up
one morning and know you're

712
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,757
gonna die.

713
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,694
I just never heard of it before.

714
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:33,204
- Purdy's ain't like other people.

715
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:35,537
- You're the master or
understatement Flagg.

716
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,140
- Yeah.

717
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:42,164
Travis, I want you to
have my outboard motor.

718
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,871
- Well that's nice of you
Flagg but I don't have a boat.

719
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:45,672
- You don't have a boat?

720
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:46,553
- No.

721
00:39:46,577 --> 00:39:47,507
- How do you fish?

722
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:49,190
- Well I ain't been fishing
since I was Travis Jr.'s age.

723
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:51,533
- Well what are you doing
with all them worms then?

724
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:52,695
- Well they're not bait worms Flagg,

725
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,780
they're compost and
garbage in the fertilizer.

726
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,867
- You compost garbage for a living?

727
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:01,633
- I sell the worms that do that.

728
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:02,919
Here.

729
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,752
- I'll be damned.

730
00:40:14,776 --> 00:40:17,388
I didn't know you were
helping the environment.

731
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:19,612
- There's a lot of things you
don't know about me Flagg.

732
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,282
- Yeah.

733
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,359
Like what?

734
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:32,084
Travis, take that board,
buy yourself a boat

735
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:35,462
and take the kids out
fishing while you can.

736
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:37,645
- It's amazing the insights
grandparents get about kids

737
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,222
'cause I would have given
anything to have you take

738
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,405
me fishing when I was their age.

739
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,030
- I don't remember you ever asking.

740
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:45,946
- None of the other kids had to ask.

741
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,793
And their Pa's were working.

742
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:53,137
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

743
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:56,929
- You can buy my coffin Travis,
make sure it's worm proof.

744
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:02,714
(coughing)

745
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,177
- Well she got a bunch of money from

746
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,819
her third or fourth divorce.

747
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,061
I don't know.

748
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:09,998
And of course I get an
appointment to show her a house.

749
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:12,552
She shows up dressed to
the nine, pointing out

750
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:15,864
all the stops just trying to
impress me with her money.

751
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:17,617
You know the beamer, the mint coat.

752
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,374
The silicon bazoomies out to here.

753
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,252
- What?

754
00:41:21,276 --> 00:41:22,285
Beverly Baker?

755
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:24,351
No way she was flat as a pancake.

756
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,219
- More like five day old roadkill.

757
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,845
Honk, honk.

758
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,181
So I'm shocked...

759
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:31,474
- He's pissed because I wouldn't
take his outboard motor.

760
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,760
- You're still eating dairy aren't ya?

761
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:39,489
I can smell it.

762
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,906
- [Travis] You're still
raiding worm farmers slightly

763
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,599
below people who sell their
owns homes aren't you?

764
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:44,555
- Ooo good one.

765
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:45,298
- I'll call you back.

766
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:46,534
Oh my god.

767
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,894
- Hello Jenny.

768
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:51,504
- [Jenny] I'm doing my homework.

769
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:54,870
- Mama.

770
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,509
Get, get in there.

771
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,003
- [Jenny] Jeez already.

772
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,649
- That is one hell of a
mistake you and papa had.

773
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,767
- Whatever he gives you, you take.

774
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,308
- Hi papa.

775
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,272
- Hi dear.

776
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:16,896
- Here's a fresh one for you.

777
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,087
- Thank you.

778
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:26,067
(sighs)

779
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,923
Derek wanted to come but
he's working days now so.

780
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:34,584
- Oh, maybe you two can
start having a family of

781
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,686
your own now that you're
sleeping in the same bed

782
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,202
at the same time.

783
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:46,426
- You find that funny?

784
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,618
- No.

785
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:55,156
I just can't stop thinking
about silicon bazoomies.

786
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,422
(laughing)

787
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:58,442
- I'm on my deathbed
and you're making jokes.

788
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:00,730
- Oh papa you're not on your
deathbed you're just feeling

789
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:02,087
sorry for yourself.

790
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:03,132
- Rachel.

791
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:04,733
- Now that your sister's
a big developer she thinks

792
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:06,185
she can insult me.

793
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,949
- I'm not a developer.

794
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:11,026
- Your selling houses on
prime farmland graden sprawl,

795
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,152
what do you call it.

796
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,974
- You know if you would just
take the time to find out

797
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:16,203
what it is that I do you
would know that I'm...

798
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:17,806
- You're the final one to talk!

799
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,990
You didn't even come to the courthouse!

800
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,963
- Oh and watch you make
a fool of yourself.

801
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,948
You know if you were
just reasonable with Gus.

802
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:25,189
- I will not hear that name in my house.

803
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:28,810
- Linette, I'm gonna go talk
to Gus, about helping Gus

804
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:31,806
build those mobile homes that
Gus is putting up next door.

805
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,432
(wheezing)

806
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:35,725
- Papa, papa, breath, breath, breath.

807
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:42,679
- Sweetheart, go get mama's
jewelry box over there.

808
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,351
You'll be laughing on the
other side of your face

809
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:49,319
when I'm lying out there in
a pine box six feet under.

810
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:56,243
Here sweetheart, I want you to have it.

811
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,042
- Papa these are mama's.

812
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,482
- That's okay I bought 'em for her.

813
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,629
- [Linette] No, no I don't
feel right about that.

814
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:02,916
- No, no it's all right dear.

815
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,344
They're not real anyway.

816
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:07,200
If you don't want 'em
save 'em for your children

817
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:08,721
when you have 'em.

818
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:10,109
Here, here.

819
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:12,680
Give these to her.

820
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:13,736
(groans)

821
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,938
- I'm out of here.

822
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:20,224
- Papa, breath, breath. breath.

823
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,663
- I'm all right now.

824
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:28,251
- Looks like the cold
went right to his brain.

825
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,883
Time we had a litte talk.

826
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:36,572
- Yoohoo, I've brought my
famous funeral casserole.

827
00:44:39,037 --> 00:44:42,862
- I'm sure Flagg will
appreciate the thought Melinda.

828
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,489
- That'll kill him for sure.

829
00:44:46,513 --> 00:44:49,089
- I figured with all the
youngins coming for the funeral.

830
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:50,819
- Anne Marie's not coming.

831
00:44:50,843 --> 00:44:53,698
- Oh, I didn't think Anne
Marie was gonna be here.

832
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:55,544
- Sure you did.

833
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,455
- I'll tell Flagg you brought it.

834
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:09,261
- Well, I'll be going then.

835
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,503
- [Flagg] Ada, who you
gabbling with out there?

836
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,477
- Oh it's Melinda.

837
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,720
She brought you her famous casserole.

838
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:22,693
- Well send her in so I can thank her.

839
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,584
- Well hi there.

840
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,891
Linda says you both wanna buy some eggs.

841
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:41,643
- How many would you like?

842
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:43,060
Oh that's my son.

843
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:44,696
I gotta greet him.

844
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,042
Hello.

845
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:48,062
There you are.

846
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:49,452
(chuckles)

847
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,740
How was your trip?

848
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,435
- Long.

849
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:58,080
- [Ada] Look at your and your stuff.

850
00:45:58,104 --> 00:45:59,700
(chuckles)

851
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,339
Oh good to see you.

852
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,440
- Hey.

853
00:46:05,464 --> 00:46:07,437
How's the spiritual real estate game.

854
00:46:07,461 --> 00:46:10,317
- Don't knock it I bet my
congregations bigger than yours.

855
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:12,045
- Yeah I bet it is.

856
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,964
Hey there.

857
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,135
- How are you.

858
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,622
It's good to see you.

859
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:17,746
- Hows Derek?

860
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,872
- Oh he's fine.

861
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:21,542
He wanted to come but
he had to work today so.

862
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:22,969
(phone ringing)

863
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:26,185
- Oh ah, I'm gonna be
right back with your eggs.

864
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,899
Come with me a minute Eldon.

865
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:32,245
- So hows pop?

866
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,010
- I know better.

867
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:36,309
I've been telling the
others it's just a cold but,

868
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,485
I'm beginning to think it's
got more to do with the trial.

869
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:42,102
- How so?

870
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:45,481
- Well I think he knows it
was a mistake to sue Gus,

871
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:48,552
and he can't find a way out
of it because of his pride.

872
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:03,417
- No wonder you fell
in love with them mama.

873
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:04,659
These are beautiful.

874
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:07,735
- Fertilized eggs are supposed
to be lower in cholesterol

875
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,948
and I figure the market'll brew.

876
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,571
Strictly organic.

877
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:19,054
- Hey did you do something
new to your hair?

878
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:20,562
- I cut it a bit.

879
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:21,620
- Well it looks nice.

880
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,346
Hey Travis.

881
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,001
What do robbins do before breakfast?

882
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,188
- I don't know, what?

883
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,139
- Warm ups.

884
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,159
Ha!

885
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,724
All right I keep telling
the (mumbles) to give it up

886
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:38,405
but they just keep coming
up with more worm jokes.

887
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:39,795
- Whatever.

888
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:41,900
- [Linette] Hows the new church?

889
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,664
- Well we're raising the
money for the walls while

890
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:46,022
the good lord lays the
foundation and I guess it's just

891
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:48,320
my job to make sure
everybody knows he's keeping

892
00:47:48,344 --> 00:47:49,980
his end of the bargain.

893
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:51,979
- Well you can't count me
in for a contribution bro.

894
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:52,677
- [Eldon] Okay.

895
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:53,697
- As long as you'll take a credit card.

896
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,161
- [Eldon] Oh yeah we'll max you out.

897
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:59,578
- I hope you can help
papa Eldon I really do.

898
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:03,065
- Well I'll try but,
you know how he is about

899
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,935
being ministered to.

900
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:06,734
- About the same as the rest of us.

901
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,624
- So tell me reverend, what's
god's cost for new square

902
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:11,656
foot construction?

903
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,612
- [Eldon] Well, that's a
very complicated question.

904
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:20,853
I don't know (mumbles).

905
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:22,346
- [Ada] Square footage.

906
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,890
- Oh, mama that's your set.

907
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:28,933
- He insisted I take them Ada.

908
00:48:28,957 --> 00:48:30,600
I didn't want to upset him.

909
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:33,647
- Sorry.

910
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:35,353
Mama he can't give away your stuff.

911
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:37,489
- I reckon he can give
away anything he wants to

912
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:39,230
in his own house.

913
00:48:39,254 --> 00:48:41,164
- Except it ain't just his house.

914
00:48:54,729 --> 00:48:56,667
- [Linette] He's giving away
everything they own Eldon,

915
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:58,872
including mama's things.

916
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:01,229
- Mama I think you better get
all your things out of there.

917
00:49:01,253 --> 00:49:02,889
- You know why don't we
just move him out of there

918
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:05,160
and give those sheep
something else to piss on.

919
00:49:06,268 --> 00:49:08,264
- Will you talk to him son?

920
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:10,368
He listens to you.

921
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:14,854
- It's good to see you son.

922
00:49:14,878 --> 00:49:16,874
- It's good to see you too papa.

923
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,726
- I can't keep a thing down.

924
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:24,141
- It came on kind of a sudden didn't it?

925
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,934
- Yeah well, can't predict these things.

926
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:29,539
- That's true.

927
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:30,832
But I never would of been
predicting that you'd be giving

928
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:33,886
away all your things and mama's.

929
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,904
- I want people to think
kind of me after I go.

930
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:39,063
- Yeah see I told them that had to be it.

931
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:41,322
That it couldn't be that
you were seeking salvation.

932
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,823
- Who was saying that?

933
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:48,071
Who said I'm not seeking salvation?

934
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:49,716
- You know just...

935
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,338
folks, you know how they are.

936
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,985
- Yes I do I know how people are.

937
00:49:57,186 --> 00:49:58,642
I know how they are.

938
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:05,102
You didn't know my pa did you son?

939
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:06,762
- No he was pretty ill when
he died but I do remember

940
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:08,306
being afraid of him.

941
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,164
- Yeah he did that to people.

942
00:50:10,188 --> 00:50:13,206
- Sang to him on his Bible
thumping, his temper.

943
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,035
You know nobody showed up at his funeral.

944
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:18,441
Not even family.

945
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:20,263
Just me and ma.

946
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,516
Hurt my ma real bad.

947
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,531
- You're afraid the same
thing will happen to you.

948
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:29,187
You're nothing like your pa.

949
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:32,506
- No.

950
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:36,319
- You know that trial
might have been a mistake

951
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,496
but it's not too late to change that.

952
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:42,355
- I don't know what good that'll do.

953
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:44,150
- You might be surprised.

954
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,696
You can start by getting out of this bed.

955
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,849
- This is a good place that
I need to wait for the end.

956
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:57,129
Whoa.

957
00:50:59,897 --> 00:51:01,870
Here son.

958
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:03,665
Here, here.

959
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:07,229
Here this is for the church building fund.

960
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,795
I'd like you to say a few words over me.

961
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,311
When my time comes.

962
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:21,849
(slow music)

963
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:23,534
- [Jenny] Don't they have
pills for this kind of thing?

964
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,414
- [Voiceover] Ther you go
lets slip some prozac into

965
00:51:25,438 --> 00:51:27,491
his hot water bottle.

966
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:29,511
- I think we should call Anne Marie.

967
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:30,835
- Forget it.

968
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:33,597
- Oh you don't know what it
was like between her and papa.

969
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,396
- Like when she told him
she was marrying Jurvis.

970
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,644
- Oh god I thought the
roof would come off.

971
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,735
I mean a used car
salesman for a son in law.

972
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:43,461
- Yeah they're worse than developers.

973
00:51:45,753 --> 00:51:48,383
- I thought things would get
better after her divorce.

974
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:50,953
- Why should she bother with us?

975
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,927
She's a big star.

976
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:55,272
The perfect talk show host.

977
00:51:55,296 --> 00:51:57,431
Full of opinions and a big mouth.

978
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:58,766
- You have a nice thing to
say about everyone don't

979
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,973
you Rachel?

980
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,610
- Oh come on Travis it
wouldn't hurt her to drive

981
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:04,409
two hours to see mom
every once in a while.

982
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:06,625
- Well she does call.

983
00:52:06,649 --> 00:52:07,949
- I don't really care what you guys say,

984
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:09,412
mama I know she can help.

985
00:52:09,436 --> 00:52:11,233
(honking)

986
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:12,762
- Oh my lord.

987
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:15,780
Oh god.

988
00:52:17,654 --> 00:52:19,325
- I'm outta here.

989
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,209
- Who is it?

990
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:21,612
- Wait Rachel I'm going with you.

991
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:23,645
- Now don't be rude.

992
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:24,469
- Who is it?

993
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:25,687
- Aunt Edith.

994
00:52:25,711 --> 00:52:27,151
- [Ada] It's your uncle Ben's widow.

995
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:29,588
She hasn't been here since
before you were born.

996
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:30,878
- God what a family.

997
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,232
- You'll get used to it honey.

998
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:36,485
- Hello Purdy's.

999
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:37,909
- [Ada] Hello Edith.

1000
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:40,560
It's been a long time.

1001
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,952
- I heard my brother in laws dying.

1002
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:45,222
I guess there's some justice
in the world after all.

1003
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:50,149
- Oh no Edith.

1004
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,332
- If you're gonna start
with your nasty comments,

1005
00:52:52,356 --> 00:52:54,514
you can just march
yourself out here they way

1006
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,571
you come in.

1007
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:58,247
- I'm sorry Ada, you never
did appreciate my humor.

1008
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:01,793
I'm here to pay my respects.

1009
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:03,105
- How'd you find out?

1010
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:06,506
- Nothing the Purdy's do in
this county I don't hear about.

1011
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,946
(chuckles)

1012
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:10,024
Lets see now, this is...

1013
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:11,447
- Linette.

1014
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:15,572
- You moving back to town Eldon?

1015
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,511
- I wasn't planning on it.

1016
00:53:17,535 --> 00:53:18,962
- I thought you might.

1017
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:21,586
'Cause praying for Flagg
is a full time job.

1018
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,404
(chuckles)

1019
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:29,504
Well Travis, I'm
surprised to see you here.

1020
00:53:29,528 --> 00:53:31,349
- You're not the only one aunt Edith.

1021
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,655
- [Eldon] He is part of the family Edith.

1022
00:53:36,284 --> 00:53:38,635
- You come to sell the house Rachel?

1023
00:53:39,524 --> 00:53:41,043
(phone ringing)

1024
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,397
- Hello?

1025
00:53:47,278 --> 00:53:49,901
- Is that because she never
could stand the smell of pigs.

1026
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:54,757
Now, now who's this one here?

1027
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,506
- It's our youngest, Jenny.

1028
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,690
- She must have your jeans Ada.

1029
00:54:00,714 --> 00:54:04,057
You sure are growing up in
the right places sweetheart.

1030
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:07,481
- You know what aunt
Edith, I have to be going.

1031
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:09,420
So you take care now.

1032
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:12,148
- I come visit once in 20
years, you can't stick around

1033
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:13,309
for a few minutes.

1034
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,365
- No, I'm sorry.

1035
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:18,069
I'm late for the doctor
so I gotta get going.

1036
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,666
So, bye bye.

1037
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,850
- Flagg ain't got nothing
that's catching does he?

1038
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,085
- We're not sure.

1039
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:32,622
- We ain't been that
close of a family child.

1040
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:35,718
I gotta tell you.

1041
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:37,606
I sure miss having family.

1042
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,651
So, where is the old coop?

1043
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:49,789
You look like hell.

1044
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,524
- Come to cheer me up did you?

1045
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:54,897
- (chuckles) I could
recommend a good mortician.

1046
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:59,164
Remember what your pa always said

1047
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:01,213
We all gotta go sometime.

1048
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:06,008
And the sins of the father
shall be visited upon the sun.

1049
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:11,259
I brought you some of Ben's things.

1050
00:55:11,283 --> 00:55:12,873
Maybe they'll comfort you in the end.

1051
00:55:12,897 --> 00:55:15,079
- You should of told me his
time had come so I could

1052
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,971
of made my peace with him.

1053
00:55:16,995 --> 00:55:18,814
- There's only one way
to find peace Flagg.

1054
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,609
Right in all your wrongs.

1055
00:55:31,263 --> 00:55:33,120
- So you're taking Spanish
now I take it here.

1056
00:55:33,144 --> 00:55:33,865
- Yes.

1057
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:34,725
- Do you have...

1058
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:35,504
- I hate it.

1059
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:37,244
- Do you have Mrs. Walsh?

1060
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:38,871
(laughing)

1061
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:43,067
Oh my god, can you tell me how to say

1062
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:44,558
I know I want a beer
because I'm gonna sneak into

1063
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,144
a bar very soon.

1064
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,533
- It's mamacita.

1065
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,026
- Egg money?

1066
00:55:54,941 --> 00:55:56,224
- Egg money.

1067
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,065
- He gave it to me.

1068
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,053
- What the heck is she talking about?

1069
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:24,591
- But you can't let
her take your bed mama.

1070
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:35,312
- Giving away the bed
is like giving up on us

1071
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:37,107
being together.

1072
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:48,291
(laughing)

1073
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:52,852
- But do you remember when
I had to watch that TV show,

1074
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,069
for biology class remember.

1075
00:56:55,093 --> 00:56:56,438
It had the live birth.

1076
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:59,044
- [Voiceover] I won't
tolerate that kind of thing in

1077
00:56:59,068 --> 00:57:00,307
my house.

1078
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:01,585
- [Linette] And he took
the TV and he threw it

1079
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:02,920
in the crack.

1080
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:04,859
- [Eldon] Oh it's still down
there I saw it this morning

1081
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:06,240
on my walk.

1082
00:57:06,264 --> 00:57:07,447
It is.

1083
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:10,059
- You could see the
rabbit ears sticking out.

1084
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,218
- Do you remember that time
when Travis failed health?

1085
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:14,615
That one semester, and papa
goes down to the school

1086
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,496
and he says, you can't fail my son!

1087
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,133
You can't fail my son, he's healthy!

1088
00:57:18,157 --> 00:57:20,308
He's never been sick a day in his life!

1089
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:21,771
- [Rachel] Yeah.

1090
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,025
- [Linette] Do you think we
should be laughing like this

1091
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:24,627
with him laying in there?

1092
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:26,166
- Oh please.

1093
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:30,083
- Travis, you didn't happen
to see Jenny downtown

1094
00:57:30,107 --> 00:57:31,186
did you?

1095
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,832
- No I was hanging out with
Scooter doing some catching up.

1096
00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:34,611
Why?

1097
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:35,906
- She's usually home by now.

1098
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:48,456
- Well please let me know
if you hear from her Lupe.

1099
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:54,841
And could you call Jeff, okay then thanks.

1100
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:03,554
She wasn't at practice.

1101
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:06,582
Lupe thinks she went some
place with her friend Jeff.

1102
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:08,894
- I'm gonna call the sheriff.

1103
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:09,849
- No, no.

1104
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:12,344
Travis, lets go look for her.

1105
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:13,703
- Well that's a good idea.

1106
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,502
Why don't you two go along and I will keep

1107
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,024
the supper warm.

1108
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:18,184
- Well I'll go with you.

1109
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,090
- No, no, no.

1110
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:21,023
Rach let me and Eldon do it.

1111
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:25,133
- Oh.

1112
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,174
- She come home yet?

1113
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:40,020
- [Ada] No.

1114
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:42,133
Boys went looking for her.

1115
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:44,153
- She run off because of me Ada.

1116
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:47,217
- Now don't out that on yourself too.

1117
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:49,052
- I heard them laughing out there.

1118
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:50,689
They're all gonna be happy when I'm gone.

1119
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:52,233
- They were just having fun.

1120
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:55,003
They were remembering
when they was growing up.

1121
00:59:06,432 --> 00:59:08,694
There is no one of them
that wouldn't do anything

1122
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:11,070
they could to make you well.

1123
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,090
- Eldon says I have to forgive myself.

1124
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:20,341
- [Ada] Well Eldon's pretty
smart about such things.

1125
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:22,907
- What goods a preacher
that tells you what to do

1126
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:25,345
but don't tell you how to do it.

1127
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:27,140
(phone rings)

1128
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:30,222
Boil them duds Ada honey.

1129
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:32,043
You cold?

1130
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:34,946
- Oh I was just a little chilly so.

1131
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,262
- [Linette] Mama, telephone.

1132
00:59:40,112 --> 00:59:41,006
- Hello?

1133
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,743
- [Anne Marie] Hi mama, don't
worry Jenny's here with me.

1134
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,589
- Oh thank goodness.

1135
00:59:46,613 --> 00:59:48,007
- [Voiceover] She just
popped in at the station

1136
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:48,866
and surprised me.

1137
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,861
She got a ride from one of her friends.

1138
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:53,132
- Oh I guess I should have known.

1139
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:58,140
She's been talking about
nothing but you helping papa.

1140
00:59:58,164 --> 00:59:59,580
- [Voiceover] How are you doing?

1141
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:04,200
- Well to tell you the
truth, I'm worried about him.

1142
01:00:04,224 --> 01:00:05,477
- [Voiceover] Really?

1143
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:09,262
Well I'm gonna put Jenny on
the early train tomorrow.

1144
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:11,440
- Why don't you come with her?

1145
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,799
Maybe she's right, maybe you can help.

1146
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:16,379
- [Anne Marie] Oh having me
there would probably sink

1147
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:17,732
him completely.

1148
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:22,904
- Well won't you think
about it Anne Marie?

1149
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:25,005
- No I think I've been
through all this with Jenny.

1150
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:26,851
I got my show in the morning.

1151
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,125
But I love you mama.

1152
01:00:29,011 --> 01:00:30,903
- I love you too.

1153
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,396
Bye.

1154
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,898
- Is she coming?

1155
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:42,321
(slow music)

1156
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,764
- [Jenny] I'm so going to
live like this one day.

1157
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:54,581
But maybe in San Francisco or LA.

1158
01:00:56,246 --> 01:00:57,703
- One of the ambitious Purdy's.

1159
01:00:59,566 --> 01:01:00,982
- Well I'm definitely going
to get out of there like

1160
01:01:01,006 --> 01:01:02,259
you did.

1161
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,081
- Well you'll do it a lot
better way than I did.

1162
01:01:04,105 --> 01:01:06,015
If I have anything to say about it.

1163
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:10,002
- Was it hard, with Jurvis I mean.

1164
01:01:10,026 --> 01:01:11,936
- There are easier ways to grow up.

1165
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:17,188
- What is that?

1166
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,495
- It's sushi.

1167
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,141
- Okay.

1168
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,943
Mmm.

1169
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:33,251
It's good.

1170
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:43,095
So Anne Marie, why don't you come home?

1171
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,891
I mean, are you really
still that mad at papa?

1172
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:50,455
- Well I think I'm over that.

1173
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:56,206
I'm not really sure how he would react.

1174
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,774
- Well I think that you
should know even though papa

1175
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,885
doesn't let us to listen
to your show in the house,

1176
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:03,148
mostly all of us do anyway.

1177
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:05,029
And I know that you can
change things I mean

1178
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:06,364
I listen to you on your show.

1179
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:08,070
If you came home, I
hear you helping people

1180
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:09,754
every single day on your show.

1181
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:11,693
- You know that that's not my own family.

1182
01:02:11,717 --> 01:02:13,382
- Yeah but if you just talk to him.

1183
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,534
I know I don't really know
what went on between you guys

1184
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:19,501
but I really do believe
that he respects you.

1185
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:22,902
- That doesn't mean that he
wants me to come back home.

1186
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,605
- So you're not even gonna try.

1187
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,985
- You really love him a lot don't you?

1188
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,564
- I don't even know anymore.

1189
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:34,811
I mean he won't listen to
a thing any of us have to

1190
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,180
tell him.

1191
01:02:36,204 --> 01:02:37,898
Not that he really ever has anyway.

1192
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:41,057
But like I've never seen him
do anything like this before.

1193
01:02:41,081 --> 01:02:42,828
I mean he will not get out of bed.

1194
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:47,925
And it's not like I really
do want him to die either.

1195
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:51,749
- He's not going to die.

1196
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:53,670
- You don't know that
you haven't seen him.

1197
01:02:55,742 --> 01:02:59,383
(slow music)

1198
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:17,254
- You want this or should
I pack it up for the worms?

1199
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:18,886
- I won't tell the worms if you don't.

1200
01:03:23,652 --> 01:03:25,166
Thank you mama.

1201
01:03:27,715 --> 01:03:29,593
- Mama.

1202
01:03:29,617 --> 01:03:31,347
- Anne Marie.

1203
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:33,019
Oh you came.

1204
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:36,281
- Oh how are you?

1205
01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:37,802
- Oh well I'm a little tired.

1206
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:38,568
- Yeah?

1207
01:03:38,592 --> 01:03:41,248
- And I can't sleep any
place but my own bed.

1208
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:43,339
Well at least it used to be my own bed.

1209
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:46,043
- Are you wearing all of your clothes?

1210
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:48,482
- Well yes I am.

1211
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:50,079
It's s long story.

1212
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:56,935
- Well you look gorgeous
no matter what you got on.

1213
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,791
- Guys come inside it's freezing.

1214
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:01,944
- Oh my gosh look at you here.

1215
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:10,469
- Hey mama, Jenny said you
haven't called the doctor yet,

1216
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:11,735
how come?

1217
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:14,358
- Oh well I tried but you know your pa.

1218
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:17,249
Why should I spend good
money for some doctor

1219
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:19,531
to tell me what I already know.

1220
01:04:20,397 --> 01:04:21,776
- Hey stranger.

1221
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,091
- Hi Mr. Ponytail.

1222
01:04:25,956 --> 01:04:28,114
- [Flagg] Ada, is that Jenny?

1223
01:04:28,138 --> 01:04:29,644
- She'll be right in.

1224
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,908
- Okay.

1225
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:35,707
I might as well,

1226
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,445
get it over with.

1227
01:04:39,272 --> 01:04:40,545
Thank you.

1228
01:04:42,314 --> 01:04:43,562
Okay.

1229
01:04:58,496 --> 01:05:00,225
- Nobody told me you were coming.

1230
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:05,249
- Well I didn't know I was
myself until this morning.

1231
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:07,089
- And why'd you run off
why'd you do a fool thing

1232
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:07,915
like that?

1233
01:05:07,939 --> 01:05:09,492
- I can visit my sister if I want to.

1234
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:11,593
- Not without telling us so.

1235
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,079
- Well there wasn't time.

1236
01:05:13,103 --> 01:05:15,679
- You scared me and mama half to death.

1237
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,396
Don't run off when I'm talking to you!

1238
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,841
(coughing)

1239
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,396
- She's glad to see you too.

1240
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,765
Well I'm happy to see her but
she shouldn't have done that.

1241
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:30,156
She shouldn't have run off
without telling anybody.

1242
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,816
- Well maybe you could get
her a pager so you could

1243
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,174
keep track of her.

1244
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:35,276
- Yeah that's all we need,
teenagers with pagers.

1245
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,422
As if those cellular
phones wasn't bad enough.

1246
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:39,560
- [Anne Marie] Hey that's
a good idea you could get

1247
01:05:39,584 --> 01:05:41,765
her one as a Christmas gift.

1248
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:43,878
Or you could just you know
hire a private detective

1249
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,615
to keep track of her.

1250
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,835
- Well you haven't changed a bit have you?

1251
01:05:48,859 --> 01:05:50,868
Still as contrary as ever.

1252
01:05:50,892 --> 01:05:52,387
- The fact that I'm here
should tell you that I have

1253
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:54,790
changed quite a lot.

1254
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:57,450
- Well it took my dying
to get you here didn't it?

1255
01:05:57,474 --> 01:05:58,779
- Yes.

1256
01:06:02,651 --> 01:06:05,002
- I was right about Jurvis wasn't I?

1257
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:08,652
- I don't know how I've
been able to live my life

1258
01:06:08,676 --> 01:06:10,098
without your advice.

1259
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,273
- Yeah.

1260
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:14,585
- He has a lot of problems
but he's a good man.

1261
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:19,448
We were just, too young
to get married and I was

1262
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:22,733
too anxious to get away from here.

1263
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:25,472
- Well there's a lot more
to be said on that subject

1264
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:27,492
isn't there?

1265
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,382
- Great to see you too papa.

1266
01:06:34,935 --> 01:06:36,803
- He gets me so mad.

1267
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,986
- You have to learn to stand up for him.

1268
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,491
You know instead of
running away like I did.

1269
01:06:42,515 --> 01:06:43,689
That's something that
would help you and help

1270
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:45,836
everybody else around here too.

1271
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,385
- Ada, I'd like my hot water bottle.

1272
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:55,797
- You know slavery was
abolished in 1863 mama.

1273
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:58,090
- [Travis] Jenny's right mama.

1274
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:01,519
- Maybe should I ignore
him, see if that makes him

1275
01:07:01,543 --> 01:07:02,959
feel better.

1276
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,560
- Well that's not what she means mama.

1277
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,231
- Well, I know what she means.

1278
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:10,119
You just ain't used to seeing
him sick like this Jen.

1279
01:07:12,557 --> 01:07:16,068
And till we can figure out a
better way I'm gonna be a slave

1280
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:19,424
or whatever else it takes
to show him I love him.

1281
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:21,478
- Well while you're showing
him that you love him

1282
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:23,219
could you just take
off some of the clothes

1283
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:26,123
'cause I feel really, really
hot just looking at you.

1284
01:07:26,147 --> 01:07:28,695
(laughing)

1285
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:31,245
- Well where am I gonna put 'em?

1286
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:33,544
- Well you can put everything in my car.

1287
01:07:33,568 --> 01:07:34,925
(knocking)

1288
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,361
- Come in.

1289
01:07:38,328 --> 01:07:40,776
- Andrea, Sarah!

1290
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,338
Hi!

1291
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:44,202
- Ada.

1292
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,942
What's all that ruckus out there?

1293
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:48,078
- It's Anne Marie's friends
and they're here to see her

1294
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:49,258
not you.

1295
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:55,399
- Has everybody in this family gone crazy?

1296
01:07:58,249 --> 01:07:59,629
- [Anne Marie] Well I'm not
exactly sure why you all

1297
01:07:59,653 --> 01:08:01,312
asked me here because I
don't think there's anything

1298
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:03,089
wrong with him really.

1299
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:06,549
- That's about the only thing
I've ever agreed with you on.

1300
01:08:06,573 --> 01:08:07,629
- Rach, Rach, Rachel.

1301
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:09,237
Rach you would have died.

1302
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:11,888
- Jenny gave it to him head on.

1303
01:08:11,912 --> 01:08:13,445
They're Anne Marie's friends
they're here to see her

1304
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:14,624
not you!

1305
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:16,444
(chuckle)

1306
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:17,558
- Who told you to do that?

1307
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:18,419
- Nobody told me.

1308
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:19,925
- You sure Anne Marie
didn't tell you to do it.

1309
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:20,947
- [Jenny] Yeah I'm sure.

1310
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,038
- She did exactly the right thing.

1311
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:23,617
I mean she stood up to him
instead of walking away

1312
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,080
into your own eggshells.

1313
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:26,708
- What makes you the expert?

1314
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:29,285
- If he gets all riled up
he'll just get out of this

1315
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:32,187
funk, this (mumbles).

1316
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:33,766
- Can't I just put Rachel
in there with him for five

1317
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:34,532
minutes.

1318
01:08:34,556 --> 01:08:35,831
- Wait can I say something.

1319
01:08:35,855 --> 01:08:38,049
You know that new age
psycho babble may work

1320
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:39,442
on your radio show.

1321
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:41,405
But it's not gonna do diddly swat for him.

1322
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:43,123
- You know can we just now get into...

1323
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:44,608
- He's dying.

1324
01:08:44,632 --> 01:08:45,585
He's dying.

1325
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:46,721
Let him go in peace.

1326
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:48,091
- Oh my god.

1327
01:08:48,115 --> 01:08:48,824
Travis.

1328
01:08:48,848 --> 01:08:50,146
Don't even say that.

1329
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,126
- [Jenny] He's not dying.

1330
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:56,252
- He's just depressed.

1331
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:57,971
- Are there any more cookies?

1332
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:59,515
- You could have the rest of this one.

1333
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:02,347
- No these aren't right
for you blood type.

1334
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,763
- Oh well thank god the cookies are right

1335
01:09:03,787 --> 01:09:05,272
for my blood type.

1336
01:09:05,296 --> 01:09:06,561
- You know stirring up his anger might not

1337
01:09:06,585 --> 01:09:08,222
be a bad idea.

1338
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:11,370
- When he does get angry
he does get moving.

1339
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,297
- Gus.

1340
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:15,050
- What's that sweetheart?

1341
01:09:15,074 --> 01:09:16,408
- If you wanna get him mad.

1342
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:19,549
I mean god forbid anybody
mentions the G word around here.

1343
01:09:30,317 --> 01:09:32,196
- Oh wow.

1344
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,553
- God how beautiful it is
out here when it snows.

1345
01:09:35,577 --> 01:09:37,242
- Okay come on, lets keep moving.

1346
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:52,916
- Papa.

1347
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:56,946
- Hello dear.

1348
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,224
- [Linette] Here you go.

1349
01:09:58,248 --> 01:09:59,003
- Thank you.

1350
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,414
- [Linette] You're welcome.

1351
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:09,364
Can I get you anything else?

1352
01:10:10,391 --> 01:10:12,225
- No I'm fine.

1353
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,606
Where's ma?

1354
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,040
- She went for a walk with
Rachel and Anne Marie.

1355
01:10:19,807 --> 01:10:22,069
- Can I maybe get you
some tea or something?

1356
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,382
- I won't have it.

1357
01:10:23,406 --> 01:10:24,537
- No.

1358
01:10:26,725 --> 01:10:27,943
- You're the only one of
my children that cares

1359
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:29,603
whether I live or die.

1360
01:10:29,627 --> 01:10:31,786
- Or no that is not true papa.

1361
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,027
It's just not.

1362
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,254
We all care.

1363
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:36,406
- Well I feel it from you.

1364
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,271
I don't feel it from nobody else.

1365
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,545
Things are gonna better for you Linette.

1366
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:45,016
I know they will.

1367
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:49,114
- I know.

1368
01:10:50,048 --> 01:10:51,539
I always have hope.

1369
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,755
- Okay.

1370
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:06,659
You didn't have to prove anything to us.

1371
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,075
We can see what great shape you're in.

1372
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,477
- I don't have to prove anything to you.

1373
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,028
- Are you still mad about Jurvis?

1374
01:11:15,006 --> 01:11:18,117
- I could of had Jurivs
anytime I wanted him.

1375
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,998
- There was nothing
going on between you two

1376
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,378
so why are you making such
a big deal out of it still?

1377
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:23,934
- Who told you there was nothing going on?

1378
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,612
- He told me, he only took you out once.

1379
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,732
- Yeah.

1380
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,695
It's just that you were too
afraid to tell me that you

1381
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,239
were gonna go out with him, it was easier

1382
01:11:36,263 --> 01:11:37,180
for you to run away.

1383
01:11:37,204 --> 01:11:39,478
Just like it's easier for you
to deal with everybody elses

1384
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:41,916
problems instead of dealing with your own.

1385
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,716
- Okay so this is not about
Jurvis, this is about how

1386
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,201
I live my life.

1387
01:11:45,225 --> 01:11:47,652
- Look, if you think I'm jealous
of you, you can forget it

1388
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:50,553
because I have been in the
million dollar sales club

1389
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:52,011
for three years.

1390
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:57,351
- Rachel.

1391
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,293
I'm sorry.

1392
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:04,247
I'm sorry that I ran away and
I didn't tell you about him.

1393
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:09,193
I thought if I came home I
could maybe clear things up.

1394
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:13,592
But...

1395
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:42,626
- Well it wasn't really a date.

1396
01:12:45,232 --> 01:12:48,693
We just parked behind the
high school and made out.

1397
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:50,455
(laughing)

1398
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:51,623
- Oh.

1399
01:12:54,531 --> 01:12:56,650
Guess what I heard about Jurvis?

1400
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:08,951
- Remember how I ate these?

1401
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:09,858
No more.

1402
01:13:09,882 --> 01:13:11,958
- You loved them.

1403
01:13:11,982 --> 01:13:13,270
- Very bad area.

1404
01:13:13,294 --> 01:13:15,011
- Hey Jackson you want one of those?

1405
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:16,493
How about this one?

1406
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,598
No?

1407
01:13:18,622 --> 01:13:19,852
Okay.

1408
01:13:19,876 --> 01:13:21,206
Okay get grape.

1409
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,516
Hi Rachel it's good to see you.

1410
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,549
- Gus.

1411
01:13:27,573 --> 01:13:29,534
- Yeah.

1412
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:31,171
Anne Marie.

1413
01:13:31,195 --> 01:13:31,997
- Hi.

1414
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:34,131
- Hi Anne Marie I really
enjoy your show I listen

1415
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:35,315
to it.

1416
01:13:35,339 --> 01:13:37,475
- Oh thanks, it's good to see you.

1417
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:39,517
- You too, Anne Marie yeah.

1418
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:43,175
Ada, I've been thinking a
lot about this whole thing

1419
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,003
and what I did troubles
me it just isn't right.

1420
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,068
I'd be glad to sell your eggs again.

1421
01:13:50,141 --> 01:13:51,726
- Well thank you Gus.

1422
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,511
I'll think on it.

1423
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:02,952
- How's Flagg?

1424
01:14:03,863 --> 01:14:05,290
- No better.

1425
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:07,554
- I'd come over and pay my
respects if i didn't think

1426
01:14:07,578 --> 01:14:09,128
it would make things worse.

1427
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:13,214
- Now isn't that an interesting idea.

1428
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,425
(chuckles)

1429
01:14:22,507 --> 01:14:24,197
I walked right into that one.

1430
01:14:26,245 --> 01:14:28,299
- Mama, I thought you'd
be happy that Gus would

1431
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:29,762
sell your eggs again.

1432
01:14:29,786 --> 01:14:31,643
You sure could use the money.

1433
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:35,462
- Well I've been doing some
figuring and I made more money

1434
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:40,159
last week than I do in a
month selling through Gus.

1435
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:43,739
I don't think I need a middle man anymore.

1436
01:14:43,763 --> 01:14:45,899
- Oh you fox.

1437
01:14:45,923 --> 01:14:47,694
(chuckles)

1438
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:53,882
- [Linette] What are you doing mama?

1439
01:14:57,856 --> 01:14:59,418
What's going on?

1440
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,485
(sighs)

1441
01:15:10,254 --> 01:15:11,333
- Hi Linette.

1442
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:12,413
- Hi Gus.

1443
01:15:12,437 --> 01:15:13,744
- He's in the bedroom.

1444
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:16,983
- Is he sleeping?

1445
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:19,560
- I don't know.

1446
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:30,442
- What's he doing here?

1447
01:15:30,466 --> 01:15:31,679
- It's a long story.

1448
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:40,722
(slow music)

1449
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,803
Never even played checkers this long.

1450
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:21,040
- Travis, Eldon, it's good to see you.

1451
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:26,311
(chuckles)

1452
01:16:27,443 --> 01:16:30,321
Nice fence Flagg put up by the pump house.

1453
01:16:30,345 --> 01:16:32,069
Could use some paint though.

1454
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:38,517
Sure is a nice day.

1455
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:39,952
I'll see you tomorrow.

1456
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:04,161
- What?

1457
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:05,623
- Yeah that's what we'd like to know.

1458
01:17:05,647 --> 01:17:07,122
- Yeah what's Gus so happy about?

1459
01:17:07,146 --> 01:17:08,956
- We came to an understanding.

1460
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,941
- What kind of understanding?

1461
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:12,717
- I gave him back the rights.

1462
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,958
His lawyers drawing up the papers.

1463
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:16,455
- Lord mercy.

1464
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:18,359
- After all that time
and money you're just...

1465
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,182
- What are you getting so upset about?

1466
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:21,841
It's a good deal.

1467
01:17:21,865 --> 01:17:23,421
He's gonna drill us a new well.

1468
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:24,895
- I don't believe this.

1469
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:27,344
- Yeah I should have never gone
to court in the first place.

1470
01:17:27,368 --> 01:17:29,620
We just put things back the way they were.

1471
01:17:29,644 --> 01:17:31,895
- You're missing the point Flagg.

1472
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:33,579
Those rights belong to both of us.

1473
01:17:33,603 --> 01:17:35,680
Well I'm sorry I can't do anything right.

1474
01:17:35,704 --> 01:17:37,939
But you won't have to put
up with it much longer.

1475
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:44,913
- Poor papa.

1476
01:17:47,298 --> 01:17:49,375
Must be hard to be rejected by everybody.

1477
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,814
- Well it is.

1478
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,637
- And it must feel terrible
to feel like you're dying

1479
01:17:52,661 --> 01:17:53,995
and no one understands you.

1480
01:17:54,019 --> 01:17:55,341
I know what you're doing.

1481
01:17:55,365 --> 01:17:56,479
- Even though you've been a good husband

1482
01:17:56,503 --> 01:17:57,293
and a good father.

1483
01:17:57,317 --> 01:17:58,453
- I'm not gonna fall for it.

1484
01:17:58,477 --> 01:18:00,670
- And we all see that the
husband and the father that

1485
01:18:00,694 --> 01:18:02,633
took care of all of us
and had to support us all.

1486
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:03,874
- That was hard.

1487
01:18:03,898 --> 01:18:04,617
- I know that.

1488
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:05,568
The rest of the family knows that.

1489
01:18:05,592 --> 01:18:07,911
We love, we support you,
we understand that you've

1490
01:18:07,935 --> 01:18:09,409
been a good husband even though at times

1491
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:12,985
you've been difficult to
live with but we love you.

1492
01:18:13,009 --> 01:18:16,102
- I don't need to hear no
radio program psychology lady.

1493
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:19,428
- Do you know that we all love you papa?

1494
01:18:19,452 --> 01:18:20,449
- No.

1495
01:18:20,473 --> 01:18:21,948
- We wouldn't all be here
if we didn't love you.

1496
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:23,723
That's why we're all here.

1497
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:26,463
We're here 'cause we love
you and we worry about you.

1498
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:27,890
- I don't wanna talk about it right now.

1499
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:29,191
- Why don't you just
get up out of that bed.

1500
01:18:29,215 --> 01:18:30,711
- I'm not getting out of the bed.

1501
01:18:30,735 --> 01:18:31,350
- Come on.

1502
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,227
- I'm dying.

1503
01:18:32,251 --> 01:18:33,874
- But daddy what I'm trying
to say is you can get

1504
01:18:33,898 --> 01:18:34,851
out of the bed...

1505
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,470
- I'm dying.

1506
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:44,132
- All right lets go.

1507
01:18:50,454 --> 01:18:53,965
(slow music)

1508
01:19:07,211 --> 01:19:08,899
- So, what do we do now?

1509
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:11,477
- Well I don't rightly know.

1510
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:16,004
I'm afraid your pa'll just
up and die out of pure

1511
01:19:16,028 --> 01:19:17,954
stubbornness.

1512
01:19:17,978 --> 01:19:20,125
- What will you do then mama?

1513
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:22,645
- Since you're all grown,
the only thing I've known

1514
01:19:22,669 --> 01:19:25,878
is taking care of him and Jenny.

1515
01:19:28,507 --> 01:19:29,988
And my chickens.

1516
01:19:32,443 --> 01:19:34,307
It's pretty sad ain't it?

1517
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,673
Well,

1518
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:41,969
he'll be wanting his hot
water bottle about now.

1519
01:19:49,346 --> 01:19:50,692
- Papa's not the only
one who needs to get out

1520
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:51,837
of the house.

1521
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:56,357
- Mommy.

1522
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:57,761
- What's that?

1523
01:19:57,785 --> 01:19:58,993
- Hey mama.

1524
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:00,292
Excuse me I'll take this.

1525
01:20:00,316 --> 01:20:01,245
- Now what are you doing?

1526
01:20:01,269 --> 01:20:02,602
- Thank you very much.

1527
01:20:02,626 --> 01:20:05,755
- Now will you tell me
what this is all about?

1528
01:20:06,922 --> 01:20:08,379
- Okay shh.

1529
01:20:14,108 --> 01:20:16,208
- Okay Linette.

1530
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,399
Linette.

1531
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:20,167
- Tada.

1532
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,281
- Whoa.

1533
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:22,825
- Beautiful mama.

1534
01:20:22,849 --> 01:20:25,061
- Mama where are the gingerbread cookies?

1535
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:27,864
- Mamacita.

1536
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:29,531
- What's going on?

1537
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:35,560
- [Anne Marie] Oh not bad
for such short notice Travis.

1538
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,997
Mama, this gentleman insists on taking you

1539
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:40,698
out for a date this evening.

1540
01:20:45,347 --> 01:20:48,261
- My mama taught me
never to go out on a date

1541
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:51,662
unless I know exactly where I'm going.

1542
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:54,181
- I know your date and
I know what he's driving

1543
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,981
and I strongly recommend
that you take some

1544
01:20:56,005 --> 01:20:57,253
tab money.

1545
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,835
- We're going dancing mama.

1546
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:00,991
Come on,

1547
01:21:02,598 --> 01:21:04,915
- Dude green means go, red means stop.

1548
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:08,084
- [Flagg] Ada, where you going?

1549
01:21:08,937 --> 01:21:10,604
What's going on?

1550
01:21:10,628 --> 01:21:11,671
- This is brilliant.

1551
01:21:11,695 --> 01:21:13,146
- Oh thank you but I wish
you didn't have to be high

1552
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,388
to tell me.

1553
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:16,136
- Grass is very natural.

1554
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,707
- What's going on?

1555
01:21:18,731 --> 01:21:19,956
Where you going?

1556
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:25,319
- [Travis] Mama I haven't had
such a serious date in years.

1557
01:21:26,892 --> 01:21:28,454
- [Ada] Thank you for doing this.

1558
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:31,217
And for coming to see your pa.

1559
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,061
I know it wasn't easy for you.

1560
01:21:35,564 --> 01:21:37,114
- I'm glad I came mama.

1561
01:21:39,046 --> 01:21:42,923
- [Ada] Travis, would
you mind taking a little

1562
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:44,173
side trip.

1563
01:22:31,926 --> 01:22:34,560
Well it's been so long since
I did anything like this,

1564
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:36,295
I don't know how to act.

1565
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:37,479
- Just act natural.

1566
01:22:37,503 --> 01:22:39,170
Everybody will handle the rest.

1567
01:22:43,947 --> 01:22:47,517
(country music)

1568
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:54,586
â™« Well come with the
boys down to the station

1569
01:22:55,915 --> 01:22:58,545
â™« Did need farewell as I go

1570
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:03,890
â™« Don't you shed a tear as
the train rolls down the line

1571
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,869
â™« I'm on my way to
glory don't you know â™«

1572
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,990
- Why Ada, it is so good to see you.

1573
01:23:19,075 --> 01:23:20,015
Hello Travis.

1574
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:21,814
- Hello Mrs. Cooper.

1575
01:23:21,838 --> 01:23:23,509
- What's going on with Flagg?

1576
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,385
- Well it's hard to tell.

1577
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,229
But this is my date tonight.

1578
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:30,834
- Where's your ma?

1579
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:32,413
- She went out for a while.

1580
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:33,632
- She went out?

1581
01:23:33,656 --> 01:23:37,068
- Yeah she, went out with Travis.

1582
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:37,857
(grunts)

1583
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:38,834
- Went out with Travis?

1584
01:23:38,858 --> 01:23:39,912
Where'd they go?

1585
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:43,209
- There's a dance tonight at The Grange.

1586
01:23:43,233 --> 01:23:45,473
- A dance at The Grange, she
went to a dance at The Grange?

1587
01:23:45,497 --> 01:23:47,574
What she do a damn foolish
thing like that for?

1588
01:23:47,598 --> 01:23:49,548
- Why, 'cause she felt like
she'd been cooped up here

1589
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:50,836
much lately.

1590
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,648
- Well it was good enough for
her to be cooped up before

1591
01:23:52,672 --> 01:23:54,210
I was dying.

1592
01:23:55,272 --> 01:23:58,192
- Yeah but, all that's
changing now isn't it?

1593
01:24:00,317 --> 01:24:01,767
- I suppose she'll be doing
a lot of that kind of thing

1594
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,148
then huh.

1595
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:04,647
Dancing carried on.

1596
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:08,246
- Yeah I see all the
time in my line of work.

1597
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:10,701
How quickly widows become free spirits.

1598
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:18,229
- You don't suppose she's
found somebody else already

1599
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,407
do you?

1600
01:24:21,736 --> 01:24:24,311
- Well she is a mighty fine looking woman.

1601
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:25,949
- Yes.

1602
01:24:25,973 --> 01:24:28,386
Yes, that's a problem isn't it?

1603
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,984
That is the problem.

1604
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:36,126
Â™« I'm on my way to
glory don't you know â™«

1605
01:24:43,282 --> 01:24:46,225
(applause)

1606
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:50,896
- Can I have the first dance?

1607
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,865
- You'll have to wait your turn Foster.

1608
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:02,723
(slow country music)

1609
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:09,727
â™« Since I walked down that road

1610
01:25:09,751 --> 01:25:12,379
â™« And I still don't know why

1611
01:25:15,846 --> 01:25:18,863
â™« I was a young man

1612
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,215
â™« I didn't know â™«

1613
01:25:23,947 --> 01:25:26,822
- We're not careful we'll be
an item in tomorrow's paper.

1614
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:34,417
This brings back a lot of memories.

1615
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:36,060
The school dances.

1616
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,415
Hayrides.

1617
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:42,357
And hikes to the falls.

1618
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:45,642
I know, I know, I know.

1619
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,416
It's not right to...

1620
01:25:48,905 --> 01:25:51,075
To pry on you in those days.

1621
01:25:51,099 --> 01:25:55,575
But it really struck me
when you came without Flagg.

1622
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:58,558
- Felt strange to me too.

1623
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:05,599
- Well, whatever happens
you won't ever have to worry

1624
01:26:05,623 --> 01:26:07,290
about anything.

1625
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:12,320
I'll always look after you.

1626
01:26:12,344 --> 01:26:16,171
- I don't need anybody to
look after me Gus Falk.

1627
01:26:17,864 --> 01:26:20,580
Now if you really cared about
me you would do something

1628
01:26:20,604 --> 01:26:22,188
to support Flagg.

1629
01:26:23,088 --> 01:26:25,966
- You think this is
about him being jealous?

1630
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:30,145
- He's always believed that
there's still something

1631
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:31,847
between you and me.

1632
01:26:36,972 --> 01:26:39,886
- I sure would not mention
that we were dancing

1633
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,847
together tonight.

1634
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:43,968
(chuckles)

1635
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:50,956
(humming)

1636
01:27:20,843 --> 01:27:22,614
- Flagg.

1637
01:27:23,548 --> 01:27:25,120
Flagg?

1638
01:27:27,844 --> 01:27:29,660
You want some tea?

1639
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:33,277
- How was the dance?

1640
01:27:33,301 --> 01:27:35,295
- Fine.

1641
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:38,255
Gwen and Foster said to say hello.

1642
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:39,864
And Gus.

1643
01:27:42,412 --> 01:27:44,548
We even danced.

1644
01:27:44,572 --> 01:27:46,126
One dance.

1645
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,716
- He couldn't wait till I
was gone before he started

1646
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,918
to pounce.

1647
01:27:48,942 --> 01:27:51,693
- Now don't get yourself
all worked up over nothing.

1648
01:27:51,717 --> 01:27:53,179
- You never even thought
about dancing until

1649
01:27:53,203 --> 01:27:54,514
Anne Marie got here.

1650
01:27:54,538 --> 01:27:56,371
- I wasn't thinking about a lot of things.

1651
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:58,386
- Next thing she'll be
taking you to chippendales.

1652
01:27:59,832 --> 01:28:02,078
- Don't go blaming anything on Anne Marie.

1653
01:28:03,454 --> 01:28:05,426
She only come to make
amends with you and you

1654
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:08,057
didn't exactly welcome it.

1655
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,091
- I heard what she said.

1656
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:13,808
- She wants you to accept
her no matter what mistakes

1657
01:28:13,832 --> 01:28:15,607
she made.

1658
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:18,985
That's all any of our
kids ever wanted from you.

1659
01:28:19,009 --> 01:28:21,272
- Kids should know how I
feel about them by now.

1660
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,728
- Sometimes it's hard to tell for sure.

1661
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,024
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1662
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:32,452
- Ada?

1663
01:28:32,476 --> 01:28:34,200
I wanna show you something.

1664
01:28:42,413 --> 01:28:45,605
My pa wrote this to my mom
when they just got married.

1665
01:28:45,629 --> 01:28:47,225
He wrote it before I was born.

1666
01:28:55,856 --> 01:28:57,418
Read it out loud.

1667
01:29:00,896 --> 01:29:03,340
- Dear little wife of mine,

1668
01:29:04,192 --> 01:29:08,103
Here I am sitting in my
cold room thinking of what

1669
01:29:08,127 --> 01:29:11,059
I am missing at home.

1670
01:29:11,994 --> 01:29:14,844
- He was driving for a long
distance hauler at the time.

1671
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:22,486
- My beautiful little
wife has a world of plans

1672
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:27,195
that I'm doing everything
I can to help come true.

1673
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:33,271
When we were single I thought
I was in love with you.

1674
01:29:33,295 --> 01:29:38,295
But at that time I didn't
know what love was compared

1675
01:29:38,428 --> 01:29:41,056
to how much I love you now.

1676
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:47,260
The X's I put on the bottom
of this letter are kisses

1677
01:29:47,284 --> 01:29:49,385
for you.

1678
01:29:49,409 --> 01:29:52,654
Save all your love for
your lonesome husband.

1679
01:29:54,668 --> 01:29:56,879
So lonesome sweetheart.

1680
01:29:58,231 --> 01:30:00,750
Love Hugh

1681
01:30:00,774 --> 01:30:03,060
- I didn't know the man
that wrote that letter.

1682
01:30:03,084 --> 01:30:05,486
The man I knew couldn't write such things.

1683
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:08,919
- The man who wrote this
was filled with love.

1684
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:15,409
He might have been angry
and confused but he was

1685
01:30:15,889 --> 01:30:18,402
still a decent man and he loved you.

1686
01:30:19,244 --> 01:30:21,317
- I have a hard time believing that.

1687
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,198
- Well you keep trying.

1688
01:30:33,105 --> 01:30:36,738
(rooster cawing)

1689
01:30:36,762 --> 01:30:40,111
Papa's having trouble forgiving himself.

1690
01:30:41,324 --> 01:30:45,201
You think forgiving his
pa would do just as well?

1691
01:30:45,225 --> 01:30:47,557
- It's not really a
question of who he forgives,

1692
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:50,878
it's the forgiving that counts you know.

1693
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:52,363
Letting go of his anger.

1694
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:54,000
- The whole thing hinges on forgiveness.

1695
01:30:54,024 --> 01:30:58,981
Forgiveness is like a key
that opens a door in the heart

1696
01:30:59,005 --> 01:31:01,809
and when that door is
open then the lord can...

1697
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:06,643
Sorry.

1698
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:09,138
- No that's okay Eldon
you're absolutely right.

1699
01:31:09,162 --> 01:31:11,455
- Well I wanna hear from you Eldon.

1700
01:31:29,478 --> 01:31:31,198
- You know it's funny
how a little water can

1701
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:34,650
start something so complicated.

1702
01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:41,423
- What?

1703
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:42,730
Mama?

1704
01:31:44,686 --> 01:31:46,120
What is it?

1705
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:53,237
(slow music)

1706
01:31:57,049 --> 01:31:58,751
- I'll be right back.

1707
01:32:03,586 --> 01:32:04,643
- Ada.

1708
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,349
Ada what's going on?

1709
01:32:06,373 --> 01:32:07,703
What's going on?

1710
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:12,224
What the hell are you doing woman!

1711
01:32:12,248 --> 01:32:14,523
- I'm just seeing how
firm the mattress is.

1712
01:32:14,547 --> 01:32:15,869
- Ada.

1713
01:32:15,893 --> 01:32:17,199
Ada!

1714
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:19,886
Ada.

1715
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,510
Ada.

1716
01:32:21,534 --> 01:32:23,008
- [Edith] Don't waste your breath.

1717
01:32:23,032 --> 01:32:24,955
I think she went over to Gus's place.

1718
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:47,394
(sheep bleating)

1719
01:32:51,568 --> 01:32:53,072
(groans)

1720
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:56,663
- What are you doing?

1721
01:32:56,687 --> 01:32:59,066
- I just wanna see where
it'll best fit in my bedroom.

1722
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,639
- Well it don't fit no where
'cause it ain't going no where!

1723
01:33:10,223 --> 01:33:12,242
- That's what I get for trusting you!

1724
01:33:12,266 --> 01:33:14,401
This time they're gonna
throw you in the slammer!

1725
01:33:14,425 --> 01:33:15,899
- Now what's got into you?

1726
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:17,838
- You know damn well
what's gotten into me.

1727
01:33:17,862 --> 01:33:19,962
- See I thought we settled
this yesterday when you

1728
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:21,484
were on your death bed.

1729
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:23,422
- That was before you turned my water off!

1730
01:33:23,446 --> 01:33:25,546
- Turned your water off,
Andy have I been out of this

1731
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,847
store today?

1732
01:33:26,871 --> 01:33:28,850
- We've been putting up
stock all day Mr. Purdy.

1733
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:31,745
- Well then you hired somebody to do it!

1734
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:34,880
- Why would I do a fool
thing like that when you gave

1735
01:33:34,904 --> 01:33:36,697
the water rights back to me?

1736
01:33:45,908 --> 01:33:50,087
Andy why don't you go and
chop me some fire wood

1737
01:33:50,111 --> 01:33:51,441
will you?

1738
01:33:55,035 --> 01:33:56,248
Okay.

1739
01:33:57,172 --> 01:33:59,632
Doggonit Flagg.

1740
01:33:59,656 --> 01:34:01,683
You haven't learned a thing
from all this have you?

1741
01:34:03,777 --> 01:34:06,163
Now Ada and I were dancing last night.

1742
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:09,373
That's not what this is about is it?

1743
01:34:09,397 --> 01:34:11,229
- No.

1744
01:34:11,253 --> 01:34:14,649
- I respected Ada's decision
when she decided to marry you.

1745
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:18,027
And that has not changed.

1746
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,485
She loves you Flagg.

1747
01:34:25,636 --> 01:34:29,931
Now, you go home and I'm
sure you'll figure out

1748
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:31,847
what happened to your water.

1749
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:33,583
I'm sure it's the breaker.

1750
01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:45,464
- You're right.

1751
01:34:45,488 --> 01:34:47,960
- Sure I'm right I mean that breakers old.

1752
01:34:47,984 --> 01:34:51,136
- No I mean about me
not learning anything.

1753
01:34:57,433 --> 01:34:58,983
- I'm sorry.

1754
01:34:59,883 --> 01:35:01,206
I was wrong.

1755
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:02,762
You have learned something.

1756
01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:04,746
You apologized to me
yesterday for what you did

1757
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:07,342
and today just now you listened to me.

1758
01:35:08,242 --> 01:35:10,720
Pa you were hopping mad I
know how hard that is for you.

1759
01:35:13,211 --> 01:35:15,405
- Well it's hard for you too.

1760
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:17,059
- Yeah it's hard for me too.

1761
01:35:19,306 --> 01:35:20,937
I'll tell you what.

1762
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:24,784
I think maybe I've been
too set on beating you

1763
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:26,316
at whatever we do.

1764
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,297
- Well I'm glad to hear
you finally admit it.

1765
01:35:29,509 --> 01:35:32,673
- I will try to change that.

1766
01:35:33,782 --> 01:35:34,891
- Okay.

1767
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:38,280
I will too.

1768
01:35:41,165 --> 01:35:43,323
- So checkers tomorrow?

1769
01:35:43,347 --> 01:35:44,631
- Yeah.

1770
01:35:46,168 --> 01:35:47,416
Usual time.

1771
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,940
(slow music)

1772
01:36:44,922 --> 01:36:47,277
- [Travis] No Porter
grandpa's not dead yet.

1773
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:48,968
Porter give the phone back to mommy.

1774
01:36:51,074 --> 01:36:52,397
Okay sweetheart.

1775
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:53,477
I'll talk to you later.

1776
01:36:53,501 --> 01:36:54,924
Love you, bye.

1777
01:36:56,901 --> 01:36:58,770
Amy can't get here until tomorrow.

1778
01:36:58,794 --> 01:37:01,087
So its it okay if I stay here tonight?

1779
01:37:06,723 --> 01:37:08,452
- Hey, your welcome.

1780
01:37:08,476 --> 01:37:09,694
Guys.

1781
01:37:09,718 --> 01:37:12,383
Mama has something she
wants to tell everyone.

1782
01:37:13,979 --> 01:37:15,394
About your eggs.

1783
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:17,410
- Oh well.

1784
01:37:18,692 --> 01:37:22,471
I spoke to the manager at
the supermarket in town

1785
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:28,175
about not selling organic
eggs and so next week

1786
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:31,085
there will be Purdy Eggs in their cooler.

1787
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:34,422
- Hey way to go mama.

1788
01:37:34,446 --> 01:37:36,553
(applauding)

1789
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:39,479
- You guys, he's coming.

1790
01:37:43,294 --> 01:37:45,075
(sheep bleating)

1791
01:37:56,064 --> 01:37:57,966
- Glad you're up and about.

1792
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:00,148
- Well there's a lot of work to do.

1793
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:02,307
Not gonna have time for a lot of dancing.

1794
01:38:02,331 --> 01:38:05,721
- [Ada] Well dancing's exactly
what you need Flagg Purdy.

1795
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:06,546
- Yeah.

1796
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:08,704
- Everynight.

1797
01:38:08,728 --> 01:38:10,701
- What time's that show of yours on?

1798
01:38:10,725 --> 01:38:13,662
- 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.

1799
01:38:13,686 --> 01:38:15,154
AM610.

1800
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:17,527
- I'll try to watch it.

1801
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:19,605
- You done good papa.

1802
01:38:19,629 --> 01:38:20,801
- Thanks for your help Eldon.

1803
01:38:20,825 --> 01:38:22,020
- I did very little.

1804
01:38:22,044 --> 01:38:24,004
You did hard work, and
thank you for giving me

1805
01:38:24,028 --> 01:38:26,722
the inspiration for this weeks ceremony.

1806
01:38:26,746 --> 01:38:29,515
- Is the road to forgiveness
paved with gifts.

1807
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:32,185
- Send me a tape.

1808
01:38:34,477 --> 01:38:36,356
I'm gonna bring the outboard
over one of these days

1809
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,539
and we're gonna take the kids out fishing.

1810
01:38:38,563 --> 01:38:39,712
- Okay pop.

1811
01:38:39,736 --> 01:38:40,618
- [Flagg] Okay.

1812
01:38:40,642 --> 01:38:42,370
- Papa.

1813
01:38:42,394 --> 01:38:44,328
I'm really glad you're up.

1814
01:38:46,341 --> 01:38:48,124
- A lot of fuss over nothing.

1815
01:38:49,453 --> 01:38:50,104
- Papa.

1816
01:38:50,128 --> 01:38:50,928
- Yeah?

1817
01:38:50,952 --> 01:38:54,224
- There's a little gift on the
kitchen table from all of us.

1818
01:38:54,248 --> 01:38:55,659
- Oh okay.

1819
01:39:11,964 --> 01:39:15,175
(chuckles)

1820
01:39:17,468 --> 01:39:21,088
Well I don't know what I
learned from the whole thing.

1821
01:39:21,112 --> 01:39:24,316
What that checkers game or that
forgiving business had to do

1822
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:26,348
with it.

1823
01:39:26,372 --> 01:39:28,444
But it really doesn't matter much.

1824
01:39:29,378 --> 01:39:31,742
What does matter is we got through it.

1825
01:39:33,094 --> 01:39:36,291
And even with all our
differences, we're still a family.

1826
01:39:37,876 --> 01:39:40,533
You know it's not easy to
get your wife and children

1827
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:41,671
to change.

1828
01:39:41,695 --> 01:39:44,568
But laying in bed like
that sure seemed to help.

1829
01:39:46,675 --> 01:39:48,260
Maybe I learned that.

1830
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,783
(slow western music)
