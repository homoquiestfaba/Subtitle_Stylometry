1
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,019
You are safe.

2
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,459
It's okay, just breathe.

3
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,119
Just breathe.

4
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,009
Breathe.

5
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,289
Good.

6
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,209
That's good.

7
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,571
Hello Mia.

8
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,031
I'm Dr.. Ouelet.

9
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,171
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

10
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,951
What happened?

11
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,031
I was... You were drowning.

12
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,821
There was water.

13
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:26,311
That's right. You were on
a boat, a refugee boat.

14
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:28,851
It was sank by terrorists.

15
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,041
Why can't I feel my body?

16
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,351
Mira, your body was damaged.
We could not save that.

17
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,921
Only your brain survived.

18
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:40,521
We made you a new body.

19
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,801
A synthetic shell.

20
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,381
But your mind, your soul...

21
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,071
Your ghost.

22
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,051
It's still in there.

23
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,841
Please.

24
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,301
Sedate her.

25
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,901
Will it work?

26
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,021
Absolutely.

27
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,501
She's a miracle.

28
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,491
A machine can't lead, It
can only follow orders.

29
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,641
A machine can't imagine
or care or intuit.

30
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:29,271
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame...

31
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,001
Mira can do all those
things, and more.

32
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,141
The first of her kind.

33
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:39,361
She will join Section 9 as
soon as she is operational.

34
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:41,791
Please don't do that.

35
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,391
You reducing a complex
human to a machine.

36
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,891
I don't think of
her as a machine.

37
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,851
She is a weapon.

38
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,811
And the future of my company.

39
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:12,111
<i>ONE YEAR LATER</i>

40
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:18,481
<i>The first artificially
created memory enhancement.</i>

41
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,791
<i>Sirenum training protocol is the
fastest and most efficient way...</i>

42
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,051
<i>to develop your ability.</i>

43
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,021
<i>Stronger than ever.
Experience your power.</i>

44
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>Cybercrime is a Type 1 offense. Minimum
punishment: 15 years in prison.</i>

45
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:40,181
<i>Hanka Robotics guarantees
personal safety against.</i>

46
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:52,931
<i>All patrolling area units, be advised
possible cybercrime activity in vicinity.</i>

47
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,851
<i>Airspace in adjoining areas
will be locked down.</i>

48
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,381
<i>Section 9 is currently on site.</i>

49
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,441
<i>I repeat: All patrolling area units,
be advised, possible cyber crime...</i>

50
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,431
This is major. I'm on site.

51
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,551
Awaiting instructions.

52
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,271
<i>Analyze and report.</i>

53
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:25,751
I'm human, I am flawed.

54
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:28,901
But I embrace change...

55
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:31,181
and enhancement.

56
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,121
Now there is nothing I can't do.

57
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:38,081
Nothing I can't know,
nothing I can't be.

58
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,071
Wait and listen to something.

59
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,001
It's my 4 year old daughter.

60
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,721
In the time it took her
to sing that lullaby

61
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,231
she learned to speak
fluent French.

62
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,551
<i>Do you know that song...?</i>

63
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,841
There is an echo box up here.

64
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,881
Someone is scanning
data traffic.

65
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,441
<i>Keeps track of where
it is transmitted.</i>

66
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,721
To see who's worth this
kind of surveillance.

67
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:12,391
Accessing hotel
security network.

68
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,271
What're you seeing, sir? I've
got a lot of hotel to scan.

69
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:26,991
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for the
President of the African Federation.</i>

70
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,651
<i>Dr. Osmond is invited on
behalf of Hanka Robotics.</i>

71
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,281
Got it. 43rd floor.

72
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,681
Someone contacted the president staff.
Someone is watching him.

73
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,721
Dr. Osmond...

74
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,611
What is it you want from us?

75
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,821
I think it is more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

76
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:52,591
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

77
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,921
Do you really wanna
be left behind?

78
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,441
My people embrace cyber
enhancement as do I.

79
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,541
There is no one who really
understand the risk...

80
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:06,971
To individuality, identity,
messing with the human soul.

81
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,911
Gentlemen, Excuse me, I
think you've the wrong...

82
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,391
Hallway. Six men. Shots fired.

83
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:20,681
Section 9 ETA?

84
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,571
- Two minutes out, Major.
- Too long.

85
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,091
I'm going in.

86
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:25,591
<i>Hold!</i>

87
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:34,841
<i>Mayor, stop!</i>

88
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:41,811
I had heard this speech
before from your competitors.

89
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,541
And now Hanka Robotics
serves it with Milky suck.

90
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,641
Look. This is what
I'm talking about.

91
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,361
<i>Mayor!</i>

92
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,211
<i>Initiate.. The hack.</i>

93
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,481
<i>Help me. Please.
Don't let me die.</i>

94
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:43,851
Who sent you?

95
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:45,551
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

96
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,831
Answer me!

97
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,731
<i>Collaborates with Hanka
Robotics will be destroyed.</i>

98
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,941
You okay?

99
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,751
You're injured.

100
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,331
You're not the same.

101
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,701
Hey.

102
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:32,981
It's just a robot!

103
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:57,971
<i>Your skin deserves the best, so do you.
Try our hand cream.</i>

104
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:17,041
<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,
CENTRAL OFFICE, SECTION 9</i>

105
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,061
So what do we have on Osmond?

106
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:22,931
So far, very little.

107
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,491
He was the head of Hanka's
robotics division.

108
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,121
Human, but of course
cyber enhanced.

109
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:30,921
So how did they hack him?

110
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,791
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

111
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:35,571
Something is different.

112
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,061
What'd you get?

113
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,421
Why you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

114
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,251
Because he is.

115
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,121
A Cyber Mech liver.

116
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,051
Been saving up for a while.

117
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,811
Now it's lost cool every night.

118
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,311
You got enhanced so
you can drink more?

119
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:53,861
Embrace enhancements, Togusa. We
would not be here without it.

120
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,661
I am all human and
happy, thanks.

121
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,481
Any more information about
the seized geisha bot?

122
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,141
Hanka is running scans.

123
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,631
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

124
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,601
<i>I've been talking to
the Prime Minister.</i>

125
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,471
<i>He wants a full report.</i>

126
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,431
<i>Togusa.</i>

127
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,631
Following last night's attack...

128
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,801
3 more Hanka's scientists
were murdered...

129
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:26,871
in the company's
central laboratory.

130
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,801
The first two were shot...

131
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,641
and the third was beaten to
death by his own service robot.

132
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:37,731
All showed signs of
cerebral hacking.

133
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:40,521
The same as the
geisha did to Osmond.

134
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:45,041
And all were senior figures...
in Hanka.

135
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,721
Just like Osmond.

136
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:51,591
A message was left at each
of the crime scene...

137
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,491
By someone identifying
himself...

138
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,061
as <i>Kuze.</i>

139
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:01,491
<i>Collaborate with Hanka

140
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,981
<i>Collaborate with
Hanka Robotics...</i>

141
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,251
<i>should be destroyed.</i>

142
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:11,411
<i>Togusa.</i>

143
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:15,541
<i>You and Ladriya go speak to Mr.
Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.</i>

144
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:20,451
<i>Major and Batou take a
look at Dahlin report.</i>

145
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:24,901
<i>Find out what has been
recovered from the geisha.</i>

146
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,721
<i>Major!</i>

147
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,401
<i>I told you not jump off.</i>

148
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,291
I had to, or more
would have died.

149
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:51,981
<i>You are a member of my team,
and my responsibility</i>

150
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,911
I'll find him... and
I will kill him.

151
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:59,751
It's what I am built
for, isn't it?

152
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,601
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

153
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:12,481
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

154
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:17,661
<i>When we see our
uniqueness as a virtue...</i>

155
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,751
<i>Only then will we find peace.</i>

156
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:28,581
<i>Safely reconfiguring the
child's genetic Structure.</i>

157
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,201
<i>Families built better.</i>

158
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,691
What was going on with you
at the hotel last night?

159
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,151
Nothing. I'm fine.

160
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,571
Are you sure?

161
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,151
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

162
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,351
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

163
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,631
Hey, Ming!

164
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,751
Hey, Batou!

165
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,351
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

166
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,391
For the dogs.

167
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:59,371
For someone who doesn't like people
How come you care about dogs so much

168
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,241
I don't know. I like just
strays and they like me.

169
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:04,301
They like you Because
you feed them.

170
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,601
You got no heart.

171
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,501
Hey, girls!

172
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,421
Hey Gabriel!

173
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,861
Meet Major.

174
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,751
Major, Gabriel.

175
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,621
We used to have a dog.

176
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,111
Sure is that?

177
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,731
More of a cat person.

178
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,401
You don't talk about that stuff.

179
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:41,681
What?

180
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:44,651
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

181
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,621
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

182
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:49,991
What about family?

183
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,631
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

184
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,381
Our boat sank in the harbor.

185
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,621
I almost drowned.

186
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,801
I feel sinking...

187
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,291
there is always this thick
fog over my memory.

188
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:03,791
And I can't seen through it.

189
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,191
You are lucky.

190
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,111
Every single day I get
screwed upon my memory.

191
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,801
It's better to be pure.

192
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,721
Like you.

193
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:29,211
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

194
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:33,521

196
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,701
Opens and close, please.

197
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,891
Your have damaged
internal systems.

198
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:51,531
Maybe next time you
can design me better.

199
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,511
- How are you?
- I am fine. I can't feel anything.

200
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,451
No you, in There.

201
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,021
I have been having glitches...

202
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,231
but it will pass.

203
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:09,261
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

204
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:12,851
But these wounds are so cycling.
I had two this morning.

205
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,541
- Sound or image?
- Both.

206
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:20,871
I see it.

207
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,991
You made any
unencrypted downloads?

208
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:26,531
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

209
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:30,661
My name is Major Mary Killian. I
give my consent to delete this data.

210
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,231
It's done.

211
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,181
- No big deal.
- What are they?

212
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,641
Sensory echoes from
your mind, shadows.

213
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:39,991
I'm not sure.

214
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,021
How do you know it's a
glitch of what's me?

215
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,041
The glitches have a
different texture...

216
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,311
to the rest of your code.

217
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:51,121
I can see everything.

218
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,811
All of your thoughts, your...
decisions.

219
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:58,131
I guess privacy is
just for humans.

220
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,051
You are human.

221
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,181
People see you as human.

222
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,721
Everyone around me seems to fit.

223
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:09,531
They seem connected to something.
Something I...

224
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:11,271
am not..

225
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,861
- Like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

226
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:19,561
And at time you'll feel more more
connected to it and to them.

227
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:25,191
Opens and close, please.

228
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,341
We cling to memories as
if they define us, but...

229
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,201
They really don't.

230
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,981
What we do is what defines us.

231
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:50,591
<i>You're entering a Hanka secure area.

232
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:54,061
<i>Please disable

233
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,171
I'm busy.

234
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,791
Dr.. Dahlin! Are
you finished yet?

235
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:01,211
If you hadn't rained all the
Geisha with the bullets,

236
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,321
This would be much easier.

237
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,931
- I didn't shoot him.
- I did.

238
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,161
This is gonna take days.

239
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,081
I need to run hundreds of
potential simulations.

240
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:12,441
We don't have the time.

241
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:18,711
She was a Hanka companion bot.

242
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:22,281
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

243
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:25,081
What was on her drives?

244
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,081
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

245
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,151
No sign of what she was up to.

246
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,701
The hardware was vandalized.

247
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,071
They ripped her up.

248
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:39,361
Then I have to do a deep dive.

249
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,341
You can't encrypt you
in the deep dive

250
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:43,981
I know it.

251
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:49,861
They could left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

252
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,301
She is right.

253
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,111
You will be exposing your mind to who
ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

254
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,631
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

255
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,031
It's too dangerous.

256
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:13,721
And highly irresponsible.

257
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,021
Are you sure?

258
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:22,691
You see any bad code headed
my way, pull me out.

259
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,431
How come you're
the one sweating?

260
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:37,671
Run it.

261
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,641
Cyber mind connection to
the Major, now active...

262
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:51,651
and unencrypted

263
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,271
consent required
for data download.

264
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,691
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

265
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,791
Disconnect. Get her out.

266
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,271
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

267
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,571
Get her out now!

268
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:53,831
Now!

269
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:56,991
Are you okay?

270
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,531
I know where he is.

271
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:48,311
Two Mercs at the door.
Armed and enhanced.

272
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:51,131
Copy that. We got it covered.

273
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,761
There's a lot of heat in
here for a nightclub.

274
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:07,231
It's a Yakuza Club.
What did you expect?

275
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,031
I quite like the place.

276
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,311
Why doesn't that surprise me?

277
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:16,181
I am gonna have to draw some attention. See
if I can access the basement that way.

278
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:22,271
You're not here looking
for any trouble, are you?

279
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,361
I am just here for the girls...
and beer.

280
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,241
- Can I help you?
- I am looking for someone.

281
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:32,781
You've been here before?

282
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,401
My friend had some
Mech work done here.

283
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,311
We don't do Mech work here.

284
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,371
My mistake.

285
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:43,311
Why don't you come have fun with us?
We will have some privacy.

286
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,541
I'm in.

287
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:54,721
I'll be here when you need me.

288
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:11,401
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

289
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,871
She's human?

290
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:15,891
Your friend.

291
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,441
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,771
Batou.

293
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:21,221
Can you hear me?

294
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:25,261
Who did this stunning
work on you?

295
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,301
It is divine.

296
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,531
Ladriya... guns.

297
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:37,781
Here.

298
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:42,471
Batou, I'm losing signal.

299
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,771
Don't worry sweety.

300
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:47,251
We have privacy.

301
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:50,061
Listen.

302
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,821
You know the signal
is green in or out.

303
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,451
Major, I'm in position.
Do you copy?

304
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:58,661
Beer.

305
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,871
If you don't answer, you're
gonna hurt my feelings.

306
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:13,061
Ladriya, do you have
major on Comms?

307
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:15,861
Got nothing. The signal
is still blocked.

308
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:19,091
I am afraid I get bored
by that easily, so...

309
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:21,361
You don't wanna talk...

310
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,321
Maybe you wanna dance!

311
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,761
Major, come on. Answer me.

312
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,671
I thought you said no trouble.

313
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,771
Dance!

314
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:57,621
The truth is...

315
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,911
I wasn't built to dance.

316
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,841
Back on comms. I am
heading to the back room.

317
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:01,811
I missed you. I'll
meet you there.

318
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:36,511
<i>Collaborate with Hanka
Robotics should be destroyed.</i>

319
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:48,311
Major?

320
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,811
Where is Batou?

321
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:26,631
In enhancement, next door.
He is doing well

322
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:30,691
you took most of the blast.

323
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:35,571
I saw him down there.

324
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:38,741
It was like...

325
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,301
He waited to see me.

326
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,941
We synaptic scanned you.

327
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:48,581
Everything you witnessed went
to Section 9 to evaluate.

328
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:53,151
You know, the scan...

329
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,741
Also turned up the
number of glitches.

330
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:58,471
They've been getting worse.

331
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:01,601
Since when?

332
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,191
Since the deep dive.

333
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,451
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

334
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:25,971
No.

335
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,141
They don't.

336
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:33,161
You have been inside the
same shell as he has.

337
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:37,691
That could have very
serious consequences.

338
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,851
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

339
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,711
You're disappointed.

340
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,941
No, I'm worried.

341
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:52,271
You're not invulnerable.

342
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:56,821
I can repair your body, but
I can't protect your mind.

343
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:58,921
Why not?

344
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,671
You can see all
my thoughts so...

345
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,121
You should be able
to secure them.

346
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:11,531
Try and understand
your importance Major.

347
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,511
You're what everyone
will become one day.

348
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,041
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

349
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:42,771
I can see you out
there, you know.

350
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:47,461
How many fingers
am I holding up?

351
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:49,751
Funny.

352
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,861
Say something nice.

353
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,961
You chose those?

354
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:05,891
They are tactical.

355
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,961
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

356
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,461
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

357
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,291
I have night vision...

358
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:16,981
and X-rays.

359
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:20,421
I guess I see like you now.

360
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:23,551
Don't worry, you'll
get used to it.

361
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,821
Thanks for saving my ass.

362
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,691
Glad to see you're okay..

363
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,041
Major?

364
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,351
Could you feed the dogs for me?

365
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,441
I don't want to scare them.

366
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:41,041
Anytime.

367
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:27,981
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr.
Aramaki?

368
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:31,871
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

369
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:35,071
<i>We have everything
that we require.</i>

370
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:39,621
Major is our most sophisticated
weapon only if she is intact.

371
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:42,991
And Dr. Ouelet informed me...

372
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:46,141
That you let her dive
a corrupted geisha.

373
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,621
You realize there is
a premium importance

374
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:58,471
that Hanka represents
to this government.

375
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:02,181
Major is the is the
future of my company.

376
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,581
If you compromise
your systems again...

377
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,201
I will burn this section.

378
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,071
<i>Yes sir.</i>

379
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,431
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

380
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:19,121
<i>Be careful who is the threat.</i>

381
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:23,281
<i>I am accountable to the Prime
Minister, not to Hanka.</i>

382
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:13,051
<i>Create your own beauty.
Beauty enhanced.</i>

383
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,321
Are you human?

384
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:27,911
Yeah.

385
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,421
Can you take that off?

386
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:38,101
So I can see your face?

387
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,391
What is that feeling?

388
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:06,781
It feels...

389
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,641
different.

390
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:21,711
What are you?

391
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,361
<i>SECURE PROJECT 2571</i>

392
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,071
<i>HANKA PERSONNEL FILES</i>

393
00:41:58,771 --> 00:41:59,771
Look at me.

394
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,081
Tell me what they took from me.

395
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:10,181
I am sorry. They never told us.

396
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,171
It feels weird driving
with these eyes.

397
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:40,321
Why do you take that?

398
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,621
Um, keeps my brain from
rejecting this body.

399
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,971
Major, Batou, you
need to get here.

400
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:49,311
What you got?

401
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,941
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

402
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,511
It's Dahlin.

403
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,031
Got it.

404
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,841
Major this way.

405
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:33,351
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

406
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,011
What is that?

407
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:38,781
She found what Kuze
stole from Osmond.

408
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:44,341
It's a list of everyone who
worked on a project called 2571.

409
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:46,341
That's who he's targeting.

410
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:48,641
Is there anyone
else on that list?

411
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:51,251
<i>Dr. OUELET</i>

412
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,851
Find Oulet. Now!

413
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:57,021
She is in transit.
Her comms are down.

414
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,731
<i>I'm looking at her
and thinking...</i>

415
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:06,191
<i>"You want me to for
pay for violin too".</i>

416
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:07,771
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

417
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:10,451
<i>I love that chick to pieces.</i>

418
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,641
<i>I do. She is amazing.</i>

419
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:15,871
<i>But when she prox that
thing, it's painful right?</i>

420
00:44:16,951 --> 00:44:17,951
<i>Why not piano?</i>

421
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:22,751
<i>I mean, it's the same price,
and doesn't sound so bad.</i>

422
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:27,451
<i>At least if you can't play

<i>2-5-7-1! Tell me everything!</i>

00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:33,381
<i>Are you prepare to

425
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:43,491
Go!

426
00:45:58,551 --> 00:45:59,551
Go!

427
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,461
Who is Kuze?

428
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,211
- Why does he want to kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

429
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:05,931
Enough, enough!

430
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:09,541
We need him alive.

431
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:16,011
Please. I have
been through this.

432
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,181
You have the wrong guy.

433
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,721
So tell us who we do have.

434
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:27,501
My name is Lee Cunningham.

435
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:33,181
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

436
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:34,091
Who loaded the mines?

437
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:36,601
I don't know anything about the
weapons, alright I told you.

438
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:39,291
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

439
00:48:39,511 --> 00:48:40,961
What's her name?

440
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:46,061
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

441
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:48,701
Isn't she a little angel?

442
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,941
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

443
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:55,161
Do you have kids?

444
00:48:58,681 --> 00:48:59,981
Where do you live?

445
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:03,581
I can't remember.

446
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:06,881
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

447
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:08,981
It's a tall place, right?

448
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:11,891
You don't have a child.

449
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:18,071
You have no wife. You live
alone, It's just you.

450
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:19,821
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

451
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:21,251
- There was nobody there.
- No.

452
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:22,871
You live there for 10
years by yourself.

453
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:23,141
No!

454
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:25,541
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

455
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,211
I didn't kill anyone!

456
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,731
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

457
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:32,161
Please!

458
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:34,871
I didn't do anything.

459
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,381
Why do you keep
saying this to me?

460
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:39,761
I don't understand.
How can he not know?

461
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,841
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

462
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,771
and somehow installed
a new reality.

463
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,561
At least he got to
believe he had a kid.

464
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:53,331
What's the difference huh?

465
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,831
Fantasy, reality?

466
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,011
Dreams, memories?

467
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:01,641
It's all the same.

468
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:04,001
Just noise.

469
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:07,001
It's him.

470
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:11,531
He is in there.

471
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:16,761
This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.

472
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:18,481
Lie Detector.

473
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:20,131
He must have hacked in that way.

474
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:23,061
We should uplink to the machine, trace
the code, get a lock on his location.

475
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,081
Do it.

476
00:50:24,451 --> 00:50:26,551
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

477
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,681
<i>Major</i>

478
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:31,601
<i>We don't know what
else he can do.</i>

479
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,911
The signal is unstable. Can
you get the lock on him?

480
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:48,281
We gotta move fast.
We're losing him.

481
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,701
Connecting.

482
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:53,651
Who are you?

483
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:57,951
Come here.

484
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,651
I am shy.

485
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:04,991
I am not beautiful...

486
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:06,501
like you.

487
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,501
Tell me who you are.

488
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:14,721
I have been born more than once.

489
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:17,991
So I have more than one name

490
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:20,041
I'll find you.

491
00:51:20,531 --> 00:51:21,981
Not yet.

492
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:24,161
I am not done.

493
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,541
The machine is tracing
his location.

494
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,121
We got a fix!

495
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:35,421
I need to see her.

496
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:37,461
No, please. I know..what...

497
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,911
We got him.

498
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:48,231
Let's go.

499
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:03,941
Weapons up.

500
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:08,161
- Go.
- On me.

501
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:58,071
Stay Down! Stay Down!

502
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:09,771
Put it down, put it down.

503
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,391
Grenade!

504
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:16,281
Major!

505
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:18,091
Come in.

506
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:21,351
I knew why we could
not find him.

507
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:27,431
He is using human minds to
create a network of his own.

508
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,071
We're coming to your position.

509
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,141
Tell me who you are.

510
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:53,011
I'm that what you
seek to destroy.

511
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,291
In this life, my name is...

512
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:01,401
Kuze.

513
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:06,061
What are you doing to me?

514
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:13,921
I have, connected you, to a
network of my own creation.

515
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,601
When I am finished
in this world...

516
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:21,271
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

517
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:23,891
What do you want from me?

518
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:26,531
I became...

519
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:29,811
Fascinated with you...

520
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:33,091
Reading your code...

521
00:56:33,451 --> 00:56:35,991
when you were
inside that geisha.

522
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:42,171
Like nothing I had
felt before, yet so..

523
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:44,361
Familiar.

524
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,741
We are the same.

525
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:50,861
We are not the same.

526
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:55,501
You kill innocent people.

527
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:58,621
Innocent? Is that
the..what you call them?

528
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:01,771
I am as they need me.

529
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:04,331
Who made you?

530
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:06,541
What have they told you?

531
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,171
That you were the first?

532
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:12,101
The first cerebral salvage.

533
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:16,721
You were born of lessons...

534
00:57:17,131 --> 00:57:18,611
from my failure.

535
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:22,281
What are you talking about?

536
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:28,671
I was conscious while they dismembered
my body, and discarded me

537
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,941
like garbage.

538
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:34,591
I was lying on a table...

539
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:39,831
Listening to doctors talk about how my
mind had not matched with the shell.

540
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:42,181
That they had built.

541
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:46,491
I'm projected to 2571...

542
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:48,281
had failed...

543
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:50,961
and they had to move on...

544
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:58,451
to you.

545
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:08,071
Morning beauty you are.

546
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,641
They have improved us so much...

547
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,771
since they made me.

548
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:23,091
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

549
00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:25,771
But they have created us...

550
00:58:26,071 --> 00:58:28,471
to evolve alone...

551
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:34,731
beyond them.

552
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:37,711
Evolution? That's what you call?

553
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:40,461
Killing everyone who made you?

554
00:58:40,911 --> 00:58:43,171
You are not listening to me.

555
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:45,271
You are murderer.

556
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:48,571
They tried to kill me first.

557
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:52,331
It is self-defense.

558
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:54,511
The defense of self.

559
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:58,921
More will die...

560
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,971
until they tell me...

561
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:04,981
what they took.

562
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:06,571
I won't let that happen.

563
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,451
You want to kill me?

564
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,921
Like everyone else.

565
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:24,911
Do it, then.

566
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,371
Do what you are
programmed to do.

567
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:43,551
What is that?

568
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:57,261
What is that?

569
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:02,751
I kick in to remember,
but I am haunted by it.

570
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:05,551
Do You see it?

571
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:12,131
Togusa!

572
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:21,331
Don't take the medication
that they gave you..

573
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:24,721
They use it to suppress
your memories.

574
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:29,021
Your shell belongs to
them, but not your ghost.

575
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:31,471
Your ghost is yours.

576
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:33,521
Remember that...

577
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:36,711
and maybe you can
remember it all.

578
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:47,471
Get away from her! Get
down on the ground now.

579
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,741
Major..

580
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:05,501
Major!

581
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:08,821
How many?

582
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,031
Dozens。

583
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,101
How many?

584
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:27,421
98 unsuccessful
attempts before you.

585
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:32,001
You killed 98 innocent people.

586
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:34,651
No, I didn't kill anyone.

587
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,961
You wouldn't be here.

588
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:40,111
You would not exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

589
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:41,921
Experiments?

590
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:46,011
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

591
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,691
No, Mira!

592
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:57,051
Sacrifices were made.

593
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:01,531
Where did the bodies come from?

594
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,621
Where did I come from?

595
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:09,321
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

596
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,581
I did not ask questions.

597
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:13,171
The harbor.

598
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:15,491
My parents.

599
01:03:16,181 --> 01:03:17,841
The way they died.

600
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,231
Did that happen?

601
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:25,541
No.

602
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:31,101
We gave you false memories.

603
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,121
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

604
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:36,971
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

605
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:40,721
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

606
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:42,981
you were born.

607
01:03:44,261 --> 01:03:46,251
You were so beautiful.

608
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:50,531
Nothing I have is real.

609
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,021
I found him.

610
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:57,401
I told you to be careful.

611
01:03:57,771 --> 01:04:00,381
You knew who he was
the whole time.

612
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:01,851
You built him.

613
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:04,691
He had a..

614
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:07,681
Violent unstable mind.

615
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:10,911
His cerebral connection
wouldn't hold!

616
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,481
- I tried to save him!
- No.

617
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:15,981
You left him to die.

618
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:30,631
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

619
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:33,851
Is there any word on Major?

620
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:38,451
<i>She's gone. Off-grid. Silent.</i>

621
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,491
Copy that, sir.

622
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,821
I know where to find her.

623
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,581
I didn't ask you to come here.

624
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:32,241
You never ask.

625
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,551
But I always do.

626
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,871
Did they send you
to bring me in?

627
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:45,331
I'm just here to fish.
Did you see any?

628
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:50,141
You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me.

629
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,261
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

630
01:06:16,051 --> 01:06:17,711
What's it like down there?

631
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,211
It's Cold and dark.

632
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,571
Just a million miles away.

633
01:06:25,851 --> 01:06:27,381
No voices.

634
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:29,901
No data streaming.

635
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:32,271
Just...

636
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:36,821
nothing.

637
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:44,281
- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?

638
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,711
It feels real.

639
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:55,581
Why didn't you stop him?

640
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,941
I don't know who
to trust anymore.

641
01:07:02,081 --> 01:07:03,651
You trust me, right?

642
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:09,591
Yes I do.

643
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:14,571
I just don't like it.

644
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:24,911
I need you to take me back.

645
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:27,031
There is more I
need to find out.

646
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:32,791
Sure.

647
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:52,311
Dr. Ouelet...

648
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:54,701
What have you told her?

649
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:58,631
She knows.

650
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,331
I'm bringing her in.

651
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:33,941
Hanka security to Headquarters.

652
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:36,801
We have the Major.

653
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:15,581
Why is she sedated?

654
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:18,561
She's been turned
by a terrorist.

655
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,261
But you know that already.

656
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:26,581
You should have called the first
time she came to see you.

657
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:29,581
Instead, you gave
her information.

658
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:30,961
What makes you think
you have the..

659
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:33,731
- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.

660
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:36,351
It's time to move on
to the next iteration.

661
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:37,891
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

662
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:40,081
I will delete all the
data and reprogram her.

663
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:43,291
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.

664
01:09:43,781 --> 01:09:46,701
You download all the
data on the terrorist...

665
01:09:46,991 --> 01:09:49,021
and then I order
you to terminate.

666
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,671
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

667
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:59,571
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

668
01:10:03,281 --> 01:10:05,071
- She's mine.
- No.

669
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:07,581
She is a contract... with me.

670
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:09,481
We succeeded.

671
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:13,201
She is more than human...
and more than AI.

672
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:17,601
We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

673
01:10:17,911 --> 01:10:20,061
Her ghost is what failed us.

674
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:24,121
We can not control her. She
is no longer a viable asset.

675
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:31,971
You should be the one to do it.

676
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:43,551
What are you doing to me?

677
01:10:45,311 --> 01:10:47,701
I'll run the standard synaptic.

678
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:50,101
Upload your data on the raid.

679
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:53,831
I'll find out exactly
what Kuze told you.

680
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:56,751
You know what he told me.

681
01:10:57,551 --> 01:10:58,551
The truth.

682
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:04,541
You're deleting
everything, aren't you?

683
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:05,871
No.

684
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:10,601
So I don't remember...

685
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:12,561
You.

686
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,501
My name is Major Mira Killian...

687
01:11:25,221 --> 01:11:28,691
And I do not consent to the
deletion of this data.

688
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:32,981
I do not consent.

689
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,451
I do not consent.

690
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,591
We never needed your consent.

691
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:46,421
Yours or anyone's.

692
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:52,931
You're killing me..

693
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:55,671
Right you...?

694
01:12:15,101 --> 01:12:16,281
Mira?

695
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:20,021
Do you hear me?

696
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:25,011
Mira?

697
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:31,001
This is your past, your real past.
Take it.

698
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:34,171
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

699
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:35,631
Come on, go!

700
01:12:43,001 --> 01:12:44,001
Go!

701
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:45,601
Go!

702
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:58,331
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

703
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:01,841
<i>Initiating Lockdown procedure.</i>

704
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:04,971
<i>Please relocate to your
designated safe room.</i>

705
01:13:05,321 --> 01:13:07,331
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

706
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:12,281
That's the problem
with the human heart.

707
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:55,341
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

708
01:13:55,761 --> 01:13:57,291
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

709
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,321
You are to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

710
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:03,721
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

711
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,521
You want to kill her?
You built her!

712
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:08,951
- Have your sergeant stand down.
- The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.

713
01:14:09,251 --> 01:14:10,901
She is not the major anymore!

714
01:14:11,211 --> 01:14:14,001
We have a section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

715
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:17,011
This goes public
your unit goes down.

716
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,401
<i>You kill her...</i>

717
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:22,501
<i>You kill us.</i>

718
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:24,651
I'll take that under advice.

719
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:29,961
So what now?

720
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:25,821
Oh, the puppy.

721
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,591
Oh, you surprised me.

722
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:33,131
She likes you.

723
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,011
I was looking for...

724
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:37,201
No, come in.

725
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:40,051
Yeah, go, come come.

726
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:48,721
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

727
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:02,181
That... Motoko's room.

728
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:06,201
My daughter died a year ago.

729
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:08,571
I am Sorry.

730
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,791
She run away.

731
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:13,531
She was a difficult.

732
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:17,861
We fought.

733
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:23,181
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

734
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,111
Please come on the sit.

735
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:49,101
What happened to your her?

736
01:16:49,821 --> 01:16:51,561
I don't know.

737
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:57,921
The ministry sent me
her ashes, and...

738
01:16:59,131 --> 01:17:01,881
They told me she
took her own life.

739
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:08,391
But Motoko... No, no, no.

740
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:11,681
I never believe them.

741
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:14,251
She was happy...

742
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:17,991
living in the lawless
zone with her friends.

743
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,191
She'd write her
manifestos about...

744
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,961
how technology was...

745
01:17:25,451 --> 01:17:28,031
destroying the world.

746
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:31,661
Then one day...

747
01:17:32,111 --> 01:17:34,071
the police came...

748
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:36,141
and they run.

749
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,851
It's strange.

750
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:56,281
I see her in so
many young women.

751
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:00,381
On the street, in my dreams.

752
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:03,561
As if she is still here.

753
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:06,261
She was...

754
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:08,451
fearless.

755
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,961
And wild.

756
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:16,081
You remind me of her.

757
01:18:17,591 --> 01:18:18,661
Sorry.

758
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:25,181
Why do I remind you of her?

759
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:29,541
The way you look at me.

760
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:36,991
Who are you?

761
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:42,121
I don't know.

762
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:45,281
Wait, wait, wait!

763
01:18:47,281 --> 01:18:49,721
Will you come again to visit me?

764
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,681
I will.

765
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:20,631
Aramaki.

766
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:22,581
Listen to me.

767
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,551
I was never in a
terrorist bombing.

768
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:27,261
My parents...

769
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:30,531
Everything was data they
installed in my mind.

770
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:35,891
And there were others.
Run-aways like me...

771
01:19:36,481 --> 01:19:38,491
considered disposable.

772
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:42,081
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.

773
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:44,391
To Hanka.

774
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:47,611
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

775
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,681
Dr. Ouelet can.

776
01:19:50,381 --> 01:19:51,891
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

777
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:59,871
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

778
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:07,091
Put me on the grid. I
need Kuze to find me.

779
01:20:09,521 --> 01:20:10,821
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

780
01:20:11,331 --> 01:20:14,131
I know, but I have to do this.

781
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:19,241
<i>I'm going to meet with
the Prime Minister.</i>

782
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:22,231
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

783
01:20:28,761 --> 01:20:30,621
The virus has spread.

784
01:20:53,531 --> 01:20:56,301
<i>All agents stick
to mental comms.</i>

785
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:40,171
<i>Don't send a rabbit...</i>

786
01:21:40,571 --> 01:21:41,571
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

787
01:21:49,931 --> 01:21:51,771
<i>We are burned.</i>

788
01:21:53,361 --> 01:21:54,701
<i>I repeat.</i>

789
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:57,831
<i>We are burned.</i>

790
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,161
We have located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

791
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,601
Air support 5 minutes out.

792
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,801
Is the spider tank within range?

793
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,481
Yes sir. Awaiting
your orders sir.

794
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:18,801
Motoko!

795
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:28,691
It is real.

796
01:25:32,181 --> 01:25:33,981
This place.

797
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:44,091
I remember what they did to us.

798
01:25:44,491 --> 01:25:48,961
Cutter and his men. This is
where they took us from.

799
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:57,651
We used to sleep right here.

800
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:01,471
We were like a family.

801
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:03,701
All of us run away.

802
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:06,881
We had nothing...

803
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:12,511
except each other.

804
01:26:16,331 --> 01:26:18,181
They took that from us.

805
01:26:34,591 --> 01:26:36,461
Your name was Hideo.

806
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:49,331
Motoko.

807
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:53,791
That was your name.

808
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:58,681
Motoko.

809
01:27:02,611 --> 01:27:04,031
Come with me...

810
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,211
my network.

811
01:27:08,111 --> 01:27:10,531
We will evolve beyond them.

812
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:15,911
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

813
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:17,681
Come...

814
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:19,671
with me.

815
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,241
I will take control from here.

816
01:27:39,691 --> 01:27:41,551
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

817
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:45,361
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

818
01:27:54,371 --> 01:27:56,241
It's Cutter! He found us!

819
01:29:34,611 --> 01:29:35,821
<i>Target acquired</i>

820
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:39,161
No!

821
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:50,501
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

822
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:08,101
You came close...

823
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:09,661
you freak.

824
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:44,281
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

825
01:31:27,611 --> 01:31:29,251
Sniper team on site?

826
01:31:30,011 --> 01:31:32,141
Approaching the target now sir.

827
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:36,021
Come with me.

828
01:31:37,421 --> 01:31:40,341
There is no place for us here.

829
01:31:45,321 --> 01:31:46,411
No.

830
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:54,521
I'm not ready to leave.

831
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:57,771
I belong here.

832
01:32:01,471 --> 01:32:04,271
I'll always be there with you...

833
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:07,081
your ghost.

834
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:14,841
Target is in view.

835
01:32:15,351 --> 01:32:16,721
What are you waiting for?

836
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:17,931
Do it!

837
01:32:20,221 --> 01:32:21,861
No!

838
01:32:22,701 --> 01:32:24,011
Keep firing.

839
01:32:26,661 --> 01:32:29,141
<i>Saito, have you found Major?
Is she safe?</i>

840
01:32:31,731 --> 01:32:32,901
She will be.

841
01:32:55,371 --> 01:32:56,451
Hey..

842
01:32:58,831 --> 01:32:59,981
Hey.

843
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:05,731
Say something nice.

844
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,671
What's your name?

845
01:33:09,241 --> 01:33:12,601
Aramaki told me you had
a name from before.

846
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,221
Motoko.

847
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:24,991
Major still in there, right?

848
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:28,401
I am.

849
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:45,161
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

850
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:47,931
<i>I talked with the
Prime Minister.</i>

851
01:33:48,261 --> 01:33:51,521
<i>You are accused of murder and
crimes against the state.</i>

852
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,131
I thought that it might be you.

853
01:34:02,411 --> 01:34:04,421
<i>It is unwise to resist.</i>

854
01:34:24,711 --> 01:34:25,711
Please.

855
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:27,331
<i>Major?</i>

856
01:34:27,921 --> 01:34:30,231
<i>I am with Cutter.</i>

857
01:34:30,961 --> 01:34:33,031
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

858
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:35,871
Tell him this is justice.

859
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:38,401
It's what I was built for.

860
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:41,861
So do you give consent?

861
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:44,451
My name is Major.

862
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:47,321
And I give my consent.

863
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:00,721
You don't have to
come here anymore.

864
01:36:03,481 --> 01:36:05,041
I know.

865
01:36:39,521 --> 01:36:42,291
My mind is human.

866
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:45,841
My body is manufactured.

867
01:36:47,861 --> 01:36:49,821
I am the first of
my kind, but...

868
01:36:51,521 --> 01:36:53,191
I won't be the last.

869
01:36:57,671 --> 01:37:00,981
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

870
01:37:02,171 --> 01:37:05,131
But what we do defines us.

871
01:37:11,531 --> 01:37:14,681
My ghost survived to
remind the next of us...

872
01:37:15,521 --> 01:37:18,751
that humanity is our virtue.

873
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:22,521
I know who I am...

874
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:25,401
and what I'm here to do.

875
01:37:29,431 --> 01:37:30,741
<i>Major.</i>

876
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:32,771
<i>Engage targets.</i>

877
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:49,191
<i>You're authorized.</i>
