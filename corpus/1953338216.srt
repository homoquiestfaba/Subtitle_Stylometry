1
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,605
You good? I'm fine.

2
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,075
Girls, what're you doing?

3
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,276
Girls!

4
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,313
Dumbasses.

5
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,283
Y'all don't
belong on this block.

6
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,384
Yo, take her bike.

7
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,686
Drop that high yellow heifer.

8
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,323
We don't want any trouble.

9
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,091
What the hell?
Nice.

10
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,292
Sweetie.

11
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,463
Oh, nice.

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,698
Right in your face.

13
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,235
Your mom still in
the nuthouse, Sweetie?

14
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,402
Easy, man.

15
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,971
Let us go.

16
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,472
Nah, it's too late for that.

17
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,975
If you want your bike back,
you'll have to re-earn it.

18
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,243
Yeah, make them re-earn it.

19
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,385
We're gonna have us a race.

20
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,322
You beat his boys to that tree
and we're through.

21
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,258
You won't have to walk
18 blocks out of your way

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,093
in the morning
no more neither.

23
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,495
Stop ducking corners,
hiding and crawling and shit.

24
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,165
If not, the bike
will be ours.

25
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,768
I ain't racing for something my parents
bought me in the first place.

26
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,371
"Something my parents bought me
in the first place."

27
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,505
Bitch, please.

28
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,509
Then why don't you go on
with your dang bike?

29
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,512
We can beat Hi'Low and Lil' Man
on our slowest day.

30
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,347
Yo, on your mark?

31
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,349
Latonya, let Betty go home.
You get a 60-second lead.

32
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,517
Set?

33
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,219
Just keep on running,
all the way home.

34
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,353
Go!

35
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,458
Get her!

36
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,334
Get her!

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,721
Two Dog, stop!

38
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,623
Stop kicking her now!

39
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,060
Stop kicking...

40
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,228
Baby!

41
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,395
You like picking on girls?

42
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,231
Oh!

43
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,732
Stop!

44
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,734
Yo, someone,
can you just do something?

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,741
Sucker!

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,477
Stop it.
He's had enough!

47
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,516
You dare jump
my little sister?

48
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,237
Somebody help him!

49
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,438
Come on, Ola. Let's go.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,773
No. No!

51
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,509
Let me go, Roland! Fucking...

52
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,114
It's time to go. Come on.
No!

53
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,483
Come on.
Let me...

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,493
You all right, Sweetness?

55
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,727
Yeah.

56
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,227
All right, I got a half grilled cheese
and a little cabbage soup.

57
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,562
Here we go.

58
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:07,933
It's not too hot,
it's not too cold.

59
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,603
Come here.

60
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,849
Yesterday,
I got the Daily Double.

61
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,283
You did?

62
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,921
None of the contestants.

63
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,395
Hey, girls.

64
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,863
Who's hungry?

65
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,564
Hi. There's some hot soup
on the stove.

66
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,665
I'm hungry!

67
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,736
Thanks, Dad.

68
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,239
Hello, Mom.

69
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,440
What's up?

70
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,575
Mama, Ola said hi.

71
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,744
And Daddy said,
"What's up?"

72
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,879
Nothing.

73
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,680
My girls are home.

74
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:56,982
Hi, Mama.

75
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,857
Yankees take it or no?

76
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,992
You bet.

77
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,430
Oh!

78
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,931
What's up?

79
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,666
Sorry,
you want some more?

80
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,476
Looks good, honey.

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,452
<i># My name is Sweetness
Don't...</i>

82
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,920
All right! All right.

83
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,421
<i># My name is Sweetness</i>

84
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,024
<i># Don't underestimate the T
'cause you need this #</i>

85
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,637
It's already been handled.

86
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,039
I know.

87
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,881
Well, I'm sorry.

88
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,584
You know.

89
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,487
I'm gonna get
some money soon.

90
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,721
I know.

91
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,540
Gordon.

92
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,343
What?

93
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,511
Mmm.

94
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,363
Come on, baby, what did you do
with my watch?

95
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,631
Hmm?

96
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,734
You told me you
sold it, remember?

97
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,773
If I fucking remembered,
I wouldn't have fucking asked.

98
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,719
Every single fucking time.

99
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,494
Rene, come on.

100
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,466
Ah, honey, come...

101
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,537
Honey, come on. I'm sorry.

102
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,773
Rene, I'm sorry, baby.

103
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,912
Lorene!

104
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,150
Come on. I'm kidding.

105
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,961
How come he doesn't just
stay wherever it is he goes?

106
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,630
Can you do me a favor?

107
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,701
Could you go get my pocketbook off
the shelf and bring it here?

108
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,802
Why?

109
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,505
Can you do that
for me, Sweetie?

110
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,843
Lorene, where are you?

111
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,824
Lorene, come on.

112
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,059
Come on, Lorene. What...

113
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,961
Fucking counters...
Are you there?

114
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,132
Toss it to me.

115
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,302
Stay inside.

116
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,705
Are you coming back?
Of course I am.

117
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,541
Come on, Rene!

118
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,678
Lorene, come on.

119
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,681
Fuck!

120
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,158
Where the...

121
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,695
What the fuck?
Everyone's fucking gone.

122
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,732
I can't be bothered with this
piece of fucking shit.

123
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,003
He sounds like
he's underwater.

124
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,639
I wish he was.

125
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,975
Permanently.

126
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,245
Uh...

127
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,015
Bong! Bong! Bong!

128
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,150
Stop it!

129
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,652
Bong! Bong! Bong!

130
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,221
You gonna draw
attention to us. Stop it.

131
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,160
Oh, shit!

132
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,165
You dropped one.

133
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,233
Help me.

134
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,374
Get out of here, go.

135
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,349
Totally better.

136
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,750
Okay.

137
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,324
OLA: Mmm-hmm.

138
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,396
Uh-huh.

139
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,764
Yeah.

140
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,919
Just personalize
the language.

141
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:53,224
For instance, if Betty was
running 60 miles an hour,

142
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,327
carrying four book bags
at 120-knots winds,

143
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,795
when will Betty get home?

144
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,165
Oh!

145
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,901
Okay, I get it. Yeah.

146
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,910
What's with the jacket, night and day,
in the fucking house, Ola?

147
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,211
I'm cold.

148
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,812
Are you cold or stupid?

149
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,288
What about your knight
in shining armor?

150
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,324
Is he off probation yet,
what's his face?

151
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,833
Pick it up!

152
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,551
Pick it up.

153
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,857
What, are you gonna cry?

154
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,548
Lucky you.

155
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,252
Escaping.

156
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,087
Superdifluous.

157
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,561
Superdifluous.

158
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,166
Superfluous.

159
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,278
Look, you heard
from your sister?

160
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Nothing.

161
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,084
Come on, it's been months.

162
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,319
You hens
haven't spoken a word.

163
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,553
No.

164
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,328
Well, we don't hang
those in the kitchen.

165
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,130
Okay, just...
You hang them in here.

166
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,499
I don't care if it
takes fucking longer.

167
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,041
Superfluous.

168
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,484
My mom's got
the illest pill connect

169
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,120
this side of
the Atlantic, bitch.

170
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,989
Ain't got shit on my father's
coke connection.

171
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,991
I make four
allowances in one day.

172
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,326
Yeah, right.
You hear this kid? Come on.

173
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,364
Oh! Goody, goody gumdrops.

174
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:30,268
Hold up, Sweetness. Hold up.
Hold. Damn. Where you going?

175
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,172
I got something for you if you need it.
You know what I mean?

176
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,274
Goody O'Hara.

177
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,542
Yeah, I'd be
willing to experiment

178
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,511
even with them fucked-up
ass shoes she got on.

179
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,731
Her name is Esther.

180
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,703
Hi.

181
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,899
Thanks, Roland.

182
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,636
Thank you.

183
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,680
Would you trade it
for a boat?

184
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,316
Where am I going
in a dumb boat?

185
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,755
You can trade it for a plane.
You can go anywhere in a plane.

186
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,692
Yeah, well, you get me a plane
and then I'll decide.

187
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,528
Until then,
I'm not trading my wheels.

188
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,029
Okay.

189
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,265
But seriously, Ol, if we sold it,
we can get a lot of money.

190
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,934
Stop speaking on my car.

191
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,602
Sorry, Ol.

192
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,640
Forget it.

193
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,912
You want me to shuffle?

194
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:08,979
Yeah.

195
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,881
Don't be mad.

196
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,787
Let me show you
how we do it.

197
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,955
I taught you how to shuffle.

198
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,323
How we do it. How we do it.

199
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:21,992
Okay.

200
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,407
Don't worry,
you're almost there.

201
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,542
Come on, give us some space.

202
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,031
It's so bizarre.

203
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,700
What?

204
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,736
It's like her
body's back, but...

205
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,077
All right, I'm going out.

206
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,748
It'll be a while
till we see him again.

207
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,029
Mom.

208
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,465
What did you go and do?

209
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,576
I got to go feed Esther.

210
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,120
Hi, Mama.

211
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,725
Where have you been?

212
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,998
You look different.

213
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,740
You know, I learned a gazillion new words
in that book you got me.

214
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,670
You can come out now.

215
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,080
O'Hara, how's your sister?

216
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,615
Uh... She's fine.

217
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,017
I'm gonna fucking...

218
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,486
She's getting on?

219
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,588
Um... Yeah,
you could say that.

220
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,091
How about you?
How you doing?

221
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,229
I... Um...

222
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,234
I gotta get to class.
I'm gonna be late. Sorry.

223
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,782
Come on, answer.
Mountains or ocean?

224
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,250
Who cares?

225
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,286
Don't be like that.

226
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,522
That was your favorite game.
You're the one that made it up.

227
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,856
Yeah, past tense, "was."

228
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,374
What happened?

229
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,077
Nothing. I'm gonna find Daddy.
I'll be right back.

230
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,284
Ma, Esther's sound asleep.
I'll be right back, okay?

231
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,554
I'm coming.

232
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,591
Bye, Mama.

233
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,892
Be safe.

234
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,663
This prick brother of hers,
he chased me eight blocks,

235
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,865
which is like eight
avenues over there.

236
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,900
So, I'm piping down, okay?

237
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,670
I got half his beard
on my belly button.

238
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,341
I swear to God, it was a rip.
Ripped it straight out.

239
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,710
And that was the last time
I was in Hawaii.

240
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:09,012
Fucking sand
and beach, my ass.

241
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,584
Oh-ho! It's my girls!

242
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,220
Hey, guys. Guys, you know my kids?
Hi.

243
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,755
Hey, what,
did your mother send you?

244
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,089
Dad.

245
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,958
This came for you.

246
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,827
What, you come all the way down here
just to give me a letter?

247
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,665
What is it?

248
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,008
Tell me, Ola.
What's it say?

249
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,981
What's it say?

250
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,953
"Dear Gordon, David John died in
his sleep last night.

251
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,722
"Regrets, Patsy."

252
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,690
Daddy's brother died?

253
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,926
Yeah. Go home.

254
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:56,994
Dad, we're gonna
wait for you.

255
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,061
No.

256
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,633
You've done enough already.
Go home.

257
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,134
Dad, it's okay.
We'll wait with you.

258
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,937
I don't want
the sight of you.

259
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,840
Go on, go on.
Get out of my fucking face.

260
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,642
Dad. Don't make me
say it again. Okay?

261
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,644
Just go home. Go and make
yourselves useful.

262
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,680
Check on your
fucking mother or just...

263
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,986
Come on, let's go before
someone sees us here.

264
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,421
Come on, Ola.

265
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,804
I hate him.

266
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,840
Don't say that.
His brother just died.

267
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,775
So what?

268
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,176
Damn, look at him.

269
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,811
Shut up, Sweetie.

270
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,947
Stop telling me what to do.

271
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,181
My pleasure.

272
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,416
"My pleasure."

273
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,781
Mama, may I
have some juice?

274
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,758
Quit slamming stuff.

275
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,027
I'm not slamming anything.

276
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,495
Oh, I'm sorry,
is that slamming?

277
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,464
Do it again, I dare you.

278
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,869
Smartass.
Ow!

279
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,537
That's what you get
for being a smartass.

280
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,873
If I was so smart, I wouldn't be stuck
here with all of you.

281
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,575
Oh, you're gonna get it.

282
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,154
Stop.

283
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,259
Mama?

284
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,928
Leave her alone.

285
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,264
If you wanna be useful, go make sure that
gravy's not fermenting.

286
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,172
That's it. I told you
to stop slamming shit.

287
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,442
Where did she go?

288
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,111
Ma!

289
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,997
Come back
inside now, Ma.

290
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,435
Go on and do.

291
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,674
Oh.

292
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

293
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,179
You are leaving looking like that
over my dead body.

294
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,181
So be it.
Don't. Don't.

295
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:47,217
Don't you dare.
I'm still your father.

296
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,252
You're just this person that comes
and goes,

297
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,487
sucking the life out of...

298
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,995
Jesus, child.

299
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,967
Lorene!

300
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,435
Lorene!

301
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,439
You...

302
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,779
Last time.

303
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,355
There's some
glue on the floor.

304
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,191
Yeah, no shit.

305
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,299
Alfie, who the fuck dressed you this
morning, man?

306
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,468
Yeah, that color's a little loud, brother,
I gotta tell you that.

307
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,670
You look like a lime, man.
You ain't got no lights in your house?

308
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,005
Jesus.
Yeah, I don't think

309
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,074
he has a mirror
in his house... Oh!

310
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,010
Come on now.

311
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,678
So how about you last night, brother?
What the fuck happened to you?

312
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,980
You're a little
tricky one, huh?

313
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,315
You fell in
the bush or something?

314
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,817
Something like that,
I don't know.

315
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,352
Copped a free feel
right there, you saw that?

316
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,654
Just shut up, man. I just don't wanna
be fucking near you.

317
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,989
All right, Alfie,
play time's over.

318
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,190
Bye-bye.

319
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,691
Yeah, don't fuck around, man.
Sell that shit.

320
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,527
All right, fuck you.

321
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,396
Fucking prick.

322
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,677
I told you the first time.

323
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,646
Yeah, but that was
for some new kicks. This is for...

324
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,747
You know.

325
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,150
I just can't, baby girl.

326
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:01,251
Please.

327
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,154
Please.

328
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,258
Please, front me
some gear, Ro.

329
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,628
I mean, shit, you see
how my family's living.

330
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,232
I'm not trying to
go down like that.

331
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,770
Well, I found someone else
who'll front me, so...

332
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,674
I'm doing this with
or without your help.

333
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:51,534
Okay, look, keep it simple.
Small batches.

334
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,803
You can start
with the basics.

335
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,743
Powder to keep them awake.

336
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,811
Pills to help them sleep.

337
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,850
Mad chronic.

338
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,546
The people you're
playing just don't know.

339
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:48,284
Well, well, well.
Lo and behold.

340
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,889
Speak up. Y'all want
something or what?

341
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,724
We'll have a taste.

342
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,726
You see me squishing
soft serve out my ass?

343
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,228
Girl, this ain't Carvel.

344
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,796
I'm thinking it should be.

345
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,733
It's like that?

346
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,602
You better believe.

347
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:09,706
Anyone coming around to knock me
off has to put me out for good.

348
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,242
How do we know your
shit's worth buying?

349
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,878
Because everybody
and their meemaw says so,

350
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,679
or you two
wouldn't be here.

351
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,792
How about an exchange?

352
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,774
So what's your last memory?

353
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,609
Nothing.

354
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,015
You ever wonder
where he is?

355
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,454
What makes you think
I don't know where he is?

356
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,789
What you
care for, Sweetie?

357
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,791
I just want to know.

358
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,031
There's nothing to know.

359
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,735
Do you remember him at all?

360
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,622
So, what, you ain't
got no tact or what?

361
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:36,392
Guess we're gonna have to teach
your ass social skills, too.

362
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,401
He played
this game with me.

363
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,739
Cut up a whole newspaper
and made these figurines.

364
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,413
We made a village of folks.

365
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,451
Named each one.

366
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,920
And their kids
and their grandparents.

367
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,960
We made shops and jobs
and stories for all of them.

368
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,808
Two days later he vanished.

369
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,620
Fuck, we're gonna need to roll
some more to come up out of this.

370
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:48,131
The amount that mine comes and goes,
he might as well be gone.

371
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,057
Drop this off
on your way to school.

372
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,992
No, I'm gonna be late.

373
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,730
Sweetie, Lefty's mom
just died.

374
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,498
Drop this shit
off on your way.

375
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,101
I didn't know.

376
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,038
Hey, if you didn't put up for all these
funerals and shit,

377
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,907
how do folks get buried?

378
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,542
For real, Ro.

379
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,650
You best chill
with that profit, kid.

380
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,152
<i>That'll catch up with you.</i>

381
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,154
<i>I'm just trying to eat.</i>

382
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,990
I'm not doing it
for more or for extra.

383
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,159
<i>Anyway, it's just
for right now.</i>

384
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,996
Except right now
keeps on changing.

385
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,343
<i># My mother spread glory</i>

386
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:48,584
<i># My father,
he still walks in sin</i>

387
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:55,925
<i># 'Cause I'm
trying to make it on in</i>

388
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:02,865
<i># I've come to
this gray land alone</i>

389
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:10,807
<i># I heard of
a city called Heaven</i>

390
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:16,813
<i># And I started to
make it back home #</i>

391
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,994
Take off your earrings.

392
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,898
And get your hair back.

393
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,970
I'll come from the left.

394
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,742
I'll come from the right.

395
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,077
And then how do you want to do this?
You want to have a sign?

396
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,713
A code, in case you get into trouble,
we know to stop.

397
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:51,948
And jump in?

398
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,651
I don't believe in no sign.

399
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,163
Oh, Sweetie.
You stupid little cunt.

400
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,800
What do you
turncoat twats want?

401
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,113
It's a multiple choice.
Circle A, B or C.

402
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,055
What the fuck is this?

403
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,890
You're unfamiliar with it?

404
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,326
If it was familiar,
why would I ask?

405
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:44,760
It's statistics.

406
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,001
Look, am I
suspended or what?

407
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,203
Fucking hell,
you're suspended.

408
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,138
So what's to discuss?

409
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,868
Okay, Sweet, keep your eye
on room six.

410
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,371
Anything wack happens,
just send me a blank text.

411
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,472
Cool.

412
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,546
Whoa. Who the fuck
is this little brat?

413
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:11,781
I'm with him.

414
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,049
Pest, get outside.

415
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,116
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not asking.

416
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,952
Shut the fuck up.
Okay.

417
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:19,288
No, no, everybody in this room
stays in the fucking room.

418
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,123
Stay still.

419
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,858
All right, get on with it.

420
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,462
I should be checking
you ain't up to shit.

421
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,530
Where's the money?

422
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,932
Enough!

423
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,901
I'm walking away.
Ro, don't walk away.

424
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,002
What?

425
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,103
I told you to shut up.

426
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:35,171
S, what're you saying?

427
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,839
We're already in this, Ro.

428
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,240
Hold still.

429
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:40,543
Let's just get what we came for.
It could help.

430
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,413
Get your fucking hands
off her.

431
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,148
Yeah.

432
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,249
Fuck!

433
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,256
We're in the wrong room.

434
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:57,460
I've never seen
y'all before in my life.

435
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,161
It's a mistake.

436
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,400
I apologize for walking in on y'all
hick-ass motherfuckers.

437
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,438
Shit.

438
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,973
Move it, now. Move it.

439
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,376
Hey! Come on, we got off on
the wrong foot.

440
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,394
Stop at a brown car.
What brown car?

441
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:32,561
We're gonna see
it in 25 seconds.

442
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,863
I don't see no brown car!

443
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,965
Stop screaming. Calm down.

444
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,953
Step back.

445
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,637
Shouldn't you be in school?

446
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,920
Bang! Bang!

447
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,055
Fucking kids.

448
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,259
I'll deal with you later.

449
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,672
Bang!

450
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,797
I gotta go.

451
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,066
So, what, you're just kicking
me to the curb now?

452
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:20,336
Free will ain't working,
is it? No.

453
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:22,238
Where you gotta be?

454
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,939
None of your business.

455
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,542
I don't wanna go with you.
I'm just wondering what the big secret is.

456
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,346
Good night, Sweetness.

457
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,553
Baby girl, me and you ain't
crossing that line, so...

458
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,157
Don't even try
that shit again.

459
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,263
Good night.

460
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,740
Don't turn me
into that guy.

461
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,711
Look, this never happened.

462
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:06,515
You're gonna go inside.
I'm gonna take off.

463
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,020
And this shit lays here.
Curbside.

464
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,088
Nothing to speak on.

465
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,801
Catch you later.

466
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,405
Later.

467
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,376
You're cheating, Ma.

468
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,145
Wait, no.

469
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:37,346
Hey.
Hey.

470
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:38,814
You wanna play?

471
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,190
Either get over it,
or go sulk upstairs.

472
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:51,093
I think you're gonna have
to pull another one.

473
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:55,564
No. Remember,
I still have options.

474
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,634
But not many.

475
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,271
You're right.

476
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,574
Oh.

477
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,243
Another one.

478
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,580
This is not fair.
You rigged this.

479
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,082
Here's your daddy's bones.

480
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,250
OLA: Okay. Here we go.

481
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,849
Come here.

482
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,384
Come here.

483
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,458
Here you go.

484
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,821
Hold that for a second.

485
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,834
Here.

486
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,555
Is that good?

487
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,023
Down a little.

488
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,741
Fuck!

489
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,540
All right.

490
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,706
Latonya.

491
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,083
Latonya!

492
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,592
I heard you used to
tell great stories.

493
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:31,433
Sweetie, your curiosity
will be the thing that saves you.

494
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,402
From what?

495
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:40,609
Dr. Stills ran clear across the room
to literally catch you.

496
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,580
Ola arrived cautious.

497
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,648
She needed persuading.

498
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:52,688
But you just flew out.

499
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,060
Would you let me
do your hair?

500
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:00,128
It's already done.

501
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,030
I could fix the ends.

502
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,500
Okay.

503
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,117
When we're ready.

504
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,285
What?

505
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,721
Nothing.

506
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,563
It's my serve?

507
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:35,797
Yeah, yeah. It's on.

508
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,234
I'm preoccupied.

509
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:41,069
Ro, that was so you.
Silence.

510
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,904
Your play's no good.

511
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,473
At least I can
hit the ball, right?

512
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,241
Yeah, for real. For real.

513
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,643
Like that one's gonna...
There.

514
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:48,844
Nice.

515
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:49,978
Get that.

516
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,913
That's how you serve,
right there.

517
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:54,683
Jojo, you ain't even playing.
Just standing there looking cute and shit.

518
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,056
It's like... 100%.
Yeah.

519
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,226
Come on, Jojo.

520
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,262
Oh...

521
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,344
Hey, Roland.

522
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,097
Oh, my God!

523
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,300
Oh, shit.

524
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,810
Stop it.

525
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,747
Stop it.

526
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:00,582
Stop.
Nah, he's gonna get up.

527
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,750
Stop.

528
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,712
Sweetie.

529
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,692
Ever wonder if you had someone
who caught Mommy,

530
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,194
or if someone
would've caught Daddy?

531
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,513
What's more bizarre?

532
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,382
That both Mommy and Daddy
have brothers named David John,

533
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,686
or that one was an Irish cop and
the other was an activist?

534
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,187
Stop changing the subject.

535
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,290
Say something real.

536
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,059
What?

537
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:26,528
Forget it. Just leave.

538
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,440
I'm sorry for the way
I used to beat on you.

539
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,448
I'm surprised you
never bring it up.

540
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,921
I didn't want us to
stop being friends.

541
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,261
Why bother?

542
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,231
How far do you plan to run?

543
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,401
Far enough not to live with
my folks with a baby.

544
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,169
Yeah?

545
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:10,305
That's exactly what I said.

546
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,492
You hungry?

547
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,099
She's just gonna
chew through that.

548
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:42,003
Yeah, well, she can chew it to bits.
Whatever makes her happy.

549
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,147
What was that for?

550
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,848
You know, it was owed.

551
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,785
Is your mother resting?

552
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,787
Yeah, she's still napping.

553
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:59,921
I guess she
didn't wake up while...

554
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,022
While what?

555
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,491
Nothing.

556
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,060
Where did
Sweetness run off to?

557
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,294
I don't know
where Sweetie went.

558
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,462
Ola.

559
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,930
Seriously, I don't know
where she went.

560
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:11,066
All right. Whatever.

561
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,200
I'm gonna fix some food.

562
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,239
Ready?

563
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,575
We're gonna leave in a bit.

564
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,047
I mean, shit, look at him.

565
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,557
Yo, I gotta get
Ol's car back.

566
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,993
We roll in an hour.

567
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,394
One hour.

568
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,502
Yo, you better
watch your homegirl.

569
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:57,672
It looks like she's on the loose over there.
What the fuck?

570
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,474
It's been a rough day.

571
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,231
Yo.

572
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,133
Close the door, man.

573
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,087
In or out?

574
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:49,624
Open door just
invites unwanteds.

575
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,695
Sure. Why not?

576
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,532
Whoo-hoo!

577
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,474
Whoa.

578
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,709
O'Hara.

579
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,479
Coleman.

580
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,549
No shit.

581
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,154
Which one of us
is worse off, man?

582
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,321
Um...

583
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,257
I don't know.

584
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,463
Take it slow,

585
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,398
one nostril at a time.

586
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,534
Nice ink.

587
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,443
Why is everybody
laughing at me?

588
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,512
Flip it.

589
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,447
Other side. Other side!

590
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,252
Excuse me, I wouldn't want to
offend the straw.

591
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,589
All right, go get 'em.

592
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,550
O'Hara.

593
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,118
What?

594
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,662
Okay.

595
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,730
Where are my keys?

596
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,701
I, uh...

597
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,903
I...

598
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,506
I, I, I...
Where are my fucking keys?

599
01:11:58,747 --> 01:11:59,847
You're lit.

600
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,887
I'll pay you back, Ola.
Every penny, okay.

601
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,589
Is it drivable?

602
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:21,436
Sweetness, that took
me two years to buy.

603
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:22,537
Can I just...

604
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,372
You're standing too close.

605
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,746
Was anyone seriously hurt?

606
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,362
Come on in.

607
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,630
Walk past me, fearless.

608
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,402
Yup, that's me.

609
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,447
Would be a favor.

610
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,260
God damn, yo.

611
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:20,695
How far is it, Jo?

612
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:23,398
Shorty be the one
knowing all the short cuts.

613
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,833
Oh, Shorty and
the short cuts. Get it?

614
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,569
What the fuck, man?

615
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,904
Ow! What the fuck?

616
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,572
Oh!

617
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,442
Don't want you
walking our streets.

618
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,377
Why're you hiding?

619
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,012
Yo!
Ow!

620
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,548
Come here, come here.

621
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,883
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

622
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:43,618
Fat, they're leaving him.

623
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,553
Come on.
Fuck.

624
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:47,255
Son of a bitch!

625
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,923
Dumb shit.
Dumb fuck.

626
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,692
Dumbass.

627
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,732
Get him down.

628
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,500
Get him down. Get him down.

629
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,986
Please help me. I'm sorry.

630
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,292
Not even.

631
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:27,662
If you were actually sorry,
you would've apologized first,

632
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:29,530
then asked for help.

633
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:37,472
What in the fuck did
we ever do to you, huh?

634
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:52,587
Believe that shit.

635
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:53,688
That sounds good to me.

636
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,798
You're standing in
the way like that.

637
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,932
You can't do it all.

638
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,702
Stop stalling
and throw the ball, man.

639
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,845
Come on, man.

640
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,436
If I hit it, I get some.
If I hit it, I get to hit it.

641
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,440
Yo, chill the fuck out.

642
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,519
Damn.

643
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,054
You finished yours already?

644
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,722
I was thirsty.

645
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,825
Yo, what's today?

646
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,394
Let's go to IHOP.

647
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:10,031
Sunday special, two plates will
feed all of us.

648
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,098
All of us.

649
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,834
Yeah, I know.
Look, look.

650
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:15,736
Shorty,
it's like that, for real?

651
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,406
You ain't coming with us?
Yo, Shorty.

652
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,608
I'll just duck my head in real quick.
Catch y'all later.

653
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:23,578
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

654
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,912
He's chicken shit, my man.

655
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,681
Baby.

656
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,150
Oh, don't joke about him.

657
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,188
Yo, how many hours
we've been up?

658
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,557
Like, 30 or some shit.

659
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:38,459
Yeah, 30.

660
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:39,860
All right. Yeah.

661
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:41,195
You feel me? All right.

662
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,900
You okay?

663
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:46,968
Yeah, I'm good.

664
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,136
Guys.

665
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,540
Put some pep in your step.

666
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:53,841
Put some pep in that step.

667
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,713
Yeah.

668
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,728
That's not right.
What do you mean?

669
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,962
How're you gonna tell
him that ain't right?

670
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,464
You're flipping my groove.

671
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:17,898
Yeah. Yo, I'm serious.

672
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,468
I'm fucked up a little bit,
but you fucked up my groove.

673
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,039
Bring it back!

674
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,721
This will help.

675
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,660
Wow, you're up.

676
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,567
Do you wanna say something?

677
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,576
No.

678
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,116
Good night.

679
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,735
You know, I didn't know that was you,
today, on the street.

680
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,204
I was...

681
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,978
Good night, Sweetness.
Go on, go to bed.

682
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,115
Yeah. Good night.

683
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,702
Good morning, Sweetie.

684
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:02,770
Morning.

685
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:04,171
You want something to eat?

686
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:06,841
Um... No, it's cool.
I'll get something at school.

687
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:07,908
Bit of a... Okay.

688
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,310
All right. Look, I got it.

689
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,162
What, you going somewhere?

690
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,181
Yeah.

691
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,818
Of course.

692
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,155
It's like, takes over...

693
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:55,723
That's funny.

694
01:19:55,725 --> 01:19:56,991
I'll see you
guys later, okay?

695
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:58,259
Where're you going?

696
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:00,661
I have to...
I gotta babysit.

697
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:01,762
All right, call us.

698
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:02,997
All right.

699
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:39,033
Stop! What are
you doing? What?

700
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:44,305
This is just bizarre. Seriously, what?
What do you want?

701
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:47,174
I'm worried about you.

702
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,676
It's too late for that.

703
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:51,178
Well, maybe,
but I'm here now.

704
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,346
You're a little late.

705
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,215
Look, Sweetie, I'm here now.

706
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:55,382
Hey!

707
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,828
Leave it. I'll do it.

708
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,296
I'm all right.

709
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,866
You can chill with Esther.
I'll do it.

710
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:14,435
It's fine.
I don't need any favors.

711
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:21,442
I'm not doing you a favor.
I ate just as much as you.

712
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,714
Won't your girls
be waiting for you?

713
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:29,917
They're not my girls,
and I'm not going out tonight.

714
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,289
Staying home
two nights in a row?

715
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,225
Did hell freeze over?

716
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,732
We'll be nearby if you need.

717
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:48,002
Yeah, 'cause doing dishes has always been
dangerous business for me.

718
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,118
You're up and at it.

719
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,920
Good morning to you.

720
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,221
Where's Esther?

721
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:42,990
Gordon walked
her to the market.

722
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,792
What's this old
thing doing out?

723
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,527
Ola asked to see it.

724
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,298
I made some eggs.

725
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,466
Great. Can I help?

726
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,134
Thank you, no.

727
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,506
Who wears that?

728
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,913
Were you at
a mental hospital?

729
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,496
They're good.

730
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,166
I know you love thyme.

731
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,435
I would have never thought
to put thyme in eggs.

732
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:32,172
I've done dill.
Everyone does dill.

733
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,440
Parsley.

734
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,919
As many questions
as it takes.

735
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,726
Morning, Mr. Coleman.

736
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:56,030
Sorry, too early. School doesn't start
for another half-hour.

737
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,432
Mr. Coleman, can I
talk to you for a minute?

738
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,036
Miss O'Hara.

739
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:05,139
Hello, is there a problem?

740
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:06,874
Um...

741
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:08,942
Yeah, you could say that.

742
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,312
Yeah.

743
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:13,647
Come on in.

744
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,061
So what can I do for you?

745
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,063
Can you think of any
place that will take me?

746
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,264
Take you where?

747
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:32,066
College.

748
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:34,568
Is there a problem
with your SATs?

749
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,971
None of my teachers
ever said anything about SATs.

750
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:44,912
I guess I kind of missed
the whole college bit.

751
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,581
Well, I can't
fabricate your transfer.

752
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,583
It won't end well
if I stay in my neighborhood.

753
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,353
Send me somewhere, anywhere.
Talk to someone.

754
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:56,090
You know, tell them
I want a chance. That's all.

755
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,191
You're a little late.

756
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,425
Coleman.

757
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:03,297
Okay. Um...

758
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,666
What interests you?

759
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,104
I don't know.

760
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:12,139
Well, what do you like?

761
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,376
People say I'm musical.

762
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,682
All right.

763
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,019
You're gonna need
to fill this out.

764
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,256
Bring it back to me
with an essay

765
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:31,258
about why a college
should accept you,

766
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,128
what you have to offer,
and no misspells.

767
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,463
I'll do what I can
from my end.

768
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,436
Appreciate it.

769
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,505
We'll work something out.

770
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,610
Hey.

771
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:52,079
I've got 30 minutes.

772
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:54,314
You wanna fill it out now?

773
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:59,219
Yeah. Cool.

774
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:07,661
What do you want?

775
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,365
It was wrong,
what I did to you.

776
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:13,500
Not interested.

777
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,768
Man, just hear me out.

778
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:19,139
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on.

779
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:20,507
Look, I'm so...

780
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,608
Dead it.

781
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,579
I'm so sorry.

782
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:35,055
Oh?

783
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:36,356
Fuck you.

784
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,410
Morning, Sweetie.

785
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,316
This again.

786
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,622
I thought so.

787
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,157
What's up?

788
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,458
What's up?

789
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,726
I'm like, y'all look so...

790
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:26,466
Yeah.

791
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,575
Come on.
Up and out, Sweetness.

792
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:48,355
All the coming,
going and vanishing,

793
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,657
and now you decide, for whatever reason,
that you want to stay,

794
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,292
and we're supposed to, what,

795
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:54,361
jump up and down and welcome you back
like nothing ever happened?

796
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:56,663
Right here, right this second,
I'm here.

797
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,198
Yeah, until you
change your mind

798
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,466
or we get to be
too much for you.

799
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:00,634
No, I won't change my mind.

800
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:01,768
You will.

801
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,170
I'm done with all that.

802
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:05,505
Yeah, for how long,
this time?

803
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,841
Sweetie, none of youse was the problem.
I was the problem.

804
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,543
So selfish. I was doing okay.

805
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:10,677
No, you weren't.

806
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:11,812
I was okay.

807
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:13,547
Sweetie, please.

808
01:29:13,549 --> 01:29:14,648
Come on.

809
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,450
I got over
needing to know you.

810
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,853
No, you didn't.

811
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:21,188
Would you please stop?
No.

812
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,190
Stop with the Good
Samaritan act, okay?

813
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,225
It's not a fucking act.

814
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:26,960
Yeah, well,
we'll see, won't we?

815
01:29:26,962 --> 01:29:29,463
Yeah, Sweetie, come on.
We will.

816
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,236
It's too far a walk for you.

817
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:10,771
No, not at all.

818
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:14,975
Does your hip hurt?

819
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,311
Nothing a little ice
won't fix.

820
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:26,453
We're at the halfway mark.

821
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,589
Yeah. What do you know?

822
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:42,736
So, are you coming tomorrow?

823
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,971
Tomorrow, yeah.
Yup. You bet.

824
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,715
Maybe I'll just meet you here.
You won't have to walk as far, you know.

825
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:18,738
Come on.
