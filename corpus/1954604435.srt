1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,566
M1 Command Center-Los Angeles

2
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,049
Patrol four.
Heading into the holding pen.

3
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,671
This is patrol four. I have uh

4
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,572
- visual breach on unit 103.
- Sir?

5
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,506
What do the monitors show?

6
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,008
The camera feed is offline.

7
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,205
We need visual confirmation.

8
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,451
There's no margin for error here.

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,488
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,947
Can you verify that the cell is empty?

11
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,648
Stand by.

12
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,569
Cell is empty.

13
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,279
- Stand by.
- Copy that.

14
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,115
Do we have a problem here?

15
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,688
Get Talbot down here ASAP. Now!

16
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,128
Stand your ground.
Back up is en route.

17
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,726
It's all for show.

18
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,964
Don't worry we've all gone through this.

19
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,432
Soon, we'll be sisters.

20
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,236
As you know this is pledge week

21
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,947
and these pathetic losers
are what's left of the even more

22
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,918
pathetic losers who rushed
our hallowed sorority,

23
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,921
Tau Omega Sigma.
We are the beginning and the end.

24
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,855
The beginning and the end.

25
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,724
These girls are the last three,

26
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,332
but to be one of us they
have to go through a final trial.

27
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,125
Girls.

28
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,275
Are you stupid bitches
or are you TOS wolves?

29
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,989
It's time for the wrestling match.
Grease those pigs up!

30
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,391
Yeah!

31
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,427
Can't hear you!

32
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,224
Strip!

33
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:24,140
The rules of the game are simple.
The first girl to get dunked loses.

34
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,286
May the best girl win!

35
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,995
Take her down!

36
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,079
Hey! There's cops outside!

37
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,122
Where are you guys going?
Wait. We're not done here.

38
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,088
How dare the cops
intrude on our little soiree.

39
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:43,153
You just destroyed
and five million dollar investment.

40
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,367
And I would do it again if I had to.
Sir.

41
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,805
Right answer.
There's a convoy.

42
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,707
Three more investments
are on their way here.

43
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,872
I need you to divert it.
While we assess our situation.

44
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,883
This whole facility
has been compromised.

45
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,483
Contact me when you get there.
I'll have more information for you.

46
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,727
Yes, sir.

47
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,939
- Can I help you, officers?
- We've had noise complaints.

48
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,673
Well, it's a party.
There's bound to be a little noise.

49
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,783
A little noise is okay. A lot is not.

50
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,714
Looks like there is alcohol
on the premises.

51
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,514
- Is everyone here over the age of 21?
- Gimmie a light.

52
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,787
Of course. We don't condone
underage drinking, officers.

53
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,157
Sure you don't. How old are you?

54
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,429
I'm 21.

55
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,930
How about you showing me
your drivers license.

56
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,899
Let's go.

57
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,034
HEY!

58
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,638
You stay right there.

59
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,874
Time to go.

60
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,983
There they are.

61
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,850
Pull along side.

62
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,311
- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Corporal Barnes.

63
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:47,019
- Corporal, do you know who I am?
- Sir, yes sir. Captain Talbot, sir.

64
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,715
Good.
There's been a change of plans.

65
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,912
Yes, sir.

66
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,030
Sir, I'm with the shipment.

67
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:01,362
Good. The closest safe location
has been determined to be here

68
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,870
the Elkwood detention facility.

69
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,165
It has a large underground garage

70
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:11,006
and it's run by a man
we can count on to be discrete.

71
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,841
I'll put a call into him.

72
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,004
You take the vehicles
over there and park.

73
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,108
I'll be in touch. LaFranco out.

74
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,856
Everything okay, boss?

75
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,988
Yeah, let's hope so.

76
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,431
Corporal Barnes
I need you to follow us.

77
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,499
Sir.

78
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,265
Move it!

79
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:00,724
Where the hell is my car?

80
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:01,884
Right there.

81
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,087
Oh crap, quick!

82
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,992
Hurry! Come on!

83
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,131
Are you sure?

84
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,672
Frenemies don't let frenemies
get behind the wheel.

85
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,974
What?

86
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,671
I said -are you okay to drive?

87
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,578
Jeeze. Yell much? Yeah,
I'm okay. Get your ass in the car.

88
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,050
Please, Pippi. Come on.

89
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,010
Come on!

90
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,149
Are you bitches ready to have fun?

91
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,323
Stay here.

92
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,596
Let's go now.

93
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,667
- Did I do that?
- Yeah, you did that.

94
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,312
Elkwood Detention Facility-Los Angeles ------------

95
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,899
Warden Lewis.

96
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,229
Yes?

97
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,433
Governor.

98
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,604
Yes, sir.

99
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,370
I see.

100
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,178
I understand.

101
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,072
Every courtesy will be extended.

102
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,116
Yes, sir.

103
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,015
- Armstrong?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,716
We'll be having some guests.

105
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,948
Okay.

106
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,752
Can you notify the front gate?

107
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,953
Right away, sir.

108
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,672
I'm here in front of the home where
Mr. MacMoran is currently being held -

109
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,869
after a major manhunt
that lasted several weeks. -

110
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,909
It is almost ten years to the day

111
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,507
when Mr. MacMoran had
committed the rape and murder

112
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:09,122
of almost half a dozen nurses
at a prominent assisted living facility.

113
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,151
At this hour it is not known
where Mr. MacMoran will be taken -

114
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,990
other than his reign of terror
is officially over. -

115
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,532
Well, well, well.

116
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,870
If it isn't the infamous Doyle MacMoran.

117
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,897
I guess if I was a young girl I'd be

118
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,000
quaking in my little bunny
slippers right about now.

119
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,208
But I'm not.

120
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,849
I'm a man.

121
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,748
I'm a grown man.

122
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,257
I guess you don't mess
with grown men too much, do you?

123
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,193
Too much of a challenge.

124
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,997
Ah, Doyle.

125
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,437
You know there's a lot
of families out there

126
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,736
that would rest easier
if you would just cooperate.

127
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,043
Might even take the death
penalty right off the table.

128
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:12,017
Think about it. Death. Life.

129
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,811
Life in prison ain't that bad.

130
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,520
Gives you lots of time
to reflect on what you've done.

131
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,521
Repent.
Hell, write a book I don't care.

132
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:31,365
All you have to do
is tell us where the bodies are buried.

133
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:40,845
You ask me for a favor
yet you can't even use the magic word.

134
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,716
The magic...?

135
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,948
You think I'm going to say please
and thank you to you, dirtbag?

136
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,955
You got another thing coming. You...

137
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,595
A good mother teaches every young
gentleman proper manners.

138
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,766
Your momma was no lady I see.

139
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,367
What about you, Doyle? Hmm?

140
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,102
Your momma teach you that?

141
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,370
Or was she too busy with one of your many
'uncles'?

142
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,120
I don't remember much about my momma.

143
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,057
Aside from bludgeoning her
in her bed when I was nine.

144
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,789
So why don't you just put me in the chair
and fry me up real good

145
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,832
because I ain't going
to tell you a damn thing.

146
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,598
Unless, of course,
you use the magic word.

147
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,902
Alright.

148
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,277
I guess we'll just have
to figure out another

149
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,379
way to loosen your tongue.

150
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,857
Tell Lewis I'll be back tomorrow.

151
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,723
Put that scumbag in
the smallest cell you've got.

152
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,432
You've got it, sir.

153
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,351
Can I help you?

154
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,918
Please inform
Warden Lewis that we are here.

155
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,184
And we are?

156
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,428
This is Stevens at the gate.
We have visitors.

157
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,899
Let them through.
Warden gave the go ahead.

158
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,971
I understand.

159
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,203
Just head towards your left.

160
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,514
Check it out.

161
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,857
Hey, ladies.

162
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:49,227
A pretty girl is like a melody
that haunts you night and day.

163
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,564
Turn around and shut up.

164
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,970
I don't care what he says.
I think you've got a beautiful voice.

165
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,046
Oh, you sweet man.

166
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:06,675
- Just like the strain of a happy refrain -
- Move it.

167
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,913
She'll come upon like a marathon

168
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,648
- and dance through your brain.
- Let's go.

169
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,692
Alright, ladies. Follow me.

170
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,758
Ladies.

171
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,869
Oh my god, it smells like pee.

172
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,515
Hey!

173
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,045
You like that?

174
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,396
Hey, cutie.

175
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,332
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah, and your breath really stinks.

176
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,336
You sure it's not your upper lip?

177
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,875
At least I don't need to wax the 'stash.

178
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,640
Inside please. Inside.

179
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,947
Let go. Let go of me.
Step inside.

180
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,355
No. No, no. Thank you. Let go.

181
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,651
Thank you.

182
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,382
Hey!

183
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,993
Look, are you causing trouble?

184
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,926
Because I really hate trouble.

185
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,332
I'm not causing any trouble.
No, no trouble here.

186
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,769
In fact, we're all just getting
to be really, really good pals.

187
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,968
Where's the trouble?
It's my favorite place to be.

188
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,013
Boom, Boom, Boom.

189
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,444
Oh, whatever.

190
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,980
Get off.

191
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,989
Leave her alone.

192
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,153
Oh yeah? Make me, pipsqueak.

193
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,533
Oh my god.

194
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,128
You feel so good.

195
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,238
Like a million little bunny rabbits.

196
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,576
- Yeah? You're a little bunny rabbit.
- You think so?

197
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,242
- Yes.
- I love bunny rabbits.

198
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,817
- Do you?
- Yes!

199
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,150
- Lets talk about bunny rabbits.
- OK!

200
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,849
- Do you have a fuzzy little tail?
- Sometimes, yeah.

201
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,052
Speaking of fuzzy little tails
have you met my friend?

202
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,298
I could have taken her.

203
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,695
Sure you could have.

204
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,998
I shouldn't even be here.

205
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,364
None of us should.

206
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,940
We didn't even do anything aside
from being in the car.

207
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,474
You're either a passenger or a driver.

208
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,976
Me? I prefer being behind the wheel.

209
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,322
Watch it!

210
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,094
There's hardly any room.

211
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,791
Well, be more careful.

212
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,971
I know you're all wondering
what's going on.

213
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,744
Truth is... I'm not sure.

214
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,842
So, we stay put for now.

215
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,647
I want you to temporarily disable
the security cameras and gear up.

216
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,685
We may be guests,

217
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,483
but we can't let anyone
interfere with our mission.

218
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,795
- Understood?
- YES, SIR!

219
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,430
Let's get to work then. File out.

220
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,828
Ignacio, come with me.

221
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,710
Looking good.

222
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,049
I presume you know what this is for.

223
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,085
If something happens.

224
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:51,763
Like the loss of cargo
then we are to... Boom.

225
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,973
Destroy all evidence including the trucks.

226
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:55,938
Good.

227
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,412
I need to make a call to the man.
Hold tight until I get back.

228
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,656
Damn it.

229
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,389
What?

230
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,758
You're kidding.

231
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,029
Do nothing. For now.

232
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,033
What else could possibly go wrong?

233
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,974
Sergeant, tonight we find ourselves
between a rock and a hard place.

234
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,567
I don't understand.

235
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,243
And that's a beautiful thing, trust me.

236
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:41,610
Besides this idiot we have some
other new friends under our roof tonight.

237
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,082
No less dangerous however.

238
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,323
I need you to send your best man
down below.

239
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,621
And he's to report only.

240
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,598
Do not engage.
Keep this in our circle of trust.

241
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:01,002
Are guests are connected at levels way
beyond our pay grade so tread lightly.

242
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,966
Yes, sir. I'll send Cooper down.

243
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,099
Alright.

244
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,085
Captain. -

245
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,347
The cargo is secure, sir.

246
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,157
Good. Very good. -

247
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,592
Unfortunately, we've had another breach. -

248
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,920
I don't know the extent of it yet, -

249
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:30,325
but as you're aware the smallest
of the small can be catastrophic. -

250
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,928
Talbot, I need you again. -

251
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:38,377
Get some of your men together.
You're going hunting. -

252
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,084
You're in charge while I'm gone.

253
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,384
Sir?

254
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,923
Something is out there that shouldn't be.

255
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,725
You know what to do
if worse comes to worse.

256
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,555
Boom.

257
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,588
Okay.

258
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,157
See you soon.

259
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,987
Hey, mom.
We're gonna get in the Jacuzzi.

260
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,427
Okay, baby. Don't stay too long.

261
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,327
You'll shrivel up like prunes.

262
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,842
Hey.

263
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,241
Hey.

264
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,984
- Feels so good.
- Yeah, it's great.

265
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,491
Does your mom know that-

266
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,327
Boys are coming over later!

267
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:13,003
She would have to be sober for
at least minute to even notice.

268
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,234
She's going be passed
out in twenty. You'll see.

269
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,502
You're so lucky.
I wish my mom was like that.

270
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,813
She's all up in my grill 24/7.

271
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,883
Really? I'm lucky?

272
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,846
Yeah, you are.

273
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,954
- Really?
- Yeah.

274
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,353
- Yeah?
- Oh, so lucky.

275
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,526
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was that?

276
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,160
I don't know.

277
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,709
This ain't nothing, pretty boy.

278
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,615
This is just a slight detour

279
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,985
before you get dropped in a big,
black hole for the rest of your life.

280
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,957
You ever wonder
what hell on Earth is like?

281
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,036
Not interested?.

282
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,076
Only in getting out of here.

283
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,623
You don't seem like the rah-rah type.

284
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,121
You finally noticed that, did you?

285
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,359
Sorry.

286
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,399
Sarcasm is my natural default.

287
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,069
You think?

288
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,034
I thought if I pushed myself
into doing something

289
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,682
from what I know then
maybe I'd grow as a person.

290
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,817
Yeah, I hear jail is good for that.

291
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,049
Evening, ladies.

292
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,073
Hey.

293
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:16,247
Isn't that the guy that killed all
those chicks about ten years ago?

294
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,479
Put them up.

295
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,254
I don't know.

296
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:24,759
Sort of looks like my cousin Bob.

297
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,957
Now there was a guy who could drink.

298
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,130
He was good people though.

299
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,151
Keep heading on the five
until you get to the two.

300
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,314
Copy that, sir.

301
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,733
You and you. Position yourself
by the prison entrance.

302
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,530
You sure those things can't escape?

303
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,539
It's reinforced steel.
No way they can get out.

304
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,236
They're tough,
but they ain't that tough. Let's go.

305
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,077
Sir,

306
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,349
the Hummer has left the grounds,
but there are four men left.

307
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,084
Fully armed with automatic weapons.

308
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:33,759
Sir, our guests seem to be heavily armed.
The count is four individuals.

309
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,301
Okay,
Sergeant I want you to talk to them,

310
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,833
but go slow.

311
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,671
Assess the situation and report back to me.

312
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,966
Affirmative.

313
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,475
I'll call you back after I've made contact.

314
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,845
Cooper, come with me.

315
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,688
Woah, woah, woah.

316
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,823
Lower your weapons.

317
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,556
Gentlemen, this is our house
and you are our guests.

318
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,027
Sorry, sir. We cannot allow you to pass.
Orders.

319
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,968
Okay, can I speak to
whoever is in charge then.

320
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,482
Can I help you?

321
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,413
I'm Sergeant Armstrong.

322
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:31,749
Warden Lewis sent me here to make sure
that you were being taken care of.

323
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,520
Well, you can tell the Warden that
we really appreciate his hospitality,

324
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,026
but we don't need anything at the moment.

325
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,601
Oh. Well, I'm glad.

326
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,260
And may I ask whom I'm speaking to.

327
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:50,935
Corporal Ignacio. Department of Internal
- Homeland Security.

328
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,077
Internal-Homeland Security?

329
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,414
What is this? Some kind of joke?

330
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,909
I don't want to appear rude,

331
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:05,383
but we are really going to need you
to leave this immediate area.

332
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,292
Okay, what exactly is in that truck?

333
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,125
That's a need to know situation, sir.

334
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,729
You need to get back inside.

335
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,964
Come with me. Come on! Let's go!

336
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,001
Cooper, I want you to go to Warden Lewis
and tell him exactly what's going on.

337
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,099
I'm going to check this out myself, okay?

338
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,108
Yes, sir.

339
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:33,412
You see one of those things
you don't hesitate to shoot it.

340
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,870
What are you carrying
in these vehicles, Corporal?

341
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,243
Is that an explosive device in our jail?

342
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,880
Do you know what that
would do down here?

343
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,642
Step away. Step away!

344
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,120
We need to call Talbot!

345
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,510
What is going on? I heard gunfire.

346
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,979
The cargo trucks...
there's something inside of them.

347
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,140
What do you mean? Inside.

348
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,513
I can't even say.
It's some kind of animal.

349
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,554
Code red. Code red.
I want a full assembly.

350
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,095
Lock down C Block!

351
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,127
Stun batons aren't
going to be enough, sir.

352
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,397
We're going to need
something more powerful.

353
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,134
Do I have to remind you
we're in a correction facility full of criminals?

354
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,700
We're not allowed anything more powerful.

355
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,970
Warden Lewis, come in.

356
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,175
We have a situation down here
I can't even begin to explain.

357
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,444
Oh Jesus! Come on!

358
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,056
Come on! Jesus please!

359
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,034
I don't feel so good.

360
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,609
Oh, gross.

361
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,148
She's coming down
off of whatever she was on.

362
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,814
Oh, great.

363
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,351
You don't have any idea what's going on?

364
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,554
None. All the cameras have been
disabled in that sector.

365
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,622
I'm coming down.

366
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,762
Get back to your post.

367
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,664
I need eyes on the situation.

368
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,064
Sir? We're assembled.
Shall we continue?

369
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,436
Proceed with caution.

370
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,976
We don't have any idea
what we're dealing with.

371
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,443
I'll be down in five.

372
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,309
10-4.

373
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,516
Okay, men. We're going to move out.

374
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:57,318
RUN! Run, run, run, run!
Close the doors.

375
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,391
- Close them!
- Sir? What the hell is going on?

376
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,697
What?

377
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,335
Is that? Is that a dinosaur?

378
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,042
Run! Go, go, go!

379
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,213
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

380
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,708
Go, go, go! Run, run, run! Go, go, go!

381
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,538
What's going on?

382
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,166
Hey!

383
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,674
What the -?

384
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,121
No, no.

385
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!

386
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,673
Let's go. Got to get out of here.

387
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,146
Shhh. Go, go, go. Come on, come on!

388
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,650
What the -?

389
00:38:56,201 --> 00:39:00,332
Now, normally
I would say that's a pretty good thing.

390
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,048
Nope.

391
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,518
Not a good thing. Not at all.

392
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,316
Something is wrong.

393
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,362
- Hi.
- Look, stay back.

394
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,358
Look, I'm serious!
It's for your own good.

395
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,128
- What about him?
- Hey, there.

396
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,830
Come on!

397
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,399
Okay.

398
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,012
What temperature do you think
bacon gets extra crispy?

399
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,991
Hey! Leave him alone.

400
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,996
- What?
- She said leave him alone.

401
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,871
What's the magic word?

402
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:11,999
Please.

403
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,312
That's the one.

404
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,879
The magic word
is let's get the hell out of here.

405
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,651
That's more like a magic sentence,

406
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,511
but she probably
wouldn't know the difference.

407
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:25,989
I wouldn't go out there if I were you.

408
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,954
Yeah? And why not?

409
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,891
Let's consider our situation for a moment.

410
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,896
A) We just heard a bunch of people
screaming and suddenly they are silent.

411
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:39,027
B) The doors happen to open all
by themselves and the only guard was this guy.

412
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,874
Who looked like
he was about to piss his pants.

413
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,108
Does that really make+
you want to go wandering the halls?

414
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,439
No, not really.

415
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,415
What do you think is going on?

416
00:40:55,987 --> 00:41:01,153
Whatever it is I say we get out of here before
anyone figures out what's going on.

417
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,928
No, no, no. Those are mine.

418
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,525
So, you're going play warden now?

419
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,735
No.

420
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,006
You want to go? There's the door.

421
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:18,971
Okay.

422
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,477
- Don't you think we should -
- Shut up, Sarah. Let her go if she wants.

423
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,415
Hi.

424
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,845
I want to go too.

425
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,949
- You want to go?
- We should go.

426
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,047
I vote yes. We go.

427
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,189
Let's go. Come on.

428
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,928
Hey, Manny? You coming?

429
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,963
Nah. I'm going to stay.

430
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,964
What are you talking about?
We're a team. Let's go!

431
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,897
Bear, I appreciate that,
but I'll be all right.

432
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,267
I just don't move so good anymore,
you know?

433
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,671
Enough with the chit-chat.

434
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,037
Let's leave the warden with his keys
and his play things.

435
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,009
Okay.

436
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,255
I'm sorry.

437
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,993
Enjoy your stay.

438
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,756
Too da loo, gals.

439
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,295
Bye, bye.

440
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:23,130
It's a beautiful day for a walk.
And a talk...

441
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,545
This is it.

442
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,460
Captain. -

443
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,995
We've tracked it down.

444
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,535
Its location is smack dab
in the middle of suburbia.

445
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:56,438
Do what you need to do.
Contain the situation. -

446
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,978
No matter what.
Look at it this way... it's just a test run. -

447
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,010
A what?

448
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,475
What does he mean by 'test run'?

449
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:13,484
Never mind that. You heard the man.
Come on. Let's move out.

450
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,124
Keep your eyes open.

451
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:36,844
Sir.

452
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,238
Shhh.

453
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,855
Cease fire! Cease fire!

454
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,428
Sir, what are
we going to do about Brown?

455
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,932
Tag him. The clean up crew will
take care of him.

456
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,594
I thought we were the clean up crew.

457
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,728
Jones is going to stay here
and tell them what happened.

458
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:34,736
Sir?

459
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,871
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open. Move!

460
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:37,737
Yes, sir.

461
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,872
We have to get it out of here.
It's too populated.

462
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,037
Wait. Lead it away? How do you know
it's going to follow us?

463
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,946
It's got the scent of us now.
You drive.

464
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,952
I'm going to blast that son
of a bitch straight back to the stone age.

465
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,382
Oh, god.

466
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,517
I can only imagine what he is
going to do to those little cherries.

467
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:03,660
What was that?

468
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,424
I'm really freaking out right about now.

469
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:09,765
Just keep moving.

470
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,963
The important thing is that we get out of here
before they realize we're loose.

471
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,832
Then it's just you and me.

472
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,679
Oh, come on. You got to have heard that.

473
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,411
Maybe we should go back.

474
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,449
No. The hell with that. We just keep -

475
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,513
Maybe you're right.

476
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,681
Come on, come on. Move. MOVE!

477
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,555
Oh my god. What do we do?

478
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,396
I vote for being a quiet as possible.

479
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,001
We need some kind of weapon.

480
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:46,902
I got this.

481
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,200
Yeah, and you already used
it on our friend here.

482
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,139
One cartridge. One shot.

483
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,575
Good job.

484
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,838
Yeah, well I've got this.

485
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,005
Has anyone tried the pay phone?

486
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:58,412
Well?

487
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,951
I guess I have to do everything myself.

488
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,545
Open the door.

489
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,126
Go ahead.

490
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,081
- No!
- Come on. Shhh.

491
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,950
Wait, wait!

492
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,393
Close the door!

493
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,500
Lock it!

494
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,660
Oh my god.

495
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,633
Woah! WOAH! Jesus!

496
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,634
Did I do it?

497
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,772
Oh my god. Thank you.

498
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,880
I swear I'd give up drinking for life.

499
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,612
Oh, god. Don't say that!

500
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,585
Hello?

501
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:56,827
Hello? Is anyone there?
Can you hear me?

502
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,070
- Hello?
- Yes, we can hear you.

503
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,030
Good.

504
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:04,631
I'm Warden Lewis. I run this facility.

505
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,235
What's your name?

506
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,479
Pippi.

507
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,013
Pippi. Well,
it's very nice to meet you, Pippi.

508
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,516
I'm sorry it's under such
bizarre circumstances.

509
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,086
No kidding.

510
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,017
This is some kind of experiment, right?

511
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,522
You people drugged us
and now you're trying

512
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,957
to see how we react
to extreme hallucinations.

513
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,293
I wish I could say that was true.

514
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,965
There are no such thing
as dinosaurs anymore.

515
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:30,763
Gimmie that.

516
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,860
That was my general impression as well.

517
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,767
But if we're all hallucinating then

518
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,237
I guess we're having
the same shared experience.

519
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,999
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm here in the main control room

520
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,568
and some damage has
been done during the attack

521
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,081
and I'm unable to get in contact
with the outside world,

522
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:51,050
but not to worry someone will be
coming along looking for us sooner or later.

523
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,925
In the meantime you just hang tight.
Are you safe there where you are?

524
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:59,186
Yes. The doors are locked
and those things weren't able to get in.

525
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,366
Good. How many people
are there with you?

526
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:07,630
Five. Plus one of your men.
He's been... hurt.

527
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:11,170
Hurt? How? How bad?

528
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,069
Who is it?
Can you see the name plate?

529
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,604
Armstrong. He's okay.

530
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,212
One of the prisoners attacked
him with a taser.

531
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,712
That's why he's unconscious.

532
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:27,052
Okay. Okay. Well,
he should have a set of keys on him.

533
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,889
Yeah, we got those.
That's why they weren't able to get in.

534
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,553
Alright, good. You just hang tight.

535
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,631
Alright? I'll see what
I can do to get us out of here.

536
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,391
Call if anything comes up.

537
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,006
Hey!

538
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,952
Oh my god. I'm going to kill
that slut for selling me bad X.

539
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,525
I swear I just saw dinosaurs back there.

540
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,653
Oh, come on. You did see a dinosaur.

541
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,957
What are you talking about?
Stop messing with me.

542
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,962
I'm not messing with you.

543
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,531
Would you stop pushing.
I don't feel good. I need to rest.

544
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,037
We have to keep moving.

545
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:24,835
If we don't we could end up as little
pieces of meat inside a dinosaur's stomach.

546
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,476
Do you want that?

547
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,970
- Okay. Just give me a second.
- We don't have a second.

548
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,280
Shh. Shh.

549
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,877
Hear that?

550
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,286
That's not a bad trip, okay?

551
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:46,592
That is death and it's about to knock
on our back door so please can we go now?

552
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:52,331
NO!

553
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,669
Please.

554
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:57,273
For god sakes will you just please
go with me now.

555
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:03,813
Okay? Walk. Walk. This way.
Come on. Please, please let's go.

556
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,747
Fine. You're on your own.

557
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:31,674
Pretty bunny.

558
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,960
So, the plan is just to sit here and
hope someone comes to our rescue?

559
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:57,532
Sounds reasonable to me.
What else can we do?

560
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:00,970
What are you doing?

561
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:04,075
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking charge.

562
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:06,573
Damn it.

563
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,003
Damn it.

564
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,049
This place was built old school.

565
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,618
Stone foundation
is messing with the signal.

566
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:18,045
He said -

567
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,647
I heard what he said Sarah.
Now shut it.

568
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,287
Ha.

569
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,123
What are you going to do?
Take our picture and post it online?

570
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:31,566
No, idiot.

571
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,829
There's still a payphone out there.
Remember?

572
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,734
If it works we can let the warden know.

573
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,341
Yeah? How's that going to help?

574
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,634
Those are dinosaurs.

575
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,371
This is a prison.

576
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:45,077
I'd say we're all a little out
of our element right now.

577
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,239
Whatever.

578
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,285
You can go back to doing nothing
if you want to.

579
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,852
Sarah, come here.

580
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,683
I said come here.

581
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,927
Are you a wolf or are you a little bitch?

582
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,028
A wolf?

583
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,668
I want you to use this
to peek down the hall.

584
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,642
When the coast is clear
I'm going to use the phone.

585
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,280
Me?

586
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:23,079
Yes. You. Unlock it.

587
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,547
You sure you want to do this?

588
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,092
I think we all remember very
well what happened last time.

589
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:35,632
That's why when Sarah says the coast
is clear you're going to lock that door.

590
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,928
Oh, I'm going to do that am I?

591
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,001
Yes.

592
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,965
Sarah, you don't have
to do everything she tells you.

593
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,404
Yes, she does.

594
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,344
There you go.

595
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:45,234
If I even see a hint of a dinosaur
I'm going to personally feed you to it.

596
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,082
Good job. I knew you could both do it.

597
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:01,943
Catch.

598
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,088
Good job, idiot.

599
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,192
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was
your job to use the phone.

600
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:14,194
Come on. I just did my job.
She did hers. Now it's your turn.

601
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,899
Don't look at me. Go on.
How hard can it be?

602
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,933
I just locked the door.

603
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,471
Does anyone have more quarters?

604
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,436
We're not all as skilled as you.

605
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,181
Hiding quarters where the sun don't shine.

606
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,114
Fine.

607
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:47,961
Got it.

608
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,967
Great. It's not even a pay phone.

609
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,033
Who has a credit card in a prison?

610
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,445
No dial tone.

611
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,920
It's in there. It's coming!

612
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:15,059
- Oh my god, it's coming in here. Run!
- Go, go, go!

613
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:17,925
Come on.

614
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:19,825
Oh my god.

615
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,691
I need more.

616
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,430
It's okay. It's okay.

617
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,048
Jesus!

618
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,483
Come on, I need more.

619
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,392
It's okay, it's okay.

620
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,097
Be careful. We need to apply pressure.

621
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,040
Quick! In here, in here. Come on.

622
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,311
Yeah.

623
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,719
Come on in.
You must be one of LaFranco's men.

624
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,760
- How did you know?
- This is my house.

625
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,420
It's my business to know.

626
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:32,728
I was ordered to let you people in here
and now a lot of good men are dead.

627
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,462
It would be nice to know why.

628
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,568
I can't tell you.

629
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:40,876
Understand?

630
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,104
Orders.

631
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,182
I lost men as well.

632
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,453
Things have gotten
really complicated. Get it?

633
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:56,285
Okay. You can't or won't tell me.
Fine.

634
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:59,795
At least you can help me
rescue a few young girls.

635
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,637
Hello? Are you still there?

636
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:12,141
Uh. Yeah, yeah we're here,
but not for much longer.

637
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:13,639
Is this Pippi?

638
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,680
No, it's Sarah.
We're helping out a friend.

639
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,872
Please, please get here as soon as you can.

640
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,713
If you don't hurry I think she's going to die.

641
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,944
All right just stay calm.

642
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,950
I think I figured out a way
to get you guys out of there.

643
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,692
Now, we're going to lure the creatures

644
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:33,621
out of the area and trap
them in the cell blocks.

645
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,925
- Trap them? How?
- Now,

646
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,331
I've restored the electrical system
here in the control room,

647
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:39,969
but who knows how long it will hold up.

648
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,834
How will we know the dinosaurs are gone?

649
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,065
I'll be able to see it in the monitors.

650
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:47,237
All right? Ready?

651
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,114
Yes.

652
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,647
All right.

653
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,883
How many of those things are there?

654
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,587
Three.
Let's do it before I change my mind.

655
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,760
All right. Down the hall and to the left.

656
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:04,589
Got it.

657
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:08,497
You don't see anything
in those monitors of yours?

658
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:09,727
Nope.

659
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,964
- Nope. Let's do it.
- Got it.

660
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:15,869
Wait.

661
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,608
I don't want to leave you unprotected.

662
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,510
Just in case.

663
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,950
All right.

664
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:34,884
One.

665
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:38,722
Two.

666
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,102
Three! Go, go, go!

667
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,045
Okay, I'm here.

668
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,947
- Light it up!
- Got it.

669
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:14,087
HEY! YEAH, COME ON YOU SONS
OF BITCHES! OVER HERE!

670
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,027
HEY! COME ON!

671
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,075
Come on, come on!

672
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,481
RIGHT HERE!
I'M HERE! COME GET SOME!

673
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,116
COME GET SOME!

674
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,091
One dinosaur.

675
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,128
Two dinosaurs.

676
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,489
Where the hell is the third one?

677
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:58,169
Go away, go away. Bad dinosaur.
Go away, go away, go away.

678
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:06,241
It's night time and the dinosaurs
are sleeping and they

679
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:10,478
don't want to eat me
because I don't taste nice.

680
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,191
Go away. Go away!

681
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:25,001
Two coming your way, buddy.

682
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:25,964
They're here.

683
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:36,977
HEY!

684
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:42,212
Come get some! Yeah,
over here! Come get some.

685
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:48,323
Come get some right here!
Oh, you can't see me?

686
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:49,652
Right here!

687
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,659
Come get some!

688
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,802
Go, go, go!

689
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,132
Come on!

690
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,377
Come on, come on, come on.

691
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,446
You need to go straight down the hall
and then turn to the right.

692
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,478
Hurry!

693
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,460
Now what?

694
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,892
Go up the ramp.

695
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:25,927
This way.

696
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,929
Shut up! The damn things will hear you.

697
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,500
Leave her alone.

698
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,795
How's it going in there?

699
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,273
Can you hurry up with those doors?

700
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:48,748
Hey! Damn it. Pippi! Stop!

701
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:52,289
Don't proceed any further! Stay put.
Do you hear me? Stay put!

702
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,571
There's one roaming right
above our position.

703
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,234
I can see it.

704
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,372
What do we do now?

705
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:55,811
All right.

706
01:05:56,052 --> 01:06:00,990
I'm going to try and bring it back
into the main hall away from you.

707
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:05,957
You go back up the ramp and then you turn
the corner and you keep going down.

708
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,529
Eventually you'll get to
the underground garage.

709
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:10,328
There will be weapons there.

710
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,167
Weapons?

711
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:18,868
Yes, we had some visitors earlier
in the evening and they came armed.

712
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,907
What about our wounded?

713
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,407
Just leave them there.

714
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:24,848
They'll be safe. We have to move fast.

715
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,243
Now you have the keys.

716
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:30,217
All right? Now when you get out
go and get some help.

717
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,187
No, you can't leave me here.

718
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,884
Not with those things running around.

719
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,293
This will be the safest place for you, Stephanie.
You heard the Warden.

720
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,799
We need to move fast and you're injured.

721
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,300
No.

722
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,428
You need to stay still.
It'll help with the blood loss.

723
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:51,268
I'll be okay. I want to go with you.

724
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,442
I'll stay with you, Steph.

725
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,272
Sarah, you're coming with us.

726
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:04,719
I can't leave my wolf sister.
Beginning and the end.

727
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:09,452
I'll stay with her.

728
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:14,990
Look, before I crawled into the bottle
I was a real person.

729
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,091
This is my last chance
to be a real person again.

730
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:22,061
But I'm getting old and
can't move so fast.

731
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,474
You young people have to get moving
so come on... get out of here!

732
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:40,290
Thank you.

733
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,192
What about the gimpy guard?

734
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:51,525
This gimp is just fine. I can walk.

735
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,639
Okay, Warden. We're ready.

736
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,087
Here it comes.

737
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:29,234
Hold it steady.

738
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,105
Captain!

739
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:42,652
Captain, you need to see this.

740
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,362
What the hell is going on here?

741
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,869
Okay. Come on, little buddy.

742
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,632
Come on.

743
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:13,575
Just stay right there. Right there.

744
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,488
All right, go, go!

745
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:30,500
- Come on!
- Shut it, shorty.

746
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,572
RUN!

747
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,620
Come on!

748
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,558
Hurry!

749
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:58,721
I'm trying. I don't know which one.

750
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,161
Go, go!

751
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:10,664
OPEN IT! OPEN THE DOOR!

752
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:23,279
Come on. You're not going
to let me die like this, are you?

753
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,412
Eaten by a friggin dinosaur.

754
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,683
I've known men like you.

755
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:37,356
Small on the inside and no matter how many
people they hurt they always stay that small.

756
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,108
I'll tell you what.

757
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:53,247
You let me in there or I'm going
to beat that guard to death.

758
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,485
You understand what I'm telling you?

759
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,612
You want his blood on your hands?

760
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,552
This what you want? Huh?

761
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,087
No! Don't!

762
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:05,993
Don't!

763
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,429
Get out of here! I'll be fine.

764
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,501
No, he won't.
Open that door right now.

765
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,841
Go, go!

766
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,701
Get out of there, Armstrong!

767
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,425
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

768
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,961
Come on.

769
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:51,663
Come on.

770
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,106
Come on. Come on.

771
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,624
Good luck, buddy.

772
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,626
Wait!

773
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,436
WAIT!

774
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,453
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

775
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,061
Which way?

776
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,525
The Warden says
there's weapons in the garage.

777
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,036
Let me ask to make sure.

778
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:04,966
Warden Lewis are you there?

779
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,107
Warden Lewis?

780
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,747
Something must have happened.
All the gunfire.

781
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,321
The explosion.

782
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:21,986
- Let's go.
- Okay.

783
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,051
We keep on this trajectory we're going
to head straight into the city, sir.

784
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,960
I know that. Keep going!

785
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,188
There's so many of them, sir.

786
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:30,322
Keep going!

787
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,997
I see a path there.
I think they're clearing out.

788
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:37,003
Oh my god!

789
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:51,418
GO!

790
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:56,352
Is it coming?

791
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,594
Shh. Let me listen.

792
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:17,375
Is it there? We need to go.

793
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:51,079
What is that?

794
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:52,377
I don't know.

795
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:15,963
Hey! What exactly do you think
you're doing, pal?

796
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:17,731
Them girls, are mine.

797
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:23,570
Hey, where you going, buddy?

798
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:27,749
We ain't finished here.
Not by a long shot.

799
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:49,003
Here kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.

800
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,848
Dang! You are one tough son of a bitch.

801
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,892
Ha! 2 and 0.

802
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,894
Get out of the truck.

803
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,102
Monster's dead.

804
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,871
- OUT!
- You sure?

805
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,838
From my count there's still one left.

806
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,836
Get out.

807
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:35,009
Get out!

808
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,720
I'm here.

809
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:42,652
You are here.

810
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:44,716
And?

811
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:47,491
Get out.

812
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,098
There's no one else.

813
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,500
I'm the only one.

814
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,163
Oh, you're good pipsqueak,

815
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,003
but I know you're lying.

816
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,439
I'm not. I swear.

817
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:07,047
Oh. Then you won't mind if I light up
the back of this truck with a grenade.

818
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08,707
No! Don't!

819
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:16,319
It wasn't a real grenade, Sarah.

820
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,994
He was lying.

821
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,292
Maybe so.

822
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,731
But if I had thrown it in there
it would have still been very unpleasant.

823
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:28,201
Where you two little wolflings going?

824
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:31,135
Come here. Give daddy wolf some love.

825
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,766
Oh, gross.

826
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:35,301
Why can't you just leave us alone?

827
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:39,241
Oh, come on. All I want is a kiss.

828
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:41,884
From each of you.

829
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,480
I think that's the least you can do

830
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,180
after I rescued you from that big,

831
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:49,484
bad monster.

832
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:52,653
A kiss? Yeah, right.

833
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,026
I swear. Just one kiss.

834
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,198
Honest.

835
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,332
A regular honest Abe you are.

836
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:04,835
I also say please and thank you
when it's appropriate.

837
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,204
Honey attracts flies
a lot more than vinegar.

838
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:12,704
You might be small, but you're full of vinegar.

839
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,750
Yeah? That's because I hate flies.

840
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,644
When they cross my path
I enjoy picking off their wings.

841
01:19:19,722 --> 01:19:21,281
Buzz. Buzz.

842
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:30,032
Oh, I like your spunk, girl. I really do.

843
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,494
But my wings got pulled off a long time ago.

844
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,568
Is there one behind me?

845
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,247
Because if you take off when I turn

846
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,546
it's not that hard to catch you and
when I do I'm going to be very

847
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,417
unhappy with my little wolflings.

848
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,959
Okay, then.

849
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,394
We're wolves, little man.
And don't you forget it.

850
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,237
What was that?

851
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:21,813
I don't know, but we should probably
get the hell out of here.

852
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,316
Come on!

853
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:28,981
I just sent two of
your buddies straight to hell.

854
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,554
I don't see why you can't join them.

855
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,389
You're here.

856
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,403
You alone?

857
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:26,131
The T-rex quarter is loose.
You know about that?

858
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,574
My men are all dead.

859
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,109
We encountered a massive pack
of Velociraptors heading towards the city.

860
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,013
Yeah.

861
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,951
I'm aware.

862
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:44,089
What the hell is going on, LaFranco?

863
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:54,603
Well, you might say this is the culmination
to all of my hopes and dreams.

864
01:22:56,205 --> 01:22:59,039
The beasties just didn't get loose.

865
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:01,435
I set them free.

866
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:08,313
I told you before,
'this was just a test run.'

867
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:15,657
In this day and age if you want to be heard
you have to make a really big statement.

868
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:25,957
All my pets are on the loose and I'm going
to ride into town and save the day.

869
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:34,068
It's a first step on a White House run.

870
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:39,675
Everyone is desperate for a hero

871
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:45,550
and I am going to be that hero.

872
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:51,552
And you too. If you join me.

873
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,694
So,

874
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:02,738
Talbot what's it going to be, huh?

875
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,270
Are you with me?

876
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,277
Or against me?

877
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:15,215
With or against.

878
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,919
Heroes, huh?

879
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,920
Oh yeah. Heroes.

880
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:40,975
Against. Ooh-rah.

881
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,061
Oh my god.

882
01:26:22,144 --> 01:26:25,637
Who would have thought that a jail
