1
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,424
It's hard to believe I was a kid here.

2
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:34,866
This town looks a lot different.

3
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,631
How did it get this way?

4
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,400
I don't know,

5
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,636
but it turns my stomach
to look at this place.

6
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:49,775
It's painful to remember,

7
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:54,776
but maybe that's why I need
to walk these streets one last time.

8
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,328
The story of the summer
I unwillingly grew up...

9
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:07,158
Philip! Hey, Philip!

10
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,159
The summer I learned to hate...

11
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,537
- What's wrong?
- Who's that?

12
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,807
A summer set in motion by one man.

13
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,015
Hey, Philip, you don't know him.

14
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,780
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want a drag?

15
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,849
My name is Eli Cottonmouth.

16
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,491
You folks sure have
a beautiful little town here.

17
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,924
I'd like to show you something
if you'd let me.

18
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,596
This way.

19
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,834
"Beautiful little town. "

20
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,770
This Eli Cottonmouth,

21
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,404
he was one of those
snake-oil salesmen.

22
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,505
He was the Music Man.

23
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:02,879
Whoa.

24
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,941
But it wasn't "76 Trombones"

25
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,749
or a cure-all ointment that day.

26
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:11,382
Eli's specialty was model building.

27
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,054
I can't possibly tell you
the way this single model

28
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,759
captured everyone's imaginations

29
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,462
in a way that was almost magic.

30
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:26,768
Eli Cottonmouth was dangerous

31
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:30,970
because he was a man who could
show you places you've never been.

32
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:35,414
As we all wandered
around this tiny carnival,

33
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:38,713
Eli kept silent.

34
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:42,210
He let everyone who wanted to
have their fair share of look-see.

35
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,858
Then taking his cue, he simply said:

36
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:59,861
You folks sure have
a beautiful little town here.

37
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,800
May I have a show of hands, please?

38
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:07,935
Unanimous.

39
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:11,212
And so it came to pass
that Eli Cottonmouth

40
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,412
was going to stay around
for a while,

41
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,479
and the town was
going to have a new centerpiece

42
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:21,483
for the town's highly-anticipated
bisesquicentennial celebration.

43
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:26,056
That's 250 years in a tiny model,

44
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,863
a model I've never even seen.

45
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:33,430
Up until then, the only thing
I ever lost sleep over

46
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:35,498
were childish daydreams

47
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,807
and the Two-Legged Alligator Man.

48
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,712
This summer
was gonna be different.

49
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,284
Foul ball!

50
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:20,218
- Hey.
- You did such a good job.

51
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:32,529
Dude, if you turn around right now,
you can see Camille.

52
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:35,363
- That's my babysitter.
- But you like her.

53
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:39,804
- She likes your brother.
- Brock? Nah.

54
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,639
She's looking
at him right now.

55
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,974
- Nah.
- What's up, fellas?

56
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,139
- Hey, Pastor Salem.
- How's it going?

57
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,581
- Good.
- All right, man. Great game.

58
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,949
- Thank you.
- Talk to you soon. See all you guys.

59
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,419
- You guys ready to scoot?
- Yep.

60
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,728
Well, howdy, boys.
How was the game?

61
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,664
Good. We won.

62
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,792
Brock said he'd buy us
milkshakes if we did.

63
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,029
Oh!

64
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,937
No, I said I'd buy the milkshakes
if we lost, but whatever.

65
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,873
Well, that's real nice of you, Brock.

66
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,342
So what'll you have?

67
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,312
I'll have a double chocolate
with plenty of whipped cream, please.

68
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,315
I'll have double vanilla,
plenty of strawberry syrup.

69
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,510
Smart move.

70
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:28,646
Go ahead, get whatever
you want, man. My treat.

71
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,848
- Um...
- Here you go.

72
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,517
- Thanks. Mint chocolate chip...
- Mint chocolate chip...

73
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,322
- caramel topping...
- caramel topping...

74
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,884
sprinkles, and whipped cream, please.

75
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,988
Comin' right up.

76
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,826
Thanks.

77
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,503
Hey, guys, wait up.

78
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:01,844
- I'm spending the night at Jackson's.
- Does Mom know?

79
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,152
- Yeah, she said I could.
- Awesome.

80
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,988
Hey, Jackson, I need you

81
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:09,790
to take care of my brother tonight...

82
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:21,500
What are you doing?
Come on, buddy, let's go.

83
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,975
Come on, let's go.

84
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,568
- I'll race you.
- Let's race.

85
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,349
Hey, Camille.

86
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:18,956
Camille?

87
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,792
Camille?

88
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:29,539
Hey, Jackson, Philip. Dinner will be
ready in a couple of minutes, okay?

89
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,099
What are we having?

90
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:33,408
Yeah, it was fun!

91
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,330
Hey, shorty, it's not too loud.

92
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:58,235
I know.

93
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:01,206
- You know I like to feel it.
- I know.

94
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,912
- What did she fix?
- I really don't know.

95
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,507
Smells, uh...
creative.

96
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,689
Jackson.

97
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,522
Sorry.

98
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,524
"... one must remember

99
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:08,000
that men do not physically
live past this life.

100
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,993
In order to protect
the later generations,

101
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:16,668
man must equip his youth
with the knowledge

102
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,678
from his own experiences,

103
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,237
and to not impose its errors

104
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:25,648
too rigidly on its youth.

105
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:30,418
Man must pass on
the aggregated knowledge

106
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,357
to his next generation
with the reminder... "

107
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,293
- Same old same old.
- "... there is much more to learn

108
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,129
than what has been gathered
from his own experiences... "

109
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:46,435
Have you ever heard the one about the
Two-Legged Alligator Man?

110
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:50,101
- I don't think so.
- How long have you been in this town?

111
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:53,670
- It's only the scariest thing ever.
- Tell me.

112
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,848
50 years ago,
there was an old witch.

113
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,716
She lived just
outside of the town,

114
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,914
right next to the water
in an old shack.

115
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:06,652
She laid eggs, but mostly
she laid eggs for food.

116
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:10,219
But then one day one of the eggs
rolled off the pile

117
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,730
and into the water.

118
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,528
The witch didn't notice it
until one year later, when

119
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:18,196
the full-grown Two-Legged Alligator Man
returned and ate her!

120
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:27,772
Okay, Marty, you've just
eaten a witch now, all right?

121
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:32,341
But it's not enough, is it?
No, you're still hungry.

122
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:33,647
Hungry for what?

123
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,621
Linda, show him what he's hungry for!

124
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:41,819
It's magnificent! Keep it inside,
though. Keep it inside.

125
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:46,025
- Hey, Marty?
- What?

126
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,862
Over there, on the island!

127
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,027
- Very frightening, isn't it?
- Cripes, it's him!

128
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,832
Are we rolling on this?

129
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,830
Is it true?

130
00:14:54,874 --> 00:15:00,210
Yes, I believe he's
out there somewhere.

131
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:04,774
Maybe in some way he's
protecting our shore,

132
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,617
dedicated to the fine people
of this town.

133
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:11,316
I believe it.

134
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,291
Maybe that makes it real.

135
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,055
Total poppycock.

136
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:18,427
Is that a band? I think I...
yeah, I heard of them. A band.

137
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,159
Everybody else thinks so.

138
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,667
Some people say he
roams the streets late at night,

139
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:23,691
looking for...

140
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,832
What was that?

141
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:31,468
looking for food...
going from house to house

142
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,343
looking for kids
who sneak out at night.

143
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,712
- Like us.
- Like us.

144
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,622
I told you he was taking
picture earlier.

145
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,319
He's weird.

146
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,658
- Yeah. Let's follow him.
- Okay.

147
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,878
Seems like I'm the center of attention
even in the middle of the night.

148
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,816
- We didn't mean to.
- Yeah, we didn't know

149
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,843
- you were out here taking pictures.
- You didn't know?

150
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,719
What are you doing?

151
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:55,716
I'm taking pictures for visual
reference. I'm building a model.

152
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,993
- I heard about that.
- Did you hear about it?

153
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,125
You know, they make
smaller cameras than that.

154
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,830
Yeah, they do. I know.

155
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,667
It's just that I like to
do my own development.

156
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:10,107
I see it sort of
as a process, you know?

157
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:14,442
This old thing
just feels good in my hands.

158
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,371
Want to try it?

159
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:28,388
- Look at this.
- How would you boys

160
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,554
- like to do me a favor?
- What?

161
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:34,225
Well, the people in this town

162
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,666
must think I'm pretty strange.
They keep looking at me

163
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,863
like I got three eyes,

164
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,600
Which I don't.

165
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,607
You know, I think somebody

166
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,579
who was good at sneaking around

167
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,082
could probably take
a lot better pictures than me.

168
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:55,349
I need pictures of details,
details.

169
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,357
You know about details, right?
Details?

170
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,258
- Details, like...
- Yeah.

171
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:06,026
This model that I am gonna make
is gonna be the spitting image.

172
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,830
And what I would do is
I would make sure that you

173
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,102
- had film whenever you wanted it.
- Okay.

174
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,632
I just want you to
keep taking pictures...

175
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:22,136
people, places, and things.

176
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,741
- Okay.
- Think you can figure out how it works?

177
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,773
Let me show you something.

178
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:29,254
Let me show you how it works.

179
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,122
Jeez, Phil, careful.
You almost dropped it.

180
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,219
Here, take it.

181
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,425
It's heavy.

182
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:41,524
What should we
take pictures of tomorrow?

183
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:45,936
I don't know. Everything.

184
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,131
It was our first spadeful of dirt

185
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,304
in a summer of searching
for buried treasure.

186
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:56,837
Eli had us wide-eyed, you know?

187
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,941
And when you first have
a camera in your hands,

188
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:02,317
everything in the world looks
as though it should be photographed.

189
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:59,602
- Gotta get home to Dad.
- We got one picture left.

190
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,299
Save it. I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

191
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,830
Okay. Later.

192
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,502
Bye, Philip!

193
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,875
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, you.

194
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,987
We got this great camera
from Eli Cottonmouth.

195
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:20,423
The stranger?
That model guy? He's weird.

196
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,483
Yeah.

197
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,295
We got one picture left.

198
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,632
Okay...

199
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,329
Turn around.

200
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:33,894
Smile.

201
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,009
Come on. It's time to go inside.

202
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,126
That's my house.

203
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,838
Oh, yeah.

204
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,550
One day you boys are gonna
know what it's like to die.

205
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:25,523
It is certain.
Don't forget that.

206
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:38,135
Do you think he was saying
he's going to kill us

207
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,762
if we don't take better pictures?

208
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,102
I really don't.

209
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,301
Okay.

210
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,402
Man...

211
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,310
Death.

212
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:50,315
Yeah.

213
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,317
I mean, do you think it'll hurt?

214
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,842
I guess that depends.

215
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:57,378
Fire. Burning I think would suck.

216
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:58,981
It's the smoke that gets you.

217
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,822
- Shut up. It's the fire.
- No, I saw this thing on TV.

218
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,919
Drowning.

219
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,089
Man, one time I had this dream...

220
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,826
Yeah, you told me.

221
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,164
Brain cancer.

222
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,794
- My aunt...
- Then what?

223
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:12,826
What do you mean?

224
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:15,203
What happens next...

225
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,038
the second after?

226
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:20,409
What happens?

227
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,380
You boys sure are quiet.

228
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:33,050
Got some pie in the fridge.

229
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:34,116
No.

230
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,754
I don't think we're hungry,
thanks.

231
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,723
We should get your dad a dog.

232
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,826
I don't think he likes animals.

233
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,463
A chihuahua puppy's for sale.

234
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:48,735
Chihuahuas are gross.

235
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,368
What are you reading?

236
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,901
Classifieds.

237
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,277
Here's my favorite:

238
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,078
The Personals.

239
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:01,814
"SWF seeking disappointment.

240
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,981
Prove me wrong. "

241
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:06,217
Wow!

242
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:09,522
Okay, this one's good.

243
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,756
"Unrepentant clog-wearer

244
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:14,061
- seeking same. "
- What's a clog?

245
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,863
This one sounds like a five-year-old.

246
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:21,635
"Sitting alone on my swing set
seeking a push. "

247
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:24,267
Yeah, I'm not sure that's legal.

248
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:39,249
Philip.

249
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:50,124
I don't know why it bothered me so much.

250
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,694
I guess I always knew deep down

251
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,104
that my father liked to fool around.

252
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,839
But my mom,
she was a rock in my mind.

253
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,903
It never occurred to me

254
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:05,007
that she would want to be with
a man who wasn't my dad.

255
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,161
Need a push?

256
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,258
Hi.

257
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,770
Oh, God.

258
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:33,775
Charles, um, I...

259
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,781
May...

260
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,656
You look good.

261
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,970
Rose?

262
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,820
May...

263
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:23,817
And this is how
my mom began an illicit affair

264
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,557
with my dad.

265
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,566
Let's play Uno.

266
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,465
No.

267
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,670
Let's try to find the R/C car
Dad took away last week.

268
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,336
No.

269
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:42,570
Man,

270
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:44,707
um, pirates?

271
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,117
No.

272
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,122
I bet I can hold my breath
longer than you. Go!

273
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,467
Philip?

274
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:04,935
Are you still holding it?

275
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,098
'Cause I'm done.

276
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,869
No.

277
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,306
I got it!
This is it!

278
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:17,838
Here it is!
I know totally!

279
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,113
- What?
- Let's sneak out

280
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:23,246
and take a picture of the
Two-Legged Alligator Man!

281
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,051
Eli will be impressed.

282
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,058
Come on. He says
we're gonna die anyway.

283
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,720
Why don't we go out
with a bang, you know?

284
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:38,727
Maybe.

285
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,850
Look along the water.
He'll come out soon enough.

286
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,135
You hear that?

287
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:21,873
Who are they?

288
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:22,902
Shhh.

289
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,720
How are you this evening, General?

290
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,657
Move along, boys.

291
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,717
Why, you gonna call
the police on us?

292
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,353
He ain't got no phone.

293
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:39,956
Figure to smoke-signal the cops, then?

294
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:45,362
You know that gun ain't loaded.

295
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,766
I can't believe you did that!

296
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:50,399
You shouldn't have
done that, Gramps.

297
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,069
Yeah, we're just
having a little fun.

298
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:16,165
You didn't get any pictures of this?

299
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,761
No.

300
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:20,567
It was fast.

301
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,432
Well, I'm sure the General's fine.

302
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,911
From what I've heard
he's got a world war

303
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:30,210
and three bullet holes
behind him.

304
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:32,773
He'll be fine.

305
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,343
Wasn't your fault.

306
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,722
Cigar?

307
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,102
You want to see a magic trick?

308
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,421
What's inside?

309
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,659
I don't know.

310
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,142
Go on.

311
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,222
Close your eyes.

312
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:50,353
Count to three.

313
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,805
Can we open our eyes yet?

314
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:08,404
Shh. One, two, three.

315
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:29,524
You know, the days
aren't getting any longer

316
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,961
with all these
curious little kittens.

317
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,362
What can I do for you,
little kitten?

318
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,424
I just stopped by to make sure
everything's going all right,

319
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:40,734
that you got all the supplies
you need, space... oh!

320
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,036
Temperature
all right in there?

321
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,101
Everything is as well
as can be expected.

322
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,738
- Can I see it?
- No.

323
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,717
The bisesquicentennial's
only in a month or so.

324
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,379
You are working
in there, right?

325
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,947
Not at the moment.
Hint.

326
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,424
I got it. Well, look,

327
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,256
the real reason I stopped by

328
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:06,059
was to invite you
to poker night tonight.

329
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:09,328
Just a bunch of chums,
you know, nothing big.

330
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,336
We figure you'd be
good company.

331
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,099
Well, that I would.

332
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:17,438
But we'll see. As you know,
I've still got lots of work to do.

333
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:20,376
Yeah, well, if you change your mind
and are able to do it,

334
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:23,643
we meet down there at that
old fishing shack down there,

335
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,206
down by the water.

336
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,377
Doc lets us use it.

337
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,353
Nothing fancy, you know.

338
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:32,288
I appreciate the invite.

339
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,062
Okey-dokey! 8:00 PM, all right?
See you around!

340
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,737
Howdy, boys!

341
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,645
I didn't see anyone
when I came in.

342
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,952
Well, come on in.

343
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,697
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

344
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,506
We'll count you in here.

345
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,009
Deal 'em, huh?

346
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,077
I won!

347
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:40,349
- All right, you ready to go, buddy?
- Aw, Brock, one more?

348
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:44,226
I said I'd only play one game. Mom's
actually cooking dinner. We gotta go.

349
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,197
You've got a few minutes.
Why don't you stay?

350
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:53,704
I really can't.
You know, um...

351
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,399
You want to play
a few more games?

352
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,635
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's go.

353
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,379
New game.

354
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:15,791
Well, dealing
those cards out, boy?

355
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,124
Yeah, dealing you in, Frank.

356
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:28,128
- How you doing, moneybags?
- I'm out again.

357
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,344
Well...

358
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:37,704
five pesos!

359
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,910
I fold.

360
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:41,384
I'm out.

361
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:44,013
I'll see it...

362
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,852
and raise you 10.

363
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,619
Hmm.

364
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:59,963
I'll raise it 10.

365
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,403
See it.

366
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:03,771
Speaking of which,

367
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:07,471
when are we gonna see
that finished product of yours, Eli?

368
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,647
When the devil races motorboats.

369
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:18,019
Is that for sure?

370
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,116
So what kind of cards
are you hiding, Eli?

371
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,524
Come on, Frank. You gonna
let him get away with that?

372
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,339
Make him show us.

373
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,442
Show us those cards there, Eli.

374
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,048
Two pair.

375
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,057
Oh! Beats my deuces.

376
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,430
Certainly does.

377
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,005
What about a quarter-inch sprocket?

378
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,637
Well, I guess I could order you one.

379
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,877
Flange lubricant, 12-grade?

380
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,715
What kind of stores are
you used to shopping in?

381
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,051
So that's a no.

382
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,215
Hello.

383
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:31,387
- Can we talk to you for a minute, Eli?
- Sure.

384
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,420
What are you doing, Eli?

385
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:36,490
- I'm picking up supplies.
- For what?

386
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:40,994
- What do you mean?
- There's nothing there, Eli.

387
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,635
We peeked into
that little space of yours.

388
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,237
Obviously this is a concern.
The town has provided you

389
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,076
with a stipend for your needs.

390
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,480
What are you doing
with our money, Eli?

391
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:55,350
Well, it ain't nothing he's buying
in here, I'll be truthful with you.

392
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,719
You know, I think
he's making stuff up.

393
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:03,955
You peeked?

394
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,690
Eli.

395
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,928
Deal's off.

396
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:17,333
Now, just a minute, Eli.

397
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,865
I've done my work
on every continent.

398
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,845
I've done my art
for kings and queens.

399
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:25,144
I don't need to break my back for
a bunch of petty, paranoid accusations

400
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,048
- coming at me...
- No no no. Wait a minute.

401
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:30,521
- You're making me feel really funny...
- No one's accusing you of anything.

402
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:34,013
We're concerned. The town's
anniversary festival is coming up.

403
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:37,687
Yeah, we've allocated quite a bit
of our budget toward this.

404
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,095
Hmm hmm hm.

405
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,394
You're gonna get
your money's won'th.

406
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:49,634
- Good.
- But no one

407
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:52,438
sees anything,

408
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:56,743
not even a sliver

409
00:38:56,781 --> 00:39:00,877
of a fraction of a glimpse

410
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:04,911
until it's unveiled.

411
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,787
You understand?

412
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:10,021
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

413
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:13,863
Do you understand?

414
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:16,264
I will not see this town deceived
and taken advantage of.

415
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,494
Do you understand me?

416
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:20,993
Fair enough, Pastor,

417
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,768
fair enough.

418
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:33,817
Of course that caused quite a stir.

419
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,082
Everyone had heard the gossip
by the end of the day,

420
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:40,249
either from Frank or the
writing on the wall...

421
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,885
literally.

422
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,361
Jackson and I were now
the insiders,

423
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:49,059
the only ones in the whole town
who had contact with Eli.

424
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,500
Eli, it's me, Philip.

425
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:54,130
And we thought nothing of it.

426
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,713
Philip.

427
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:19,929
Hey. What's that?

428
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:21,761
It's a note from Eli.

429
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:25,565
"Don't let anyone think low
of you because you are young.

430
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:29,266
Be their ideal.
Timothy. "

431
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:32,276
Who's Timothy?

432
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,778
In first Corinthians 15,
it says

433
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:49,316
now, if Christ has preached

434
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,761
that he has been
raised from the dead,

435
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:56,392
how do some among you say that
there is no resurrection of the dead?

436
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,801
If Christ has not been raised,
then our preaching is in vain

437
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,361
and so is your faith.

438
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:04,203
It's real short.
Keep looking.

439
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:08,906
Moreover, we are even bound
to be false witnesses of God

440
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,609
because we testify against God
that he raised Christ.

441
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,210
I'm sorry, but I just don't trust him.

442
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:17,244
And if Christ has not been raised...

443
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:20,280
What's that stranger doing here
anyway? What's he building?

444
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:23,851
What I really want to know is what
is he doing with those two boys.

445
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,886
Mm hmm.

446
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,067
Here it is.

447
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:34,594
"Don't let anyone look down at you
because you are young.

448
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,872
Be their ideal. "
First Timothy 4:11.

449
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:41,640
If I have to rely on my own actions

450
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,479
to get onto heaven, I'm a goner.

451
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:09,597
That day in church,

452
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,767
amidst the whispers
and the stares,

453
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:14,141
Jackson and I began to realize

454
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,646
that Eli was beginning to change
the way the town looked at us,

455
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:21,550
and for the first time, changing
the way we looked at the town.

456
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,452
Overall, it was
a strange Sunday,

457
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:34,828
because for me it just kind of became

458
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,027
the Sunday that
Camille disappeared.

459
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,508
Whoa.

460
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:01,883
- Hey, guys.
- You look fancy.

461
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:03,860
I have a date.

462
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:05,385
Whoa. With who?

463
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:09,763
- Your brother.
- Nasty!

464
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,395
- A real date?
- Yeah, a real date.

465
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:15,029
Cripes.

466
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:25,211
Philip, do you have the green?

467
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:27,046
What do you need green for?

468
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:30,884
Because Jesus loved the little aliens
too, don't you think?

469
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:34,050
I do. I really do.

470
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:38,322
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

471
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,523
You're not reading it right.

472
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,862
- I'm sorry, it's just...
- Speak up.

473
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,733
- It's just that...
- What? What?

474
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,536
It's just that you need
a degree or something

475
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:52,872
to pronounce
half of these words.

476
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,902
I'm sorry.

477
00:43:58,382 --> 00:43:59,644
So, back to it?

478
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:04,383
If you got nothing better to do.

479
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:11,291
I got a little bit of time.
I'll finish.

480
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,256
"The catalyst

481
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:19,258
of nucular fusion
prevents... " what?

482
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:22,830
"Nuclear. "

483
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:25,273
Nuclear.

484
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:28,836
Don't bother finishing if...

485
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:30,870
This is first-grade stuff.

486
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:35,682
I can't get this
if you can't say the words.

487
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,281
What's gotten into you tonight?

488
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:41,587
Just say the words aloud

489
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,354
and I'll make sense out of it!

490
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:45,692
Well, maybe we should
just call it a night.

491
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,291
Whatever. Yeah. Right.
Run along. Go on.

492
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,631
Don't you talk to me
like that, Mr. Patch.

493
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,338
You know, I'm doing a nice thing.

494
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,775
You don't pay me
to read to you, you know.

495
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,148
So what are you
doing, then, huh?

496
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:08,879
Why are you
so hateful tonight?

497
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:13,686
Why are you wasting all
your time with that little...

498
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:17,660
Just... oh, God.
Just go on your date.

499
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,391
Go on your little date. Go!

500
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,865
- You have no right to treat me...
- Go on your little date!

501
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,860
We'll resume all of this tomorrow!

502
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:04,172
Has Camille
ever stormed out like that?

503
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:07,769
Not really, but my dad
can be tough sometimes.

504
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:10,906
Why is he so upset tonight?

505
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:13,974
- It's Sunday.
- So?

506
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:16,953
You never really hang out
Sunday nights.

507
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:19,080
Some can be better than others.

508
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:23,319
He misses my mom.

509
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,227
The hymnal he puts between me
and him in church...

510
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:29,130
it's where Mom used to sit.

511
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:34,126
He likes the old movies
'cause they remind him of her.

512
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:37,231
It reminds me too.

513
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,740
I think he died on Sunday too.

514
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:47,046
What happened to her?

515
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,450
- It was a car accident.
- I know, but how...

516
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:52,115
I don't know.

517
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,750
He never told you anything?

518
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:56,521
It was the General.

519
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,528
- The guy who...
- Yeah.

520
00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:00,723
He was driving the other car.

521
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:04,825
So yeah, I can't really feel too bad
about him getting beat up.

522
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:06,896
My old house.

523
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:09,661
I didn't spend much time
at my house that summer.

524
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,136
I'd camp out at Jackson's
most of the time.

525
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,832
That's what summers are for.

526
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:20,310
But for everyone there's a time
when you return home

527
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:22,403
and it just doesn't
feel like home anymore.

528
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:26,439
Maybe you've been gone
a day, week, years,

529
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:28,815
but it just doesn't feel like home.

530
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,015
Brock?

531
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:08,781
Hey, Brock, your coach called...

532
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,738
Philip Walden steps up
to the plate,

533
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,305
gets ready, and he swings!

534
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,750
Oh, strike one!

535
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:40,314
Okay, he gets set.

536
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:43,520
Swings again...

537
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,549
Why'd you have to go and do that?

538
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:45,823
You shouldn't have done that.

539
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:48,991
We're just having a little fun...

540
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,168
Phil. Hey, what's up, man?

541
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,640
Brock?

542
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:00,405
Yeah, what do you want?

543
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:04,610
Brock, how did you get this?

544
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,946
The bat?

545
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:10,283
Dad gave it to me when I was,
like, two or something.

546
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,482
Do you want it?

547
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,514
If you want it,
it's yours.

548
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:15,752
Brock, I was there.

549
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,988
What are you talking about?

550
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:20,826
Jackson and I
saw the whole thing.

551
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:24,800
What, a game or something?

552
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:29,670
This is the bat!
You beat the General with this bat!

553
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,947
Right?

554
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:50,252
- It's not my fault.
- Brock, don't lie to me.

555
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:53,695
The General came at us
with a shotgun.

556
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:55,699
- Don't lie to me.
- He was gonna kill us.

557
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:59,191
He broke Chip's car
and he had a shotgun

558
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:01,170
and he was going to kill...
Phil, look at me.

559
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:03,765
Phil, he was gonna kill us.

560
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,172
He was going to kill us.

561
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:08,042
Besides, you know what he
did to Jackson's family.

562
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:11,070
Keep this between us, Phil.

563
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,276
- Here you go.
- Phil.

564
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:36,865
- Hey, Jackson.
- Hey.

565
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:39,239
I've been looking for you.

566
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:43,144
- Nobody can find Camille.
- What?

567
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,013
Her mom said

568
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:47,573
she hasn't been home in days,

569
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:49,711
and she never came over
the other night.

570
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:53,018
- Maybe she just...
- No.

571
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:57,584
She left a note at church.

572
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:59,892
- She did?
- Yeah.

573
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,127
So she came to see you last night,
gave you the note?

574
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,692
No, I found the note by the altar.

575
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:11,139
- It's hers.
- Pastor, we don't know that.

576
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:12,802
Yeah, we do.

577
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:15,641
- It could be a forgery.
- It's not.

578
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,340
I'll be damned if I'm
gonna tell her mother

579
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:19,906
until I know
this is something.

580
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,942
Lem, she does clerical work
here sometimes.

581
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:23,975
I can go to the office

582
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:26,012
and get you a sample
of her handwriting right now.

583
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:29,924
"Pastor Salem, I've made a decision

584
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,723
and I know you'll listen.

585
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:34,925
I've been thinking about
where my life is going,

586
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:36,990
where the life of my child will go,

587
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:40,265
and the thing is I think
I need to start over. "

588
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:45,066
She was pregnant?
You're sure?

589
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:47,576
Yeah. She told me.

590
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:49,772
"No one needs to know.

591
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:52,509
This is my last chance
to live a normal life

592
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:56,076
before I have to take on
this huge responsibility,

593
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:58,610
so I'm starting over.

594
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:00,748
It's the beginning of a new life.

595
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:03,589
I will be the mother
God wants me to be.

596
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:06,721
Thank you for everything,
Camille. "

597
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:10,665
- When?
- In the last week.

598
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:11,998
She had just found out.

599
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:13,525
She see Doc about it?

600
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,269
Not to my knowledge.
She didn't want anybody to know.

601
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:21,277
- She say who the father was?
- No.

602
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:24,872
She never told me, and, um,

603
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,042
- I never asked.
- Sorry, Pastor.

604
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:32,181
Jackson, there's something
I need to tell you about my brother.

605
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:19,190
Pastor Salem.

606
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:24,092
- Hey, Lem.
- Hey.

607
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:26,432
I wonder if we could trouble you
to borrow that ladder of yours.

608
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,064
- Frank's just about gave way.
- Yeah, no problem.

609
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:33,566
- Having a little problem there?
- Yeah, wouldn't you know it,

610
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,443
thorns coming up in the garden
just before the big to-do.

611
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,347
Oh yeah, those crows drop
those seeds in the worst places.

612
00:55:39,383 --> 00:55:41,374
Yeah, they do.

613
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:48,681
Um, listen, Pastor.

614
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:51,159
I've been talking with Camille's mom.

615
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:54,755
Naturally she's in a real tizzy

616
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:56,993
about this whole deal,

617
00:55:57,034 --> 00:56:00,470
looking for someone to blame.

618
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:03,803
So if there's anything you know...

619
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,138
I told you, Lem. She didn't
tell me where she was going.

620
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:11,305
The last thing she would have
wanted is for her name...

621
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,184
She didn't want to wear
the red letter, Lem,

622
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:21,156
not in the midst
of all this celebration.

623
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,783
Yeah.

624
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:26,824
I guess you're right.

625
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:31,028
Yeah, I'll wait until things
simmer down a little bit.

626
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:34,799
But once this celebration is over...

627
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,130
something.

628
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:44,471
You know, she's even trying
to blame that Eli Cottonmouth.

629
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:49,713
Well, it's easy to point fingers
at the stranger, don't you think?

630
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:51,220
Hmm.

631
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:52,778
Yes it is.

632
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,986
What do you suppose
he's up to in there?

633
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:58,893
Who knows? I guess
we'll find out soon enough.

634
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:00,487
Yeah, I guess we will.

635
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,522
I'll see you tonight, Pastor.
I'm gonna help myself to that ladder.

636
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,864
Absolutely.
It's around back.

637
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:31,785
It's a mighty pretty church
you got here.

638
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:37,099
I like churches...

639
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:41,127
old churches where the air
is heavy with God.

640
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:46,576
Well, this one is pretty old.

641
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,272
They say you can't judge a book
by its cover, can you, Pastor?

642
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:53,211
What are you doing?

643
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:59,578
Digging. These buildings
tell me stories,

644
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:03,218
and I guess that's why
I do what I do.

645
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,161
And what is that, exactly?
Intimidate people?

646
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:12,429
Who are you trying to impress?

647
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:14,369
There's no royalty here.

648
00:58:15,872 --> 00:58:19,535
Why did you choose this town?

649
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:21,840
As I recall, this town chose me.

650
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,979
God, after all, spoke through

651
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:31,749
the hands of a modest carpenter.

652
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:08,882
Philip.

653
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:10,153
Philip, stop.

654
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:12,627
- Phil...
- Let me go!

655
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:14,129
Philip listen...

656
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:16,758
- where are you taking that?
- Sheriff Baker.

657
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,166
No no no no no. No, listen.

658
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:20,464
Just listen to me for a second.

659
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:22,994
- The General is...
- Where's Camille?

660
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,531
- Camille? What does Camille...
- She was supposed to meet you.

661
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:29,909
- And then she disappeared!
- Whoa whoa.

662
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:32,073
Are you saying that you
think I did something...

663
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:35,516
Brock, what did you do to her?

664
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:38,783
- She never showed.
- Brock, come on.

665
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,722
She never showed up, man.

666
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:43,749
Phil, I don't know
what you think I am...

667
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:47,422
You did it once.
She was supposed to meet you.

668
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:50,991
She was excited and dressed up
and going to meet you.

669
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,763
And no one ever saw her again!

670
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,568
She never showed up, man.
She stood me up.

671
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,335
I have no id...
look at me!

672
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,843
I have no idea
what happened to Camille.

673
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,573
People are saying that she
ran away or something.

674
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:09,046
Philip, I'm your brother, yeah?

675
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:12,543
Philly.

676
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,222
Say something.

677
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:07,273
Okay, it's all done.
Can I go now?

678
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,937
Hang on there, sport.

679
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,504
Dad, I told Philip I was
going to meet him.

680
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:13,482
Yeah, okay.

681
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:16,679
I just need you
to do something first.

682
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,211
Dad.

683
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:22,486
Jackson, Camille is not around

684
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:24,220
and I need you to pick up the slack.

685
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,693
Okay, what?

686
01:01:29,432 --> 01:01:34,267
There's a box
on the kitchen counter.

687
01:01:34,304 --> 01:01:35,862
What is it?

688
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:39,500
- It's a care package for the General.
- What? Why?

689
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:47,039
Well, he got beat up pretty bad.

690
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:51,019
- It's the right thing to do.
- No.

691
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:53,818
What was that?

692
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:56,121
No, I won't do it.

693
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,560
He got what he deserved
and now he has to live with it.

694
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:02,360
Jackson, don't
say things like that.

695
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:08,300
Look, son, sit down a second.

696
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:10,101
Let me tell you something.

697
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:19,139
You know when I started
to go blind?

698
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:21,150
Yeah, it was after the accident.

699
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:27,516
- No.
- What do you mean?

700
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:34,196
I was losing my eyesight

701
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,663
a little bit before then.

702
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:38,394
I was having these spells,

703
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:43,031
and uh, and sort of like
tunneling around the edges.

704
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,139
I didn't tell anybody.

705
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:49,145
I figured

706
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:52,512
if I didn't talk about it,

707
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:54,676
it wasn't really happening.

708
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:59,654
The accident...

709
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:01,418
it wasn't the General's fault.

710
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:08,463
It was my fault.

711
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:11,399
- What were you doing?
- Jackson...

712
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:15,268
No, what were you doing driving
the car if you couldn't see?

713
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:18,138
- It came in spells.
- I don't care.

714
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:23,134
Jackson, don't you hate me.
I hate myself enough.

715
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:26,148
- Good.
- This is about the General.

716
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:28,582
He didn't do anything to us.

717
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:31,314
And now he needs our help.

718
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:36,291
Deliver this package yourself.
You stand in front of him

719
01:03:36,326 --> 01:03:39,352
and tell him
what you just told me.

720
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:41,693
- You killed her!
- Hey!

721
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:43,756
Everything is on you!

722
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,791
Jackson, what are you doing?

723
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:49,703
You destroy everything you touch.

724
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,639
So I'm making sure
you can't touch me.

725
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:53,369
Jackson!

726
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:29,168
- Hey.
- Hey.

727
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:25,166
The story of that summer...

728
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:27,192
the knowledge was always there.

729
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:31,230
Eli just had to hand us the fruit.

730
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:34,266
And you saw
what you needed to see.

731
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,210
One,

732
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:42,082
two,

733
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:44,052
three...

734
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:50,116
What is it
that boys have in their hearts

735
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:52,457
that lets them
see things men can't?

736
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:57,833
When did they lose it?

737
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:03,027
This town and I...
we were young,

738
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:05,233
just boys in those days.

739
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:09,234
But boys grow up.

740
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,907
Do you think he exists?

741
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:14,678
I don't know.

742
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:17,185
I like to think he does.

743
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:22,055
But if you listen to everyone else
they'll say he's just a story.

744
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,786
I thought that's what it was,

745
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:27,523
- to keep us kids in at night.
- Yeah.

746
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:28,928
Two-Legged Alligator Man is real.

747
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:31,593
Jackson.

748
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:35,365
We'll get a picture of him one day.

749
01:06:35,405 --> 01:06:38,340
Close your eyes, count to three.

750
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:44,602
One...

751
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,146
...two...

752
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,551
...three!

753
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:01,287
Jackson!

754
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,530
Come on, Jackson.

755
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:20,706
Jackson!

756
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:43,966
Jackson!

757
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:28,209
And just like that,

758
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:31,448
the world was meaningless,

759
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:35,150
a gift from Eli.

760
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:39,218
Because as I watched
my best friend die,

761
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:42,231
the town was here,

762
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:45,200
all caught up in the
excitement of that model.

763
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:09,982
Has anyone here seen Eli?

764
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:13,325
I don't think so.
I haven't seen him.

765
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:25,905
Well, folks, I know you all

766
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:28,604
have been
looking forward to this,

767
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:32,978
the chance to see our
little paradise immortalized.

768
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:36,644
Now some may call it vanity,

769
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:40,918
but I say we got quite
a bit to be proud of.

770
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:42,925
Yes, sir.

771
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:46,918
We got us a mighty pretty town,

772
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:50,729
a mighty pretty town
indeed, folks.

773
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:54,725
So, without further ado...

774
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:58,061
He was just a petty con man

775
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,729
with a sense of humor.

776
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,966
Beautiful little town, right?

777
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:19,004
No no, Pastor. It's Eli.
We'll get him for this,

778
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:23,007
I promise you. It's all right.

779
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:26,783
No. No.

780
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:29,791
He's right.

781
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,688
It's us.

782
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:38,094
It's us.

783
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:43,703
God bless him for showing us.
It's us.

784
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:50,835
It's me. It's me!

785
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:05,092
She was my love.

786
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,755
She was my sin.

787
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:52,597
Cursed is the ground
because of you.

788
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,906
It will produce
thistles and thorns

789
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:59,142
because of you!

790
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:05,787
Oh, Jesus!

791
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:41,913
Take me.

792
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:44,425
Take me!

793
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:18,485
His model...

794
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:22,623
it's a mirror that only reflects
the darkest parts of yourself.

795
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:30,296
Paradise can't exist
with the knowledge of sin,

796
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:33,536
and Eli threw it in our faces.

797
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:37,878
This was no Eden.

798
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:42,981
How could we live
with each other now?

799
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:33,158
Yeah, it's just a model,

800
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:36,603
but I can barely
stand to look at it.

801
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:44,045
Because if I look too hard,

802
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,038
I can see myself,
empty.

803
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:34,118
Hello, Philip.

804
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,965
Hi.

805
01:17:40,002 --> 01:17:41,993
Can I get you something?

806
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:45,165
No, I...
I was...

807
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,799
I saw the sign, and I just...

808
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:51,438
Oh, hon, I am so
sorry about Jackson.

809
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,279
Why are you still here?

810
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:58,479
Well, this is my home.

811
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,751
There's no one here,
Miss Rockwell.

812
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,657
There's no power...

813
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,558
here, anywhere in the town,

814
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:10,258
so I don't know how you're doing
this whole thing with the light...

815
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:13,359
It's all a little impossible.

816
01:18:43,799 --> 01:18:46,563
- Hey.
- Hey.

817
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:53,830
Double vanilla milkshake,
extra strawberry syrup?

818
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:55,434
Yep.

819
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,347
I used to like those.

820
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,112
What happened?

821
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,819
I guess I grew up.

822
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:12,827
What do you do?

823
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:16,228
I work for the
power authority now.

824
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:19,490
You know, we're gonna
flood this town.

825
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:21,799
They're flooding it?

826
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:24,203
Yep.

827
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,072
In 24 hours this
will all be underwater.

828
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:31,910
The Two-Legged Alligator Man's
gonna like that just fine.

829
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:36,408
Do you believe in him now?

830
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:44,584
It's taken a while, but I came back
to try and make sense of it all.

831
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:50,963
To be honest with you,
I think I'm still just as confused.

832
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,524
And?

833
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,398
L...

834
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:02,035
I don't know.

835
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:05,672
You've lived in this town
your whole life,

836
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:08,308
and it was beautiful.

837
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:12,286
But that's not the real world.

838
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:16,985
The real word will eat you,

839
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:20,586
like the Two-Legged Alligator Man.

840
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:23,257
Isn't that what Eli
wanted to tell us?

841
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:28,897
It's easy to believe in things
in a place like this.

842
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:32,930
But the world out there...

843
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:35,375
doesn't make it so easy, does it?

844
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,935
Maybe that's why you have to...

845
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,345
believe in things.

846
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,881
You may be onto something
there, kiddo.

847
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:57,026
But I don't know what happened
to that part of me.

848
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:13,240
Maybe I can come
with you this time.

849
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:22,415
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

850
01:22:30,892 --> 01:22:32,860
There you are.

851
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:43,768
You were right, Jackson!
