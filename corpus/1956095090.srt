[music playing]

2
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,350
I can't speak as
to why it's been

3
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,895
so long since we've
had big Indian dramas

4
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,940
on British television.

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,274
They've tried.

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,817
I think you know the
truth of the matter

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,570
is, "The Jewel in the Crown"
was a masterpiece that

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,697
was shot 25 years ago.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:36,286
And the reason
we're doing this now

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,288
is because our
writer, Paul Rutman,

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,208
had a particular take on that
world that was very, very

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,543
different and was unique.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,004
Just the concept is
just stellar, I think.

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,257
I've done quite a few
period dramas by now,

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,970
and I think this is the most
intriguing concepts, the most

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,680
interesting period of time.

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,141
Fascinated by the period, by
the writing, by the characters

18
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,270
were so interesting,
all of them.

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:06,608
He wanted to tell the story
of how a nation ultimately

20
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,486
got its independence
from the British

21
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:14,908
as well as telling a
personal story within that.

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,497
So I think it's sort of
serendipity in a way.

23
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,334
It's everything I
think really stems

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,254
from a writer's vision in
television, and a writer's

25
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:33,719
passion and a writer having
an original take on the world.

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,598
And that's what I think
Paul Rutman has and has

27
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,683
created in "Indian Summers."

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,227
[music playing]

29
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,495
The central issue,
there are two families--

30
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,416
one Indian and one British.

31
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,086
The Whelans are our
core British family.

32
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,048
And they're represented
by Alice and Ralph,

33
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,342
brother and sister
reunited together

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,803
for the first time
since childhood.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,475
Their parents, as far as
we understand it, are dead.

36
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,019
Ralph has a mother
figure in Cynthia,

37
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,563
the lady who runs the
club, and if you like

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,149
a father figure in the viceroy.

39
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,611
The Dalals on the other
hand are a Parsi family,

40
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,321
who are just making due.

41
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,490
They're in India because
they were born here.

42
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,201
Their family grew
up here in Bombay.

43
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,372
And in a way, they're a much
more domestic environment

44
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,915
for the show to go to.

45
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:49,252
We have the father and
mother, Darius and Roshana.

46
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,004
And they bring with
them their three kids.

47
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,383
And because they're close
knit, Aafrin takes his family

48
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,510
with them and they
all live together

49
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,430
in fairly huddled circumstances
in the Indian bazaar.

50
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,266
They're, for me, a center
for warmth in the show.

51
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:10,107
They're more human, more
humorous place for us to visit.

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:16,154
And, in a way I think they're
a counterpoint to the Whelans

53
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,617
who have plenty of warmth,
but are also shot through

54
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,827
with secrets.

55
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,120
I am hereto work.

56
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:23,995
To work?

57
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,747
And why are they here?

58
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,582
To rule.

59
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,085
For me, one, one of the
most interesting things

60
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:37,718
is the British out here,
out of their comfort zone

61
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,930
and trying to create
little England here.

62
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,433
And what was happening
at that time,

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,101
politically, the
whole thing I think

64
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,519
is the most fascinating thing.

65
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,564
And of course within it
are the love affairs.

66
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,524
And they are, of course,
personal relationships

67
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,984
are always fascinating.

68
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,695
But with this background,
and this [inaudible]

69
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,946
Even, it's very, very intense.

70
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
You are on form tonight.

71
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:11,752
It's putting that very British
world of the 1920s, 1930s

72
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,298
on screen, which we
have seen in various--

73
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,467
but then putting
it in this world,

74
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,886
it's like lifting them and
putting them on another planet.

75
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:25,348
They're just, they're
so uncomfortable here

76
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,517
and they desperately
cling onto the things that

77
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,019
worked for them in England.

78
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,022
[music playing]

79
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,406
The first time I
read the script,

80
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,744
I remember being completely
blown away by the scope.

81
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:53,293
That first shot, which is the
train and the way Paul writes

82
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,798
it and the images that he
clearly had in his head

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:04,179
were so vivid that
I saw them as well.

84
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,765
We all, we all had this
conversation actually

85
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,852
when we met for the
first time about how

86
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,730
strong the storytelling was.

87
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,776
And it's great when you get
that kind of ambition married

88
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:24,407
with really good writing cause
often you get, you get one

89
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,827
without the other.

90
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:32,582
And I just felt with
this, it was-- I read it

91
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,212
and thought yes, of course, this
is the time to tell this story.

92
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:45,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
members and guests,

93
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:52,686
welcome to our little club
and welcome to the Sipi Fair.

94
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,606
Wonderful thing it is to
be able to take pleasure

95
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,442
in each other's cultures.

96
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:07,576
I think Cynthia
is a character who

97
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,955
goes to the heart of the
British experience in India.

98
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:17,002
On the one hand, she's
like a figurehead

99
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,213
for the imperial experience.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,636
But she's also ferocious, dark,
as challenging and at times

101
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,847
cruel <i>as</i> she is charismatic.

102
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:35,770
And as for the rest of
you-- cheats, adulterers,

103
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,983
slaves of empire here to
rule this great nation

104
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,028
for another glorious
six months--

105
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,155
I want no moaning
about my milk punch.

106
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,075
We knew that we needed
an actress who would not

107
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,121
lose the audience, who would
take the audience with her

108
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,291
into some fairly dark places.

109
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,669
And we were thrilled
with the idea

110
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,464
of trying to get Julie Walters
to play that part because we

111
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:07,886
knew that she had that
combination of charm,

112
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,222
and strength, and ferocity
that Cynthia needs.

113
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,226
Um, and so when she
read the scripts

114
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:20,148
and was willing to meet, I
was absolutely beside myself

115
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,816
with excitement.

116
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,154
And the fact that she's come
in and delivered in the way

117
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,617
that she has obviously been
I think, incredible for me,

118
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,202
incredible for the show.

119
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,870
I think it's also fair to
say she's been incredible

120
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,206
for a lot of the younger
actors as an example

121
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,126
of the commitment,
the preparation she

122
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,924
does, and the power of
delivery from take to take.

123
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:51,805
I certainly think that Cynthia
is a very powerful person.

124
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,308
I mean, to think she has a
Machiavellian personality,

125
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,311
and so she's going to
control whatever environment

126
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,605
<i>she's in if she possibly can.</i>

127
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:06,861
So I think she's also um, a
great stickler for everything

128
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,280
British.

129
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,949
Thank god this is
only once a year.

130
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,536
Come on, let's get on with it.

131
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:19,082
So, 150 fruit scones,
150 plain scones,

132
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,627
150 rounds of sandwiches, all
in time for the Sipi Fair.

133
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,337
The challenge of
recreating afternoon tea

134
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,882
at Claridge's, only
serving it in the outliers.

135
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,093
The thing that attracted
me very much to the script

136
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,928
is not just the
period-- which it does.

137
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:36,433
I love that period in history--
but is her extremely complex

138
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,394
relationship with Ralph.

139
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,648
I mean, it's kind of mother,
son, and it kind of isn't.

140
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,776
And it's very controlling,
and she lives through him.

141
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,070
And it's just really,
really interesting.

142
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,364
And we've had, especially
towards the end of it--

143
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:56,036
all through, I mean the very,
in the very first episode,

144
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,288
there's a scene where he
throws her up against the wall

145
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,124
and you know, because she's
trying to control him over.

146
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,669
But she still comes out on
top as it were with that.

147
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,464
And that's that
little scene made

148
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,966
me want to do the-- before
I read anything else, that

149
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,259
made me want to do it.

150
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,219
It's just, it was
brilliantly written,

151
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,930
and it's very, very interesting.

152
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,517
You immediately go what
are these two about?

153
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,561
It just draws you in.

154
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,898
And as it goes on, and
it gets more and more

155
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,817
intense as their
paths, the two of them

156
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,280
slightly are going and pulling
in different directions.

157
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,325
And so it becomes more
intense and more upsetting.

158
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,703
And yes, we've had a
couple of huge scenes,

159
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,706
Henry and I together
and it's great

160
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,416
that they're at the end of it.

161
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,211
Because we've grown to
know one another <i>as</i> actors

162
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,046
and grown to know
our characters.

163
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,799
We're more in tune
with our characters.

164
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,928
And they were amazing
to do because they're

165
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,641
fabulously written
and complex and there

166
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,477
is all sorts going on in them.

167
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,814
Meet fire with fire until Mr.
Gandhi and the rest of Congress

168
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,314
are subdued.

169
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,693
Too strong?

170
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,736
Because I rely on
you to reign me

171
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:12,946
in if I'm being too tiresome.

172
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,155
Not at all.

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,323
Fire with fire,
just what they need.

174
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,617
With Ralph Whelan
I really wanted

175
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:26,292
to write a charming,
recognizable young Englishman

176
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,798
caught at a moment in history
who was, by his own lights,

177
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,509
trying to do the
right thing, uh,

178
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,344
but is on the
wrong side history.

179
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,054
So he's a difficult
character in that way

180
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:43,768
because he does and says things
that we don't like to hear,

181
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:50,942
but it's important that his
good intentions, however

182
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:55,572
far he strays from them
are always in our minds.

183
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,742
And when we met Henry
Lloyd-Hughes, when he read

184
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,955
for us, he has charm in spades.

185
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,833
He's a tremendously
talented young actor

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,423
who can be emotional, funny, has
a great internal energy to him,

187
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,135
and was absolutely magnetic
from the moment we first

188
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,553
saw him read.

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,013
Well, there's an actress
called Laura Carmichael,

190
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,931
who is in "Downton Abbey."

191
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,268
And I was doing a film, and
she was also doing the film,

192
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,270
and she heard me read the lines.

193
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,065
And I was really
busy with the film,

194
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:37,030
and she said I strongly urge
you to put yourself on tape

195
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,489
and send this tape.

196
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,909
I was like, Laura I
want to, I want to.

197
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,660
And she was like, no,
you have to do it.

198
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:47,540
And she kind of sat me down and
we did it right there and then.

199
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,381
And as I was doing
it, in the process

200
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,011
I realized that-- there's
this strange thing that

201
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,347
happens where you feel
the words sound good

202
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,389
coming out of your mouth.

203
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,267
Does that make sense?

204
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:12,148
And obviously it's a very,
very interconnected plot.

205
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,735
So with all these things, you're
finding out a little bit more

206
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,320
about the character.

207
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,532
But right from the get go,
my impulse, it felt right,

208
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,077
felt like a really
interesting fit.

209
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,288
And the closer I got,
the more I liked.

210
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,707
And it's not always that way.

211
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,043
It's not always that
exact combination of,

212
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,588
as the layers reveal
themselves, you

213
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,466
go wow, that makes
it more interesting.

214
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,302
That makes it
something, even more

215
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:46,015
of a challenge and even more
of a slightly complicated

216
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,810
concoction.

217
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:55,108
I didn't know what to expect
the first time I met Henry.

218
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,986
And I'm very lucky
that we get on

219
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,864
as well as we do because we've
got so much to do together.

220
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,786
He is so enthusiastic about
everything, which is great

221
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,455
because it's good to
have someone like that,

222
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,209
with that energy on set.

223
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,502
Well, that is good news.

224
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,170
Do you have a name?

225
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,463
Yes.

226
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,091
I have the details
with me right here.

227
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,052
[Slams]

228
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,895
Hmm.

229
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:33,896
Hmm.

230
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,858
[phone ringing]

231
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,535
Well, yeah, I have so much
to do on screen with Nikesh.

232
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:52,248
It seemed preposterous not to
spend as much time with him.

233
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,918
He was the only actor that
I actually saw extensively

234
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,879
before we even left.

235
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:04,385
So I've had many, many
hours getting to know him

236
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:10,767
and he's such a kind of
amazingly capable, hearty,

237
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,312
thigh slapping guy that he's
exactly the kind of person

238
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,274
that you would want to go off
and do any kind of adventure

239
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,028
with, regardless of acting,
you know what I mean?

240
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:28,117
He's got just like bags of
experience and intelligence

241
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,994
and application.

242
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,246
Aafrin is a tough
character to play

243
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,208
because unlike a lot of
the British characters,

244
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,043
he is less active.

245
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,670
He's someone who is just
getting by and trying

246
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,464
to do right by his family.

247
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,466
Things happen to
him which are bigger

248
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,261
than he can at first
control And he acts in ways

249
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,224
that he can't always
understand at the time.

250
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,229
Um, what Nikesh brings is
a sensitivity, I think,

251
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,190
and a gentleness,
a diffidence which

252
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,818
really feels right
for Aafrin And he's

253
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,444
brought that character to life.

254
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,781
He gives him a warmth that
really makes us, the viewer,

255
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,409
want to go with him,
want to follow him

256
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,245
through a story that takes
a lot of twists and turns.

257
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,746
No, it's a British club.

258
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,832
Please, I have to speak
to the private secretary.

259
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,125
Stand down Vinod.

260
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,084
<i>That'll do.</i>

261
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,296
Dalal.

262
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,215
Letter sir, awaiting
your signature.

263
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:27,969
Hmm.

264
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,310
You found it all right?

265
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,353
Yes sir.

266
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,063
In the end,

267
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,066
Alice Whelan's story is very
tricky for an actress to play.

268
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,987
She's someone who, like
a lot of her generation,

269
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,739
with that India experience,
grew up in India,

270
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,951
was sent home to boarding school
at a very young age-- home

271
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,036
being England-- had
a horrible time,

272
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,706
and has come running
back to India in her 20s.

273
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,875
She's a character who doesn't
know where she's from.

274
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,960
She doesn't know what home is.

275
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,004
She doesn't know if
she is based in England

276
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,466
or in London or in India.

277
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,051
But she has an idea
that Simla is her home.

278
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:14,307
Jemima has tremendous
warmth and, as an actress,

279
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:19,520
she brings a huge amount of
emotion, of wit, of fluidity

280
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
to her performance.

281
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,983
I think she's a
character with Jemima

282
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,526
who we can fall in love with.

283
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,196
I think there's
something about the fact

284
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,073
that Jemima is an
English woman who grew up

285
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,119
in Paris, that perhaps gives
her a certain otherness,

286
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,454
<i>a certain statelessness.</i>

287
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,080
She doesn't know quite
where she's from.

288
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,417
And it's possible that she
carries a little bit of that

289
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,293
into her performance.

290
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,049
So more than anyone
who read for us, she

291
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,678
seemed to just put her finger
on that statelessness of Alice,

292
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,848
that sense of where
do I come from?

293
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,269
But she also has that
tremendous warmth,

294
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,481
and heart, which I think
is absolutely critical

295
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,857
to get Alice right.

296
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,318
And what brings you
to the summer capital?

297
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,613
Oh, just visiting.

298
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,949
It's not quite decided yet?

299
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,161
And will little man's
papa be joining you?

300
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,372
Sorry?

301
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,083
Some dashing young [inaudible].

302
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,671
I can just see it
with your figure.

303
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
And you'll excuse me.

304
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,969
[music playing]

305
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,929
Look.

306
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,931
She left her hat.

307
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:41,102
When Alice arrives-- the
wonderful Jemima West-- it,

308
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:46,816
is a huge new opportunity for
Sarah to make a new friend,

309
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,779
but also to get into the society
that she really wants to be in.

310
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,699
Not just because she wants to
be higher than she is, but also

311
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,243
she wants to be at the parties.

312
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,744
She wants to go to the balls.

313
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,123
She wants to be part of
it, part of the community.

314
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,584
I know.

315
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,545
I have a fancy you
and I are going

316
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,506
to be the very best of
friends, don't you think?

317
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,636
Sarah doesn't work out.

318
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,139
She doesn't really understand
what's coming back at her.

319
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,767
So she does believe that
there's a friendship there,

320
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,477
with herself and Alice.

321
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,273
And she thinks that, from the
initial meeting of when she's

322
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,734
not quite sure who she is and
she's a bit interested to see

323
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,612
where the babies come from,
to realizing who she is

324
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,407
and-- and the first few
conversations, I don't know,

325
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,534
are possibly terrifying
from Alice's point of view.

326
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,370
From Sarah's point of view, it's
actually forging a friendship

327
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,457
and deciding that
this person is going

328
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,251
to be her friend
is enough for Sarah

329
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,878
because she doesn't
really have friends

330
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,172
and doesn't really know
how to go about it.

331
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,133
And it changes her whole
dynamic because all of a sudden,

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,095
there is a friend in
this friendless world.

333
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,430
[music playing]

334
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,806
Am I?

335
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,516
Don't look.

336
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,854
Poor things come out without
a pair of gloves to cool her.

337
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,230
You all right?

338
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,566
You look white as a sheet.

339
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,444
That woman is wearing my dress.

340
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,739
Excuse me.

341
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,615
Excuse me.

342
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,699
Where did you get that?

343
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,076
<i>That is</i> my <i>dress.</i>

345
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,578
She must have given it
to the dhobi for washing.

346
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,163
What?

347
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,415
Well, they have a little
habit of subletting the best

348
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,669
outfits for the weekend.

349
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,253
Get your [inaudible]

350
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,630
Ah, dinner.

351
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,383
How Jolly.

352
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah, me and Olivia.

353
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,135
It's always a risk
when you've obviously,

354
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,971
when you first
meet other actors.

355
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,598
What the chemistry
is going to be like,

356
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,225
how you're going to get on.

357
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,851
And thankfully me
and Olivia seem

358
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,063
to get on like a house
on fire off camera

359
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,860
as well she makes me laugh and I
hope, I think I make her laugh.

360
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,905
She certainly seems to laugh at
this stuff, this silly, stupid

361
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,740
stuff I'm saying half the time.

362
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,827
There is a special
thing between um--

363
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,746
whether that's because we're
playing brother and sister.

364
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
Um, yeah, there's
a slight, there's

365
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,917
a deeper bond between us anyway.

366
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,628
My sister, Madeleine.

367
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,256
God knows we don't get
to choose our families.

368
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,799
Where are we going?

369
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,592
It's the first
night of the season.

370
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,386
The club, where else?

371
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,303
Alice, I'm Madeleine.

372
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,933
Yes, she knows.

373
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,602
You are even
prettier than he said.

374
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,854
Who?

375
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
Well, your brother of course.

376
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,777
I think this has got to feel
like one of her last chances.

377
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,990
And I think that's why she
puts so much energy into it

378
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,619
and gives him so many chances,
because he's you know,

379
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,457
he's not an easy nut
to crack, essentially.

380
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,877
[door slams]

381
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:12,855
So I got your note.

382
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,899
I was beginning to
think you'd never ask.

383
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,404
I think to give
the story energy,

384
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,573
I think it needs to
be that, you know,

385
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,036
she feels that this might be
her last chance of you know,

386
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:34,251
avoiding singledom and
spinsterhood which, you know,

387
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,421
had a real-- I mean,
she's meant to be sort

388
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,173
of lying about her age already.

389
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,054
I mean, I think she's sort of
playing on hopefully her more

390
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,933
youthful looks to try and snare
someone before things droop.

391
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,642
[laughter]

392
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,976
[music playing]

393
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,980
I believe it's called
the grizzly bear.

394
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,398
Really?

395
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,026
You still do that.

396
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,737
They do in this antique land.

397
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:06,116
Well, they're
doing it all wrong.

398
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,035
Hey.

399
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,495
What?

400
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,414
No self pity.

401
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,001
Cardinal sin, remember.

402
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,002
I remember.

403
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,969
On your feet, Saul.

404
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,470
[inaudible]

405
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,514
--[inaudible] sexy dance
called the grizzly bear.

406
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:36,230
So step, hop, skip, hop,
then back, and go rawr.

407
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,649
This is all for your benefit.

408
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,110
You do see that, don't you?

409
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,279
One of the strange things
about empire was actually

410
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,657
there were quite a lot
of Scots who came out.

411
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,450
Quite a bit of
Irish who came out,

412
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
quite a bit of
Welsh who came out.

413
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,454
And you could almost
say-- and I guess

414
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,541
I'm trying to say-- that
one of the things that

415
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,252
kept the Union together,
one of the things that

416
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,298
kept Britain together um,
uh was this idea of empire.

417
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,259
That actually, a young Scotsman
could go out and make something

418
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,305
of himself in India or Burma.

419
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,139
Armitage!

420
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,017
Look, that, that's me.

421
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,852
You're in tea?

422
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,520
Oh well, I am now.

423
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,230
<i>That's my uncle's business.</i>

424
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,481
You uncle?

425
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,232
Stafford Armitage?

426
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:20,941
Aye!

427
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,151
Do you know him?

428
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,278
So I guess when
Ian gets there, he--

429
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,071
brown eyed and bushy
tailed, sort of wants

430
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,074
to get to know the British
establishment in [inaudible].

431
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,035
So he comes across sort
of everyone really.

432
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,578
I mean, the first
episode, basically,

433
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,372
he's trying to find his uncle.

434
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,417
He really is the most
excellent fellow, mostly

435
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:44,924
in the morning between the
hours of 9:00 and 11:00.

436
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,261
[snoring]

437
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,722
Oh Christ.

438
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,391
Ralph kind of takes him
under his wing a little bit

439
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,393
when he finds out that
he's a good rider.

440
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,189
Ian's a brilliant horse rider
and there's a [inaudible]

441
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,066
Scene, which Ian actually wins.

442
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,319
And I think that
sort of propels him

443
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:09,573
into the club more than just
who's this guy sort of thing,

444
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,116
you know?

445
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,535
He becomes part of the
scene and has a little drink

446
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,120
and they have a party in there.

447
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,416
And uh, also because Cynthia,
Julie Walter's character

448
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,170
is quite fond of Stanford
Armitage, Ian's uncle.

449
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,214
She kind of takes
him under his wing

450
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,801
as the story goes
on as well and wants

451
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:34,515
to sort of teach him the
ropes of how to act in India.

452
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:40,187
But Ian kind of wasn't expecting
to be told to act in a way

453
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,691
that he is expected to
as a British, um, person.

454
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,318
And he starts to
rub up against that.

455
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,278
And I think that's when.
as the tipping point

456
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,198
for Ian as the
person that he wanted

457
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,577
to be in India and the
person that he kind of wants

458
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,539
to be after he realizes
the reality of it.

459
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,917
Imperial India, British
India had many aspects.

460
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,836
Sure, there was
the political side,

461
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,671
but there was also
the business side.

462
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,758
A lot of people went out there
and made money on the railways

463
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,263
or in [inaudible] or
cotton or growing tea.

464
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,516
And I think it's
interesting to have

465
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:21,937
a story in the mix
about a Scotsman

466
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,523
who tries to run a business
and who finds himself

467
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,318
in conflict with a local
Indian businessman.

468
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,197
And in many ways, that's
an omen of things to come.

469
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,200
That's even better than
you said in your letters.

470
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,870
Well, I'm no one to brag.

471
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,456
And this land is all yours?

472
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:45,044
No, no, other fellow
owns this stretch.

473
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,837
Was he at the club?

474
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,339
Good god I should hope not, no.

475
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,425
No, he's a local chap uh.

476
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,801
Local?

477
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,429
Native.

478
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,221
Really?

479
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,389
They can do that.

480
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:02,227
Oh, they do as they
please nowadays.

481
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,481
The Dalal parents--
Darius and Roshana.

482
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,649
We've got Roshan Seth
is playing Darius

483
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,737
and Lillete Dubey
is playing Roshana.

484
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:16,658
And they're two wonderful ,
actors from India living in ,

485
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:22,081
Mumbai and Roshan's
coming from New Delhi.

486
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,501
And for all of
us, and for me, it

487
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,337
felt important that we have
Indiana actors, not just

488
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,797
British Asians in the mix.

489
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,633
Not just Malaysian
Indians in the mix.

490
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,845
To give, I think, to ground the
show, to give it authenticity.

491
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,972
And they've certainly
brought that.

492
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,142
I think they bring a reality
and warmth of feeling

493
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,728
to that Indian family.

494
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,106
As soon as we step
into their home,

495
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,900
this is a family and a house
that we can believe in.

496
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,318
And I think a lot
of it is because

497
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,278
of what they bring to that.

498
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,197
Anyway, there's no point
unpacking everything

499
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,117
when we don't know
what's happening, huh.

500
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,493
Just because a
few Britishes are

501
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,203
afraid of the sun,
why we all have

502
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,621
to march up to the
top of the hill

503
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,123
like the grand old Duke of York.

504
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,499
It's because your
brother here--

505
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,167
Pappy, I don't need
you to defend me.

506
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,170
Your brother, the
esteemed junior clerk

507
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,964
is compelled to come.

508
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,674
You should say no.

509
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,050
Then what huh?

510
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,678
Your mommy's too old
to beg in the street.

511
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,972
You sister is too pretty and--

512
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,849
Your daddy is too blind.

513
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,309
So funny.

514
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,645
So my character
is a bit of a geek.

515
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,605
She's always reading a book.

516
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,734
So she's kind of always
sitting in a corner somewhere

517
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,281
or she kind of just gets in
the way a bit of everyone.

518
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,324
And my brothers and
sisters are always

519
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,492
running around everywhere.

520
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,035
My mum's always cooking.

521
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,247
So we're all just really
busy doing different things.

522
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:51,044
When I set about trying
to write an Indian family

523
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:55,549
at first, I thought a lot about
who they should be and what,

524
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,093
cultural background
they should come from.

525
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,179
And it struck me
that the Parsis are

526
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,391
a very interesting community
particularly at that point.

527
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,852
They were a community that did
very well under the British.

528
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,315
They were a small
community, even then.

529
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,027
And they had very ambivalent
feelings about the British.

530
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,030
On the one hand,
they were some, uh,

531
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,116
quite powerful pro-independence
figures amongst them.

532
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,453
On the other hand, they
were fearful of what

533
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,914
would happen to them
once the British left,

534
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,541
and they felt that the British
were a sheltering presence.

535
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,502
I think there's a feeling
of energy about the show.

536
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,838
Afeeling of something dying.

537
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,926
And the Whelans as a family
are afraid for their future.

538
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:43,305
And when I look at
the Parsis, I think

539
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,308
I'm right in saying that they
can no longer even be classed

540
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,770
as a community in India, because
their numbers have dropped off.

541
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,981
They're now considered a tribe.

542
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,025
And in a sense,
they're a community

543
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,029
that is if not quite
dying, then endangered.

544
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:03,033
And so in a way, I think that
the Dalals and the Whelans

545
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,327
are two families who are
fighting for their future,

546
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,079
they're fighting
for their lives.

547
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,874
They have more in common with
each other, than they realize.

548
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:15,379
And I think they both have
more complicated attitudes

549
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:20,634
to the politics of the day
than might at first appear.

550
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:26,431
Also the Parsis spoke English,
which is quite useful for us.

551
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,058
And it just seemed
like an opportunity

552
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,812
to come shine a spotlight on
this slightly under explored

553
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,438
part of India.

554
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,398
This is it.

555
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,316
This is it.

556
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,943
This is why.

557
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,907
This is it in action, the
British sense of fair play.

558
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,742
[laughter]

559
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,910
[Shout]

560
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,370
Sometimes when
we do our scenes,

561
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,956
Roshan and I always,
often feel that, you know,

562
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,040
these lines are too clean.

563
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,542
Indians don't talk like that.

564
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,211
They tend to talk over
each other, overlap more,

565
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,296
and you know.

566
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,840
So, which makes it real as well.

567
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,426
I know it's very difficult
for the sound people,

568
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,678
but it's how they talk.

569
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,389
They don't wait, they're
not polite like the English.

570
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,474
They won't wait for someone
to complete something.

571
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,643
If they have something to
say, they just say it over.

572
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,065
So I really like
the representation

573
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,693
because I think
they're very fair

574
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,196
and they have their foibles
and Darius has his weaknesses,

575
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,531
you know, for the English.

576
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,658
And she's very naive,
doesn't know much.

577
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,035
Because that's how she would be.

578
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,704
And yet, she's a very
strong-minded woman,

579
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,833
within the confines of her home.

580
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,169
She's a little naive which
makes her very endearing,

581
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,838
but she's also very much
the woman of the house.

582
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,299
And she controls things
as well as her husband.

583
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,721
It's a lovely mix.

584
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,848
It's a lovely mix
of being rooted

585
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,809
in where we are in our culture.

586
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:57,230
And yet, you can see where
these kids are going to go.

587
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,985
You know, we let
them-- we get upset

588
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,528
when they're getting
too independent,

589
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,405
but we've allowed them.

590
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,074
We've brought them up like that.

591
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,701
Which is how it should
see be, I think, you know.

592
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,289
How it is even today, that makes
it very contemporary actually.

593
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:25,008
I really, really wanted this
to look period, India wise.

594
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,094
Which sounds ridiculous,
but of course,

595
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,262
today, India like
any other country,

596
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:35,227
there is a huge proponent
towards polyester.

597
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:40,440
Anything that's easy to
wash and easy to dry.

598
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,151
Fortunately, India still has a
thing called the [inaudible],

599
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,238
which is government run.

600
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,408
Where, which are basically
workshops for villagers

601
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,034
to sell their wares.

602
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,870
So we're talking about hand
loomed fabrics, which has

603
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,123
been going on for a long time.

604
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,377
And they are <i>as</i> near
to what you would

605
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,547
you would have gotten in 1930s
as you could now get today.

606
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:09,052
So in fact we imported most of
the clothes from [inaudible].

607
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,180
All the traditional stuff,
which is Dhotis and [inaudible]

608
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:19,396
And undershirts and , and we
imported those from Mumbai.

609
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,816
Thank God, they still do
them and it looks great.

610
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:28,363
The Indian women stuff we
tended to find here in Penang.

611
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,909
And we're fortunate enough to
find a shop that had old stock.

612
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,705
And it had wood block
prints, lot of cotton.

613
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,915
I've kept away from the
silks unless the people were

614
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,210
very, very rich, which
also have the added

615
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,922
benefit of looking broken down
the minute you put them on.

616
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,799
Just like the men's
suits, which we've

617
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,427
used natural-- and the
European men's suits,

618
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,678
we've used natural fibers.

619
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,097
So it's cottons
and linens, again,

620
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,476
to give you that crumpled
look because you,

621
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,353
we know what it's like being
in this humidity and this heat.

622
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,731
Your clothes look
fabulous for five minutes

623
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,275
after you step out
of your front door.

624
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,153
And then for the rest of the
day, you're hanging in rags.

625
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,114
And I really wanted to get
that across on this film,

626
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,825
and I think and
hope we've done it.

627
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,329
[music playing]

628
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:30,717
--[inaudible] Is that
her do you think?

629
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,053
The club, certainly,
this is the one place

630
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,350
where we see
Cynthia's rule of iron

631
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:44,523
as far as dress code
and general appearance.

632
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:51,905
So having established
the early '30s look, ,

633
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,325
the next thing was to make it
look as though it was real.

634
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,370
And slightly more
difficult was trying

635
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,205
to make it look a little
bit like most of it

636
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,166
was made in India, which
of course it would've been.

637
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,877
Very few people had the money
to import their clothing

638
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,504
from Europe.

639
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:12,050
So, that was a
challenge, , and in fact,

640
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,804
worked brilliantly well simply
because we managed to find

641
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:21,017
the people here who could copy
but of course, the copying,

642
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,478
you always get a slight
sort of variation on a theme

643
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,439
by copying, which is
exactly what I wanted.

644
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,234
And so therefore, I
think it looks very real.

645
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,154
So the thing about the
club is that we have,

646
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,573
sundowners if you like.

647
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,324
So during the day,
anybody went to the club,

648
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,201
and they wore
normal day clothes.

649
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,996
And then in the
evening, dress code

650
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,125
was, if you had it-- because
this is what everybody did

651
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,085
at home-- you wore white tie.

652
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:51,756
And we were on a cusp here
, because in fact, by 1936,

653
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,967
dinnerjackets were
much more common.

654
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,636
And black tie, as
opposed to white tie,

655
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,805
brought in by the Prince
of Wales, particularly.

656
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,223
And he was one of
the first people

657
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,436
to wear black tie when
white tie de rigueur

658
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,770
and caused a scandal.

659
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,064
But of course, as
these things always do,

660
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,942
it filtered down through
the market very quickly

661
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,778
and everybody took it up
because it was more comfortable.

662
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,074
Soft collars, still bloody
bow ties, but soft collars.

663
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,869
And , just easier,
easier clothing.

664
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:28,251
We talked about
various ways of,

665
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:36,134
of making this level of
smartness and uprightness

666
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,055
not looking starchy
and not looking staid.

667
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,391
And it just sort of
helps that, obviously

668
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,268
makes a great designer,
but also the '30s

669
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:50,398
has such a kind of flamboyance
in a way, in a way.

670
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,152
You know it's, a lot of,
you know, all of the clothes

671
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,737
are making statements.

672
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,489
That's what great, it's
what's so great for costumes.

673
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:08,249
It's that you, even in
quite a stuff landscape,

674
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:14,214
there's something debonair
about all of the characters.

675
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,590
But particularly.

676
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,385
And it was actually
Anand who then took us

677
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,763
into a further place
which was this concept

678
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,975
of the black and
white and two worlds.

679
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:32,315
And undulating between the two.

680
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:36,403
I haven't done my scenes
in Indian costumes yet.

681
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,987
So I can't wait.

682
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,213
Hungry?

683
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,965
Yeah.

684
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,175
Keep it to myself.

685
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,261
I don't think much of
the food of the club.

686
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,346
Yeah.

687
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,723
Except the Yorkshire pud.

688
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,223
Naturally.

689
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,311
Nick's amazing, and he
had a very strong idea

690
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,315
that he was going to make
everything out in Malaysia.

691
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,944
And so there was very much
a sense from the costume

692
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,446
that you see of the
other characters

693
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:24,534
that it's copied from "Vogue."

694
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,871
And so it doesn't have--
and I think that's, that's

695
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,414
how it would have
looked at the time.

696
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,041
People would've taken
ripped out pages

697
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,960
from sort of American
and British publications

698
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:40,049
and been like, please
can you make this.

699
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,719
And Madeline very much wasn't
one of those characters.

700
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,930
And, you know, basically
there's-- we've sort of moved

701
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,224
together kind of two images.

702
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:52,479
Because I think there's been
a sort of image of Madeline

703
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:58,526
which-- basically I wanted
her to be sort of-- I

704
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,404
wanted her sort of sexuality
to be sort of expressed

705
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,156
in the clothes.

706
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,825
But I think in my mind, I had
her as slightly overly sexual

707
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,035
perhaps.

708
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,578
And what I love
about what he's done

709
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:16,336
is he's created her as
incredibly elegant and quite

710
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,380
strikingly American I think,
in quite a sort of modern way,

711
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,715
hopefully.

712
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,760
Um I think in my
first email to him,

713
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,346
I was like, I just see her
in sort of pinks and beiges

714
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,348
and her clothes all sort
of kind of falling off.

715
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,600
Which isn't actually
what he's done,

716
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,935
but I love what he's done.

717
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,312
He's done kind of,
it's more monochrome,

718
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,189
it's more long lines.

719
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,073
Which also sort of shows
sort of to a certain extent

720
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,115
how powerful she is.

721
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,178
Memsahib, everything
is prepared.

722
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,014
So we had this
difficult scenario

723
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,016
where Cynthia is
setting up the opening

724
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,518
of the club for the season.

725
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,938
And Paul had written
into the script

726
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,649
that she is wearing
a boiler suit, which

727
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,901
is absolutely fine for period.

728
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,487
Not normally worn by
women of her background,

729
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,989
but there we are.

730
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,074
But a sensible thing to
wear if you're cleaning up

731
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:33,454
after a winter of mess of the
club where it hasn't been used.

732
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,206
But then at the
end of the scene,

733
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,252
she has to open it
up and step out of it

734
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,588
and underneath is
an evening dress.

735
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,173
Well, that's not an
easy thing to do.

736
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,053
Um, but I did find an
extraordinary, completely

737
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,265
contemporary fabric
here in Penang

738
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,225
which looks like beading.

739
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,353
It was a deco pattern,
and it was made

740
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,439
of a [inaudible] synthetic.

741
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:04,319
And I designed the dress so
that it was almost Grecian.

742
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,488
So therefore, it was
just a lot of again,

743
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,574
dropped waist, but a
lot of folded fabrics.

744
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,201
And because this
fabric is plastic,

745
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,829
it, it just falls into shape.

746
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:19,250
And bless her heart, Julie
got it absolutely right.

747
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,337
She practiced
unzipping, stepping out

748
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,922
of it, whipping it
off, and there she

749
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,298
was in full evening dress.

750
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,424
And it looks wonderful.

751
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,761
[music playing]

752
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,098
Let's get on with it then.

753
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,869
I think the challenge
of the picture

754
00:40:55,036 --> 00:41:00,333
was not being unreliant
on hired goods.

755
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,337
It was knowing we had to
produce every single garment

756
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,881
on the series.

757
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:12,261
We only imported stiff collars,
braces, men's suspenders,

758
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,013
the things you can't get here.

759
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,851
So the challenge for me really
was getting stuff done in time.

760
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,772
Because we pretty soon after
We started the first block,

761
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,566
we were up here
at the Crag doing

762
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,404
eveningwear-- we were doing--
and having big crowds.

763
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,197
It was actually a
matter of producing

764
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,574
the sheer quantity of costumes.

765
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,326
And I haven't worked
it out yet, but I

766
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,914
know we've made over 500
costumes for this show, which

767
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,541
is pretty amazing.

768
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,711
And most of those were made
in the first three months.

769
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:49,298
And all made by little
workshops and individual people,

770
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,467
not mass made in factories.

771
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,137
[music playing]

772
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,600
Sumitra! [inaudible].

773
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,103
You know, I mean, that
is England if ever there

774
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,524
was England, the Wisteria
sort of climbing down

775
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,737
the balcony into the veranda
and all that sort of says

776
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,657
all part of that sort of
[inaudible] nostalgia.

777
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:20,997
I needed to find those quirky,
quirky buildings you know,

778
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,624
designed in the
sort of, designed

779
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:28,254
in the British style which
really, really characterized

780
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,339
the hill stations in India.

781
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,010
Malaysia shares very much
the same colonial history

782
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:38,264
as Britain through very
much the same period.

783
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:42,518
So the buildings and the
life and the atmosphere

784
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,854
are incredibly similar.

785
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,150
You know, one of the great
discoveries of Penang Hill

786
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,819
where we're filming a
lot of this was that,

787
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:57,742
up here we've got a string
of buildings which were built

788
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,412
by the British during their
imperial days here and which

789
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,705
have been largely untouched.

790
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,837
We had some great finds both
in the club at Crag Hotel

791
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,007
and also in Chotipool
which when we found

792
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,467
it was fairly run down.

793
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:20,890
But the designer has
restored it to real glory.

794
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:25,228
And I think there is an
uncanny resemblance between

795
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:29,607
the architectural style of ,
the locations that we're using

796
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,652
of Chotipool And the kind of
things that were being built

797
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,905
in similar of the time.

798
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,782
There was a lot of
muck to the building

799
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,868
which [inaudible] was very
sniffy about in similar

800
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,495
at the time.

801
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:47,834
But it has been
caught in aspect here.

802
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,672
So I think it's possible to say
that there is nowhere else that

803
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:59,178
quite delivers the atmosphere
of the hill station in quite

804
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,056
the way that we
found here in Penang.

805
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:08,396
I was a little dubious
about duplicating Shimla here

806
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,148
in Penang Hill.

807
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:16,320
But when I drove around, I said
this could be a lane in Shimla.

808
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,656
Stop here please.

809
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,034
The, the key locations that
were always in my head when I

810
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:29,125
was scouting around that I
knew, I had to find and I

811
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:33,671
wasn't going to be able to
build because they required real

812
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,886
scale I suppose were
firstly the British club,

813
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,848
which is run by Julie Walters
and in many ways is the sort

814
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:48,477
of social centre of our show.

815
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,189
So that was always a really
important location to me.

816
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,067
And when I came
here, it was really

817
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,405
sort of the most exciting day
of the whole adventure in a way.

818
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,325
It was covered in jungle,
but it was clear that it was

819
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,204
a spectacular , location.

820
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:13,419
--[inaudible] Penang in October
2013, looking for location,

821
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,506
because Charlie had previously
seen, ,with Dan and Paul,

822
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,467
the writer.

823
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:20,885
And discovered
this fantastic sort

824
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,223
of ex-hotel which we
turned into the club

825
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,060
on the hill, the Crag Hotel
which was really the turning

826
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,938
point on the location
[inaudible] really

827
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,274
which we then we could
actually do it in Penang.

828
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,946
Um, and then other pieces, other
colonial houses on Penang Hill

829
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,530
fell into place.

830
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,368
The first day I arrived
here and saw this location up

831
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,621
on the hill, up on
Penang Hill, I suppose,

832
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,916
I kind of imagined it when I
was, you know, got the script

833
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,877
and was working on it before
it came out and everything.

834
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,381
But it's far more
beautiful and it's stunning

835
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,842
and you, it just so helps.

836
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,971
It's very, very real,
it's the real deal.

837
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,724
And we haven't had anything
like this for I don't how long,

838
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,142
30 years.

839
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,895
And then it was a bit
of location in India.

840
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,605
And then the rest was
done in the studio.

841
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,234
Here, we have this amazing
location on Penang Hill.

842
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,030
People are going to want
to go and stay in that club

843
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,407
when they see this.

844
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,284
It's so divine, you can
see right through it

845
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,370
out into the jungle and
it's just beautiful.

846
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,331
It feels, it's so important
that it feels so real.

847
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,958
Half your job's done.

848
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,502
I walk through there and I
feel like, here I am, you

849
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,505
know, in the Simla,
the Royal Simla Club.

850
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,091
The second location where I
knew we would require scale

851
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,343
and that I couldn't build
was the Viceregal Lodge.

852
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,433
That building is
very, very particular

853
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,855
in Simla and unreproducible,
but what I needed

854
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,399
was a building of
grandeur and scale.

855
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,614
And so the old governor's
mansion in Georgetown

856
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,117
had exactly that.

857
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,662
And was built for exactly the
same purpose as the Viceregal

858
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,414
Lodge in Simla.

859
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,584
So although we've got lots of
, English colonial buildings,

860
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,879
what we haven't got really
was an Indian quarter in,

861
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,756
in Georgetown, in Penang.

862
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:27,261
It was not a concern, but you
do find yourself wondering OK,

863
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,973
how's that going to work.

864
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,560
And that was completely
dispelled the first time

865
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,312
I walked on set.

866
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,149
Because the first set that we
were filming on was the bazaar,

867
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:46,572
was the most Indian
of our locations.

868
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,451
So we took a car
park which was in back

869
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:54,038
of the, of the museum which
has some buildings on it

870
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:58,167
and created the Indian
quarter-- the Dalal house,

871
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,170
and the bazaar, and the
markets, and some streets

872
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,090
and temples in that car park.

873
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,009
[music playing]

874
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:22,274
I remember going on
the set with Roshan

875
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,736
and there's a
particular bird-- I

876
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,240
think it's called the coyle--
there's a particular bird that

877
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,325
starts singing.

878
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,036
And he went oh,
that's good, that's,

879
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,788
that's the bird that
wakes me up at home.

880
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,957
And then he looked at the
sound department and said,

881
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,417
you should get that.

882
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,504
And that's when I thought,
OK, this is, things

883
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,297
like that, I mean, the
art department can't

884
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,050
plant the birds in the trees.

885
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,593
We're onto something here.

886
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,638
The bazaar is so, like
I said, so controlling.

887
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,932
So you have to think of it
as a production [inaudible].

888
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,226
So it's so controllable,
and it's got the flavour,

889
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,937
it's got all the
noise and the hustle

890
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,149
and the bustle and the
chaos of an Indian bazaar.

891
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,236
There's always things going on.

892
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,779
Like, there's chickens
running around,

893
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,531
and everyone's running
all over the place.

894
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,908
And it's just really
like chaotic, but like,

895
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,326
controlled chaotic.

896
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,245
I don't know, I kind of like it.

897
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:20,875
You almost wish that you could
take every single person that's

898
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,919
going to watch it on telly
and take them and go,

899
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,964
this is, just walk through
the Indian quarter.

900
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,382
It's not CGI.

901
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,218
There's a-- I'm staring
at a goat's balls here.

902
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:36,182
I mean, we've, we've got
just a real sensory overload.

903
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,225
I feel very much
like my house is

904
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:43,230
on a very busy street with a
lot of pokey, nosy neighbors.

905
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,149
Like this is [inaudible].

906
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:45,691
BYE bye.

907
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:46,650
Not yet.

908
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,110
Don't go yet.

909
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,571
Come here [inaudible].

910
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,281
The family home was
just breathtaking.

911
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,159
I walked in and I
kind of had a moment

912
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:59,705
where I though I think I'm
about to cry at how beautiful

913
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:00,414
this is.

914
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,250
[crowd noise]

915
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,385
So there's a lot of kind
of bustle of informality,

916
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,638
of people crashing
in and out, which

917
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,724
I think the directors
have realized beautiful.

918
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,684
And that's a big
contrast with what

919
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,811
you find at
Chotipool, the Whelans

920
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,396
home which is much more formal.

921
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,858
There are servants, and
everyone is a little bit more

922
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,945
on their guard, a little
bit more self aware.

923
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:35,824
So I think, yes, again, I think
the houses and the atmosphere

924
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,827
of the houses reflect on just
the way there is two different

925
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,746
families , functioning.

926
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:46,710
I think the critical thing
about shooting in real

927
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:54,176
locations is that , one, we
can get a movement in and out

928
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,761
of buildings.

929
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,807
It's a very natural space
for the actors to inhabit

930
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:05,396
and really become
, these people.

931
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:12,486
And what I think it does is it
gives the sense of real people

932
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:16,156
living real lives
in real places.

933
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:20,536
And the hope is that will give
the whole show the authenticity

934
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,621
that we've been striving for.

935
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:27,167
I mean it's a full on
visceral experience.

936
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,588
I feel like I'm really
glad that we're somewhere

937
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,715
that is this foreign to me.

938
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,550
Because that helps.

939
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,511
It helps because it feels other.

940
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:42,182
It doesn't feel like a
studio on the edge of London.

941
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,019
A cordon sanitaire
around the Indian quarter,

942
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,522
and everyone is to remain
indoors while officers

943
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,357
conduct a search.

944
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,735
30, any paperwork for signing?

945
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:53,485
N0w's your chance.

946
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,825
I remember doing
that speech when I've

947
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,786
set up the cholera [inaudible].

948
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:07,666
And all these faces
looking up at me

949
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,629
and trying to make
these clerks wake up

950
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,214
in the, dozing in the heat.

951
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,885
It brought so much
to that scene.

952
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:22,306
It's not the same doing it
with two guys in front of you.

953
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,727
There was a huge hall,
and, and loads of people.

954
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:30,564
And I suppose that's one of
the fantastic things that,

955
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:37,321
production have done is
just brought this scale,

956
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,239
so all of all of
our imaginations--

957
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,576
certainly in my case--
have been expanded.

958
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,246
You know, , it's richer, bigger
than I could have thought

959
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,208
of when you're sitting at home
in London reading a script.

960
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,921
Locations I shoot
at, I'm in the middle

961
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,799
of the jungle in a big,
beautiful, stately house

962
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,427
or a big-- it would be
exactly the same there if we'd

963
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,513
found locations in
India, they would

964
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,639
look no different to this.

965
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,182
In fact, probably not as good.

966
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,518
And this is more authentic.

967
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,521
I wondered why we were shooting
in Malaysia and not in India.

968
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,440
But I can see that this
is absolutely perfect

969
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,609
because it's kind of untouched.

970
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,945
And it's the real thing.

971
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,614
And it must be hard to
find that anywhere else.

972
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,074
And also it's great
being in Penang.

973
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,367
It's fabulous.

974
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,369
I was a little
concerned because

975
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,330
of spending many, many
summer holidays there.

976
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,292
I'm basically from Delhi,
so it's [inaudible].

977
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,713
And , it's very historical.

978
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,840
The capital was there,
it's the summer capital

979
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,550
for so many years.

980
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,596
So I was a little concerned,
but once I came here and I saw--

981
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:53,021
that's the beauty of all these
, colonial outposts, the towns.

982
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,985
A lot of them, especially like
Penang, which is a little away.

983
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,487
A lot of this
architecture is preserved.

984
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:06,410
So , and of course I think
the production has done a lot

985
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:11,623
to restore and preserve
a lot of the things.

986
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,710
In fact, to make it look good.

987
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,336
I think some of the
buildings are nice,

988
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,006
but I think that
a lot of money was

989
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,758
spent in destroying
them as well, which is

990
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,677
great for the country itself.

991
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,598
We've been filming
in Suffolk House which

992
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:32,519
is the location for
Viceregal Lodge.

993
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:37,191
Already it's very different to
the bazaar because physically,

994
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,987
the bazaar set occupied
a much smaller space.

995
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,656
Again, that's a testament
to the art department

996
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,158
and what they managed
to do with it.

997
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,163
You turn a corner
and it's so tight,

998
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,498
but it's teeming with life.

999
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,291
But then here, it
opens out a lot more.

1000
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:58,003
And I think that's
reflective, again,

1001
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,716
of what it was like to go up to
the-- what it would have been

1002
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,011
like to go up to the Viceregal
Lodge and just some easy space.

1003
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:20,651
And before this set I've
also been the location where

1004
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:25,239
we were shooting Gorton Castle
which is kind of more of the,

1005
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:29,451
I guess the nuts and bolts
of the civil service.

1006
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:33,914
Slightly less polish and
slightly more packed.

1007
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:38,919
So in a way, my journey
here has been from home

1008
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:44,716
to my workplace at
the start of the show

1009
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,387
before the events of
episode one really kick off.

1010
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,013
And then suddenly
I'm a complete fish

1011
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,182
out of water in this place.

1012
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,643
And I think it's really
nice to open up that space.

1013
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,061
And I think that
will carry on when

1014
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,564
we get to other
locations like Chotipool

1015
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:04,736
and the Crag where
Cynthia's clubhouse is.

1016
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,990
Chotipool was, in a way,
the most difficult location

1017
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,741
to find.

1018
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,995
Chotipool is Ralph
and Alice's house.

1019
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,039
It provides the sort of
emotional center of the house.

1020
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,544
It's a sort of
Eden, a fantasy, ,

1021
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,089
and was the lost
location that we found.

1022
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,389
We'd almost landed on
buildings that, you know,

1023
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,391
on reflection
weren't quite right.

1024
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:39,646
They either had the scale, but
they didn't have the romance.

1025
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,275
Or they have
extraordinary interiors,

1026
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:46,111
but were unshootable in.

1027
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:53,243
And right at the last moment,
I was taken to a house that we

1028
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,331
had to fight through
jungle to get to, ,

1029
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,083
that had been uninhabited I
think probably for about 2O

1030
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,585
or 3O years.

1031
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:06,214
It was completely overgrown,
pretty inaccessible.

1032
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,468
And I was shown it by
the designer Rob Harris

1033
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,887
with a pretty heavy heart.

1034
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:17,184
It seemed to be fairly clear
he didn't want me to choose it.

1035
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:23,190
So , however, you know, after
about two or three hours

1036
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,234
thought, we sort of went back
and both of us looked at it

1037
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,736
and looked at each other.

1038
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,072
And you were with
me Dan as well.

1039
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:34,201
And it became apparent
that with a lot of work

1040
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:40,332
and a lot of clearing and
renovation, that actually,

1041
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,125
it was the perfect location.

1042
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,544
It was isolated,
it was romantic,

1043
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,506
it was on the top of the hill.

1044
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:52,219
And that , we should
be ambitious ,

1045
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,181
and choose it despite all
the logistical difficulties

1046
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,476
and design difficulties that
it was going to throw at us.

1047
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,646
And I think it was
the right decision.

1048
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,191
Going up to
Chotipool and granted,

1049
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,611
we were still at the stage
where the flower beds were being

1050
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:12,948
dug for the first time to,
to create something that

1051
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,784
had never been made before.

1052
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:19,746
And it took my breath
away, just the enormity

1053
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,248
of what was going on.

1054
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,583
I mean, the same with
the club <i>as</i> well.

1055
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,420
I mean, it's a whole complex
of beautiful old buildings

1056
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,755
that are being
taken and elevated

1057
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,842
to a level which is like almost
beyond what they were when they

1058
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,095
were first built. I
mean, it's extraordinary,

1059
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,223
absolutely extraordinary
undertaking.

1060
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,853
And to think, at any stage when
we're down here, attempting

1061
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,817
something, somewhere up there,
they're erecting a chandelier

1062
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,695
or doing some huge undertaking.

1063
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,323
It's extraordinary, just
the scale and detail

1064
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,702
of all of this.

1065
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:05,500
And the challenges to make
the level of commitment,

1066
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,253
the performances match that.

1067
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,715
I loved Paul's writing
when I first read it.

1068
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:17,012
I loved the-- I had the first
three episodes I think came.

1069
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:21,475
And, I just found
it-- it's fascinating,

1070
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,978
and it's the kind of writing
that comes in and goes out

1071
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,564
rather than how do
I make this work?

1072
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:32,194
You know, it's
very real, and easy

1073
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,197
to make conversational,
which is really important.

1074
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:43,246
Paul's writing was vivid
and funny, and dark.

1075
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,458
And all of the characters
had something to say.

1076
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:52,714
And none of them shied away
from being interesting.

1077
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:56,218
It's difficult. It's difficult
with so many characters

1078
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,763
to make them all rounded,
to have them well

1079
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,225
edged, to have their own
graphs, their own stories,

1080
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,977
uh, which of course
are all interconnected.

1081
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,687
But to do that is not easy.

1082
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,815
Everything is in
Paul Rutman's head

1083
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,527
is why I realized when we, I
remember, Aysha and I asking

1084
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,613
him a question
about a plot thread

1085
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,824
that we'd only read
up to a certain point

1086
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,076
and there was a plot
thread dangling there.

1087
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,953
So I don't want to give it away.

1088
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,124
But I said, we asked him,
what happens with this thing.

1089
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,126
And he just kind of looked
and went, what do you

1090
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,337
think happens with this thing?

1091
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:37,801
And then he told us, and
it was completely brilliant

1092
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:41,763
and nothing like what
I would have expected.

1093
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,809
I suppose one of the
hard things for me feeling

1094
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,062
my way into the show was
to ask the question, you

1095
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,190
know, what were we doing there?

1096
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,401
What did we think
we were doing there?

1097
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:58,864
It strikes me as interesting
that so many younger people

1098
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,784
have no notion of
what the empire was.

1099
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,204
We've done a very good job
of sweeping the entire empire

1100
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,748
experience under the carpet.

1101
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:13,086
I think for my
grandparents' generation, ,

1102
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:17,757
it was for many people, it was
a huge part of their lives.

1103
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,052
For thousands of people, it
was an extraordinary, formative

1104
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,139
experience that touched them
and changed them, and changed

1105
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,183
the sense of how they
felt about themselves

1106
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,393
and how they felt
about their country.

1107
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,647
But we have done an
extraordinary job

1108
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,734
of excising that from history.

1109
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:39,154
[music playing]

1110
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,492
To the King-Emperor!

1111
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:48,205
When you say uh, when
they call out King Emperor.

1112
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:53,293
I mean, they didn't make
Victoria emperor of uh,

1113
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,421
made her specifically
the empress of India.

1114
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,758
,And it's well you know,
the jewel in the crown.

1115
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:04,554
India was very
much the possession

1116
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,056
that Britain was most proud of.

1117
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,807
I supposed it's
like the 0thers--

1118
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,311
Canada, Australia-- they sort
of didn't feel like possessions.

1119
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:16,816
They were part of us because
of the, the racial makeup

1120
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,110
of Australia and
Canada was very much

1121
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,988
of the old white, British stock.

1122
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:26,910
And India was this
amazing clash of cultures,

1123
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,205
and a synthesis of
cultures it has to be said.

1124
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,707
It wasn't, it wasn't
always harmonious,

1125
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,252
and often it was
very, very violent.

1126
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,965
But it is, at the very least,
an extraordinary synthesis,

1127
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:45,929
which is, we have made our
mark on India for a good while.

1128
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:50,100
On the left, , people feel
it's a shameful episode,

1129
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,395
that we have to
castigate ourselves over.

1130
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,772
On the right, people
feel, I think,

1131
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:01,695
a sneaking pride for the
work that we did there.

1132
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,697
For the fact that
this tiny island

1133
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,117
was capable of ruling
half the world.

1134
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,455
I think there's a
middle point which

1135
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,750
we've tried to course,
which is simply to ask,

1136
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,129
on a very human level, what did
we think we were doing there?

1137
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,256
What did we think we
were doing in India?

1138
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:28,138
What did our grandparents
imagine we were getting up to?

1139
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,973
Hello love.

1140
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,600
So many people of
that generation,

1141
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,686
when I talk to them
about what I'm doing,

1142
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,147
the first thing they say
is, we did a lot of good.

1143
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,648
We did a lot of good out there.

1144
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,651
And I think there is a
rather kind of defensive,

1145
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:47,907
rather vulnerable story
about good intentions, ,

1146
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:55,081
about disastrous blunders, and
about an improvised constantly

1147
01:03:55,248 --> 01:04:00,086
changing effort to stay on, to
stop this dream from ending.

1148
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,006
Even after people
back home in Britain

1149
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,384
had got rather tired of,
of the empire project,

1150
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,887
there was a cadre
of people in India

1151
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:11,723
and other countries who were
determined to hang onto a life

1152
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:16,436
that they loved, to a home that
they loved and couldn't imagine

1153
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,521
any other way of living.

1154
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,400
And in a way, "lndian
Summers" is the story

1155
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:27,906
of a group of people trying
not to let go of a home uh,

1156
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,325
that they'd grown up in.

1157
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:34,245
[music playing]

1158
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,706
As you may have heard, this
year's summer administration

1159
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,917
got off to a bumpy start.

1160
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,545
The man who tried to shoot
you, do they know his name?

1161
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,298
As I said, the man won't speak.

1162
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,219
Lucky for you, in
bumping into that bullet--

1163
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,470
Yes.

1164
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,515
Not so lucky for him.

1165
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,058
A man tried to kill
you [inaudible].

1166
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,643
And now Mr Dalal
and I are required

1167
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,103
to help you cover something up.

1168
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,815
So, this summer we
have to show the world

1169
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,274
we're committed to reform.

1170
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,652
One day, who knows,
Indians might be raised up

1171
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,153
to run their own affairs.

1172
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:07,946
King-Emperor.

1173
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:08,947
ALL: King Emperor.

1174
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,828
Ladies and gentlemen.

1175
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,622
Welcome to the Sipi Fair.

1176
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,207
No entry into the interior.

1177
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:22,168
I'll double lock the
doors from inside.

1178
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,045
I find myself this
morning wondering

1179
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,965
if you'd ever had any
interest in joining the higher

1180
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,466
ranks of the civil service?

1181
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,635
Head clerk?

1182
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,429
There was an
incident yesterday.

1183
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,722
We demand full independence.

1184
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,475
My sister Sooni,
she was arrested.

1185
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,728
[inaudible] you can't do this.

1186
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,147
This is how it is.

1187
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,815
One thing is given to you.

1188
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,859
Another one is taken away.

1189
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,735
Wake up Aafrin!

1190
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,405
Look at the role
you've been cast in.

1191
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,490
Marvelous Mr Dalal
who threw himself

1192
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,325
into the path of a bullet.

1193
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,954
Esteemed servant of the empire,
loyal Indian of the hill.

1194
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:58,663
<i>Soon“.</i>

1195
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,706
Wake up Aafrin!

1196
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,249
I will get you out, I promise.

1197
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,751
[music playing]

1198
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,254
I won't be taken for a fool,
If that's what you think

1199
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,755
is happening, which I
have no doubt you do,

1200
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,048
then you're very much mistaken.

1201
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,762
What if I want you to myself?

1202
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,222
He's in love.

1203
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,225
So are you.

1204
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,227
I though you'd be pleased.

1205
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,230
I thought you'd be
pleased to see me.

1206
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,650
I have heard of British men
who take Indian wives, but never

1207
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,985
the other way around.

1208
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,862
What are your intentions,
because Madeline

1209
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,281
is a high prize.

1210
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,158
All these people.

1211
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,493
What about them?

1212
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,704
Do you even know them?

1213
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:40,705
[gunshofl

1214
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,708
[scream]

1215
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,209
You came!

1216
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,135
That's my house.

1217
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,388
All I ask is that
our son should

1218
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,224
live the life that is for him.

1219
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,324
[crying]

1220
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:19,911
You're all I've got.

1221
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,412
Yes.

1222
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,206
Harry, I, I--

1223
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,041
Shall we?
