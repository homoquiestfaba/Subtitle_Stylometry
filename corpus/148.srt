1
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,721
Willard.

2
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,456
There are rats in the basement.

3
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,508
Ow!

4
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,710
Willard...

5
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,309
what are you doing?

6
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,717
l'm going to bed.

7
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,949
lt's late.

8
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,551
Yes. l'm going to bed.

9
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,959
Good night, mom.

10
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,987
What were you doing down there?

11
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,495
You, uh, said there were rats.

12
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,529
Well, did you see them?

13
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,943
Well...there aren't any rats.

14
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,310
There are.

15
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,407
All our neighbors moving away...

16
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,410
and all these new people
remodeling the houses.

17
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,913
They're stirring up rats.

18
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,419
Well...have you been
to the basement?

19
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,931
No. You know l can't.

20
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,434
l know they're there.

21
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,936
l can smell them.

22
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,930
All my life l could smell mice.

23
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,308
Smell...mice?

24
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,438
And hear them.

25
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,746
Don't you hear them down there?

26
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:43,050
lt's--it's just the wind.

27
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,852
There aren't any rats.

28
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,486
Come in here. Hmm?

29
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,487
Come in here.

30
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,981
l'm sorry l've been
such a bad mother to you.

31
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,418
Well, you've--you've been a...

32
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,685
Well, you are...
a wonderful mother.

33
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,818
lt's my fault
your life was wasted.

34
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,303
Willard.

35
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,501
What an awful name--Willard.

36
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,775
Maybe if you had
a stronger name...

37
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,009
that Frank Martin
wouldn't push you around...

38
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,487
or maybe
you'd have found a girlfriend...

39
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,854
if you had
a more handsome name--

40
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,258
Mark or Kyle or...

41
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,490
Clark.

42
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:05,263
Willard, from now on,
your name's Clark.

43
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,006
Good night, Clark.

44
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,200
Pardon me.

45
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,878
That you?

46
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,558
Sorry.
They told me to sit here.

47
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,462
Willard, he wants to see you.

48
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,956
Oh. Well, um...

49
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:23,305
Ms. Leach,
it seems that someone...

50
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,836
this girl,
is sitting at my desk.

51
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,714
M aybe t hat s Why
he Wa hts to see you

52
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,783
OK.

53
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,016
Hey. Pay attention.

54
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,977
Yeah?

55
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,987
Who's that at your desk
out there, Willard?

56
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,965
l--l don't know her.

57
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,492
Sit.

58
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,611
Who did you say that was at
your desk out there, Willard?

59
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,078
l--l--l don't know her.

60
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,716
Well, you should know, because
it's your fault she's there.

61
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,851
You've fallen
at least a week behind...

62
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,918
processing the purchase orders.

63
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,987
You know,
when that happens, Willard...

64
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,295
everything comes
to a standstill--

65
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,995
my salespeople
up on the floor...

66
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,504
shipping, receiving, inventory.

67
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,597
Everybody's standing around...

68
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,937
with their thumbs
up their asses...

69
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,443
beocause you havve a oWed
t he pu vrochase ovrdevrs

70
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,468
to bottleneck at your desk.

71
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,505
Your father built this company,
Willard.

72
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,449
Hell, your family name
is still out there...

73
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,452
on the side of the building--

74
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,579
''Martin Stiles Manufacturing.''

75
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,614
Ah, hell,
it just seems to me like...

76
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,059
that alone
would make you take...

77
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,325
a little more pride
in your work.

78
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,731
Well, l...

79
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,795
Oh, my mother is sick.

80
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,204
l see.

81
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:39,871
So, it's your mother's fault
that you've fallen behind?

82
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,973
Willard, l'm an old friend
of the family.

83
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,883
Hell, l've known your mother
since before you were born.

84
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,286
She's a fine lady, and she
deserves to be kept comfortable.

85
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,814
Your dad
was like a father to me.

86
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,158
And l promised him
that l would always...

87
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,925
look after
you and your mother...

88
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:03,060
and as long as she was alive,
you'd have a job right here.

89
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,764
And in keeping
with that promise...

90
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,932
l must insist that you find...

91
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,909
a good rest-care facility
for mom.

92
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,675
We can't afford that.

93
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:20,048
But, hell, l guess
you could always sell the house.

94
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,953
Here's an idea--l'd tear it
down and build apartments on it.

95
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:28,653
l'm sorry, Mr. Martin.
l'll--l'll--l'll...

96
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,892
l'll catch up. l'll stay late.

97
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,595
Oh, yeah. You would love that,
wouldn't you, Willard?

98
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,469
Suck up on more overtime than
it even costs me for a temp.

99
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,770
You'll catch up, all right,
asshole...

100
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,902
and you'll catch up
on your own damn time!

101
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,005
There's one thing that you will
never understand, Willard--

102
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,982
bus hess s a vrat vraoce

103
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,383
Promise or no promise,
l will not allow myself...

104
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,618
to be devoured by all of those
other rats because of you!

105
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,980
Clark!
What is it? What is it?

106
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,002
Shh, shh, shh.

107
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,504
lt's OK. lt's OK.
lt's OK. lt's OK.

108
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,709
Here we go.

109
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,778
What was all that noise?

110
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,923
Rats?

111
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,121
No.

112
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:49,931
A bird got stuck in the house
somehow, and l let it out.

113
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,300
lt's all right now,
so go back to bed.

114
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,669
What are you doing in there?

115
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,698
l'm going potty.

116
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,938
You've been in there
a long time.

117
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,173
l'm not feeling well, mom.

118
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,615
ls it loose or hard?

119
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,421
l'm OK. l'm OK.

120
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,914
So just--just go to bed.

121
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,689
Let me see.
l'm still your mother.

122
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,629
Clark! Clark!

123
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,966
You should be in bed.

124
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,941
You're feverish.

125
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,709
l get afraid, Clark.

126
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,444
Your father was in
that bathroom late that night.

127
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,615
Yes, l know. l'm never going
to do anything like that.

128
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,647
What is that on your hand?

129
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,387
lt's--it's soap.

130
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,156
lt's cooking oil.

131
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,892
Oh, Willard,
you're too old for that.

132
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,369
When will you
find yourself a girl?

133
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,413
Well, other than
getting caught in the trap...

134
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,442
you seem pretty--pretty smart.

135
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,925
You should be called...
Socrates.

136
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,928
What do you think?

137
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,955
Yeah? All right. Socrates.

138
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,710
Whoa. Like it in here? Oh.

139
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,911
Where are you going?

140
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,424
Bye, Socrates.

141
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,393
Say hello to your family.

142
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:02,264
You're reunited with
your brother and sister and mom.

143
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,468
Look. Look, everybody.

144
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,206
Food. Food for everybody.

145
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,510
There you go. Very good.

146
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,510
Bye.

147
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,617
Socrates...

148
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,460
l will never let anyone
harm you ever.

149
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,466
l promise.

150
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,469
l promise.

151
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,994
l promise.

152
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,673
Martin, l have to cover
your damn car every day.

153
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,948
''Cover my car. Cover my car.''
Ugh!

154
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,392
Do you like my new S-55,
Willard?

155
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,832
M y heW oca vr M y heW M evrocedes
saW you d vroo hg ovvevr t

156
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh.

157
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,734
Uh, yes, Mr. Martin. lt's...

158
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,771
Do you know
why l have that car?

159
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:02,151
l'm driving that 350-horsepower,
V-8 masterpiece...

160
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,645
for you
and your fellow employees.

161
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,218
You see, buyers
feel a sense of security...

162
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,956
when they can see proof...

163
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,021
that they're dealing
with a successful man.

164
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:17,092
So, when l whip into that
parking lot behind the wheel...

165
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,969
of my brand-new
Mercedes AMG-class...

166
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,670
they'll buy from us over
the slob in the Jaguar S-type.

167
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:32,082
Do you know why l can afford
to plunk down 90,000 bucks...

168
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,950
for that little edge
over the competition, Willard?

169
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,483
Because l'm a successful man!

170
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,517
Because l have never been late
for work a day in my life!

171
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,123
Because when l come to work,
l don't show up...

172
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,726
in one of my dead father's
cheap suits!

173
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,706
Because l have never
given my boss such grief.

174
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,677
Maybe it wouldn't hurt you
to find out what pleases me!

175
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,451
Are you OK?

176
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,230
Hi, Socrates.

177
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,700
lt's been a bad day.

178
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,736
Tear it, Socrates.

179
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,497
All right...

180
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,694
you teach them.

181
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,793
They listen to you, Socrates.

182
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,109
Tear it.

183
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,915
Tear it.

184
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,184
Tear it up.

185
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,603
Jeez. You're big.

186
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,701
Big Ben.

187
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,943
Do you know him, Socrates?

188
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,495
Ben, this looks like
the beginning...

189
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,292
of a beautiful friendship.

190
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,926
Tear it.

191
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,529
Tear it.

192
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,877
Tear it.

193
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,448
OK, everybody,
that was really good.

194
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,356
Speed. Speed.

195
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,657
Very good.

196
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,163
Rope...up.

197
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,725
Tear it.

198
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,864
You go down there. Go on now.

199
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,774
Down. Down. Tear it.

200
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,503

00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,482
Still.

Out.

203
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,941
One week! You've been late
for so many hours...

204
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,044
that it equals an entire week!

205
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,352
Mr. Martin, l--l'm sorry.

206
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,689
l want my week back.

207
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,250
l've discussed it with counsel.

208
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,285
l may not be able
to fire you, Willard...

209
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,663
but, by God, it is well within
my rights to administer...

210
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,691
physical disciplinary reprimand!

211
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,465
l know that you must be tired
of this excuse...

212
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,065
but what can l do?
My mother is sick.

213
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,541
You don't give a shit
about your mother!

214
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,908
lf you did, you'd show up
for work on time...

What s ha ppehed

216
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,278
You're out a week's pay.

217
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,785
Oh, you don't like that.
Then quit.

218
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,418
Act like a man for once
in your life and just quit!

219
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,428
You're
a slimy, pukey piece of shit!

220
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,693
You wouldn't make a pimple
on my grandmother's tush!

221
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,796

Ben, no.

226
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,644

nobody else will be able to fit.

ln.

228
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,644
Be careful, stupid.
We're not making a bed here.

229
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,001
All available units,
please respond immediately.

230
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,533

316 Glenview Parkway.

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,008

Tear it.

234
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,861
Tires. Tear it.

235
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,485
Ben, l told you to stay.

236
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,059
You--you won't fit.

237
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,379
What the hell is that?

238
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,979
You left the washer
in the garage...

239
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,013
running again, didn't you?

240
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,855
ln! ln!

241
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,459
Come on. Come on.

242
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,129
Anybody out there?

243
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,038
ls someone out there
in the garage?

244
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,599
Oh, shit! Look at that!

245
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,134
Somebody got in here
and slashed my tires!

246
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,669
Damn!

247
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,784
Who's out here?

248
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,354
Yeah, you better run!

249
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,388
You don't mess with a man's
brand-new car like that!

250
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,026
Run,
and you'll only die tired!

251
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,031
You better run faster...

252
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,632
because if l catch you,
you are dead meat!

253
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,619
Quiet!

254
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,726
Go home!

255
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,311
Do you want to see
what's in the bags...

256
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,744
you stupid little dog?

257
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,663
The look on his face.

258
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,725
lmagine, all four of his tires.

259
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,463
Do you know
what a set of those tires run?

260
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,971
lnsurance will cover it.

261
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:44,463
But insurance won't cover
how pissed off he's gonna be.

262
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,410
Hey, what's up?

263
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,970
Someone broke into
Martin's garage last night...

264
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,279
slashed his tires
and peed on the floor!

265
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,282
Morning, Cat.
You look very nice today.

266
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,486
Wow. Someone--someone urinated
on the floor?

267
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,586
No, no, no.
You know, what happened--

268
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,891
when Martin
goes in his garage...

269
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,921
and sees his tires,
he pissed his pants...

270
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,092
and blamed it
on the guy that did it.

271
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,974
Do you think that's funny, Fox?

272
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,873
Ahem.
Good morning, Mr. Martin.

273
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,037
ls everything OK?

274
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,448
No, everything is not OK.

275
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,951
How would you like it
if some maniac...

276
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,885
invaded the privacy
of your home...

277
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,947
and scared the dog shit
out of your wife...

278
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,959
and then you had to lose
an entire night's sleep...

279
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,052
because you're
dealing with the cops?

280
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:41,258
Knowing that that
perverted sicko has control...

281
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,962
over you and your family's
peace of mind?

282
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,833
For Jesus and Christ,
for how long?

283
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,398
How long will it last?
No, l'm not all right!

284
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,271
This morning, l rode the subway.

285
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,480
Well, Mr. Fox,
how would you like that?

286
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,486
No, sir,
l wouldn't like that at all.

287
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,647
l didn't think you would.

288
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,450
Barbara, l need a foot massage.

289
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,977
Oh, that's so good.
That's so good.

290
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,972
Foods.

291
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,531
Foods.

292
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,440
We, um...

293
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,820
we're running out of room.

294
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,484
l'm very sorry about this...

295
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:18,928
but l can't--l can't
feed you anymore.

296
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,090
l can't afford it.

297
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,801
You're going to have to find
a new place to live.

298
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,965
Go find somewhere
more comfortable.

299
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,410
l wish that
they didn't have to...

300
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,313
but all good things
must come to an end.

301
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:45,950
Follow Ben. He will find
a new place for you.

302
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,754
He will take care of you.

303
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,792
Won't you, Ben?

304
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,958
You're the leader...

305
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,097
after Socrates.

306
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,938
Good night, Ben.

307
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,432
You're not going anywhere,
Socrates.

308
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,460
You'll always be with me.

309
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,966
l hate everyone but you.

310
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,777
Let's go to bed.

311
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,048
Ben, l told you.
You can't come upstairs.

312
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,151
N oW, t s oh y Soocvrates,

313
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,502
Oh, Socrates.

314
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,786
Aah! Don't touch me!

315
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,485
You're getting rid of me.

316
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,993
Mom, l--l love you.

317
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,461
l heard you!

318
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,465
''All good things
must come to an end.''

319
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,991
No, l--l love you
more than anything in the world.

320
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,995
You don't love me!
You won't feed me!

321
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,339
l hate you!

322
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,278
You need to go to the hospital.

323
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,773
What if mom sees you?

324
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,580
No.

325
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,223
Mom?

326
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,529
Mom?

327
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,272
Off. Off. Off.

328
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,535
Off. Off. Off.

329
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,513
Off.

330
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,612
Down! Down! ln the basement!

331
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,179
Down! Down! Down!

332
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,056
ln the basement! Down!

333
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,266
You think you're funny?
You think you're smart?

334
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,136
Socrates, he's smart.

335
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,436
He knows that
they're going to have to come...

336
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,443
and they're going
to have to take her away...

337
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,945
and then they'll come,
and they'll take me away...

338
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,504
and then they'll come,
and they'll take you away!

339
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,218
Hi.

340
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,964
She's my mother.

341
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,761
l love her.

342
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,594
And l'll miss her.

343
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,000
l already miss her.

344
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,244
But, Socrates...

345
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,518
if you ever died, l...

346
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,952
You're the only friend
that l've ever had.

347
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:18,964
Well...

348
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,945
at least
you're with father again.

349
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,489
l have a friend.

350
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,484
See?

351
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,158
He wants to say good-bye to you.

352
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,566
Say good-bye, Socrates.

353
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,331
That's good.

354
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,607
Willard.

355
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,151
ln.

356
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,087
Willard, are you all right?

357
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,286
Yeah.

358
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,425
l didn't mean to upset you.

359
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,765
You didn't have to come here.

360
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,169
Well, we didn't hear from you...

361
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:26,973
and l wanted to make sure
that you were OK.

362
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:35,748
Uh, and l want
to let you know that...

363
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,617
you have a friend.

364
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:01,307
Willard Stiles,
l am Joseph Carter.

365
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,609
l'm an attorney
with Montgomery and Glitt...

366
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,547
the trustees
of your mother's estate.

367
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,643
l've been trying to reach you,
but you don't answer the phone.

368
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,246
May l have a moment
with Willard, please?

369
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,353
Do you mind if l check on you
after work...

370
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,420
and make sure that you're OK?

371
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,661
Oh, l--thanks.
That's OK. l'll be OK, Cat.

372
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,941
Willard, l have some news...

373
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,954
l don't know if you're aware of
or prepared for.

374
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:47,456
Your parents had been
living off an account...

375
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,483
they had originally set up
for your future.

376
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,964
lt was intended to be yours
upon their passing.

377
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,991
However, your father's death
left debts...

378
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:03,405
that even Mr. Martin's buyout
did not completely relieve.

379
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,908
ln fact, there remains
pending litigation...

380
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,912
on some unsettled debts.

381
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,436
Well...

382
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,110
it's--it's still my house.

383
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,517
Your mother
refinanced the house...

384
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,283
after your father's death.

385
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:24,522
-ln fact, we still owe--
-''We''?

386
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,119
lt's my house.

387
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,530
We can declare bankruptcy.
We can sell the house.

388
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,598
-lt's my house!
-Yes, of course.

389
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,435
You grew up there.
lt's your home.

390
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,465
-But it's the bank's house.
-lt's my house!

391
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,136
There's no need
for a single man...

392
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,511
to be living in such
a large house, Willard. Sell it.

393
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,882
Why do l have to pay
for what things my parents did?

394
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,409
The money can help you
start over.

395
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,355
''Start over''? l'm almost done!

396
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,688
Willard, look.
You have no choice--

397
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,957
lf l have no choice,
why did you even come here?

398
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,964
Why did you
even bother telling me?

399
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,966
Do you get off
on telling people...

400
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,128
that they have no control
over their lives?

401
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,970
That l have no money, no home,
and it's not even my fault?

402
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,977
Willard,
this is not the time nor place.

403
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,979
Now, you think about it.

404
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,982
Then, please,
you have to contact me.

405
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,982
This is the only chance
you have...

406
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,353
to take control
of your own life.

407
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,128
Thank you.

408
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,837
Socrates.

409
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,746
Ben!

410
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,036
Willard, it's Cathryn.
Answer the door.

411
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,776
l saw you walk in.

412
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,853
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

413
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,620
l'm just on my way out.

414
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,685
l have some stuff that
l have to do at the cemetery.

415
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:17,462
Oh, well, this might not be
the best time, Willard...

416
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,436
but please don't
take this the wrong way.

417
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,804
You looked so lonely
at your mother's service...

418
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,105
and l remember
how devastated l was...

419
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,271
you know, when my mother died.

420
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,440
And the only thing
that helped me through...

421
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,508
was...her mother.

422
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,349
This is Scully.

423
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,982
She'll make a great friend,
and she'll keep you company.

424
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,117
Oh.

425
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,288
l don't know what to say.
l...

426
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,522
l can't accept Scully.

427
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,660
See? She likes you.

428
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,638
Well...

429
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,301
Why don't you hold her?

430
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,207
Just take her. Just hold her.

431
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,610
Really, l can't. l'm sorry.

432
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,616
-Just take her.
-OK.

433
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,914
Well...

434
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,718
l'm really late, and...

435
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,384
Do you think it's OK
if l just put her inside?

436
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:19,156
-Sure. She's potty-trained.
-Oh, good. Good.

437
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,938
Socrates.

438
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,506
lt's OK.

439
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,531
lt's OK.

440
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,799
l wasn't...

441
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,806
really trying to hurt him.

442
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,634
l know.

443
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:58,044
You're trying
to keep the peace...

444
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:06,750
but he has to learn...
l am the boss.

445
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,600
lt's back to work, Socrates.

446
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:40,310
Ben, out.

447
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,017
OK, Ben...

448
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:54,519
just because
Socrates says it's OK.

449
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,443
Here we go.

450
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,741
Here we go.

451
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,908
Am l reading this correctly?

452
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,907
''Mr. Stiles, it is our regret
to inform you...

453
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,850
''your position
has been terminated.

454
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,354
''Enclosed please find
two weeks' severance.

455
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,982
''Your service is appreciated.

456
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,685
''Frank Martin.''

457
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,893
He's firing you.

458
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,035
But l thought
he couldn't fire you.

459
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,964
Willard.

460
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,944
Hey. Hey!

461
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:21,708
This whole thing is just
one big misunderstanding.

462
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,685
l'll make it up to you, though.

463
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,415
l'm gonna take you
to the Jets-Dolphins game.

464
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,719
-How does that sound?
-What?

465
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,798
Feels like this office could
use a little holiday cheer.

466
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,131
Cathryn, go dig out
the Christmas decorations.

467
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,693
They're in the back storeroom.

468
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,364
The key's in Willard's desk
somewhere.

469
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,707
Talk it over with Rosie
and let me know.

470
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,770
l'll be right here at
the office working late tonight.

471
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,374
Christmas bonus time, you know.

472
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,922
Mrs. Leach, found the keys...

473
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,689
but you can dig out
your own holiday cheer...

474
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:09,027
and then you can shove it
up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho.

475
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,960
-l quit.
-Bye-bye.

476
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,435
How could you?

477
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,874
What part of ''You're fired''
don't you understand?

478
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:25,108
-My father!
-ls dead. Been dead.

479
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,638
And now your mama's dead, too.

480
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,743
He started this company!
lt's my family's company!

481
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,949
No. My company.
Been my company...

482
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,721
and l don't want you
around it anymore.

483
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,833
Why in the hell
are you even still here?

484
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,207
You hate it here.
l hate you being here.

485
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,303
You're going nowhere here.

486
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,008
Mommy and daddy are dead.

487
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,517
Get over it
and get on with your life.

488
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,247
The terms
of your purchase contract--

489
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,317
they strictly state
that you are not allowed to--

490
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,885
Sue me.

491
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,990
Get you a goddamn lawyer
and sue me. You'll win.

492
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:22,528
Go down today and hire yourself
a $250-an-hour lawyer.

493
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:26,701
Sue me.
My $400-an-hour lawyer...

494
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:29,905
will tie it up in the courts
until l die.

495
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:34,245
So, what? 10, 1 5, 20 years
from now, you'll win.

496
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:37,684
You know l cannot afford that!
You know that!

497
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:44,590
Need money?
Make me an offer on the house.

498
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,322
Don't give me that face,
Willard.

499
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,892
l buy the house, you have money.

500
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:57,599
You can go buy yourself
a very nice clean used car...

501
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,905
move someplace
where you'll be happy...

502
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,410
get a job, a girlfriend.

503
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:08,884
Jeez, you'll be so damn happy
you won't want to sue me.

504
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:37,970
All right...
l'll sell you the house.

505
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:44,179
But, please, please,
please let me keep my job!

506
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:57,458
Please!
Please let me keep my job.

507
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,025
Please.

508
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,904
What in the hell
is going on now?

509
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:12,346
A rat! A rat in here! Oh!

510
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,810
lt's a rat! Oh, my God!

511
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,410
Rat! Look out!

512
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:18,920
There's a white rat...

513
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:21,923
and it is the size
of a dog--l mean, huge dog.

514
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,925
Over there,
behind the Christmas lights.

515
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,924
See him?

516
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,366
Where? l don't see any mouse.

517
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,495
No. Up there, you idiot.

518
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,802
Up there!

519
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,400
l think
your wild-ass imagination...

520
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,932
is kind of
getting away with you.

521
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,468
He's up higher.

522
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,205
There he is.

523
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,957
No!

524
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:16,340
Walt, this is Mickey.
l'm coming to join you.

525
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,313
Yeah.

526
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,421
What's the matter, tiger?
Can't take a little blood?

527
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,019
Ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers.

528
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,223
Nice work, Mr. Martin.

529
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:37,095
Yeah, good one, sir.

530
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,231
He expects me to clean that up?

531
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,999
l'll do it.

532
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,528
Thanks.

533
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,497
What could l do?

534
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,237
What could l do?

535
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,940
What could l do?
What could l do?

536
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,471
What could l do?
What could l do?

537
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,507
What could l do?

538
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,932
What can l do?

539
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,538
What can we do?

540
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,610
ln.

541
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,888
ln.

542
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,970
That's it.
We can't fit any more.

543
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:03,944
The rest of you
are going to have to wait here.

544
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:07,881
Ben and l will be back later.

545
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:10,951
Right, Ben?

546
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,600
Oh, Jesus.

547
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:42,763
Ooh...l like that.

548
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,762
Ooh, look at you.

549
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,934
Oh, my God.
Look at all the rats.

550
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,698
Yes.

551
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:52,332
Look at the rats.

552
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,706
We've come to see you.

553
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,506
We?

554
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:59,912
They'll do anything l tell them.

555
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,439
Well, then tell them to get
the fuck out of my office!

556
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,951
Sit down.

557
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,750
Now, you listen to me, Willard.

558
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,154
Sit down!

559
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,156
What the hell's
wrong with you?

560
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:17,826
Mr. Martin, you stole
this business from my father.

561
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:22,894
lt killed him,
and it killed my mother.

562
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,873
And now
you're trying to kill me.

563
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,340
No. That's--

564
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,936
You never let me alone
for a minute.

565
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,947
You made a fool of me
in front of everybody.

566
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:36,940
And now you're trying
to take my house.

567
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:46,125
You made me hate myself.

568
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,061
l thought a lot about it...

569
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,967
hating myself.

570
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,459
Well, right now...

571
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,963
at this moment...

572
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,910
l like myself.

573
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:14,349
You killed Socrates!

574
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,289
Who the hell is Socrates?

575
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:23,025
He was the only friend...

576
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,589
l ever had!

577
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,421
What's the matter, tiger?
Afraid of a little blood?

578
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,802
Tear him up.

579
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,411
Good-bye, Ben.

580
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,434
Food.

581
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,299
Food.

582
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,524
-l think l hear footsteps.
-Yeah.

583
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,936
-Let's look around back.
-OK.

584
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:43,858
Willard? lt's Cathryn.

585
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,497
l've been calling you all day.

586
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,523
Did you hear?

587
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,301
Martin's dead.

588
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:58,101
They called from the office.

589
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,401
The details are weird.

590
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:02,376
All kinds of rumors...

591
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:06,972
that he was murdered
or attacked by animals.

592
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,144
l'm hungry.

593
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,182
Could we get something to eat?

594
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:17,248
Right now?

595
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,089
Let me get my coat.

596
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,500
Just a second.

597
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,208
Could l use the restroom?

598
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,327
Cathryn?

599
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,229
ln here.

600
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:35,669
Sorry. l had to go so bad,
and you flew off somewhere.

601
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,477
We need to go.

602
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:01,186
Shit. l must have
run over something.

603
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,839
-There he is.
-You sure that's him?

604
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,038
Yeah.

605
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,542
Get in the car.

606
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:26,986
l'll call triple-A.

607
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:28,716
l've got a cell phone.

608
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,412
Mr. Stiles, police.
Open the door, please, sir.

609
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,279
Can you please tell me
what this is about?

610
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,711
Willard!

611
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,849
Open the door, Willard!

612
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,587
l want to help you!

613
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,720
Willard!

614
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,025
Willard!

615
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,729
Open the door, Willard!
Let me in!

616
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,000
What's going on in there?

617
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:57,009
l hear him going around back.

618
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:17,525
Stiles.

619
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,491
Stiles!

620
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:36,678
l'm sorry, Ben. l...

621
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,686
l'm sorry that l left you.

622
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,018
l got scared...

623
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:44,855
and so l--l came back here.

624
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:55,433
lt's all over, Ben.

625
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:02,573
You can live anywhere.

626
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:07,445
You can go anywhere.

627
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,284
l have nowhere.

628
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,050
Who's he talking to?

629
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,559
There was nothing
that l could do about Socrates.

630
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:32,633
But...we got him back.

631
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,972
We got Mr. Martin back together.

632
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:44,618
This guy's nuts.
We should just call Bellevue.

633
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:47,314
lt's all over, Ben.

634
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,949
So just...go!

635
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,622
Go away!

636
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,631
Whoa! lt's not just Bellevue.

637
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,963
We've got to call the health
department exterminators.

638
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,332
You see that?

639
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,599
Oh, man.

640
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:04,798
Let's go.

641
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,276
Do you want some food?

642
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,952
l'll give you some food, Ben.

643
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,619
l'll give you
all the food that l have...

644
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:31,030
if you'll just go away.

645
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,465
Do you want food?

646
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:49,449
No.

647
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:52,180
No, no, Ben. lt's food.

648
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,984
lt's just food.

649
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,688
Whatever food
is in the bag is yours.

650
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:08,629
Ah! That's it for you, Ben!

651
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:10,432
l hate you!

652
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:16,171
l loved Socrates,
but l hate you!

653
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,700
l'm not setting foot in there.
There's, like, a thousand rats.

654
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,976
Ma'am,
you want to get eaten alive?

655
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,578
Martin.

656
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:47,235
lf you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

657
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,608
lf you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

658
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:08,951
Cathryn, help!

659
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,657
Help!

660
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,132
Cathryn!

661
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,005
Cathryn.

662
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,170
Ben.

663
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:30,876
l thought we were friends.

664
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:37,000
Food's here.

665
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:40,002
Food.

666
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:48,215
Look, Stiles, you've got to eat.

667
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:51,986
You might be out of your mind,
but your body's staying here.

668
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:53,994
Eat.

669
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:57,486
Come on.
We got some nice chicken...

670
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:00,227
some mashed potatoes...

671
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:02,132
got a sourdough roll.

672
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:08,533
Hey, look.
We got a piece of cheese.

673
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:10,441
That's what the mice eat,
isn't it?

674
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,575
OK, rat boy.

675
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:18,107
Look, l'm gonna leave it here.

676
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,086
You can do
whatever you want with it.

677
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:47,005
Hi.

678
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,711
Shh.

679
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:54,812
l know you're hungry,
but we have to wait.

680
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:58,791
Our time will come.

681
01:34:58,826 --> 01:35:03,195
Let's not let them know
that you've come back to me.

682
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,960
We have to sit here...

683
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:11,938
and wait--

684
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,462
wait...

685
01:35:15,476 --> 01:35:17,467
quietly.

686
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:25,979
Quiet as a mouse.
