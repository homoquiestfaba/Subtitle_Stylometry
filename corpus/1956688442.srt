JOE [VOICEOVER]:
Maybe you should.

208

[VOICEOVER] Are you a pervert?

What is it?

242

Good for you.

Online.

Oh, say strip club.

But this is different.

252
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
Been e-mailing back andforth a couple of weeks now.

253
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,160
You know how when youjust click with somebody?

254
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,200
She's smart.

255
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,840
She's funny-- looks
like a supermodel,

256
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,520
not that that matters.

257
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,920
Before you go all in on thisgirl, will you do me a favor?

258
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,600
Meet her in person first.

259
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,880
I'm not stupid.

JOE: I can't keep doing this.

261
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
I need to meet you.

Be patient.

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
JOE [VOICEOVER]: You
keep saying that.

266
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,880
I'm tired of being patient.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm not waiting anymore.

268
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
TANYA: What's that
supposed to mean?

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
JOE [VOICEOVER]: It
means no more email

270
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
until I meet you face to face.

271
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080

Excuse me, Joe Donnelly?

One in the gold tie.

276

Looks fun.

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,360
It is.

278
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
Jump on in there.

279
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,640
Don't know how.

21 wins.

281
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
You want it as close asyou can without going over.

282
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,680
House hits anything under 17.

283
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,040
That includes a soft seven--

284
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh my god.

285
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,680
Hi.

286
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,240
And I'm standing hereexplaining the damn rules.

287
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,120
I know.

288
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm thinking, um, Joe, it's me.

289
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,760
What are you doing here?

290
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,080
You said you needed to see me.

291
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,400
See?

292
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm real, Joe.

293
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
Are you ever.

294
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,000
How do you do?

295
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,040
Don't know what to say.

296
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,920
I didn't think you'd come.

297
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
[sighs]

298
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm married.

299
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,960
OK.

300
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Are you happy?

301
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,040
I'm sitting in a coffee
shop in Atlantic City

302
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,120
with a man I met online.

303
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,720
Take a wild guess.

304
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,920
And I have a daughter, Molly.

305
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,600
She's cute.

306
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,760
Thanks.

307
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
If this changes things
for you, I understand.

308
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
And I won't think any
less of you, I swear.

309
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
I just didn't want to
start this out on a lie.

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,400
I wanted you to knowwhat you're getting into.

311
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,640
OK.

312
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,520
Tell me.

313
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,080
Did I scare you away?

314
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm still sitting
here, aren't I?

315
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,480
Turn your head to the side.

316
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,160
I want to see.

317
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,240
Do you know who
you remind me of?

318
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't laugh-- Steve McQueen.

Yeah, if your hair were shorter.

Who do I look like?

322
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,240
Let me see--

323
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,800
you look like a cross
between Michelle

324
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680

Wow.

327
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,160
What are you thinking?

328
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm thinking you're verybrave for coming here.

329
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,520
I hope you're not disappointed.

330
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,480
Not in the least.

331
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Now what?

332
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,480
You tell me.

333
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,240
You tell me.

334
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
Take me upstairs.

335
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,160
You all right?

336
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,040
I've never cheated
on anybody before--

337
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,120
makes me feel weird.

338
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you think I'm a slut?

339
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Hell no.

340
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,640
If he was taking care of yourheart, you wouldn't be here.

[sighs]

342
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
Look at you.

343
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,000
You are an angel.

344
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,800
Oh, I'm not an angel.

345
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm a brat.

346
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,240
So how long have you
owned the casino?

347
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
Oh, casino--

348
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,920
Mm-hm.

349
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,680
Well, I don't
actually own the place.

350
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm a pit boss.

351
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,480
I work here.

352
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,840
But you said--

353
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
I was building myself
up for fun, you know?

354
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,440
I never really thought
we'd meet, especially--

355
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,120
You're not rich?

356
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,920
Oh no, ma'am.

357
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,200
Let's say this is bankruptcy.

358
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,640
Well, that's me right there,teetering on the brink.

359
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
[scoffs]

360
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Guess this changes
things for you, huh?

361
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,080
What the hell do you think?

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
I just made the worst
mistake of my life.

363
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
I never want to hear
from you again, ever.

364
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Understand?

365
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,800
OK.

366
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
I never came here.

367
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,680
Whatever you say.

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760

369
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,040
Gotcha.

370
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,480
JOE: So I don't know whatyou want to see first.

It's just-- it's exactly likesomething I would have said.

391
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,360
I was a detective, theCounty Sheriff's Department

393
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,760
There is a high profilemurder they couldn't solve.

pin it on some guy.

395
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,480
I wouldn't go along
with it, so I got fired.

397

just like I said.

before it started.

And you thanked
her by leaving?

490

living by myself.

I don't know.

552
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm going to watch
a few more hands.

553
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,480
Call for you.

554
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,360
Not now.

555
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
Someone named Tanya.

556
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,760
Is this Joe
Donnelly, the man I

557
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,040
keep having dirty dreams about?

558
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,920
I don't know.

559
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,080
Can you describe those dreams?

560
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,680
So what did you think?

561
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,640
JOE: Think about what?

562
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,480
You forgot already?

563
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,000
The video, you fool.

564
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,560
Let me tell you something,I will never, long as I live,

565
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,360
forget that video.

566
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,800
Blew my mind.

567
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,080
I'm not even going to tell youhow many times I watched it.

568
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,640
Well, how about the realthing again next Saturday night.

569
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,280
JOE: You coming back?

570
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,200
TANYA: Told you I would.

571
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,080
Oh, man.

572
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,160
I can't wait.

573
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,080
[knocking]

574
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,960
WOMAN: Hey, Tanya.

575
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,280
Listen, I gotta go.

576
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,920
My flight gets in at
2:15 in [inaudible]..

577
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,200
There's something we need totalk about when I get there.

578
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,240
Sounds serious.

579
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,600
Kind of.

580
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
I love you, hun.

581
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
Love you too.

582
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
[phone beeps]

583
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,600
Hey, Molly.

584
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,480
Hi.

585
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,840
Hey, I'm a little freaked out.

586
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,120
David wants me to
get a Wonderbra.

587
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,040
[chuckles]

588
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,920
What did you do?

589
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,080
What?
Nothing.

590
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,240
Don't what nothing me.

591
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,480
I know that look.

592
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Either you've done somethingyou shouldn't have,

593
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,000
or you're going to.

594
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,080
I think I'm having an affairwith a guy I met online.

595
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
You think?

596
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,480
I am.

597
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,720
He lives in Atlantic City.

598
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,920
That's why I went there.

599
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,280
[laughs]

600
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,240
Uh, you slept with him?

601
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,120
Don't lie.

602
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,040
I knew I should
have gone with you.

603
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm going back next weekend.

604
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,440
Can you take care
of Molly for me?

605
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,480
Tanny, what if Mark
finds out about this?

606
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,120
I just have to
make sure he doesn't.

607
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200

615
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,680
I missed you.

616
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
Let me look.

617
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
[scoffs]

618
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,960
Lord, am I in trouble.

619
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,720
[giggles]

620
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
I almost didn't make it.

621
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,400
I got to the airport
and chickened out.

622
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,240
What are we doing, Joe?

623
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,600
[shuts engine off]

624
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,200
Promise you won't be mad?

625
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,080
I won't.

626
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,160
What is it?

627
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,040
What is it?

628
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,080
It's mine, isn't it?

629
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,200
Are you mad?

630
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,160
Well, this is probablythe happiest day of my life.

631
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,200
I'm not joking around
this time, Tanny.

632
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,640
Let's get married.

633
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,560
Joe--

634
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
This is big.

635
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,160
We're having a baby.

636
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,240
I know it's big.

637
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,920
Why not?

638
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,840
You know why not.

639
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,520
So divorce him.

640
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,400
It's not that simple.

641
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,960
Sure it is.

642
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
- No, it's not.
- Sure it is.

643
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,720
- No, it's not.
- Sure it is.

644
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,600
- It's not.
- Hun--

645
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,480
It's not.

646
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,160
[thunder bellowing]

647
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,160
You don't understand.

648
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
Explain it to me then.

649
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,920
The guy I'm married
to, he's not--

650
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,880
I don't even know his name.

651
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,160
What's his name.

652
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Mark.

653
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,160
He's not like you, OK?

654
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,960
I don't trust what he woulddo to me if he found out.

655
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,520
I don't trust what
he would do to you.

656
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,600
What do you mean?

657
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,480
What's he going to do?

658
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,680
Never mind.

659
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,720
What's he going to do, Tanya?

660
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,520
I don't want to
talk about this.

661
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
- I do.
- I don't.

662
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,120
I just think about himthe whole time I'm there.

663
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,360
When I'm here, all I want to dois think about you, you and me.

664
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,600
If we can't do that, I mightas well be back in Pittsburgh.

665
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
It's just temporary until Ican find something, you know,

666
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,880
better.

667
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,080
Hold on a second.

668
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,960
I'll see if he's here.

669
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,680
Teddy?

670
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh, I love thinkingabout you sitting here, sun

671
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
coming in right [inaudible].

672
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,640
Teddy?

673
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
This is Teddy.

674
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
This is Tanya, friend of mine.

675
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
What a handsome
young man you are.

676
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,640
Catch.

677
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
[laughs]

678
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,080
So what's he do for a living?

679
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,040
Come on, I'm just asking.

680
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,920
I don't know.

681
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,160
All I know about is BDNH.

682
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,160
BDNH.

683
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,120
BDNH Auto, the
salvage yard he owns.

684
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
That's how I met him.

685
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,880
They needed someone
to handle their books.

686
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,040
The rest of his life-- yourguess is as good as mine.

687
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,280
These guys come over
to the house sometimes,

688
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,240
these creepy lookingguys in expensive suits--

689
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,520
he won't even talk
to them in the house.

690
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,320
Or he'll get a
phone call, say he's

691
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,680
going to some NASCAR race--disappear for a few days.

692
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,640
When he comes
home, I find clumps

693
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,000
of money in his coat pocket.

694
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,120
I counted it once--

695
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,400
$10,000, Joe, in two days.

696
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,920
He didn't make it doingbrake jobs, I know that much.

697
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,960
He could be
involved in some kind

698
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,400
of organized crime, you know?

699
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,320
Drugs, racketeering,
something like that.

700
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
Pass himself off as thisregular guy, you know?

701
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,480
I had no idea who
I was marrying.

702
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,160
Sometimes I think the
only reason he married

703
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,400
me is because he worried when Ilooked at the website, figured

704
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,720
out something was going on.

705
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,640
Can I use your phone?
- What?

706
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
I have to book a
room for the night.

707
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,240
You're staying here.

708
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm not having you in a hotel.

709
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,120
It's too soon.

710
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,360
Think about him.

711
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,720
What do you think he's
going to feel, seeing

712
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,680
another woman in his mom's bed?

713
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,720
Susan never slept here.

714
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
You know what I mean.

715
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
That's OK.

716
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,320
You can stay, if you want.

717
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,200
Are you sure, hun?

718
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
Because I don't mind a hotel.

719
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,640
Yeah, you make my dad happy.

720
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,600
Oh--

721
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,600
Oh.

722
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,560
[laughing]

723
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,560
Oh, was I too loud?

724
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,360
I don't think so,
but it's all right.

725
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,040
It's all right.

726
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,600
[laughing]

727
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,600
God.

728
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Oh, baby.

729
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,520
Oh my god, what--
what-- what happened?

730
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Oh, oh-- it's OK.

731
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,840
It's not real.

732
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,040
It just-- it clips in.

733
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,520
Oh, does that gross you out?

734
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,320
No, it freaked me out.

735
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,200
It's OK.

736
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,400
[sighs]

737
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,200
So what'd you say toMark to let you get away?

738
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,960
Oh, I told him that wehad some sales conference

739
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,600
to go to that uh, we werecoming out with a new line

740
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,040
of smudge free lip gloss.

741
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,640
Not the brightest
bulb on the tree, is he?

742
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,440
Oh, don't be jealous.

743
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
You're the one I love.

744
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,560
Besides, you're
bigger than he is.

745
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,720
Oh, you mean George.

746
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,880
- George?
- George.

747
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,040
Why George?

748
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,600
- Because he's curious.
- Oh.

749
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,520
[giggles]

750
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,000
Do you want it to
be a boy or a girl.

751
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,160
I don't care.

752
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,400
Either way, it makes me happy.

753
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
Here's what we do
after the divorce.

754
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,480
We bring Molly out.
We have a baby.

755
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,360
We buy a house.

756
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,320
You put in a pool.

757
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,800
We'll be a family.

758
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,880
How does that sound?

759
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,360
Before we make
any more plans, I

760
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
have to tell you what happened.

761
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,360
What?

762
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,880
I was six or seven
when it started,

763
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,240
13 when it finally stopped.

764
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,840
Whole time it was happening,you know what I thought?

765
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,560
I thought it was love.

766
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,560
I thought he loved me.

767
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,920
He kept telling me
how special I was.

768
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,560
That's why I told
on him, because he

769
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,160
started um, paying attention tosomebody else, some other girl.

770
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,000
I felt like I wasn't
special no more.

771
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,760
Like I was nothing.

772
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,400
I'm damaged.

773
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,400
Do you still want me?

774
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,080
[slot machines whirring]

775
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,320
Paula, I'm having Joe's baby.

776
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,080
Is this a congratulationsmoment, or an oh dear?

777
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,560
Well, both, I guess.

778
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,440
You know I'm married.

779
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,840
Yeah, Joe told me.

780
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,600
Divorce court, here I come.

781
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,920
You know, there's
not a lot of pretense.

782
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,880
But Joe, he's pretty wide open.

783
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,120
It just wouldn't take muchto hurt him, you know?

784
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,760
Oh, you have feelings
for him, don't you?

785
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Who said that?

786
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,480
Don't worry.

787
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,280
I'll be careful with him.

788
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,440
What are they doing in there?

789
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
Beautification.

790
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,440
I've never had aprofessional makeup job before.

791
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,040
I usually just slap it on.

792
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,160
Oh my god.

793
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
Know what I'm thinking about?

794
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,920
What?

795
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,440
All the hearts
you're going to break.

796
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,000
Ta-da.

797
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,560
TEDDY: Woah.

798
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,080
It's a bit over the top?

799
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,160
No, no, you look great.

800
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,320
Yeah?

801
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,440
Uh, hello, over here.

802
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,560
Come on.

803
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,240
TEDDY: Looking good, Paula.

804
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,280
How's the pizza?

805
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,160
TEDDY: It's good.

806
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,760
[sniffling]

807
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,920
What's wrong, baby?

808
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,400
I'm lying to myself,
and I'm lying to you.

809
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,080
[inaudible]

810
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,160
Mark isn't going to let me go.

811
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,520
He'll put-- he'll put
me in the hospital

812
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,440
again if I ask
him for a divorce.

813
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,120
He beat you up?

814
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,520
Why didn't you tell me?

815
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,120
[inaudible]
something I'm proud of.

816
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,840
I saw my mother stuck in
an abusive relationship.

817
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,080
I swore it would never be me.

818
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,000
I thought she was weak
for staying with him.

819
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,280
How often does he hit you?

820
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,600
Oh, as often as
I make him mad.

821
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
I don't argue with him anymore.

822
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,160
I just give him what he
wants when he wants it.

823
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,360
Anything he wants?

824
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,080
Are you still sleeping with him?

825
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
Do you have any
idea what would happen

826
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,000
if I started denying him sex?

827
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,040
How do you know it's my baby?

828
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,000
Because Mark got fixed
after we had Molly.

829
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,400
When's the last time
you slept with him.

830
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,560
When?

831
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,560
Two days before I left.

832
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,720
Two days.

833
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,880
Straight sex or kinky stuff?

834
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,800
Oh, what?

835
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,640
Oh, now you're mad at me too?

836
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,920
Well, that's just what
I need, another man

837
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,800
who thinks he owns me.

838
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,200
Go to hell, both of you.

839
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,000
[car door opens]

840
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,880
Boy, I tell you,
when that Tanya leaves,

841
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,920
that girl is gone.

842
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,200
Come here, baby.

843
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,080
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

844
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,600
It's OK.

845
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,920
I get jealous, OK.

846
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,240
I'm a jerk.

847
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,560
I lay in bed with
him some nights and--

848
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,800
if his heart would
stop beating--

849
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,640
I wish he'd die.

850
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,200
I even had a dream
about it once.

851
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
It was awful.

852
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,480
It was just a dream.

853
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,360
It doesn't mean anything.

854
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,360
I know.

855
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,680
But then in the
morning when I woke up,

856
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,680
I wanted it to be real.

857
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,240
Honey, killing
never solved anything.

858
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Talking is always
the better way.

859
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,840
There are some people
you can't talk to.

860
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,720
I know.

861
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,880
He ever lays a hand on youagain, you take pictures, OK?

862
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,760
OK?

863
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,440
Come on, you're shivering.

864
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
Come on.

865
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,440

having sex with my wife.

Now she's growing fat
with a bastard in her--

872

not for long.

873
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,600

00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,560
Who is it?

Just a sec.

885
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,520
Take this downstairs.

886
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,440
Thanks, hun.

887
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,480
Joe, I told you, you
can't call me here.

888
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,160
Look, I just got an
email from your husband.

889
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
He knows about the baby.

890
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,160
TANYA: What?

891
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,040
That's impossible.

892
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,040
Yeah, well, he knows.

893
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,280
And he says you're
going to lose it.

894
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,160
He said that?

895
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,920
Wha-- what should I do?

896
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,800
Put him on the phone.

897
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,680
Let me talk to him.

898
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,760
TANYA: Are you crazy?

899
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,560
Put him on the phone, Tanya.

900
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,640
No.

901
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,640
Then I'm coming to Pittsburgh.

902
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,520
Joe, stop.

903
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
If you come here, you'regoing to make things worse.

904
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,920
Let me handle this, please.

905
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,560
I'll call you later, OK?

906
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,880
OK?
- You can't.

907
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,200
I'm working tonight.

No calls.

You sure?

No calls.

I'm her friend.

What's--

1110
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,160
There was an

This is a difficult situation.

Do you know who did it?

1121
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,400
We don't know anything yet.

1122
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,760
Um, it looks like
a botched robbery.

1123
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,720
There's been a few break

Everything's

I'll call you.

It's been two weeks.

1151

I haven't heard from you.

1152
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,440

Yeah.

1166
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,600
Thank you.

1167
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,200
Um, sorry to
intrude, Mrs. Sullivan.

1168
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,560
Do you have a minute?

1169
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,880
So much for doing this.

1170
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,560
I know it's a difficult time.

1171
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,600
I want to say, first
of all, that um, again,

1172
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,480
how sorry we are for your loss.

1173
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,960
Oh.

1174
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,360
There's just a
couple of questions.

1175
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,720
Um, did Mark have anyenemies that you're aware of?

1176
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,560
Anyone who might wish him harm?

1177
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,880
I thought you said
it was a robbery?

1178
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,240
Well, that's what
it looks like, yes.

1179
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,640
But we don't want
to miss anything.

1180
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,720
Well, I--

1181
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,720
I can't think of no one who'd--

1182
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,800
Ma'am?

1183
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,080
I don't want to accuse
nobody of nothing.

1184
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,760
Mark deserves the most
thorough investigation

1185
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,040
we can give him.

1186
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,280
Well, there was this guy whoused to work out at the yard.

1187
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,320
He was messing with
the VINs or something.

1188
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,200
Mark fired him.

1189
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,440
This was when?

1190
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,720
Six, seven months ago.

1191
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,760
But I don't think he
would've done nothing.

1192
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,000
Do you remember a name?

1193
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:33,880

never said a single thing.

1204

That's not going to happen.

him off on the way over.

01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,000
Tanya?

1274
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,680
Yeah, all the time.

1275
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,960
You a cop?
- Me?

1276
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,160
No.

1277
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,040
Nice girl?

1278
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,280
Nice ain't the first
word comes to mind.

1279
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,320
What is?

1280
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,160
Willing.

1281
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,200
[knocking]

1282
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,640
Hi.

1283
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,520
My girlfriend and I lostour baby a few weeks ago.

1284
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,760
I wondered if I could speak withthe doctor that treated her.

1285
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,840
What's the patient's name?

1286
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,480
Tanya Sullivan.

1287
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,000
[phone ringing]

1288
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,840
Are you sure this
is her hospital?

1289
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,560
Well, I have the
sonogram from here.

1290
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,040
That's us-- hmm, weird.

1291
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,400
[computer beeps]

1292
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,840
Sir, this is 10 years old.

1293
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,560
Excuse me?

1294
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,720
10 years ago.

1295
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,600
See?

1296
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,960
Can I, uh--

1297
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,120
can um-- can I have that back?

1298
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,040
Thank you.

1299
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,760
TANYA: They raped me, Joe.

1300
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,640
They took me out
back by the pool.

1301
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,200
[knocking]

1302
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,520
Who are you?

1303
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,400
Who are you?

1304
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,560
Who is he?

1305
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,200
You know this guy?

1306
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,280
You bet your ass she knows me.

1307
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,160
Tell him, Tanya.

1308
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,200
Tell him who I am.

1309
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,120
Go upstairs.

1310
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,040
I'll be there in a minute.

1311
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,720
Who is he?

1312
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,720
Will you calm down?

1313
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,920
Who is he?

1314
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,640
My boyfriend, OK?

1315
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,520
Happy now?

1316
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,800
And what am I?

1317
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,520
Go home, Joe.

1318
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,800
This is 10 years old.

1319
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,960
10 years.

1320
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,160
Was there ever a baby, Tanya?

1321
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,960
Tell me, was there?

1322
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,080
And the pool-- there is no pool.

1323
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,640
You said they raped you
out back by the pool,

1324
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,440
but there isn't one, Tanya.

1325
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,000
He never laid a
finger on you, did he?

1326
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,480
The bruises, how-- the bruisesin the photo-- how'd you

1327
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,360
do that?

1328
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,600
It was makeup.

1329
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,600
You painted them on.

1330
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,160
Who was he, Tanya?

1331
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,560
Who did I kill?

1332
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,240
He sure as hell
wasn't some mobster.

1333
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,800
You didn't kill anybody.

1334
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,440
Far as I know, it was a
robbery that went bad.

1335
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,160
The emails, BDA
junk-- you sent those.

1336
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,280
You push all the right
buttons, didn't you?

1337
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,920
Go home, Joe.

1338
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,200
Why'd you do this?

1339
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,640
Why'd you do this to me?

1340
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,480
Go home.

1341
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,480
You're going to hell for this.

1342
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,080
[scoffs]

1343
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,920
[sighs]

1344
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,400
TANYA: I ordered it all online--

1345
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,240
except for the rug,
that's from Sears.

1346
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,200
Do you like it?

1347
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,120
It's OK if you don't.

1348
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,440
I've got 30 days to return.

1349
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,760
I'm just not sure
that maybe you should

1350
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,440
be buying so much new stuff.

1351
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,520
Why not?

1352
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,400
It looks bad.

1353
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,200
I don't care how it looks.

1354
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,160
People might think that--

1355
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,320
I don't care
what people think.

1356
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,200
Well, maybe you ought to.

1357
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,200
Tanya, this is real life.

1358
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,080
Mark is dead.

1359
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,400
Someone killed him.

1360
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,080
He's dead.

1361
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,040
[slot machines whirring]

1362
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,880
[inaudible].

1363
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,080
Seen Joe?

1364
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,520
Is he on tonight?

1365
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,240
He's supposed to be.

1366
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,240
Hell, if he's on anotherbender, that's it for him.

1367
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,080
Uh, place your bets.

1368
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,520
[phone ringing]

1369
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,400
[hangs up]

1370
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,680
Joe?

1371
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,600
Joe?

1372
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,120
Sheldon's going
to kick your butt.

1373
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,120
No--

1374
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,880
JOE [VOICEOVER]:
Anything happens to me,

1375
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,800
I put all my things in order.

1376
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,840
They're in a briefcase
under my bed.

1377
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,080
Dear Paula, a man named
Mark Sullivan was killed

1378
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,040
in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago.

1379
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,480
It was me.

1380
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,440
I drove there and killed him.

1381
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,640
Tanya was involved.

1382
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,120
She helped set it up.

1383
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,760
I have all the proof.

1384
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,800
Take it to the police.

1385
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,080
DETECTIVE: Please
make sure Teddy is OK.

1386
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,800
I love him so much.

1387
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,280
He's all I have left.

1388
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,200
I know that doing this
is the coward's way out,

1389
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,840
but I am at my end.

1390
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,240
I was so blind and so
stupid, and so in love.

1391
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,960
Little did I know she
never meant any of it.

1392
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,840
Joe.

1393
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,960
Mark's insurance policy--bit of money there--

1394
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,200
bored of their life, who knows.

1395
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,720
Most people don't really
need a reason to lie.

1396
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,280
For some, it's the
lie itself they

1397
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,400
get a charge out of, seeinghow far they can push things,

1398
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,320
you know?

1399
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,040
Getting lost in
the make believe--

1400
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,400
it's still murder, though.

1401
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,920
Let me them.

1402
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,200
They look bad.

1403
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,160
I bought them.

1404
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,520
Let me see them.

1405
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,440
[laughing]

1406
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,400
I can't believe I'm
even sleeping with you.

1407
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,240
Yeah, yeah.

1408
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,640
[laughs]

1409
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,120
[knocking]

1410
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,920
DETECTIVE: Did you evermeet a man in Atlantic City

1411
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,160
by the name of Joe Donnelly?

1412
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,920
I met a lot of people
in Atlantic City.

1413
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,160
There was a Joe I met, butI talked to a lot of people.

1414
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,200
DETECTIVE: Did you developa relationship with him?

1415
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,600
It isn't true that you werehaving a physical relationship

1416
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,480
with Joe?

1417
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,760
Maybe online.

1418
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,000
No, I'm talking
about in person.

1419
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:41,880
No.

1420
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,720
DETECTIVE: Did you eversend Joe films of you naked?

1421
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,920
No films of me naked, no.

1422
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,840
I didn't.

1423
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,640
OK.

1424
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,680
I'll tell you this.

1425
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,840
We do know that Joe
took his own life.

1426
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,360
OK, Tanya, things get
difficult in life.

1427
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,360
Sometimes things get difficultand you get into situations.

1428
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,400
You get married to somebodyand then you meet someone else.

1429
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,680
OK, let me ask you this.

1430
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,560
What's your online name?

1431
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,840
Tanya1013, I have SexyKitten--

1432
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,040
I've had 100 different names.

1433
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,120
But you had a
relationship with Joe.

1434
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,440
Yes.

1435
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,160
Yes, you did.

1436
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,160
[sighs]

1437
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,080
Hm?

1438
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,640
[sighs]

1439
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,280
You know what?

1440
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,360
Online is a game, OK?

1441
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,800
There is nothing wrong withtalking to somebody online.

1442
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,040
There is nothing wrong with it.

1443
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,200
I have a list of
people that I talk to.

1444
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,000
I have probably 50
people that I talk to.

1445
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,920
I-- I talk to a
guy named Dennis.

1446
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,320
I talked to a guy named Tom.

1447
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,200
Everyone I have a differentrelationship with.

1448
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,200
There is nothing
wrong with that.

1449
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,840
There is nothing wrong withsitting and talking back

1450
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,920
and forth to someone online.

1451
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,400
Sometimes you say stuff.

1452
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,600
Come on, everybody does it.

1453
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,840
Nobody can see.

1454
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,680
They don't know you.

1455
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,240
Sometimes you say stuff.

1456
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,400
DETECTIVE: It's
all there, Tanya.

1457
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,080
All of it.

1458
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,600
Been a lot of things toa lot of different people.

1459
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:56,120
[keyboard clattering]

1460
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,040
What do you want
me to be to you?

1461
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,720
[MUSIC - KEATON SIMMONS,
"CURRENTLY"]

1462
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,040
KEATON SIMMONS: [SINGING]My love is a storm.

1463
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,640
She doesn't wait for me.

1464
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,720
And now that she's
gone, I fear that she'll

1465
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:33,840
never be back in my arms,oh, where she held me tight.

1466
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:40,720
And I just might
be losing, uh-oh.

1467
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:51,840
When the rain comes down,the clouds will roll, lord,

1468
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,040
and the wind will blow.

1469
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:01,360
You on my undertow
caught in a riptide.

1470
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:08,080
And I am currently
in love with you.
