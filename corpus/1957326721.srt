1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,325
I need to tell you something.

2
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:12,470
A lot of things, actually.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,378
This is going to be tough, but
I have to be honest with it all.

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,520
I went through a lot this summer,
and I'm not proud of most of it.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,255
I'm getting ahead of myself.

6
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,797
Let me tell my story from the beginning...

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,798
before everything fell apart.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,824
So have you ever actually
met anyone from Wyoming?

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,147
No.

10
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:36,290
Have you been to Wyoming?

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,438
I haven't even been
out of California.

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,339
Though, I did go to Vegas once.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,359
So, no.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,446
So what reason do we have to believe
that Wyoming actually exists?

15
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,447
There's... Yellowstone.

16
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:48,710
- The National Park?
- The National Park.

17
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:52,654
Well 'National' means government...

18
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,885
- Which means that Wyoming is a secret federal operation.
- That is crazy.

19
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,224
I'm telling you that if you told someone...

20
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,999
Look, if you told someone
from another country

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,415
to point to Wyoming on a map...

22
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,460
Would they be able to do it?

23
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,429
- Yes they would!
- No! No they wouldn't be able to do it.

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,456
They would be able to do it.

25
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:08,612
- I couldn't even do that. They would not be able to...
- Dude, did you turn vegan?

26
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:09,838
What?

27
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:20,123
Johnny, chill out. It's okay.

28
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,048
That's blasphemous bro. Come on.

29
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,489
I hate you, Wade!

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,108
I hate you too, bud.

31
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,375
Come on man. I see that smile.

32
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,940
I know you love me!

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,917
Kubrick once said that it's a mistake to
confuse pity with love.

34
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,417
Like...

35
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:52,558
Cubic the function?

36
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:09,566
Hey!

37
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:12,538
Hey, how's the script coming along?

38
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,333
It's going pretty well. I'm almost done.

39
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:16,644
Oscar worthy?

40
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,348
Hell no, it's just a short.

41
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,949
The academy has
a category for those yeah but like for the

42
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,096
Yeah, but like...

43
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,454
for the real ones.

44
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,660
I mean, with each one you make
you get better.

45
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,217
You'll get there someday

46
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:30,423
Thanks.

47
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,584
What's up?

48
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,417
Will wants me to go pick him up some
food and take it to the store.

49
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:46,676
Do you wanna get anything to eat?

50
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,366
I can't. I'm broke.

51
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,188
I didn't ask you if you had money.

52
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,871
I asked you if you wanted to eat.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,990
Ay, where at then?

54
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,427
Um, Will wants McDonald's, so.

55
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,412
You gonna get a Royale with Cheese?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,543
You just saw that movie like two days ago.

57
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,304
What's wrong with that?

58
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:05,552
Nothing, I'm...

59
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm just so proud.

60
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:09,715
I'm just trying to keep up with you, man.

61
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,458
I know, and you're doing
such a great job with that.

62
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,905
Alright then, Mr. Director.

63
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:14,999
Save the tears.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,190
I'm gonna go get ready.

65
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:19,955
Alright.

66
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,412
Yeah, thanks.

67
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,220
See you at home.

68
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:54,410
See ya.

69
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,999
Yeah, I could have done a better job at
that last season. i don't know what they

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,329
I don't know what they were thinking.

71
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,708
I told you that show was trash.

72
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,205
Yeah. Yeah you did.

73
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,063
Who's fries are you eating?

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,382
I'm eatin' mine.

75
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,813
Alright. You always do this.

76
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:12,314
Do what?

77
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:13,617
Right when we get home,

78
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,999
you're gonna give me the
fries that you've been eating.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,994
And then you're gonna
take the one that's full.

80
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,419
Who's holding the bag?

81
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,927
Who bought the bag?

82
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:25,170
And who bought the food in the bag?

83
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,202
Fair point.

84
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,010
- Thank you.
- Bite it.

85
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:32,993
- I am not gonna bite it.
- Bite it!

86
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:34,239
I am not gonna bite it.

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,550
That's not my style.

88
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,678
Gimme the fry.

89
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,175
You're gonna make me crash.

90
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,043
Thank you. God.

91
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,595
Wade!

92
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:06,927
Wade!

93
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:07,928
What?

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,668
How was work?

95
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,480
The usual.

96
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,481
Whatcha doing?

97
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:20,878
I'm writing.

98
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,770
Write while you can, buddy.

99
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,357
That's... what I'm doing.

100
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,166
Okay. Whatever.

101
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,416
Um, dinner is gonna be
ready in a few minutes.

102
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,421
Alright.

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
What's up Johnny?

104
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,564
Dude, I got in.

105
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,712
Wait, where?

106
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,042
Berkeley, dude!

107
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:51,918
I told you you'd get it.

108
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:55,445
I can't believe it! I'm off the waitlist.

109
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:56,698
That's awesome, man.

110
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,595
I can't... I can't even believe it...

111
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,385
Damn.

112
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,352
We're... We're gonna be pretty far away from
each other.

113
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:06,353
Wade, it's my dream school.

114
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:08,753
I'll come visit a lot during our breaks

115
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,074
and I'll see how much you've
grown the business with Will.

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
Or... when you make a huge movie.

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,103
Maybe I'll come back to work here too.

118
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,751
Silicon Valley's getting pricey.

119
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,342
Yeah.

120
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,741
I'm happy for you though man. that's like really great
johnny thanks man star of something big means a lot

121
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:26,741

122
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:27,742
Thanks, man.

123
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:29,999
That start of something big.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It means a lot.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,551
Alright, I... gotta go eat dinner.

126
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,552
Yeah, see you man.

127
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,042
Uh, you still there?

128
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,942
Yeah, my bad... Later.

129
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:49,943
Yeah, see you man.

130
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,292
Wade!

131
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
What?!

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
What?!

133
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:09,198
Dinner!

134
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,840
All right!

135
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,197
That night, I finally finished my script.

136
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:22,510
It was a simple story... two old
friends learning to part ways.

137
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,112
Something I'd be able to
make on my own...

138
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,113
without too much help.

139
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,591
Hey Wade.

140
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:38,709
You know you look creepy
sitting on a park bench by yourself, right?

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,288
What's this?

142
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,677
The Fraternal Tragedy,
written by Wade Down.

143
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:45,405
You want me to read this now?

144
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:46,406
Yeah, now.

145
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,319
Okay, lemme sit.

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,926
Hey Wade!

147
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,265
One question!

148
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,266
Huh?

149
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
Who am I playing?

150
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,808
You really want to be in it?

151
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,479
You don't have to if you don't want to...

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,978
No, I'm serious. Yeah.

153
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,404
It's a great script,

154
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,199
I want my Oscar nomination,

155
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,773
and, I mean it's our last
summer together so why not?

156
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,179
Thank you man. Um...

157
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,878
Actually, I kind of wrote... had uh...

158
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,315
I kind of had a character
in mind for you already.

159
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,512
Uh, which character?

160
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:25,513
Um...

161
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,666
The character Kevin.

162
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,999
The backstabber?

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,961
- Okay, no, not like that.
- Wow, Wade. I see what you think of me.

164
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:34,784
- You really think of me that way?
- No, I...

165
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:37,115
I'm just messing with you dude, c'mon.

166
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,667
I can... I can play Kevin.

167
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,750
I don't think I'm a Kevin,
but I can play Kevin.

168
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,834
Perfect. That's what I thought.

169
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:46,297
Alright. So when do we start filming?

170
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,582
Well this is not gonna
be like my other shorts.

171
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,647
We're gonna need funding.

172
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,127
Will!

173
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,346
Will! Will!

174
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:02,103
What?

175
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,397
Can you turn that off?

176
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:04,604
No!

177
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,542
I need to ask you something.

178
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,543
Huh?

179
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,196
Can I borrow some money
for my next project?

180
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,555
No, no, no. We had a deal.

181
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:14,177
One summer off from the store.

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,401
Please?

183
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:17,400
No work, no pay.

184
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,401
Find the money yourself, Wade.

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,011
Where's this dude from?

186
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,012
Some online marketplace.

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,890
He's from around here though.

188
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,240
What's taking him so long?

189
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,240
Just give him some time.

190
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,241
I'm sure he's around.

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,679
If he's not here in fifteen minutes...

192
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,190
Be patient.

193
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,684
Alright, where is this guy?

194
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,684
I told him what my car looks like.

195
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,685
It's so hot in here.

196
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,980
Where are these guys from?

197
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,981
Around here.

198
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,004
Are there supposed to be two of them?

199
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,629
I didn't think so.

200
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,261
I thought there was only
supposed to be one of them.

201
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,262
Yeah. Me too.

202
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,679
Well, are you sure about this?

203
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Bro, I can't pass this up. It's a steal.

204
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,194
Soon as we secure the ball,

205
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,006
I can resell it for
double, probably triple.

206
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:41,517
Well I'm gettin' fifty percent, right?

207
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,549
No.

208
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,550
What do you mean, 'no?'

209
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,927
Then why am I here?

210
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,023
Bro you owe me.

211
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,024
We talked about this.

212
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:54,399
I did you a favor.

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,469
That was so long ago.

214
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,469
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,476
That doesn't count,

216
00:11:58,477 --> 00:11:59,668
That doesn't just go away, man.

217
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:02,674
We detailed your car for three hours.

218
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,291
Me and my uncle Jorge.

219
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,093
Yeah, well screw you and your uncle Jorge!

220
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,369
No! Uh uh!

221
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,094
You remember that.

222
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,386
You owe me a solid.

223
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,126
Yeah, well that's 'cause
he scuffed my shoe!

224
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,598
I got the black Forces.
What am I supposed to do!

225
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,667
Bullcrap. We spent so long out there,

226
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,757
sweating our butts off for you!

227
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,004
You owe me. You know this.

228
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,893
You're here for security. Nothing else.

229
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:23,585
Whatever dude.

230
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,240
Man talking about sweating your butts
off, let's just get this over with!

231
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
I don't know about this.

232
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,458
It's frickin' hot. Can you turn on the AC?

233
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,479
Do you wanna pay me for a new car battery when my car
goes dead 'cause I'm runnin' the AC for ya? Huh?

234
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,809
Or or would you rather pay me the gas money

235
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,999
when I turn my turn on
my car to use the AC?

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,292
Or actually! Actually!

237
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:47,911
You can drive my car

238
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,016
all the way down to the gas
station and fill up my tank.

239
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,787
How 'bout that? Huh? Huh?!

240
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:54,853
You know it's probably worth it, bro.

241
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,585
Honestly, it's like a
hundred and five out here.

242
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:58,708
And while you're out there,

243
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,796
you can buy me a Slim
Jim and a couple Coronas.

244
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,527
One for me, one for my uncle Jorge.

245
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,282
Yeah, like I said, screw your uncle Jorge!

246
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,490
You owe him too, man.

247
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:07,998
Okay, well I'm gonna get 'em nice and
warm 'cause I know how you like it.

248
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,991
That's right you are!

249
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,985
Hundred and fifteen degrees 'cause
these frickin' greenhouse gases!

250
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:13,654
Greenhouse gases?

251
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:14,999
Yeah, you know. It's like the...

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,785
The light comes in and bounces...

253
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,210
It makes it hotter, you know!

254
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,949
It's like ninety degrees outside

255
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,583
but its like a hundred and twenty in here.

256
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,010
Just turn on the AC.

257
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:25,823
It's like twenty cents of gas!

258
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,563
You're crazy, fool.

259
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,013
Yeah, well whatever bro.

260
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,954
Hey, I was thinking about
this on the way here.

261
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:39,955
What if I do like an accent.

262
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:41,528
What? No. Why?

263
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,870
Yeah you know, like uh...

264
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:46,708
What's up homes, lemme get that
baseball from you real quick, aight?

265
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:47,519
Scare 'em.

266
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,519
That's stu...

267
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,092
Yeah...

268
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:51,677
I like that.

269
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,705
It's good, huh?

270
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,978
Yeah, I like it!

271
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,710
Yeah, 'cause that way they
don't know what's goin' on, bro.

272
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,835
I'll tell 'em I'm you know, coming
up with the crew you know whatada...

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,728
Okay.
It's good, huh?

274
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,757
Alright, bro!

275
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,962
It's freaking good, shit. Yeah...

276
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,740
You ready for this?

277
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:07,835
Yeah, I'm ready.

278
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:11,250
We'll be fine. Let's go.

279
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,360
Here they come.

280
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,822
Dude, this is shady.

281
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:24,823
We'll be fine.

282
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,064
Hi, I'm Wade.

283
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,143
I thought you were a man.

284
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,168
How old are you?

285
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,292
I'm eighteen.

286
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,146
Nice.

287
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:36,146
Bro. You wanna not scare 'em away?

288
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Well you know I just don't want to
be doing business with no minor.

289
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:42,680
Lemme see the ball.

290
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,480
Money first.

291
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:45,481
Very well.

292
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,878
Ball of cash for a ball of base.

293
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,259
Are you freaking kidding me?

294
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,732
Bro, can you stop embarrassing me?

295
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:53,682
Yo, you're embarrassing yourself.

296
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,592
Why would you say somethin' dumb like that?

297
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,336
Lemme see the signature.

298
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Thank you.

299
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,767
Dude, how much did you get?

300
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,997
I don't know but it's
way more than I thought.

301
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,446
That's a fake.

302
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,614
It's a fake!

303
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,960
How do you know?
Because!

304
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:17,953
Let's get 'em!

305
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,094
Hey!

306
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,876
Get over here!

307
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:23,167
Hey, this is a fake!

308
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,146
I want my money back right now
or I'm callin' the cops, bro!

309
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:27,647
Why?

310
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:28,960
It's fake!

311
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,460
It's not fake!

312
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
Look at it!

313
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,672
Johnny! Johnny!

314
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:33,173
It's not real, it's fake.

315
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,314
It's not!

316
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,248
Hey!

317
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,526
Wade, start the car!

318
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:56,858
Go get him!

319
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,329
You get him!

320
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,501
Hurry up!

321
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,433
Unlock it, it's locked!

322
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:06,434
My bad!

323
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,343
Go, what are you doing!

324
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,306
Buckle up!

325
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,306
You!

326
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,626
You got lucky! You won't
get away with this!

327
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,171
Thanks for the help back there.

328
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,527
Was the signature fake?

329
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,108
No, it wasn't.

330
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Okay.

331
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,399
I guess you could say the...

332
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,961
The guy I kicked back there
really dropped the ball.

333
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:22,708
Yeah, you could say that.
Get it?

334
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,709
Yeah, I get it.

335
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,475
Alright. See you man.

336
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:29,476
Later.

337
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,696
Hey.

338
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:41,040
Sorry for not believing you.

339
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,598
Thanks again.

340
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,126
Don't worry about it.

341
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,758
Don't tell my parents though, okay?

342
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,932
I won't.

343
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,990
I won't.

344
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,234
That was our first close call.

345
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:39,235
We could have got in some
real trouble back there.

346
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,352
In that moment, I didn't care whether that
ball's signature was authentic or not.

347
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:46,405
What mattered to me was that I had
quick money to finance the film.

348
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:48,861
And now it was time to get started.

349
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,952
Putting up flyers kept things local.

350
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,484
I just needed one more actor.

351
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:55,205
But other than that,

352
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,141
The Fraternal Tragedy was well underway.

353
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,821
You know, um...

354
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,697
You know I'm really gonna
miss you at college.

355
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:29,823
I'll miss you too.

356
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,115
I'm gonna be really lonely.

357
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,543
You could uh, find a lady.

358
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,859
Or maybe a dude.

359
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah for sure for sure.

360
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
So, I'll be shooting my next film soon.

361
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Oh yeah?

362
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:04,812
Mhm.

363
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:09,601
I really think it's gonna be good.

364
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:11,940
Mmm.

365
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,892
You think I could try becoming a director?

366
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,218
I could go to film
school and focus on that,

367
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,262
and I'll be out of your way.

368
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:27,374
What is this now, Wade?

369
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,866
You don't want to help
with the store anymore?

370
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,264
You don't wanna get rich?

371
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:36,341
After you get this MBA, that's it.
We're set. We can expand.

372
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,766
I don't care about the money.

373
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,951
Plus Johnny says I have what it takes.

374
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,952
You think I love running
that place everyday?

375
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,976
I didn't have the
opportunity to go to college,

376
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,124
because of what happened to Mom and Dad.

377
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,236
Then why don't we sell the store?

378
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:00,105
We could go to college and we
both will have what we want.

379
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:01,556
We're not selling the store.

380
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:05,084
I might not love the place,
but you know who I love?

381
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,163
Listen...

382
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:14,000
Going to film school
won't get you anywhere.

383
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,834
Neither will some business program.

384
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:19,024
It will if you work hard enough, and
you're a hard worker. I've seen it.

385
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,648
I could work hard to
become a director, then.

386
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:22,528
We don't even have the
money to send you there.

387
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:25,631
The scholarship for business
school can't be transferred.

388
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,152
Can't the life insurance
money pay for it then?

389
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,214
The life insurance, Wade?

390
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,292
How do you think we paid off this house?

391
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:36,215
Sure, our store is doing
pretty well right now.

392
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,534
But it could always grow, and
it can definitely always fall.

393
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,888
That's where you come in.

394
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:45,600
Why can't I just...

395
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,100
No.

396
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm not gonna let you waste your
time or your smarts on film school.

397
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:54,236
Life is easy and set for
you from here on out.

398
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:55,989
Just take it.

399
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,887
From here we build what we were given.

400
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,036
Tim Burton says...

401
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:11,229
You shouldn't spend
your life making someone else's dreams.

402
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,190
Do you just sit around
looking at quotes all day?

403
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,081
I just wanna learn from the best.

404
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:17,591
And you will.

405
00:22:17,592 --> 00:22:18,899
At business school.

406
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,448
Hey, when does your brother get home?

407
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:59,315
End of the day so we're chilling.

408
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,540
And, got it.

409
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,281
Alright I downloaded the auditions
already so it shouldn't take long.

410
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,903
How many were there?

411
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:07,204
Only three.

412
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:08,277
Three?

413
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:08,778
Yeah.

414
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,611
Damn, people are really
sleeping on this film.

415
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,189
You did mention on the flyer
that you're paying them right?

416
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,699
No.

417
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,406
Nice.

418
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,316
- Let's just watch the auditions.
- Hey, uh

419
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:27,814
My name is John. And...

420
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,678
Mmmm. Nah...

421
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,719
That's not my real name. I was
gonna give you a fake name.

422
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,968
But...

423
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:40,505
Dr. Jill says I have to be
more honest now!

424
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,033
So I'm Cody and here's...

425
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,742
Anyways my name's Steve and here's my...

426
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:51,766
My scene.

427
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,005
Action!

428
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,515
You talkin' to me?

429
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,381
You talking to me?

430
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:04,237
Well who the hell else... you talking to me?

431
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,412
Casino.

432
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,952
And uh here's my...

433
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:15,000
My Mr. Wick if you know what I mean.

434
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,501
Action!

435
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,413
His Keanu impression is pretty good.

436
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,214
He's literally just
staring a bit off camera.

437
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,831
That's spot on though. And it works.

438
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:34,667
Yeah I guess.

439
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:35,765
Man I love that guy.

440
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,040
Next!

441
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,320
Huh. Next.

442
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:41,219
Hey what's up. I'm Tommy and...

443
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,241
Well I gotta be honest I've
never really acted before,

444
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:46,393
- But I'm kinda hoping this'll be my big break.
- This guy looks pretty good.

445
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,327
- I'm going to acting school in the fall...
- Skip!

446
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:50,152
- But I thought I'd join this production during the summer.
- Wait, why?

447
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,206
He's not even doing a scene.

448
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,693
I actually think we went to the
same high school, right? Go Titans!

449
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:56,734
It's not about the acting ability.
It's about the personality.

450
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:00,363
Do you wanna be the director?

451
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:03,058
Alright. I'm just sayin'. It's your call.

452
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,163
Maybe. Let's just check out the next
guy and we'll see from there.

453
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,984
Hey kid, remember me?

454
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,926
Guess what? Saw your little flyer
on my way home from work.

455
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:28,939
I'll never forget your
face and you know what?

456
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,562
You're gonna get what's comin' to you.

457
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,712
Gimme that.

458
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:34,376
Also your flyer is ugly!

459
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,584
I don't know why we laughed at that.

460
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,423
I guess Tommy's gonna be late.

461
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
So this is like the main area of the film?

462
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,540
Yup. Seems like a lethal
meeting place, you know?

463
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,032
You want another signature
incident to go down?

464
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,187
No.

465
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:28,383
The vibe here just fits the script.

466
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,757
Here he comes.

467
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,482
Hey!

468
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:35,482
Hey.

469
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,792
Okay, so, uh, you're Wade?

470
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,793
Mhm. I'm Wade Down.

471
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,583
Alright then.

472
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:46,953
You're Tommy, right?

473
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,496
Uh yeah looks like it.

474
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,720
So uh how big is this film anyway?

475
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,019
I'm the crew.

476
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,359
Are you serious? How do you expect
this production to get anywhere?

477
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:01,011
At the end of the day
you're still getting paid.

478
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,617
You still get a credit.

479
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:06,879
You're the actor, I'm the director and the
cameraman, DP, and so on. You get the idea.

480
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,864
Alright, so who's that over there?

481
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:12,000
- That's Johnny.
- I'm Johnny.

482
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,983
What's his job?

483
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:20,984
- He's playing Kevin.
- I'm playing Kevin.

484
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,513
Where is he going?

485
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:34,821
I don't know.

486
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,267
Why'd we get stuck with this guy?

487
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,842
It was your idea to hire him.

488
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:40,984
You agreed to it.

489
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,816
Well, he's who we gotta work with.

490
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:04,987
Let me see the script.

491
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,329
Sike! Great actors don't need scripts!

492
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,451
Well I don't know if you're a great actor.

493
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,735
And I've worked months on the script

494
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:15,042
So you're gonna use it.

495
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,862
Alright, alright, let's
just pick up the script yeah?

496
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:22,523
Fine.

497
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,914
You all right?

498
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,086
Listen, I know Wade's a
little on edge right now,

499
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,025
and it's really complicated, but

500
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:45,255
it's his last chance to
do what he loves to do.

501
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,744
So let's just do it his way, okay?

502
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,789
- Alright.
- Okay, we cool?

503
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,174
- Yeah.
- Alright.

504
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:51,638
Wade, come here.

505
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,143
Yeah Wade, we're good now.

506
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,983
Alright. First filming day is Monday. Here.

507
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:09,224
So wear what you guys are
wearing and welcome aboard.

508
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,119
Tommy was right.

509
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,385
I was in over my head
trying to wear all those hats.

510
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,386
But I did my best.

511
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,394
That's me. That's me eighth grade.

512
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:22,639
That's you?

513
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
That's me eighth grade bro.

514
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:28,468
What's so funny?

515
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.

516
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,079
Cool, well are you guys ready then?

517
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,598
So Tommy you'll be standing
there with your arms crossed.

519
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,447
Johnny, you'll be down that hill.
I'll tell you when to come up.

520
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,349
Alright.

521
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,797
And, action!

522
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:10,891
Wait Johnny!

523
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,959
Move further down.

524
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Okay.

525
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,328
- Is here good? Okay.
- Yeah.

526
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,981
Action!

527
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,903
So what do we do now?

528
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:33,561
Didn't you read the script?

529
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:34,232
Yeah.

530
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,349
So I want you to act out
the scene get a feel for it.

531
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,306
Well yeah I know I'm
supposed to ask Johnny if...

532
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,645
Kevin.

533
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:44,307
Kevin... if he's the guy, but like how?
Like what's the timing?

534
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:45,751
Hold on.

535
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,057
Alright so I already got the wide shot.

536
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:57,679
So I'll cut to Johnny when he walks up.

537
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,489
And you guys can just improvise this scene.

538
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,650
And then I'll give you notes afterwards.
So yeah, just reset.

539
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,246
And... action!

540
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,668
So you're the guy?

541
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,279
No, I'm just travel in
the middle of nowhere.

542
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,490
Yeah I get it I'm just saying
you don't really look the part.

543
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:20,651
Oh yeah, I...

544
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:25,929
Well, sorry... Sorry guys I didn't
press record, so...

545
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,269
- Come on, man. It's hot out.
- But that was really good!

546
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,649
So let's just reset and do it again.

547
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,793
Make sure you press record this time.

548
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
Alright see you guys later.

549
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,072
Yeah good work today guys.

550
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:07,073
Thanks boss.

551
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,311
You know I've never actually
learned how to ride a bike.

552
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:14,542
- Really?
- Yeah

553
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:17,583
Yeah this is my only transportation.
I don't have a car, so...

554
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:20,179
Oh, neither do I. Guess I
gotta get a bike, right?

555
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,422
- How far you have to walk?
- I'm just waiting for my ride.

556
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:26,769
Yo. Johnny.

557
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,875
Yeah what's up?

558
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,584
Here you go man.

559
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:35,054
Dude, come on, I don't need this.

560
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,095
It's cool dude. We have
enough in the budget, so...

561
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:38,963
You sure?

562
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:39,963
Yeah.

563
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:41,056
Alright. Thank you man.

564
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:42,329
No problem.

565
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,504
Hey Tommy do you wanna just wait inside?

566
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,033
- You live here?
- Yeah.

567
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:52,032
Why is your bike outside?

568
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,534
Oh, I was out and then I just saw
you walking up so I chased you.

569
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,894
Alright, let's do it.

570
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,360
How was your day?

571
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:54,780
Pretty good. We started filming today.

572
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,475
Mmm. How'd that go?

573
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,942
Good, but it was hot as hell.

574
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:01,542
There's absolutely zero shade in the hills.

575
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:04,183
The hills by Johnny's house?

576
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:06,040
Yeah why?

577
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,710
You gotta be careful out there.

578
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:10,339
If you got hurt and couldn't
call for help or if...

579
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,922
Chill.

580
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,895
No, Wade. You need to stay safe especially
if you're going to be out all day.

581
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:19,523
If you're out with friends, I don't
want them suing us if they get hurt.

582
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:20,687
They wouldn't didn't do that.

583
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,937
Well, Tommy might.

584
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,025
Who's that?

585
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:25,250
He's one of our actors.

586
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,698
He's our age so don't worry about it.

587
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:28,855
I'm paying him too.

588
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:31,355
Uh, paid?

589
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,008
With what money?

590
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,835
I sold the signed baseball.

591
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,356
You're joking right? For
like what, five dollars?

592
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,840
It's worth more than that
it's a signed baseball.

593
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,670
Dude I'm sorry no that signature's fake.

594
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:53,263
Dad just told you it was real because the line
was way too long to get it actually signed.

595
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,035
Wait how much did you sell it for? Fifty?

596
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
More?

597
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,835
A hundred?

598
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
More.

599
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:14,627
What?!

600
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
Goddamn you should have been in
business this whole time.

601
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,731
The guys we sold it to knew it was fake.

602
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:24,253
And Johnny and I just ran.

603
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:33,397
I mean, I guess just stay safe, okay?

604
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:37,015
We're gonna do it Johnny. We're
sneaking in tomorrow night.

605
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:38,929
That's illegal bro.

606
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,675
It's just one scene. In, and out.
No problems.

607
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,775
I don't know...

608
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:48,404
Look. I haven't seen security
since the renovations.

609
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:49,405
So, we'll be fine.

610
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,351
So you in?

611
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:56,864
Do we have to?

612
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,263
Yeah.

613
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,003
Why can't we just film it during
the day when the park's open?

614
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,950
Because I wrote the scene
for it to be at night.

615
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,214
Why can't we just make it during the day?

616
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,943
I said I wrote the scene at night, Johnny.

617
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,543
Fine. Is Tommy down?

618
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,145
Well he has to be.

619
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,079
I know Will was only trying to protect me, but I
needed to take some risks to get this film made.

620
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,929
That's why I couldn't give him the
details of the scene just yet.

621
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,751
Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Right?

622
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,840
- Hey you want some?
- No thanks.

623
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,488
Uh, Will...

624
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,051
Yeah?

625
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,904
I'm gonna be out late tonight. For filming.

626
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,477
It's a night scene, so...

627
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,143
Alright. Well I'm gonna be
working late anyways so,

628
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:22,929
I just need you to be safe alright?

629
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,973
Okay.

630
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,158
Alright guys, now's the time.

631
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,839
Come on, hurry up let's just do it.

632
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,960
Let's go.

633
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:42,657
You guys memorized your lines right?

634
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:43,752
Yeah.

635
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,000
So this should go by fast.

636
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:58,766
Damn it.

637
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,179
- Dude let's just leave.
- Yeah man let's just get outta here.

638
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,378
No. Once he goes back we'll be fine.

639
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,113
Move out.

640
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,514
Hey man if this gets
sketchy I'm outta here.

641
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:37,722
Yeah me too.

642
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,460
Alright, let's do this.

643
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,981
Let's just hurry up.

644
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,224
Cut. Alright, we'll get the reverse shot.
Same lines.

645
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:09,840
And, action.

646
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,444
Hey! Hey get over here!

647
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:18,651
- Wade he's coming.
- I know.

648
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:21,682
- He ruined the shot. We have to do it again.
- No Wade. We gotta go, man.

649
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:23,125
- Action.
- Dude no way!

650
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:24,126
Action!

651
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,761
You're the one that keeps trying
to pull me back into this life.

652
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,377
I don't wanna do this anymore.

653
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:30,980
Then why did you come back?

654
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,142
Cut. Awesome, let's go!

655
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,987
Hey. Three kids just snuck into the park.

656
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:48,434
I think they were filming something.

657
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:51,439
You think it was the kids those
weird guys reported? Over.

658
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,114
I don't know, man.

659
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:07,713
What's up?

660
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:09,111
Tired.

661
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:12,259
I see that. So what did you do today?

662
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,282
I uh, ran from security at the park.

663
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:20,672
You did what?

664
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:25,085
I don't have time for this right now.

665
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:27,889
You gotta stop doing all
this dangerous stuff Wade.

666
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,470
I didn't get arrested. And
I didn't even get caught.

667
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:32,919
- So relax.
- And if you did...?

668
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,876
Shut up Wade.

669
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,473
- This could have ruined our whole future.
- Our future?

670
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,951
It was for the film.

671
00:41:40,952 --> 00:41:44,126
I wanted a night scene at the park,
so I got a night scene at the park.

672
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,209
What you do for yourself
can affect me too Wade.

673
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:50,265
I'm not gonna cut any
corners for this film.

674
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,126
Just use common sense.

675
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,388
Got it.

676
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,105
That scene better be perfect.

677
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:03,569
This whole movie better be perfect if
it's worth risking that much to you.

678
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,120
It's the only thing I care about right now.

679
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:11,334
I know you like making films but why do
you wanna make a whole career out if it?

680
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:18,859
After mom and dad...

681
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,108
I realize how short life can be.

682
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,778
So I wanna live it the right way.

683
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,667
This has been in me all along.

684
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:33,669
I just never thought I
could do it until now.

685
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,740
Seems like this movie's
gonna be pretty good.

686
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:16,889
Yeah I hope so. Wade's
been working pretty hard.

687
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,184
You trying to be an actor too?

688
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,544
No, I've just known Wade a long time.

689
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,849
Really? Things seem kinda
weird between you two.

690
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,621
Uh... I don't know.

691
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,355
He kind of changed a few years back.

692
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,918
But I'mma stick with him.

693
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,329
We're pretty much like brothers.

694
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,838
So have you ever actually
met anyone from Wyoming?

695
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,602
- Because I have this theory...
- Yeah. I was born there.

696
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:57,483
No way.

697
00:43:57,484 --> 00:44:00,364
Yeah I just... I don't remember too much.
I was pretty young.

698
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:02,210
Are you being serious?

699
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:03,609
Oh. There he is.

700
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,268
Hey Wade.

701
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:13,798
Hey guys, sorry for making you wait.

702
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,875
No, you're fine. We got here kinda early.

703
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:19,668
Sorry.

704
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:45,699
Come on, pick up.

705
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,369
- What's wrong?
- What's up?

706
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,809
You can't just take my camera, Will!

707
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,691
Mmm. No I'm sure I can.

708
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,095
I know it was a stupid idea to sneak
into the park but it's over with.

709
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:08,631
I'm trying to be more professional
now and it's kind of hard to do that,

710
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:13,062
when my actors are waiting for me on set and I don't
have the most important thing. the most important thing.

711
00:45:13,063 --> 00:45:15,943
I don't know. It sounds like you're
unprofessional even with the camera.

712
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,094
You told me to make the perfect film.

713
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,992
And I'm trying to do that.

714
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,154
Where is it?

715
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,006
They're waiting for me Will.

716
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,705
Dude!

717
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:36,188
Wade, I'm busy here. It's in my closet.
Leave me alone!

718
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,433
Where are you guys?

719
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:35,761
Oh you got the camera?
Why didn't you call us?

720
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:38,100
I was driving.

721
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:39,484
Yeah, sorry.

722
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:43,433
Tommy had some stuff to do and I was
alone so I figured I would just go home.

723
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,845
Relax.

724
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,517
He told me to tell you he's sorry but he's free
to film all day tomorrow if you're down.

725
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,487
I mean I can too.

726
00:46:57,652 --> 00:47:02,700
Alright. Sounds good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

727
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,291
I'm not an idiot Han. You better give
me back the rest of my money or I'll...

728
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,947
Cut!

729
00:47:37,948 --> 00:47:40,384
Okay. Be more emotional.

730
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:42,006
Show more anger.

731
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:45,379
I'm trying. I've just never
been super mad before.

732
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,158
Pretend like you got hit then.

733
00:47:48,621 --> 00:47:50,650
Never gotten hit before.

734
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,500
Alright.

735
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,374
Dude don't do it.

736
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,617
Alright. Let's do that again.

737
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,618
Alright.

738
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:09,599
Action.

739
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,359
I'm not an idiot, Han!

740
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,241
Next time you take more of my money...

741
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:14,999
Ah, uh, okay that was also good.

742
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,799
But this time a little bit less emotion.

743
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,953
- Less angry.
- Okay.

744
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,880
I'm not an idiot, Han. Next time you
take more than your share, I'll...

745
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:27,864
- Just give me back the rest of my half!
- Cut.

746
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,623
Let's try that again.

747
00:48:29,624 --> 00:48:31,346
Sorry.

748
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:32,537
Action.

749
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,766
I'm not an idiot Han.

750
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,393
- Next time you take more than your share I'll...
- Cut.

751
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:38,120
Try again.

752
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:39,841
I'm not an idiot Han...

753
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,075
Alright let's try this one more time.

754
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:25,527
Action.

755
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,601
I'm not an idiot Han.

756
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:31,797
You better give me back the
rest of my shares or I'll...

757
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:32,859
Cut.

758
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,708
Are you even trying?

759
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,541
Dude what are you... Of course I am.

760
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:40,470
I just don't know why I
can't get this scene down.

761
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,882
I need you to get mad.

762
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:46,015
I need you to get angry mad.

763
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,668
Leo from The Revenant mad.

764
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,159
Dude I don't...

765
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,626
What do you want?

766
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:54,480
I don't... I don't know.

767
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,142
Don't hit me again.

768
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:04,779
I'm not gonna hit you again.

769
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,595
I'm trying my best.

770
00:50:08,596 --> 00:50:10,325
I know.

771
00:50:10,326 --> 00:50:12,621
It's not you.

772
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:13,760
We'll get it eventually.

773
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,675
What's wrong?

774
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:22,676
Nothing.

775
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,711
I guess...

776
00:50:27,703 --> 00:50:29,502
I guess I'm just scared.

777
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,663
That the movie isn't gonna
turn out how I expected it.

778
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,180
This is my last chance to prove
to everyone that I can do this.

779
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:42,126
Listen man, you've got serious talent.

780
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,858
You wrote a whole script by yourself.
You've written tons of them by yourself.

781
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:51,308
You're a one-man army trying to
make this whole dream come to life.

782
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:54,689
- It's not supposed to be easy.
- Yeah.

783
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,077
I do have the best friend I
could ask for helping me, so.

784
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,938
We're friends?

785
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,342
Yeah.

786
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,024
The sky's not really blue you know.

787
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:29,047
It's an illusion made
up of air and sunlight.

788
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,059
The same air we breathe.

789
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,171
The same sunlight that lets us see
the world for what it really is.

790
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,969
Blue's a weird color.

791
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,928
Come to think of it, Cobalt's
not really blue either.

792
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:50,783
At least not in its natural form.

793
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,372
Yeah I know.

794
00:51:53,373 --> 00:51:55,493
We did the elements project
together in eighth grade.

795
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,691
Oh yeah.

796
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,339
Cobalt's kind of weird.

797
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:11,607
I mean it's used in so many things
but too much of it is poisonous.

798
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,782
But you could say a lot
of things are like that.

799
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
Like drinking.

800
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,183
A lot of people drink alcohol and
it lets them loosen up, but...

801
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,840
too much of it and, you know
it could really mess your life up.

802
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,609
You could even say it's like water.

803
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,993
We're made of water, but...

804
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:46,256
too much of that and you're
six feet underground.

805
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:49,701
Or six feet under water if you
wanna take it literally.

806
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,565
You could even say Cobalt's
kind of like dreams.

807
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:59,364
We spend our whole lives chasing them,

808
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,823
but at the end of the
road they just consume us.

809
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:06,268
Turn us into different people.

810
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,086
Like dreams.

811
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,699
Shoot, what time is it?

812
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,729
I gotta go. I got work soon.

813
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,164
Hey do you know where I left my bike?

814
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:27,076
Yeah you lived in the side yard.

815
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:28,734
Why didn't you tell me you got a job?

816
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:30,581
I must have just forgotten, yeah.

817
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,266
That's cool dude. Gotta love a working man.

818
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:35,333
- Eh, I mean I just need some extra money for college you know.
- Yeah.

819
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:37,522
Don't worry, we're still
focusing on the film.

820
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,653
You should get a job too.

821
00:53:39,654 --> 00:53:42,803
Can't you work at your
parents'... your store?

822
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,084
Yeah, no I'm not gonna work there.

823
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,026
Um, so I'll see you tomorrow then?

824
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,743
No I can't I have an
orientation up in norcal.

825
00:53:52,744 --> 00:53:55,124
And then I have work all day the next day.

826
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,639
So how about the next day?

827
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah that can work, okay for sure.

828
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,613
Alright then, see you man.

829
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,189
- Alright, see you.
- Good luck at work.

830
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,881
- Thank you. Side gate's unlocked right?
- Yep.

831
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,146
Like dreams.

832
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,469
What's up?

833
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,541
Hey Tommy. We're gonna cancel filming
tomorrow and the next day.

834
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:48,452
Johnny just told me that he has some stuff to do
so we're gonna push back filming a couple days.

835
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,374
Yeah, he let me know.

836
00:54:52,036 --> 00:54:56,062
Oh. Okay uh cool. Well I just
wanted to make sure, you know.

837
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,360
Got it boss. Have a good night.

838
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,037
Yeah you too man, thanks.

839
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,308
Like Will said, the film
needs to be perfect.

840
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:10,639
This created a new drive in
me that I never had before.

841
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,299
It scared me.

842
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,129
It was my first mistake.

843
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,126
They say method acting consumes the soul of the actor
and transforms them into a character they're playing.

844
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,473
Into someone they're not.

845
00:55:21,474 --> 00:55:25,273
Apparently method directing
isn't really defined yet.

846
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:26,700
So I decided to try it.

847
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,261
Hey what's up Johnny?

848
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:51,679
Sorry, I'mma be a little late today.

849
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,974
That's cool. No worries, uh how come?

850
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:55,490
Can't find my bike.

851
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:59,155
Oh... that's weird. Do you
need me to pick you up?

852
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,885
No, thanks though. I was...
I was just letting you know.

853
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:06,264
Okay, uh see you soon man.

854
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:07,835
See ya.

855
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,120
Okay.

856
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:13,395
Action.

857
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,309
Yeah I'm no idiot, Han.

858
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,790
You better give me back the rest
of my money or I'll kill you.

859
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,840
Just give me back the rest of my share.

860
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,926
Dude that was the best one yet. So close.

861
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:35,620
Damn it!

862
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:37,917
Was it good enough though?

863
00:57:37,918 --> 00:57:41,537
Yes, but good enough isn't 'good enough.'

864
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:43,491
Please. I'm a little sick, too.

865
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:45,957
Better stay across that table then
because I don't wanna catch anything.

866
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:47,835
It's not contagious, don't worry.

867
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
Uh are you a doctor?

868
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,458
Exactly.

869
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:57,829
Are we done?

870
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,987
- Yes.
- Yes!

871
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:03,440
But let's run it back one
more time for variety's sake.

872
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,562
It's just one more.

873
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:09,313
Come on dude it's gonna be the same.

874
00:58:09,314 --> 00:58:12,239
Just draw on how you felt...

875
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,195
when you found out your bike was stolen.

876
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,862
Wait, stolen?

877
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,060
Yeah you said you couldn't find it.

878
00:58:23,043 --> 00:58:25,440
I never said it was stolen.

879
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,452
Well just assuming it was

880
00:58:29,453 --> 00:58:32,154
Imagine how it felt.

881
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,187
How it would feel.

882
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:38,442
Well, okay, you got this bro.

883
00:58:38,443 --> 00:58:42,560
Remember, The Academy is watching, so.

884
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:43,986
Ready?

885
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,417
Okay.

886
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,429
Action.

887
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,627
I'm not an idiot.

888
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:52,902
You can't just take what's not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

889
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,231
Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

890
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:59,952
but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

891
00:59:03,985 --> 00:59:05,261
- Oh my god.
- How's that?

892
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,091
That's the one.

893
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:10,767
It wasn't exactly a part of the
script but it worked even better.

894
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,343
Well I gotta go. I'm glad I could help you.

895
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,676
Do you need a ride?

896
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:23,749
Hey!

897
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,501
Maybe uh... maybe Tommy took it. Your bike.

898
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:36,280
Tommy doesn't even know how to ride a bike. But
since you brought it up you want me to ask him?

899
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,329
- I...
- No no no no.

900
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,873
Obviously if you think he
took the bike, let me ask him.

901
00:59:39,874 --> 00:59:42,477
- Well I don't mean...
- Hey what's up Johnny?

902
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,119
- Yeah. Wade here says you took my bike. Is that true?
- Um. What?

903
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,544
I can't ride a bike. Remember?

904
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,061
Yeah, no I didn't think
you would have either.

905
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:50,676
He's trying to frame me? You know what?
Tell that dude I'm done.

906
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:52,837
- Yeah, I don't blame you.
- This whole film is a mess.

907
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,024
I didn't mean that.

908
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,800
Johnny. I'll help you find your bike.

909
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah sure you will!

910
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:09,277
- I was late to work 'cause I couldn't find that damn bike.
- I'm sorry Johnny it was for this scene...

911
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:12,834
- Do you know what it's like to get chewed out by your boss on your third day of your first job?
- Like method acting!

912
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:14,376
I swear I was going to give it back!

913
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,880
- By the way, Tommy's done with the film. So am I.
- Don't just walk away, we're almost done with the film!

914
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,997
We're almost done with the film.

915
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,661
You think we overreacted?

916
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:47,025
No, I mean,

917
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:48,648
The guy's a vampire.

918
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,240
If we were younger I'd say sure,

919
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,181
make up and be all buddy
buddy again, but now?

920
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:57,584
- I'm 18. I'm going to college soon.
- Yeah, same.

921
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,288
- See, you got to surround yourself with people who'll help you get places.
- Yeah

922
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:03,440
How'd you do in school?

923
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,594
Not as good for how hard I tried.

924
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:09,200
Yeah I get you there. How did Wade do?

925
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:11,132
Amazing actually, he's pretty smart.

926
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:14,804
And he wants to be a filmmaker? It's
not really fair to the rest of us.

927
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,369
Kind of a waste of talent.

928
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,037
I mean,

929
01:01:20,038 --> 01:01:22,430
I get he was just trying to get the scene,

930
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:24,973
but to make me late to my real job?

931
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:26,390
And to blame you for it?

932
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,918
Yeah I mean he's got
drive, I'll give him that.

933
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,167
Yeah but drive too much
and you eventually crash.

934
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,659
What?

935
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,633
Or run out of gas. I mean you get
what I'm trying to say, like...

936
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,583
You good?

937
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:10,376
Yeah. Just practicing my acting.

938
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,212
Hey kid, remember me?!

939
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:29,787
How the hell did you guys
find me?

940
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:32,477
- We followed you home from the park.
- Dude that sounds creepy.

941
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:39,042
Oh yeah, we uh, uh came from the gym?
Or uh I saw you walking, or?

942
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,677
That makes no sense.

943
01:03:40,678 --> 01:03:42,474
What do you want?

944
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:44,151
You're gonna pay for what you did.

945
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:46,553
Cops are already on the way.

946
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:49,490
Where's your friend, huh?
Guess you'll do for now.

947
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,679
And don't do nothing loco
homes 'cause I'm filming.

948
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,483
- Already took my money!
- Listen, I was just trying to help a friend, I didn't...

949
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:56,126
Oh, the one who's not here!

950
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,598
- You're outnumbered fool.
- I swear I didn't know what to do.

951
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,488
- Yeah well the cops will know what to do.
- You got your pocket knife?

952
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,522
Nah homes, I left it at home.

953
01:04:04,523 --> 01:04:06,194
Are you kidding me?

954
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:08,340
- Nah homes, I thought...
- The cops won't even care!

955
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:10,109
What do you guys want, money?

956
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,506
Nah fool, we did until you jumped us, see?

957
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:14,528
We don't play like that!

958
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:29,435
I'm not proud of what I did,
leaving Johnny like that.

959
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:32,692
It felt like a knife in my back
when I saw him with Tommy earlier.

960
01:04:32,693 --> 01:04:36,501
And I thought leaving him with those
guys would somehow pull out the blade.

961
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,237
But all I ended up doing
was stabbing him too.

962
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,654
Wade...

963
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:09,614
Wade what are you doing man?

964
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,722
I think I messed up.

965
01:05:15,581 --> 01:05:17,410
What's going on?

966
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,898
I feel like I can't even
protect my own friends anymore.

967
01:05:35,661 --> 01:05:37,640
I should have helped him.

968
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,880
Johnny?

969
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,738
I keep pushing everyone away.

970
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,555
You always got me.

971
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:52,821
You're not my friend.

972
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,059
Fine.

973
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,370
But I'm your brother and I'm here for you.

974
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:02,650
- No you're not.
- I'm trying to be

975
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,473
Johnny was more of a brother than you.

976
01:06:08,474 --> 01:06:12,790
He always believed in
me, and now he hates me.

977
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,317
It's not that I don't believe in you Wade.

978
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:18,595
I'm just trying to be real.

979
01:06:18,596 --> 01:06:21,448
Real friends won't lie just
to make you feel better.

980
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:24,539
You lie to yourself all the time.

981
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,803
Care to explain?

982
01:06:26,804 --> 01:06:28,886
With your stupid master plan.

983
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:32,368
Just let go of them Will. We
could have our own futures.

984
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:37,729
You know what Wade? I'm trying to be
a good big brother and help you out.

985
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,504
It is a stupid move to throw
away what's been given to you.

986
01:06:41,505 --> 01:06:46,083
And if you don't care about
what mom and dad wanted for us,

987
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,672
then you can get out of their house.

988
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:52,568
Who are you to say what they wanted? You just want to keep the
store because the only part of them that still lives and breathes.

989
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:55,118
That store gave us everything.

990
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,547
And look at you. You're miserable.

991
01:06:57,548 --> 01:07:01,115
And if I don't follow my dreams, a few
years down the line I'll be miserable too.

992
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:03,666
I'm not gonna lose you too Wade.

993
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:06,099
We're gonna stick together.

994
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,429
Lucky for you that's
probably what's gonna happen.

995
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,139
No, it's lucky for you.

996
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,129
I hope you got to live out
your dreams while you could.

997
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,657
Because summer's almost over buddy.

998
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:17,281
Can't you see what you've been doing to me?

999
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:21,918
- You planted this seed in my head that all
I'm good for is what's easy for me!
- Get off me!

1000
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,840
You don't know how hard
I've been working for this.

1001
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,132
You don't know what I'm being put through.

1002
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,611
What you're being put through?

1003
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,750
What about me?

1004
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:35,473
We're the heirs of mom
and dad's liquor store,

1005
01:07:35,474 --> 01:07:38,374
- But all it feels like I've inherited is a poison.
- You want it so bad?

1006
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,083
A poison that runs through my veins eating at my
insides knowing I'll never be able to do what I love.

1007
01:07:42,084 --> 01:07:44,340
You want it that bad?

1008
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:47,542
Save me a seat at the Oscars, then.

1009
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,400
Being a filmmaker doesn't mean I
have to win Oscars or become famous.

1010
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,838
Plenty of people devote their lives
to it and make a fine living doing it.

1011
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,617
- Because they love it.
- Maybe you're right.

1012
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,147
I'm sorry.

1013
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:05,469
And I'd do this whole thing myself.

1014
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:11,260
But I don't have the time to go to college
or to study while I manage the store.

1015
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:13,395
I need your help.

1016
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:19,050
The way I see my future is with you beside me and
I'm sorry. It's just too late to change that.

1017
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,704
You can always make films Wade.

1018
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:25,460
You don't need some
special school to do that.

1019
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,906
I don't need business school
to own a store either.

1020
01:08:27,907 --> 01:08:31,169
That degree will open
more opportunities for us.

1021
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,443
We can start moving our way up.

1022
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:36,975
There you go with 'we' again.

1023
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:40,775
'We' are brothers.

1024
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:45,000
So yeah. We.

1025
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:51,109
You might not like me,
and you don't have to.

1026
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:55,315
But I'm gonna be there for you either way
because I made mom and dad a promise, okay?

1027
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,941
When you were adopted, I promised them I
wouldn't let anything bad ever happen to you.

1028
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,736
I might have gone too far, yeah.

1029
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:08,699
But I can't go back on it now.

1030
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,489
They'd be so disappointed in me right now.

1031
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:19,228
No.

1032
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:23,315
They always loved you Wade. No matter what.

1033
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,520
I don't know what happened
between you and Johnny...

1034
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,569
But if there's a way to fix
it, you should at least try.

1035
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,862
I'm not an idiot.

1036
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,221
You can't just take what's not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

1037
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:55,680
Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

1038
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:58,701
but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

1039
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,429
How was that?

1040
01:10:15,914 --> 01:10:17,385
I'm not an idiot.

1041
01:10:18,203 --> 01:10:21,261
You can't just take what's not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

1042
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,249
Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

1043
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,635
but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

1044
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,258
How was that?

1045
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,369
I'm not an idiot.

1046
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:52,157
You can't just take what's not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

1047
01:10:53,179 --> 01:10:55,774
Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

1048
01:10:56,311 --> 01:10:59,412
but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

1049
01:11:03,154 --> 01:11:04,162
How was that?

1050
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,385
Hey man.

1051
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,418
Hey.

1052
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,374
So how's life?

1053
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:36,352
Police literally detained me the other day.

1054
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:39,075
Honestly I'm just glad I wasn't arrested.

1055
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:42,652
- For what?
- Those creeps you sold the ball to...

1056
01:12:42,653 --> 01:12:44,334
They found me and they
called the cops on me

1057
01:12:44,335 --> 01:12:46,608
because I was beating
them up, trying to defend you.

1058
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:50,366
- But I helped too.
- Do you really wanna be in my situation right now Wade?

1059
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:51,818
Sorry.

1060
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:54,708
Anyways I just froze, I didn't...

1061
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,112
It's all your fault too.

1062
01:12:58,113 --> 01:12:59,228
How is it my fault?

1063
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:02,253
That ball you sold them.
The signature was fake.

1064
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:07,931
The things you do for
yourself hurt other people.

1065
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:10,115
Yeah I know I heard that before.

1066
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,376
Anyways, I need your help.

1067
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:25,095
Listen, if I don't make this
film, no one will believe in me.

1068
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,336
I know what I did...

1069
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,215
I know what I did was messed
up and I only had one chance.

1070
01:13:31,216 --> 01:13:32,700
And I blew it.

1071
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,833
I was just so focused on the film, I didn't
think of anything else.

1072
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:41,804
- And I'm sorry.
- Listen, I've been making good steps for my future.

1073
01:13:41,805 --> 01:13:45,411
I can't go backwards right now and it just
feels like you're pulling me that way.

1074
01:13:45,412 --> 01:13:47,328
And I'm happy for you.

1075
01:13:47,853 --> 01:13:50,399
It's just I wanna get to that place too.

1076
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,980
But I really need your help to get there.

1077
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:57,024
So all I could ask is...

1078
01:13:57,025 --> 01:14:00,442
All I could ask, is are you in?

1079
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,316
How many more scenes are there?

1080
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:06,009
I cut out a bunch so there's
only one more scene left.

1081
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,828
Okay. I'll do it. One more scene.\

1082
01:14:08,829 --> 01:14:09,967
Tommy won't though.

1083
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:12,380
What do you mean he won't?
I've been paying him.

1084
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:15,660
I guess he just doesn't take any of your crap.
Just make a contract next time or something.

1085
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:18,232
I've been dealing with his crap all this time,
and now he doesn't care about the movie?

1086
01:14:18,233 --> 01:14:20,980
- It's fine. I can take your buddy out of it anyways.
- Whatever, Wade.

1087
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:23,247
Remember what you told me
at the beginning of summer?

1088
01:14:23,248 --> 01:14:24,410
What?

1089
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:26,722
Don't confuse pity with love.

1090
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Uh.

1091
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,156
Where's my drink?

1092
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:59,019
Oh, what'd you want?

1093
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,381
- Will..
- Um,

1094
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,359
Soda.

1095
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:12,046
Please. Thanks.

1096
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,840
There you go.

1097
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,693
Will.

1098
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,970
William.

1099
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:41,857
Thank you. Thanks.

1100
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,519
So...

1101
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,000
How does your movie end?

1102
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,097
I never thought I would hear him say that.

1103
01:16:39,098 --> 01:16:43,692
The truth was I had to get out so much of the
script that my original ending was already ruined.

1104
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:46,423
But I had to finish this.

1105
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:48,501
And win Johnny back.

1106
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,890
No more lies.

1107
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:02,477
No more stealing or scamming
my way through this.

1108
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,752
I had to do something the right way.
For once.

1109
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,000
Before I could do that, I felt
like I had to change myself.

1110
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
Nice hair.

1111
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,167
Thanks.

1112
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:11,248
So uh you ready?

1113
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:13,127
Yeah let's just get this over with.

1114
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,000
Alright.

1115
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:18,463
- I brought some waters for when it gets hot.
- Hold up.

1116
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,452
School's calling. I'll be back.

1117
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,600
I had no idea what was coming.

1118
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:40,237
For some reason, I kept thinking about
that speech Johnny gave me in the backyard.

1119
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,876
Yo Johnny what happened?

1120
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,660
Johnny what happened?

1121
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,347
Leave me alone.

1122
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,689
What did they say?

1123
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,811
- Johnny.
- Go away.

1124
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:22,960
What?

1125
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,220
I'm done!

1126
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:27,999
- Johnny just tell me what happened.
- I got kicked out!

1127
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,083
From Berkeley?

1128
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,397
My admission was rescinded!

1129
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:34,015
- I'm so sorry.
- And it's all because of your stupid scam!

1130
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:36,011
They found out about the
whole deal with the cops.

1131
01:19:36,012 --> 01:19:38,631
Apparently now that's on my record!

1132
01:19:38,632 --> 01:19:40,467
Johnny just tell me what happened that day.

1133
01:19:40,468 --> 01:19:44,236
Those freaks from the park followed
me and then called the cops on me!

1134
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:47,409
- You already told me that but what did the cops do?
- There was only one cop!

1135
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:50,901
I told him about the whole thing
with your ball after he handcuffed me

1136
01:19:50,902 --> 01:19:52,794
but he let me go so I thought I was fine.

1137
01:19:52,795 --> 01:19:54,045
You know what?

1138
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,917
Take your stupid scam money!

1139
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,015
I didn't know this would happen. I'm sorry.

1140
01:20:00,016 --> 01:20:03,840
I didn't even know the ball was
fake until Will told me... Dude!

1141
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,634
Hey, hey, hey!

1142
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,162
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

1143
01:20:46,163 --> 01:20:47,360
My dreams are over Wade.

1144
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,115
How am I gonna tell my parents about this?

1145
01:20:51,974 --> 01:20:53,488
They're gonna kick me out.

1146
01:20:53,951 --> 01:20:56,783
I don't... I don't know, Johnny.

1147
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,155
I don't.

1148
01:20:59,156 --> 01:21:01,944
I could try calling them but that
would probably make things worse.

1149
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,584
You can bounce back from this.
We just need to figure things out.

1150
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,893
My dreams have been over since before I
could even recognize them.

1151
01:21:12,356 --> 01:21:14,010
You must have seen it.

1152
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:18,454
- I don't even know why you believed in me.
- Because brothers believe in each other

1153
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,703
But now I see that we were never brothers
so I don't know why I believed in you.

1154
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,280
You believe in Tommy don't you?

1155
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,349
He's going to acting school isn't he?

1156
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,882
He didn't even want to use my script!

1157
01:21:29,883 --> 01:21:32,770
You wanna know what I told Tommy
the first day we met him,

1158
01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:35,404
when he was being a complete jerk to you?

1159
01:21:36,462 --> 01:21:40,034
I told him this was the last chance
for you to do the one thing you loved,

1160
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:42,269
and that we have to do things your way!

1161
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:45,000
I know the messed up things
that got you to this point Wade.

1162
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,385
But you shouldn't drag me down with you.

1163
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:54,208
I'm stupid for thinking this film would get
me anywhere. All it did is blow up my face.

1164
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,337
In your face?

1165
01:21:56,338 --> 01:21:58,233
You know what Wade, fuck you!

1166
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,365
Johnny.

1167
01:22:07,366 --> 01:22:10,369
I saw those weirdos stop
you on the street the other day.

1168
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,903
Johnny I'm sorry.

1169
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,330
- Hey...
- Johnny!

1170
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:25,670
- I remember this lens is pretty expensive right?
- Don't!

1171
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:27,725
Why would you do that?!

1172
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,328
I wouldn't have sold the stupid baseball
if I knew it would do this to you.

1173
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,838
I know it's like losing
a future too, Johnny.

1174
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,381
Life took away my family, and put me in a
situation where I can't even do what I wanna do.

1175
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,369
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

1176
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,501
I need you!

1177
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,329
We were brothers!

1178
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,651
I'm sorry.

1179
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,640
I'm sorry.

1180
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,584
I'm sorry!

1181
01:23:36,258 --> 01:23:37,815
Hey Will.

1182
01:23:37,816 --> 01:23:41,692
I think you should call your
brother right now. He needs you.

1183
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,699
I finally reached the conclusion
of my own fraternal tragedy.

1184
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,765
I was done.

1185
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:07,108
Freed from my curse to make this film.

1186
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:09,716
But... it cost me a friend.

1187
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:13,189
I called Johnny's college and
explained to them what happened, but

1188
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:15,668
he's still waiting on his appeal.

1189
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:17,474
He deserves so much.

1190
01:24:17,475 --> 01:24:19,523
And I took everything from him.

1191
01:24:20,647 --> 01:24:24,750
Anyway, that was my summer.

1192
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:29,509
I love you Mom. I love you Dad.

1193
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:53,921
I won't be able to visit for a while...

1194
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,428
Because of school.

1195
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,520
But, um...

1196
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,502
Anyway.

1197
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,607
I finally understand what Johnny meant
when he said dreams are like cobalt.

1198
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,701
Some of us unwillingly inherit dreams
that the world wants to kill.

1199
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,661
When we decide to follow them anyways,

1200
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,739
too much passion can consume us...

1201
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,269
poison us...

1202
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:44,254
until we become the
villain of our own story.
