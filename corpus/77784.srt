518
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,992
YEAH, SHE'S
PRETTY INTENSE, HUH?

519
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:31,494
NO SHIT, MAN.

520
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:32,995
AFTER SHE AMBUSHED ME,

521
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:33,996
I COULDN'T EAT
FOR TWO DAYS.

522
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:36,999
MY GIRLFRIEND
FORCED SOME TOAST DOWN
MY THROAT THIS MORNING.

523
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,501
YOU KNOW,
I THREW IT UP.

524
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,002
BUT THAT'S KIND OF
A DRY RUN

525
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:44,507
FOR OUR NEXT 3 YEARS
IN PANANG PRISON, YOU KNOW.

526
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:48,010
SO YOU'RE GOING TO--
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS?

527
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,512
YOU'RE GOING BACK?

528
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:55,267
NO.

529
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,022
YOU DON'T
GIVE A SHIT, DO YOU?

530
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:04,026
ARE YOU SAYING I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT LEWIS?

531
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,027
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE, YEAH.

532
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,529
BECAUSE IF YOU
BELIEVE THAT,

533
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,030
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST FUCKING
THING ABOUT ME.

534
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,032
FINE. FINE.
ALL RIGHT.

535
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:12,034
THEN HOW COME YOU'RE
SO READY TO SLAM
THE DOOR ON HIM?

536
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:15,538
BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT GUYS WHO HAVE CLUBS
AND BADGES, ALL RIGHT?

537
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,540
I'VE HAD MY ASS KICKED
BY THOSE BASTARDS, TONY.

538
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,042
IT'S NOT HOW YOU THINK.
JUST BECAUSE YOU DO
SOMETHING GOOD

539
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,046
DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S
GOING TO BE A HAPPY ENDING
TO THE WHOLE THING.

540
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,548
YOU COULD VERY EASILY
DIE OVER THERE.

541
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,049
OK, YEAH.
YOU THINK OF THAT?

542
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:28,050
ALL RIGHT, LOOK--

543
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,052
THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE COIN, OK?

544
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,554
LET'S SAY,
IF THIS GOES DOWN

545
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:33,055
AND, GOD FORBID,
OK, LEWIS HANGS,

546
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:36,058
YOU DON'T THINK THIS
IS GOING TO BE, LIKE,
HEADLINE NEWS?

547
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,062
SHERIFF, THIS IS GOING
TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

548
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:41,063
WHEREAS,
THE OTHER WAY,

549
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,065
WE COME HOME
A PAIR OF HEROES,
AND THEN WHAT?

550
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:45,401
THE CITY THROWS US
A TICKER-TAPE PARADE?

551
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:49,071
GOD, TONY, YOU'RE
A FUCKING BOY SCOUT.
YOU REALLY ARE.

552
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:51,073
LISTEN TO ME, OK?

553
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:55,077
LEWIS
WOULD'VE GONE BACK
FOR EITHER OF US.

554
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:57,079
YOU KNOW THAT.

555
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:04,086
THAT'S WHY I'LL
NEVER BE MISTAKEN
FOR LEWIS McBRIDE.

556
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:11,594
AFTERNOON,
MISS EASTERN.

557
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:13,095
THANK YOU.

558
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:14,597
WELCOME.

559
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:17,099
BETH EASTERN.
HI. I'M M.J. MAJOR,

560
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:20,102
A REPORTER FOR
THE NEW YORK
EXAMINER.

561
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,604
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A WHAT?

562
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,105
A REPORTER.

563
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:25,608
REALLY.
YES.

564
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,109
AND--AND WHAT
WOULD YOU WANT WITH ME?

565
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:28,611
OH, COME ON, BETH.

566
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:30,613
I KNOW THE HANGING'S
IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

567
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:32,615
PRESS ON THIS THING
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU
AND THE FAMILY NEED

568
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,116
FOR A PUBLIC OUTCRY.

569
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,619
THE FAMILY WANTS THIS
KEPT QUIET.

570
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:39,121
OH, REALLY? LISTEN,
IN THIS INSTANCE,

571
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:42,625
YOUR INTERESTS
AND THE INTERESTS OF
THE PUBLIC CONVERGE.

572
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,627
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS?

573
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,128
MY SOURCE IS AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

574
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,630
THERE'S A BLACKOUT
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

575
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,131
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

576
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:52,635
THEY PASSED THE BUCK.
THEY SOLD IT AS DIPLOMACY.

577
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:54,637
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED ME,
AND FAST.

578
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,639
I CAN MAKE THIS
HAPPEN FAST, BETH.

579
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,641
IN 48 HOURS, LEWIS McBRIDE
CAN BE OVER EVERY--

580
00:32:58,641 --> 00:32:59,642
NO, NO.

581
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,143
LISTEN TO ME.

582
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:02,645
DO YOU REMEMBER
SINGAPORE?

583
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:05,147
THE AMERICAN KID
WHO GRAFFITIED A CAR?

584
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:06,649
SURE.
BECAUSE OF
THE MEDIA FRENZY,

585
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,651
THEY HAD TO CANE
THE KID.

586
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:12,154
BUT THAT WAS A CANING
TO SHOW SOME NATIONAL BACKBONE.

587
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:13,155
THIS IS A HANGING!

588
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,623
OH, AND I DON'T
KNOW THAT?

589
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,158
LISTEN, SOME AUSSIE
DOPE DEALER'S MOTHER

590
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:18,160
WENT ON EVERY ENGLISH-
SPEAKING TALK SHOW

591
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,162
FROM SIDNEY TO LONDON.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

592
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:24,667
THEY HUNG HER SON
A WEEK EARLY
TO SHUT HER UP.

593
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,169
EXCUSE ME. I'VE GOT
A REALLY BIG WEEK.

594
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:30,673
BETH, I CAN MAKE MIRACLES
HAPPEN IN A WEEK.

595
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,174
DON'T DO THIS.

596
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:35,177
DON'T DO IT.

597
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,679
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST--

598
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:37,680
WHAT?!
I'M SORRY.

599
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,181
JESUS CHRIST!

600
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:41,183
I'M SORRY.
I'M...VERY SORRY.

601
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:42,651
JUST...

602
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:50,776
COULD I HAVE THAT,
PLEASE?

603
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:54,697
IS HE BOYISH?

604
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:55,698
WHAT?

605
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:57,199
IS HE CUTE?

606
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,201
IS HE CLEAN-CUT?
BECAUSE IF HE IS,

607
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,703
AND I PUT HIM ON
THE FRONT PAGE
OF MY NEWS--

608
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:02,204
GIVE ME SOME TIME.

609
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:06,208
GIVE ME SOME TIME,
SOME SPACE,

610
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,211
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR STORY.

611
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,217
WHEN?

612
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,720
SOON.

613
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,226
I'M GOING
TO CALL YOU, BETH.

614
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:42,745
WHAT?

615
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,747
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

616
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:48,250
I HAVE A TAPE
I WANT YOU TO WATCH.

617
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,253
YEAH? JESUS CHRIST,
YOU DON'T LET UP, DO YOU?

618
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,254
I CAN'T.

619
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,757
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO WATCH YOUR TAPE.

620
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,759
HONEST TO GOD, I AM.

621
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,761
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY GOING
TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

622
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,262
SO I'LL WATCH IT LATER.

623
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:01,764
ARE YOU INVITING ME
TO DINNER,

624
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:05,267
OR ARE WE STILL MAD
AT EACH OTHER?

625
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,769
BOTH.

626
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,281
CHEERS.

627
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:20,282
CHEERS

628
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:24,286
IT'S A TOAST
TO LEWIS.

629
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:27,289
SWEET GUY...
LOVED THE ANIMALS.

630
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,790
LOVED HIS BEER.

631
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,792
DID HE?
YEAH.

632
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,295
I NEVER KNEW THAT
ABOUT HIM.

633
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:38,800
TELL ME SOMETHING ELSE.

634
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,303
REALLY, BEER IS ALL
I REALLY REMEMBER.

635
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:42,804
THAT'S IT?
YEAH.

636
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,306
WOW.

637
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:46,808
HE DIDN'T MAKE REALLY
MUCH OF AN IMPRESSION,
THEN, DID HE?

638
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:47,776
LEWIS?
MM-HMM.

639
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:48,777
WHAT, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

640
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,279
HAVE YOU SPENT A LOT
OF TIME WITH HIM?

641
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:54,282
I'VE...NEVER HAD A BEER
WITH HIM.

642
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:56,284
HE IS,
HONESTLY, BETH...

643
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,286
ONE OF
THE SWEETEST PEOPLE

644
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:00,789
I'VE EVER MET
IN MY LIFE.

645
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,290
LEWIS IS THE KIND OF GUY
WHO'D HAVE, LIKE,

646
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,792
A BEGGAR ON
THE STREET, RIGHT?

647
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,794
AND HE JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

648
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,296
HE'D TOUCH HIM SOMEHOW,
TALK TO HIM.

649
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,298
THE GUY COULD HAVE,
LIKE, AN ILLNESS, MAYBE,

650
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,300
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW,
A LANGUAGE BARRIER.

651
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,304
WHATEVER IT WAS,
HE JUST COULD SEE
PEOPLE, I GUESS.

652
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,808
GOT A BIG HEART.

653
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:22,310
YEAH...

654
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,813
THAT'S NICE.

655
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,816
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU
TELL ME ABOUT HIM?

656
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:30,352
YOU ARE GOOD,
AREN'T YOU?

657
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:34,823
SHERIFF, WHAT DO
YOU THINK ABOUT ME?

658
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:37,325
I DON'T KNOW.

659
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:42,330
YOU SEEM TO THINK
I HAVE ALL THESE
WILES AND STRATAGEMS.

660
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,832
I DON'T.

661
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,338
I HAVE A MAN'S LIFE
IN MY HANDS.

662
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:52,340
I GET THAT.

663
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:57,295
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, BETH.

664
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:59,798
AND ASK YOURSELF
THIS HONESTLY.

665
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,102
WOULD YOU GO BACK?

666
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:12,227
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU
OR TONY...TO DO THIS

667
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:15,730
IF I HADN'T ALREADY ANSWERED
THE QUESTION FOR MYSELF.

668
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,198
YEAH.

669
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:23,121
BUT I GUESS, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK

670
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,123
YOU COULD EVER REALLY
HONESTLY ANSWER THAT

671
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,625
UNLESS YOU'RE
IN THAT SITUATION
YOURSELF, YOU KNOW?

672
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,127
IT'S NOT A--

673
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:30,128
WHOA!

674
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:32,630
HI, GABY.
HOW ARE YOU?

675
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,632
I'M NOT SOME PIECE OF DIRT
YOU GET OFF ON

676
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,634
THEN FLUSH DOWN THE JOHN,
ALL RIGHT?

677
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:37,635
RIGHT.

678
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:40,638
HE'LL FUCK YOU
AND THEN SNEAKS OUT--

679
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,640
BY THE FIRE ESCAPE,
IF HE HAS TO.

680
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:44,642
UNLESS YOU DON'T
GIVE A SHIT.

681
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,594
UNLESS YOU'RE SOME WHORE.

682
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,432
I'M HIS WIFE.

683
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:52,650
WHAT?

684
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:02,660
FUCK YOU
FOR NOT WEARING A RING.

685
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:09,667
THAT'S MY FRIEND
GABY.

686
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,170
HEH HEH.

687
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,172
WOW.
YEAH.

688
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:16,174
GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T
