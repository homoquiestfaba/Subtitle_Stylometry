00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,246
Is that what I'm supposed
to call you now?

176
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,481
Or can I just call you Andrew
since we're old friends?

177
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,851
I don't care.
Call me wherever you want.

178
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,152
I don't know.
I like Father Andrew.

179
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,154
It's got a nice ring to it.

180
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,522
You look good, too.
You look really good.

181
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:02,957
Thank you.
I feel pretty good.

182
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,925
You still have that
youthful spirit.

183
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,127
I've changed a lot though.

184
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,962
- Yeah?
- Yeah, since I saw you last.

185
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,330
- You feel that way?
- Oh yeah.

186
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,498
How have you changed?

187
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, I quit drinking,
for one thing.

188
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,035
Really?
You quit cold turkey?

189
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,870
Yep.
I quit cold turkey.

190
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:18,873
And Wild Turkey.
And Jack Daniels.

191
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,010
That's great.

192
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,944
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

193
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,245
My head's clearer.

194
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,214
I think I'm a better person.

195
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,384
That's great.

196
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:31,585
Are you with someone?

197
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,388
Yeah.
I have a girlfriend.

198
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,454
That's good.

199
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:35,989
I was married though.
Before.

200
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,258
[laughing]
Married? Really?

201
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,926
- Yeah.
- I would have never guessed that.

202
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,327
I know.
I was though.

203
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,496
It didn't work out.

204
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,597
We got divorced
a couple of years ago.

205
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,966
That's too bad.

206
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:47,836
No, it's okay.
Just a bad match.

207
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:51,371
Well...
Are you okay?

208
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,440
Cuz, you seem okay.

209
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,443
Yeah, now I am.
Now I am.

210
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,312
But I was bad
for a long time.

211
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,413
I know.

212
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:00,081
The last time I talked to you,
you were miserable.

213
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:01,282
I was worried about you.

214
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,584
I tried to contact you
several times.

215
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,486
I couldn't get
in touch with you.

216
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,187
All those numbers
that I had for you.

217
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,389
None of them worked.

218
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,358
I had no email
address for you.

219
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,526
You weren't on social media
or anything like that.

220
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,595
Sorry. I was...

221
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,630
I needed to get
my shit together.

222
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,533
Sorry.
I shouldn't curse in here.

223
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,101
That's okay.

224
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:22,904
But uh... no.

225
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,340
[clears throat]
I turned a corner

226
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,874
and here I am.

227
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,509
- You turned a corner?
- Yeah.

228
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,245
What do you think did it?

229
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,512
Sobriety?

230
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:32,612
Uh... Well, you know,

231
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,549
the sobriety was definitely
part of it, but, uh...

232
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,621
You're not going
to believe this Andrew,

233
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:43,323
but I saw something recently

234
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:46,126
that changed everything for me.

235
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,661
I mean, everything.

236
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,563
It just... [exploding sound]

237
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:51,665
...opened my mind up
completely.

238
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:53,334
What's going on here?

239
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,538
Father James.

240
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:58,240
Who's this?

241
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,640
Paul. Hi.

242
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:04,511
Paul. This is an old friend
of mine. Paul Ruccio.

243
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,280
Why aren't you wearing
your mask?

244
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,317
Oh me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

245
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,385
And where's your mask, Paul?

246
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,388
Hey, I'm clean.

247
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,321
I promise you.

248
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,057
I'm not used to saying that
to priests.

249
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,325
I usually say it to women.

250
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,559
You've been tested?

251
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,327
Me. No. No.

252
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,563
I'm trying to avoid hospitals
and doctor's offices

253
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,065
since that's where
all the sick people are.

254
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:25,967
Right. You're obviously
not avoiding anything.

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,535
As a matter of fact,
just by being here,

256
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:31,572
you're blatantly disregarding
the rules of the quarantine.

257
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:33,508
I'm only trying to see
my friend.

258
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,943
Andrew, he has to leave.

259
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,178
I'm going to get
the disinfectant.

260
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:38,947
- Father James.
- I said, "Get him out of here."

261
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,981
I'm sorry.
Stop. Please!

262
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,717
I'm sorry but he's...

263
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,352
This is an old friend of mine.

264
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,221
A dear old friend.

265
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,456
Thank you, Father Andrew.

266
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:50,358
It makes me nervous
when you do that.

267
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,361
How long have you known
each other?

268
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:55,563
- Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

269
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,164
Yeah, thirty years.

270
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:59,400
This guy was wild
back in the day.

271
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:00,534
It's a good thing he found God

272
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:01,970
or he'd probably
be in prison right now.

273
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,371
That's not even
remotely true.

274
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:04,472
[clears throat]

275
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,006
Well...

276
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:09,510
It's nice to have friends.

277
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:13,280
[people cheering]
[car horns sounding]

278
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:18,753
Well, it must be 7 p.m.

279
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:20,020
Yep.

280
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,356
They're they go.

281
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,591
You know why they do that?

282
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,460
Yeah, sure.
It's for the healthcare workers.

283
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:27,661
It's to show their support.

284
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:28,762
I don't like it.

285
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,430
- You don't like it?
- No.

286
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:31,598
How can you not like it?

287
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:35,402
It's a spontaneous gesture.
It's a wonderful gesture.

288
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,069
No it's not.

289
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:36,970
It's just a bunch of people

290
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,438
trying to feel good
about themselves.

291
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,573
What's wrong with that?

292
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,306
What's wrong with that?
I think it's disingenuous.

293
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:43,510
Disingenuous?

294
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:44,678
I think so, too.

295
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,146
What?

296
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,247
- You think that?
- Yeah.

297
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,683
I think you're both nuts.
It's a beautiful thing.

298
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,486
It's about making
the health care workers

299
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,553
feel appreciated.

300
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,621
It helps.

301
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:55,289
What? A bunch of people
clapping and cheering?

302
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,291
How is that helping anyone?

303
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:59,593
The doctors, the nurses,
the custodians,

304
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:02,029
the orderlies,
they're all risking their lives.

305
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,563
And some collective
acknowledgement

306
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,766
is supposed to improve
the situation.

307
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,102
It's about lifting
people's spirits.

308
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,039
I mean,
is that okay with you or not?

309
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,707
- What's not okay about that?
- You know what I think?

310
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:17,544
- What?
- I think when a nurse gets off work,

311
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:21,182
probably overworked
and underpaid

312
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:23,750
she or he is walking
back to their apartment

313
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,520
and they hear this clapping,
this clamor,

314
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:28,389
this banging of pots
and pans...

315
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,591
and they find it
really annoying.

316
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,060
- Yes.
- They probably think,

317
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:34,294
"Here I am,
I'm taking all this risk..."

318
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:38,231
"...I'm surrounded all day
by death and disease" and...

319
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:40,101
...these people think
they can just participate

320
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,902
from the sidelines.

321
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,070
It's bullshit,
pardon my French.

322
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:46,174
Cynicism is never the answer,
especially now...

323
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,275
The way things are.

324
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,476
The doctors, the nurses,

325
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,577
the orderlies,
the administrators.

326
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:52,480
These people are heroes.

327
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:56,517
And once, every night at 7 p.m.,
for a moment,

328
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,719
we're all,
we are all connected again

329
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:03,156
through mutual admiration
for these people.

330
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,459
Connected. Connected.

331
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,260
We need to be connected.

332
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:11,765
We need as much connection as
we can possibly get right now.

333
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,635
Well, if that's the case,
why not open up the church?

334
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,637
That's a good question.

335
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,674
Do people not want
to come to church?

336
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,343
I would have thought there would
be a real need from your...

337
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,112
members,
what are they called, the flock?

338
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,347
No, it's too dangerous.
Too dangerous.

339
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,150
We could set ground rules.

340
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,153
We could have masks
and gloves, mandatory.

341
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,221
We could see them
by appointment.

342
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,591
We could do lots of things.
We could have a wedding.

343
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:37,392
A wedding?

344
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:38,525
Are you out of your mind?
Come on.

345
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,561
We could do a small wedding
like they have in Vegas.

346
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:42,496
I got a friend Brian,

347
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,432
he was supposed
to get married next month.

348
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:45,900
He and his finance

349
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,236
want to get married
in the church.

350
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,871
It would give people hope.

351
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,611
Father Brooks
would have wanted it.

352
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,548
[sighs] This is the tactic
that people use

353
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:01,816
when they want something.

354
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:05,385
They use the presumed desires
of the dead to get their way.

355
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,388
You don't have any idea
what Father Brooks

356
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,455
would have wanted.

357
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:09,123
Well, he wouldn't have wanted
you sitting around

358
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:10,390
feeling sorry for yourself.

359
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:13,928
And he wouldn't have wanted you
making fun of a 7 p.m. ritual

360
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,764
that comes from a place
of love.

361
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,233
He'd want us
to embrace our vows.

362
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,568
He'd want us helping people,
especially now.

363
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:23,337
You know what else
he might have wanted?

364
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,573
For us to live,
to survive,

365
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,409
to go on preaching the word
of God into the future.

366
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,510
So you're afraid?

367
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,913
Am I afraid?
Of course, I'm afraid.

368
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:32,880
Aren't you afraid?

369
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,582
"Though I walk through
the darkest valley,

370
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:36,284
I shall fear no evil,
for you are with me."

371
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,284
Psalm 23:4.

"Do not be over-wicked
and do not be a fool -

373
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,924
why die before your time?"

375
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,694
be courageous; be strong."

but the simple go on

<i>You too. You too.</i>

384
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,847
Listen, you think
it would be okay if I

385
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,683
came by again some time?

386
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:10,985
Yeah. Sure.

387
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:14,255
You know, I think
Father James likes you.

388
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:17,390
Yeah, he's a happy drunk.

389
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,925
Then he got a little mean.

390
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,760
He reminds me of my brother.

391
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,264
He's just scared.
So am I.

392
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,832
What are you guys
scared of?

393
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:25,933
Death?

394
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,935
Well, yeah, Paul.

395
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,837
But you're priests.

396
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,839
You believe in an after life.

397
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,507
And if there is a Heaven,
you're probably going there...

398
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,843
unless you're hiding
some dark secret.

399
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,447
I think you know
all my secrets.

400
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,816
I didn't know you were
afraid of death.

401
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,818
Anybody who says they're
not afraid of death

402
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,386
is lying.

403
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,023
I'm not.

404
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,624
[laughing]

405
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,628
Well you're in denial
about a lot of things.

406
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,695
One of these days,
when the church opens back up,

407
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,530
I'm going to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

408
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:58,732
She's going to
show you something

409
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,901
that will blow your mind.

410
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,337
- Like what?
- You'll see.

411
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,606
Good night, Father Andrew.

412
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,542
Good night, Paul.

413
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,351
[door clicks shut]

414
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,793
He's a spirited guy.

415
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,430
He reminds me of Father Brooks.

416
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:30,798
How so?

417
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,867
He's a little obnoxious
but lovable.

418
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,871
Yeah. One minute
you wanna punch him,

419
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:37,871
the next minute
you wanna hug him.

420
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:40,408
Well, we shouldn't be
hugging anyone anyway,

421
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,510
- given the current...
- I know.

422
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,445
It's a figure of speech.

423
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,447
In any case...

424
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,882
I think you're right.

425
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:50,316
We should open the church.

426
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,653
That would be wonderful,
Father James.

427
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:54,988
- But it has to be conditional.
- Of course.

428
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,791
We have to practice
absolute safety.

429
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:02,095
People can come in to pray
by appointment only.

430
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,398
They have to wear gloves
and a mask.

431
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,600
Only people you know...

432
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:07,800
...or have vetted.

433
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,969
I've got dozens of requests
from members of the church

434
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,307
already who just want
to come in and pray.

435
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,042
Good.

436
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:17,678
[sighs] Who knows.

437
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:19,713
Maybe we'll get some
donations out of it.

438
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,082
Well, it's not just about
the donations.

439
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,916
Did I say it was just
about the donations?

440
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,919
No. But it's somewhat
about the donations.

441
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,957
We have to keep
the lights on somehow.

442
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,791
You think God's going to say,
"Let there be light"

443
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:34,628
and ConEd
will forgive the power bill?

444
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,663
Of course. I'm sure
people will want to donate.

445
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,966
Now you're going to be
responsible for this.

446
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,736
If someone hasn't been adhering
to the quarantine,

447
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,603
they can't come in.

448
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:46,140
if someone looks sweaty
or glassy eyed,

449
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,006
don't let them in.

450
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,642
Look at their noses.

451
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,879
If there's even one
drop of snot, no access.

452
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,613
Look at their chests...

453
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,049
If they seem to be
breathing heavily,

454
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,183
then I'm sorry,
no entrance.

455
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,951
It's a little hard to gauge
whether someone's sick

456
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:58,986
by looking at their chest.

457
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,421
No, it's not. Look at me.
Look at my chest.

458
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,691
[breathing]

459
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,561
You see how it's expanding
and contracting rapidly?

460
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:08,962
That's all you have to do.

461
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,864
Look. Observe.

462
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,867
Study with your eyes.

463
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,535
That's how Da Vinci gained
most of his knowledge.

464
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,839
That's how Sherlock Holmes
solved most of his mysteries.

465
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,740
He observed and he deduced.

466
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,642
If they don't look well.

467
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,611
If something's off,
send them off.

468
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:27,414
If they have a cough,
send them off.

469
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:28,416
You sound like Dr. Seuss.

470
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,517
And I don't care
if they're black or white

471
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,053
or Asian or Iranian
or Pomeranian.

472
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,688
If they don't look well...
no entrance.

473
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,490
Well, we could get called out
for racism.

races more than other.

This isn't a Bernie Sanders

476
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,800
If they have a cough,
send them off.

477
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,000
Is that a catch phrase now?

478
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,069
And one at a time.

479
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,704
They have ten minutes.

480
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,038
They come in, they sit down,

481
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,140
they say their prayer
and they're out.

482
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,509
Ten?

483
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:57,777
- Yes.
- Where did you get that number?

484
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,779
From the Romans.

485
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,180
Well some people
might need more than that.

486
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,715
Who prays for more
than ten minutes?

487
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:03,082
Even the pope
doesn't pray that long.

488
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:04,818
You think God
wants to listen to that?

489
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,019
Okay, ten minutes.

490
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:09,989
And after they've left,
you disinfect where they sat.

491
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,759
Okay, you scrub...

492
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:16,597
...and you spray as if your
life depends on it because...

493
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,433
...in a lot of ways, it does.

494
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,068
Okay, Father James.

495
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,938
You understand?

496
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,205
I do.

497
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:26,739
Good.

my friend Brian?

00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,577
Brian?
Who's that?

500
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,544
I thought you said
this guy's name was Paul.

501
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,013
Brain is the one who
wants to get married.

502
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:35,548
Okay, absolutely not.

503
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:37,083
Are you crazy?

504
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,619
You want to have weddings
in here now?

505
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,254
Did you not listen
to anything I just said?

506
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,055
It's just going to be Brian,
his finance,

507
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,791
one or two witnesses.
That's it.

508
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:45,092
Yeah, and then
maybe a mother.

509
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,125
Then maybe a father.

510
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,263
And then a cousin,
then the cousin's boyfriend

511
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,998
- and then we're having the Royal wedding in here.
- No, no no,

512
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,900
it's not going to be like that.
I assure you.

513
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,071
Well, let's see how it goes
this week, alright?

514
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,739
Then I'll decide.

00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,058
She's pretty.

700
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:13,826
I don't know.
I love her though, I think.

701
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,130
She gets on my nerves
sometimes

702
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:18,397
but I get on hers, too.

703
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,300
So, I guess we balance
each other out.

704
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,206
Do you guys
ever think about it?

705
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:30,277
If this is the end.

706
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,648
The end, the end?

707
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,682
The end of days.

708
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:38,584
Revelation.

709
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,454
The big good-bye.

710
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:43,556
It never occurred to me
that this is the end.

711
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,125
Why not?

712
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,260
Maybe it's just not
big enough.

713
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:49,496
Compared to The Spanish Flu...

714
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:52,164
The Black Plague.
World War II.

715
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:53,867
Those were big.

716
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,201
Not that this isn't big,

717
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,571
but it doesn't feel
like the end.

718
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,371
Yeah, I know.
If I thought this was the end,

719
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,775
I'd be getting drunk
right now for sure.

720
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:04,644
You know,
Father Brooks used to ask me...

721
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:06,679
[sighs]

722
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,883
"If you knew that the world
was coming to an end,

723
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,652
would you want to be here
when it happened?"

724
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,653
I remember that.

725
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,787
He used to like to ask
people that question.

726
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:19,626
Yeah. Do you want the world
to end in your lifetime?

727
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:22,361
Why would anybody want to see
the end of the world?

728
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,663
Well, I don't know.
Think about that.

729
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,300
Think about that.

730
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,870
You would all be together.

731
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:34,341
It would be one big,
ultimate collective experience.

732
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:36,742
That's not a positive.

733
00:30:36,775 --> 00:30:37,776
That's nihilistic.

734
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,913
The whole point of existence
is to keep going.

735
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:40,914
I know.

736
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:43,617
You know, you shouldn't even
want it to end.

737
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,686
I wouldn't want the world to end
selfishly just so I could say,

738
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:48,321
"I was there when it happened."

739
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:49,788
It'd be a really good
story though.

740
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,824
I mean, that's my whole
problem with religion.

741
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,493
Like Christianity and Islam.

742
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:56,428
This eschatology.
The end of everything.

743
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:59,732
You need the world to end
to validate your belief system.

744
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:00,700
There's more to it than that.

745
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,203
I don't know.
It seems pretty clear to me.

746
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,638
Tell me if I'm wrong.

747
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,640
For Christ to return,
the world has to end.

748
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:10,143
Am I right?
Does it not say that?

749
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:13,779
Well...

750
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,681
I don't know.

751
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,451
But look at it this way.

752
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:23,323
If the world ends,
you'll be able to drink again.

753
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,563
There's always a silver lining
to everything.

754
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:34,467
At some point,
even Sisyphus must have said...

755
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:39,840
"Well... at least
I'm getting a good workout."

756
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,976
[laughing]
Good night.

757
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:44,910
Good night.

758
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,647
Good night, Father James.

759
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,951
You know what.

760
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:53,887
I'm going to head to bed, too.

761
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,590
What it be alright if I slept
at the church tonight?

762
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,257
Why do want to do that?

763
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't know.
I like it in there.

764
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,428
It's comforting.

765
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,599
I thought you were
an atheist.

766
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:07,366
Me?
No. I'm not an atheist.

767
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,534
- You're not?
- No.

768
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:12,404
When I went to seminary,
you totally made fun of me.

769
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,241
Because you're Jewish.

770
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:15,909
- So.
- So,

771
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:17,309
isn't that what
you're supposed to do

772
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:18,911
when a Jew
becomes Catholic?

773
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,480
You make fun of them.

774
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:21,915
It's just what you do.

775
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:25,484
You know,
most Jews don't get it.

776
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:28,721
Christianity is actually a road
to becoming a better Jew.

777
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:31,824
Yeah, you might be
the first person

778
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:32,993
I've ever heard say that.

779
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:36,563
Well, I could explain it
to you, but you don't care.

780
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:37,930
I care.

781
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:40,000
I care.
Explain it to me.

782
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,900
Just keep it under
two minutes.

783
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:44,437
I have an attention problem.

784
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:46,505
The old testament was written
by the Jews, you know.

785
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:47,506
Yeah, I know.

786
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,442
And they prophesied a savior.

787
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,044
I know.
I'm not a complete imbecile.

788
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,311
So when Jesus came,

789
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:55,015
he didn't say he was setting out
to destroy the old testament.

790
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,750
He was here to fulfill it.

791
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,719
Why is that important?

792
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:01,755
Because when you accept
that Jesus was here

793
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,957
to fulfill the old testament,
not refute it,

794
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:06,425
then you understand
that Christianity

795
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,861
complements Judaism.

796
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:10,029
Not only that, it completes it,
it validates it.

797
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,431
The rabbis will not
agree with that.

798
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:14,634
The rabbis don't agree
on anything.

799
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,568
When you read The Talmud,

800
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,771
It's just a bunch of opinions
about God.

801
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:20,907
It's not even connected
to the Old Testament.

802
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,476
I thought the Talmud
was the Old Testament.

803
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:24,743
The Torah's the Old Testament.

804
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:25,678
So what's the Talmud?

805
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:28,013
The Talmud's just
a bunch of opinions.

806
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:31,483
Rabbis disagreeing about
Jewish laws and traditions.

807
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,385
It's gotta be more
complicated than that.

808
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,954
Well, you told me
to keep it short.

809
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:36,389
Let me ask you something.

810
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:38,490
What does your dad think
about all this?

811
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:40,694
I haven't spoken
to him in years.

812
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,262
No?

813
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,630
That's fucked up.
You need to call him.

814
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:46,299
I don't think so.

815
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,803
You know my mom
calls me every day.

816
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:51,404
Yeah?

817
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:52,472
Every day.

818
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:54,940
She thinks people are dying
in the streets here.

819
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,944
She talks to me on FaceTime

820
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,579
and she looks at me
and she's like,

821
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:01,980
"Are you feeling okay?
You look sick..."

822
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:03,882
"...Your eyes are blood shot.
Your nose is runny.

823
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,418
Do you have a fever?"

824
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,853
That's funny.
She's saying that, too?

825
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:08,755
Who else is saying it?

826
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,456
I'm saying that
to the parishioners

827
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,424
who come in here.

828
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:12,424
I'm not saying it anymore.

829
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:15,061
She's turning me into
a total hypochondriac.

830
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:16,829
You look fine.

831
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:18,765
By the time
this virus is over,

832
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:21,501
we're all going to be
agoraphobic with OCD.

833
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,606
What are you going to do?
Just sit here all night?

834
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,474
I don't know.

835
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:30,944
I might write in my journal
a little bit.

836
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:34,880
Well, I have to turn
the lights off.

837
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:36,515
Okay. That's fine.

838
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,885
Then you won't be able
to write in your journal.

839
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,120
Alright, then I won't write
in my journal.

840
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:41,955
What are you going to do,
sit in the dark?

841
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:42,789
Yeah, why not?

842
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:44,390
What do you write
in your journal?

843
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:45,891
Dirty jokes.

844
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,961
You're not homeless are you?

845
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:49,996
What?

846
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:51,664
No.
Why would you ask me that?

847
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,566
Because you're here
every night.

848
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,401
I like your company.

849
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:57,836
Where do you live?

850
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,472
Alphabet City.

851
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,807
Yeah? How long have you
been living there?

852
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,941
About eight years.

853
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,111
Eight years you've been living
here in New York city

854
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,947
and this is the first time
you're getting in touch?

855
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,983
Andrew, I told you
I was in a bad place.

856
00:35:10,015 --> 00:35:11,084
I mean, I was a mess.

857
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:14,421
I didn't want you to see me
all messed up like that.

858
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
I'm glad you're better.

859
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,832
Can I tell you something,
Andrew?

860
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,734
What?

861
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,903
I had a good thing going.

862
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:31,771
With my wife.

863
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:34,040
With my ex-wife.

864
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,177
She was a good woman.

865
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,112
She was my best friend.

866
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:44,683
But I hurt her really bad.

867
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:47,954
I did things
and I said things.

868
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,525
I pissed it all away.

869
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,563
I'm not a good person.

870
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,934
And when...
...I was at my darkest,

871
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:04,671
really at the bottom
of a dark hole...

872
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,906
...drinking and just depressed.

873
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,975
I thought, "this is it, man."

874
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:11,044
"I'm never crawling

1048
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:14,553
Sure.

1049
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,555
You know that thing
that happens every night

1050
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:19,557
at 7 o'clock
where everybody claps

1051
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,226
for the healthy care workers?

1052
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,628
Yeah.

1053
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,095
As a nurse,

1054
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:26,598
what are your feelings
about that?

1055
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:29,601
Don't you think that's
pretty obnoxious?

1056
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:32,104
Oh no.

1057
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:34,539
I think it's nice.

1058
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:37,308
It makes me feel appreciated.

1059
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:39,778
You know, in fact,
it lifts my spirits.

1060
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,579
You know, Father James,
just yesterday,

1061
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,350
- I was feeling so low.
- Mm.

1062
00:45:44,383 --> 00:45:47,686
<i>And when the cheering started,</i>
[applause and cheering]

1063
00:45:47,718 --> 00:45:50,488
<i>it was like the clouds parted.</i>
[applause and cheering]

1064
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:51,422
[applause and cheering]
[car horns sounding]

1065
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:55,160
<i>Whoo!
Yeah, health care workers!</i>

1066
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:57,630
<i>Way to go.
Thank you!</i>

1067
00:45:58,097 --> 00:46:01,233
<i>You guys are heroes!
Whoo!</i>

1068
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:02,601
Do you think its obnoxious?

1069
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:04,202
Oh no.

1070
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:07,372
Oh no.
No, no. I don't.

1071
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:08,840
I don't. I don't.

1072
00:46:08,874 --> 00:46:12,111
I think you're right.
I think it's...

1073
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,680
I think it's so beautiful.

1074
00:46:15,713 --> 00:46:17,115
It really is.

1075
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:18,516
Thank you, Father James.

1076
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,385
It's so good to see you.

1077
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:21,586
It's been a while.

1078
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:22,755
You too, my dear.

1079
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:23,655
You have a good night, now.

1080
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:24,757
Okay, be safe.

1081
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,291
All right.
You too.

1082
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,262
<i>But why?!
I don't understand that.</i>

1083
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:34,100
Well, if you don't
understand it,

1084
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,835
I can't explain it to you.

1085
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:36,768
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

1086
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:38,636
<i>God is afraid
if you have children,</i>

1087
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:41,740
<i>that will take you away
from worshipping him?</i>

1088
00:46:41,773 --> 00:46:42,707
Yeah.
It's kind of like that.

1089
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,079
It's about discipline.
It's about devotion.

1090
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:47,413
<i>Devotion?</i>

1091
00:46:47,445 --> 00:46:49,881
<i>And you don't miss it?</i>

1092
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:51,650
- What? Sex?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1093
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:52,818
I don't think about it.

1094
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,352
Bullshit.

1095
00:46:54,653 --> 00:46:56,421
Nice. Nice.

1096
00:46:56,454 --> 00:46:57,456
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1097
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,792
<i>But I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.</i>

1098
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:01,861
Well, we believe
different things.

1099
00:47:01,894 --> 00:47:04,296
<i>All I'm saying is:</i>

1100
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,767
<i>You know, it would be nice
to have some grandchildren.</i>

1101
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,903
<i>Your mother wanted
grandchildren too, you know.</i>

1102
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:12,371
Dad...

1103
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:15,373
<i>She did.
It was important to her.</i>

1104
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:16,608
<i>She used to say...</i>

1105
00:47:16,642 --> 00:47:19,477
<i>"It's a shame priests don't have
like a loophole for that."</i>

1106
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,380
What? She said what?
She said "loopholes?"

1107
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:25,517
<i>Not in those words,
but that's what she meant.</i>

1108
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,253
<i>It was important to her.</i>

1109
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:28,921
<i>And to me!
I'm not gonna lie to you.</i>

1110
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:31,289
Well, the ship has sailed.

1111
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:33,358
<i>Well, hey, listen.</i>

1112
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,694
<i>Nobody says you have to do
it the old fashion way.</i>

1113
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,763
<i>You could try
immaculate conception.</i>

1114
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:39,732
<i>You believe in that, right?
So...</i>

1115
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:41,366
<i>Right.</i>
[chuckles]

1116
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,300
- [humming]
- <i>You believe in that, right?</i>

1117
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:43,769
I don't want to have
this conversation.

1118
00:47:43,802 --> 00:47:45,637
I'm going to hang up.
If you keep talking...

1119
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,206
<i>Don't have up.
Don't you hang up on me!</i>

1120
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:49,941
Well don't be an asshole!
Don't be an asshole.

1121
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:51,276
<i>Okay!</i>

1122
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,478
I chose my life.
I chose my life.

1123
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:55,381
Can you just please accept?

1124
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,649
<i>I hear you.</i>

1125
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,186
[sighs]

1126
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,454
<i>I read a book recently.</i>

1127
00:48:02,486 --> 00:48:03,722
Mazel tov.

1128
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,823
<i>No, I read a beautiful book
and it had this quote.</i>

1129
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:07,659
<i>I wrote this down for you.</i>

1130
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,962
<i>I've been reading
a lot of books.</i>

1131
00:48:10,996 --> 00:48:12,331
<i>Do you know how many
books I've read</i>

1132
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:12,965
<i>since we've been
on lock down?</i>

1133
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:15,501
<i>Like 42.</i>

1134
00:48:15,534 --> 00:48:17,903
<i>Forty-something books
since the middle of March.</i>

1135
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,937
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

1136
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,606
- Good for you...
- <i>All kinds of books.</i>

1137
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,541
<i>I read fiction,
non-fiction...</i>

1138
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:23,941
- It's good for you.
- <i>A read a great book on...</i>

1139
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:25,910
- <i>A bio of Martin Luther King, Jr.,</i>
- That's good for you, pop.

1140
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:28,213
<i>I read a book
of short stories.</i>

1141
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:30,783
<i>I like that they're short.
In and out.</i>

1142
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:31,684
Mm-hmm.

1143
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:32,985
<i>I read a book on plumbing.</i>

1144
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:34,086
Plumbing?

1145
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,622
<i>Yeah. I had a leak
in the bathroom sink.</i>

1146
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:39,791
- Did you fix the leak?
- <i>Huh?</i>

1147
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:41,593
- Did you fix the leak?
- <i>No.</i>

1148
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:43,695
<i>No.
But I got the book.</i>

1149
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:44,830
<i>Here you go.</i>

1150
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:46,298
<i>So I wrote this down for you.</i>

1151
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,566
<i>Listen,
this is really beautiful.</i>

1152
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,270
<i>"Do not be conformed
to this world..."</i>

1153
00:48:51,302 --> 00:48:55,640
<i>"But be transformed by
the renewal of your mind."</i>

1154
00:48:55,673 --> 00:48:58,543
<i>"that by testing
you may discern"</i>

1155
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:00,613
<i>"what is the will of God"</i>

1156
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,416
<i>"what is good and acceptable
and perfect."</i>

1157
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:06,718
<i>From your Bible.</i>

1158
00:49:07,686 --> 00:49:08,519
<i>All right?</i>

1159
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:11,456
Yeah.
You're reading the Bible now?

1160
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,792
<i>No, not the Bible,
a book about the Bible.</i>

1161
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:17,596
<i>About all different religions.</i>

1162
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:19,897
<i>Interesting.
Here's something:</i>

1163
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,269
<i>In Buddhism,
there's no God.</i>

1164
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:24,437
Yeah.

1165
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:26,672
- <i>You knew that?</i>
- Yeah.

1166
00:49:27,104 --> 00:49:30,575
- <i>They don't have a God. Since when?</i>
- Well since...

1167
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:31,943
For a long time.

1168
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:33,679
<i>It's interesting though.</i>

1169
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:35,980
<i>You know, when you read
all these religions</i>

1170
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,017
<i>and you get past
the surface stuff,</i>

1171
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,720
<i>like the names, the stories,
the actual stories.</i>

1172
00:49:42,753 --> 00:49:44,489
<i>When you get past all that...</i>

1173
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:46,824
<i>They're not that different.</i>

1174
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:50,463
<i>It's like...
We all want the same thing.</i>

1175
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:52,030
<i>Peace.</i>

1176
00:49:52,064 --> 00:49:54,834
<i>Peace in the world,
peace of mind,</i>

1177
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:57,936
<i>clarity, contentment,</i>

1178
00:49:57,968 --> 00:49:59,604
<i>Everybody...
Whoever you are,</i>

1179
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:03,708
<i>everyone wants their kids
to be safe, you know.</i>

1180
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:05,811
- <i>That's everybody.</i>
- It's funny...

1181
00:50:05,843 --> 00:50:07,746
<i>It's kind of beautiful.</i>

1182
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:10,315
You know, it's so funny
that you say that, Dad.

1183
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:11,950
Before the church closed,

1184
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:15,521
I was writing this sermon
about that very thing.

1185
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:17,523
The theme was
"The neighborhood."

1186
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:20,559
And how you can live next
to someone your entire life.

1187
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:21,994
Your neighbor.
That's what links you.

1188
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:24,595
Proximity.
Your shared space.

1189
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:26,698
And commonality.

1190
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:29,067
A sense of belonging.
Exactly like you said.

1191
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:30,736
And you know,
maybe you're a Jew.

1192
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:31,937
Maybe he's a Muslim.

1193
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,105
And even though
you're different

1194
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:34,439
and you believe
different things,

1195
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:36,041
you're still neighbors.

1196
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,742
You live on the same block.

1197
00:50:37,776 --> 00:50:39,378
<i>I love you.</i>

1198
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:44,683
I love you, too.

1199
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,619
<i>I know that.</i>

1200
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:53,025
<i>You know, when...</i>

1201
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:54,793
<i>For years,</i>

1202
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:58,497
<i>I thought you did all this</i>

1203
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,967
<i>just specifically
to piss me off.</i>

1204
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,369
No.

1205
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:05,670
[clears throat] No.
That wasn't why.

1206
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:06,872
<i>I know that.</i>

1207
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:08,941
<i>But in my head,
that's what I thought.</i>

1208
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:14,079
<i>In my heart
that's what I felt.</i>

1209
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:15,981
<i>And it...</i>

1210
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:19,084
<i>It hurt me.</i>

1211
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:21,387
[sighs]

1212
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,957
Why?

1213
00:51:27,758 --> 00:51:28,860
<i>Why.</i>

1214
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:30,728
<i>But...</i>

1215
00:51:30,762 --> 00:51:34,733
<i>I don't know,
I look at you now...</i>

1216
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:36,901
<i>And I look at you
and I just...</i>

1217
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,539
<i>I see how happy you are.</i>

1218
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,008
I am.

1219
00:51:43,707 --> 00:51:44,742
<i>I know.</i>

1220
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,946
<i>And I look at you and...</i>

1221
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,982
<i>I see you're a good person.</i>

1222
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:52,751
<i>You're a mensch.</i>

1223
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,689
<i>My son,
the mensch priest.</i>

1224
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:58,923
<i>Hey.</i>

1225
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:02,727
- <i>Hi.</i>
- What are you doing?

1226
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:06,165
<i>Uh, nothing. Nothing.
What are you doing?</i>

1227
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:07,632
I'm in the car.

1228
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,436
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1229
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:12,171
Nowhere.
I'm just driving around.

1230
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:14,139
It helps me clear my head.

1231
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:15,608
Can I come over?

1232
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:19,979
[sighs] <i>I don't know.
I don't know, babe.</i>

1233
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:23,514
Hey. I'm sorry about that
stuff I said the other day.

1234
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:25,851
It was just stupid.

1235
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:29,020
I didn't mean any of it.
I miss you.

1236
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:33,992
I wonder if this
is going to lead

1237
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,760
to the next baby boom.

1238
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,063
What?
The pandemic?

1239
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:39,465
Yeah.

1240
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:40,698
No.

1241
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:43,568
Well, that's what happened
after World War II.

1242
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:45,471
All the GIs came home.

1243
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:48,539
Their wives were waiting
for them, all excited.

1244
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:51,476
And they made babies.
A lot of babies.

1245
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,879
Why would anyone want
to have a baby right now?

1246
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,014
Well if more people are stuck
at home having more sex,

1247
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,216
there's going to be more
pregnancies.

1248
00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:02,488
People are stuck at home
so they're not having more sex.

1249
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:03,689
They're isolated.

1250
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,890
Well, I'm talking about the
couples who live together.

1251
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:07,758
The husbands and wives.

1252
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,894
They'll get pregnant
and they'll have more babies.

1253
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:11,663
They'll have more abortions.

1254
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:15,567
No. No.
You're wrong about that.

1255
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:19,104
Why would anyone want to have
a baby in this climate?

1256
00:53:19,871 --> 00:53:22,608
There are no jobs.
There are no businesses.

1257
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,677
So if I got you pregnant,
you would have an abortion?

1258
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:29,948
If anyone got me pregnant,
I'd have an abortion, right now.

1259
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:30,881
Really? Anyone?

1260
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,184
If Matthew McConaughey
got you pregnant,

1261
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:34,553
- you'd have an abortion?
- Yes.

1262
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,121
Ryan Gosling?

1263
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:36,921
Yes.

1264
00:53:36,954 --> 00:53:39,757
Zak Efron? Idris Elba?
Brad Pitt?

1265
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,727
- Nobody?
- Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1266
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,062
I don't know why you're
naming hot actors

1267
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,797
because they're not my type.

1268
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:47,765
- What's your type?
- You are my type.

1269
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,636
So if Paul Giamatti
got you pregnant,

1270
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:52,905
you wouldn't have it.

1271
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,972
If it was immaculate
conception,

1272
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:56,675
I'd have an abortion.

1273
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,142
You'd abort God's baby?

1274
00:53:58,175 --> 00:54:00,545
I would abort God's baby.

1275
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:02,014
I don't believe you.

1276
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:03,814
Well, I don't believe in God.

1277
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:06,050
Maybe you should start
believing in God.

1278
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:08,954
Maybe we all should start
believing in God.

1279
00:54:08,986 --> 00:54:12,057
Yeah.
The world is fucked, Paul.

1280
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,258
Yeah.

1281
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:16,727
A little belief would keep us
from being too cynical.

1282
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,029
You know?

1283
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:20,831
Help us be positive.
Light in the darkness.

1284
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:23,334
I don't think belief
is going to change anything.

1285
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:25,169
You don't know that.
It might.

1286
00:54:25,836 --> 00:54:27,204
How long have we been
quarantined now?

1287
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:28,707
Three months?

1288
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,976
Everyone thinks this thing
is just going to peter out

1289
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:33,110
and we'll just go back
to normal soon?

1290
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,613
I hate to break it to you.
It's not.

1291
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,682
What do you mean?

1292
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:39,951
This is the Gulf of Tonkin,
man.

1293
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:40,818
What is that?

1294
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:42,921
- The thing that started Vietnam?
- Yeah.

1295
00:54:44,122 --> 00:54:45,757
Well, Vietnam ended
eventually.

1296
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:47,825
Ten years after
The Gulf of Tonkin.

1297
00:54:47,858 --> 00:54:48,893
That's my point.

1298
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,028
You think this is going
to go on for ten years?

1299
00:54:50,061 --> 00:54:52,698
I think this is going to go on
for one hundred years.

1300
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:53,866
Until the end of time.

1301
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:57,068
If this virus isn't going to
take out half the planet,

1302
00:54:57,102 --> 00:55:00,372
then... I don't know,
the next strain will, right?

1303
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:03,874
They've been warning us about
these pandemics for decades.

1304
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:06,143
And even if they inoculate us
against this virus.

1305
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,912
There will be another strain
in the wings,

1306
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:09,213
waiting to take us out.

1307
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:10,282
Can we not talk about this?

1308
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:11,682
You're scaring
the fuck out of me.

1309
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:13,050
I came over here to relax.

1310
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:14,286
You brought it up.

1311
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:16,253
I brought up babies.

1312
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,991
You turned it into
the Left Behind series.

1313
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:21,226
This is not about
biblical prophesies, okay.

1314
00:55:21,258 --> 00:55:24,195
It's Darwinism.
The strong survive.

1315
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:26,131
For earth to survive,
it has to take out the threats.

1316
00:55:26,164 --> 00:55:28,767
What's the greatest threat
to the planet? Man.

1317
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,202
You honestly believe that?

1318
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:33,671
That the earth is planning
a coup to take out mankind?

1319
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:35,206
- Absolutely.
- Come on.

1320
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,109
You think scientists
know everything?

1321
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:38,110
They don't know anything.

1322
00:55:38,142 --> 00:55:40,845
For as much as we know
the core of the earth

1323
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:43,147
could be a massive brain
that sends signals

1324
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,150
to the plants, the trees,
even the animals.

1325
00:55:46,184 --> 00:55:48,253
I don't think that's how
it works, babe.

1326
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:49,320
How would you know?

1327
00:55:49,354 --> 00:55:50,255
Because I have a brain.

1328
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,290
And I can't control the hairs
on my arm.

1329
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:54,825
I can't tell them
to stand up or shed.

1330
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:57,695
I can't tell my toenail fungus
to retract.

1331
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,231
Gross.

1332
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:00,465
- Where are you getting these ideas from?
- What are you talking about?

1333
00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:01,633
- A lot of people believe this stuff.
- It's ridiculous.

1334
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:04,369
It is no more ridiculous
than anyone else's beliefs.

1335
00:56:04,401 --> 00:56:05,771
I think...

1336
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:07,706
...the virus is the earth's
way of saying,

1337
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,108
"I'm tired of this shit."

1338
00:56:09,974 --> 00:56:11,309
[sighs] Give me a break.

1339
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:12,878
Do you know...

1340
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,079
...that there's a mass
of garbage and plastic

1341
00:56:15,113 --> 00:56:16,915
in the ocean the size of Texas.

1342
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:20,685
But we just take garbage
and put it into the ocean.

1343
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:23,388
Will you suck my cock,
please?

1344
00:56:23,856 --> 00:56:26,925
No.
And I'm leaving New York.

1345
00:56:26,957 --> 00:56:29,061
Planning on it.
For a while.

1346
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:31,830
What? When?

1347
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:32,798
Mm... In a few weeks.

1348
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,166
I'm going to go to Utah
to live with my mom.

1349
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,435
Why?

1350
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:38,837
Have you not heard a word
I just said?

1351
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,439
Like, it's over.
Especially urban life.

1352
00:56:41,472 --> 00:56:42,306
Cities?

1353
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,875
What are you saying?
We need cities.

1354
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,977
Cities have a lot to offer.

1355
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:47,978
You said it yourself,

1356
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:50,148
it wasn't even the virus
that did New York in.

1357
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,418
It was the politicians and
the corporations. La, la, la.

1358
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,786
Yeah, but maybe
this is what it will take

1359
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,389
for New York to be reborn.

1360
00:56:57,421 --> 00:56:59,490
You know, maybe it'll be
like a resurrection...

1361
00:56:59,523 --> 00:57:01,259
...like Jesus Christ.

1362
00:57:01,994 --> 00:57:04,262
What is it with this
Jesus talk lately?

1363
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:06,831
You're talking a lot about
Jesus these days.

1364
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,767
So what?
What's wrong with Jesus?

1365
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,468
Maybe you're spending
too much time at that church.

1366
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:11,869
Yeah.
Those are my friends.

1367
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:13,371
[laughing] Oh my God.

1368
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:15,806
Your friends?
Right. Okay.

1369
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,275
- Why is that funny?
- Oh my God.

1370
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:19,777
Because Catholicism
is fucking evil.

1371
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,146
How can you say that?

1372
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:22,414
What?
Oh my God...

1373
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:25,050
Okay, so, Christianity
was anti-wealth

1374
00:57:25,082 --> 00:57:27,519
before Constantine
bastardized it.

1375
00:57:27,552 --> 00:57:29,153
And who's Constantine?

1376
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:31,155
And if the Roman Empire
had continued to flourish,

1377
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:32,491
we would all be Pagans
right now.

1378
00:57:32,523 --> 00:57:35,459
- And that would be better?
- Than Christianity?

1379
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:36,727
Absolutely.

1380
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,365
You don't think people getting
rich off of religion is evil?

1381
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:43,768
Like, it's not a little
antithetical for preachers

1382
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:45,303
to live in
$10 million mansions?

1383
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,906
Yeah, but my friend Andrew
is not like that.

1384
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:49,441
- At all... not even a little bit.
- Right.

1385
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:50,642
Okay, for any rich Christian

1386
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:56,081
to think they're being rewarded
for their beliefs by God?

1387
00:57:56,113 --> 00:57:58,282
Not all Christians
believe that.

1388
00:57:58,316 --> 00:58:00,119
How about when we
bombed Iraq?

1389
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:03,854
Millions of Christians
championed that war.

1390
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:07,191
They were 100% in support

1391
00:58:07,224 --> 00:58:10,394
of America bombing
a Muslim nation.

1392
00:58:10,427 --> 00:58:14,265
That's not antithetical
to your pal Jesus' beliefs?

1393
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,436
What does antithetical mean?

1395
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:32,284
That's nice.

1396
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:34,820
What is that?

1397
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,320
Just...

1398
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:37,923
...something I made up.

1399
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:39,323
I'm just messing around.

1400
00:58:39,356 --> 00:58:41,325
Well, don't stop.
Keep playing. I like it.

1401
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,128
Hello.

1402
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:46,597
Can I help you?

1403
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:48,500
Yes,
I'd like to be baptized.

1404
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:51,503
- Really?
- Yes.

1405
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,240
Well, we'd have to set up
and appointment.

1406
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:58,276
No, I'd like to be baptized
today. Right now.

1407
00:58:58,977 --> 00:59:01,146
Oh, well um...

1408
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:03,347
Yeah, we can't do that.

1409
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:05,082
Why not?

1410
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,852
Have you gone through
the proper education?

1411
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:10,255
Well, uh...

1412
00:59:10,287 --> 00:59:12,423
I went to high school.
Dropped out of college.

1413
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:14,124
But I'm a very learned man.

1414
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:16,060
No, what he means is...

1415
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:20,865
Have you been educated in the
principles of Catholicism?

1416
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:23,601
Do you know what
baptism means?

1417
00:59:23,635 --> 00:59:26,438
Well, I know what it means.
I've seen it done in movies.

1418
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,606
The priest standing
in the lake,

1419
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,874
dunking the head in the water.
[laughing]

1420
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:32,309
Yeah well,
there's more to it than that.

1421
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:35,213
You have to be familiar
with the rituals,

1422
00:59:35,246 --> 00:59:37,983
the proper way to pray.

1423
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:39,651
Do you know who
the apostles were?

1424
00:59:39,684 --> 00:59:41,319
What the pope does?

1425
00:59:41,352 --> 00:59:43,288
I need to know that
to be baptized?

1426
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,592
Well, no, but there is
some study required.

1427
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:52,063
I didn't know I needed
a PhD in theology

1428
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:53,264
in order to be baptized.

1429
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,900
I was told that if I wanted
to be saved,

1430
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:56,568
it was a pretty simple process.

1431
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,035
[laughing]

1432
00:59:58,068 --> 00:59:59,904
Why do you want to be saved?

1433
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,676
Well, I want to take
Jesus Christ

1434
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,979
as my personal savior.

1435
01:00:07,945 --> 01:00:09,081
Why?

1436
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:13,351
[breathes deeply]

1437
01:00:13,383 --> 01:00:15,086
Look, um...

1438
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,323
I've done a lot of things
in my past

1439
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:20,558
that I'm not so proud of.

1440
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,661
I'd like to put that
all behind me and...

1441
01:00:23,695 --> 01:00:26,197
Isn't that what Christianity
is all about?

1442
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:29,099
You erase the past
and step into the light.

1443
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:31,003
[laughing]

1444
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,572
Why do you keep laughing?

1445
01:00:34,604 --> 01:00:36,106
- Am I laughing?
- Yes.

1446
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,641
You laughed.

1447
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,477
It was more of a chuckle.

1448
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,280
Oh, chuckle.
Yeah, I chuckle. I'm a chuckler.

1449
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:45,050
It's something I do.
Don't look into that.

1450
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:46,517
Okay, well I think
what we should do

1451
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,053
is set up a few
appointments and...

1452
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:50,588
..you know, see if you're really
serious about this...

1453
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:51,990
I am serious.

1454
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,992
Um, none the less...

1455
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,162
You know.
There's a process.

1456
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,130
And you can't make
an exception?

1457
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:01,298
Well, we do make exceptions

1458
01:01:01,331 --> 01:01:04,101
for people who are sick
and dying.

1459
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:05,704
Are you dying?

1460
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:08,006
Aren't we all?

1461
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,342
I mean,
from the moment we're born,

1462
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:12,977
we're on that road
toward mortality. [chuckles]

1463
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,478
You know what we mean.

1464
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:17,215
- Do you have a terminal illness?
- Not that I'm aware of.

1465
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:21,086
But someone did cough in my
vicinity a couple of days ago,

1466
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,187
so you never know.

1467
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,522
Oh my God.
He's not wearing a mask.

1468
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,390
Where's your mask?

1469
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:29,193
Relax, Father. Father.
Relax. I'm not dying.

1470
01:01:30,193 --> 01:01:31,563
Look...

1471
01:01:31,595 --> 01:01:33,630
I've been around Christians
my entire life.

1472
01:01:33,664 --> 01:01:39,470
And they all say to me,
"Karl if you wanna be saved..."

1473
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:42,006
"...you gotta get baptized."

1474
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:45,744
"You have to accept Jesus Christ
as your savior..."

1475
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:48,012
"...if you want
to get into Heaven."

1476
01:01:48,046 --> 01:01:51,717
"or you are going
to burn in Hell."

1477
01:01:54,684 --> 01:01:57,121
So, here I am.

1478
01:01:57,155 --> 01:01:59,189
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

1479
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:00,558
I understand.

1480
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,327
You have your protocol...

1481
01:02:07,764 --> 01:02:10,267
but I am serious about this.

1482
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,036
So...

1483
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:15,774
If you were willing to...

1484
01:02:17,675 --> 01:02:19,477
...make an exception.

1485
01:02:22,146 --> 01:02:24,282
I would be willing to make a...

1486
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:28,219
...very generous donation
to the church.

1487
01:02:33,523 --> 01:02:35,292
[chuckles]

1488
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:40,631
Do you believe in God,
the Father,

1489
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:42,499
creator of Heaven and Earth?

1490
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:43,733
Absolutely.

1491
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:46,637
Do you believe Jesus Christ
was born of the Virgin Mary

1492
01:02:46,671 --> 01:02:49,607
and crucified, was buried,
rose from the dead

1493
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:52,509
and is now seated at the
right hand of the the Father?

1494
01:02:52,543 --> 01:02:53,678
I do.

1495
01:02:54,077 --> 01:02:55,813
Do you believe in
the Holy Spirit?

1496
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:57,782
Yes.

1497
01:02:57,814 --> 01:02:59,684
Do you reject Satan?

1498
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:02,153
Sure.

1499
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,357
And all his works?

1500
01:03:06,356 --> 01:03:07,592
All of his works?

1501
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,794
I'll have to cancel my
subscription to Penthouse?

1502
01:03:10,827 --> 01:03:13,398
- Oh, come on...
- I'm kidding, father. Yes, all of his works.

1503
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,300
And all his empty promises.

1504
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:16,735
Yes, all of them.

1505
01:03:19,803 --> 01:03:22,874
God, the all-powerful Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ

1506
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:26,276
has given us
a new birth by water

1507
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,480
and the Holy Spirit
and forgiven all of our sins.

1508
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:33,318
May he also keep us faithful
to our Lord Jesus Christ

1509
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,718
for ever and ever.

1510
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:36,287
Amen.

1511
01:03:37,454 --> 01:03:39,157
Yes.

1512
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,426
Okay, um...

1513
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:46,331
...close your eyes please
and lean your head back.

1514
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,770
I baptize you
in the name of the father...

1515
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:56,273
...and the son.

1516
01:03:58,276 --> 01:03:59,778
And the Holy Spirit.

1517
01:04:02,947 --> 01:04:03,849
Okay.

1518
01:04:04,948 --> 01:04:06,316
Karl, that's it.

1519
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:08,719
You are now a member
of the Catholic church.

1520
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:11,256
That's it?

1521
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:12,724
Really?
I'm in the club?

1522
01:04:12,756 --> 01:04:14,492
[laughing]
Yes. You are in the club.

1523
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:16,593
[Karl laughing]
That's all it takes?

1524
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:19,264
Well, as I said,
we usually take...

1525
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:20,831
I'm not going
to burn in Hell?

1526
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:23,767
Well, you still have to live
a virtuous life.

1527
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,835
Oh, no no no.

1528
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:26,470
From this point on,
I'm going to be a good boy.

1529
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:30,775
Hey...
Let me ask you something...

1530
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:32,843
That thing you said
about "Jesus Christ

1531
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:34,211
giving a new birth

1532
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:36,447
and forgiving us
for all of our sins."

1533
01:04:36,479 --> 01:04:37,782
Yes.

1534
01:04:38,414 --> 01:04:40,184
Do you really believe that?

1535
01:04:40,952 --> 01:04:42,354
Well, yes.

1536
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:45,657
So, every sin I've ever
committed is now...

1537
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:46,925
forgiven?

1538
01:04:46,957 --> 01:04:48,360
Yes.

1539
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,428
Really?

1540
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:51,294
Well, yes.

1541
01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:52,363
But that doesn't mean
you can just...

1542
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:55,467
So, the bicycle that I stole
in middle school.

1543
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:58,535
That's pardoned?

1544
01:04:58,568 --> 01:04:59,771
Yes.

1545
01:05:00,872 --> 01:05:03,775
And the money I stole
from my roommate in college;

1546
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:05,742
that's forgiven?

1547
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,212
Well, yes.

1548
01:05:07,244 --> 01:05:09,680
And that guy I beat up
in when I was 26.

1549
01:05:09,713 --> 01:05:11,582
I put him in the hospital
for six days.

1550
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:13,851
That's expunged.

1551
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:15,485
- Expunged?
- You know what I mean.

1552
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,622
It's no longer part
of my spiritual record.

1553
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:20,325
My rap sheet of sins.

1554
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:21,526
It's crossed off the list.

1555
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:22,861
Yes, Karl.

1556
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:25,930
It's amazing.

1557
01:05:27,497 --> 01:05:28,800
Well, if you don't mind,

1558
01:05:28,832 --> 01:05:30,834
we have to get back
to what we were doing before.

1559
01:05:30,867 --> 01:05:32,703
Oh, yes.

1560
01:05:32,736 --> 01:05:33,704
I don't want
to get in your way.

to both of you before I go?

1564

don't have time to...

1565

1566
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,957
I've done some terrible
things in my life.

1567
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,429

1568
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:01,865

That's right, I am.

1571
01:06:10,307 --> 01:06:12,710
But if you knew
the things I've done...

1572
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:16,680
...you wouldn't sleep at night.

1573
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:27,291
I've done things with children.

1574
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:33,530
I think you should go now.

1575
01:06:34,831 --> 01:06:36,834
I want to thank you both
for your service!

1576
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:43,408
I noticed the collection box
when I came in.

1577
01:06:45,008 --> 01:06:46,910
I'm going to put the rest
of this in there.

1578
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:49,581
You two deserve it.

1579

<i>I haven't been sleeping
very well.</i>

1585
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:27,686
I think one
of the reasons is that...

1586
01:07:31,055 --> 01:07:35,860
...I can't fully express
everything that I'm feeling

1587
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:37,461
about it all.

1588
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,732

1589
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:43,000
[sighs]

1590
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:47,805

but I just can't say it.

1592
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,778
You can tell me anything,
Father James.

1593
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:58,715
Yeah. But I can't.

1594
01:07:58,749 --> 01:08:00,118
Sure you can.

1595
01:08:01,352 --> 01:08:06,090
You know, I had a horrible
health crisis many years ago,

1596
01:08:06,122 --> 01:08:08,025
- did you know that?
- I didn't.

1597
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:11,563
Well, it was in the late 90s,
just before you got here.

1598
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:13,865
Uh...

1599
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:16,500
I had a horrible chest infection
that I couldn't shake.

1600
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:18,102
It went on for months.

1601
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:20,170
They didn't know
what was wrong with me.

1602
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:22,673
You know, bronchitis,
or pneumonia.

1603
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:25,142
Lung cancer, even.

1604
01:08:25,175 --> 01:08:27,611
So I had a lot of tests done.

1605
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:31,582
Cat scans and x-rays
and blood-work.

1606
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:37,888
When I got the results,
Father Brooks was there.

1607
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:43,860
Every time the doctors told me
that something was okay,

1608
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:45,963
that I would be fine.

1609
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:48,799
Father Brooks was
right by my side.

1610
01:08:53,937 --> 01:08:55,705
Sometimes...

1611
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:57,707
...he would, uh...

1612
01:08:57,741 --> 01:08:59,644
He would hold my hand.

1613
01:09:03,546 --> 01:09:05,916
Do you understand,
Father Andrew?

1614
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,019
Yes.

1615
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,790
Every time I got sick,

1616
01:09:12,822 --> 01:09:15,593
Father Brooks was there
to help me.

1617
01:09:17,228 --> 01:09:19,497
And you know
I get sick all the time.

1618
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,000
You know, flu, strep throat,
or whatever.

1619
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:25,068
This is one of the reasons
I'm so paranoid

1620
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,238
about this virus.

1621
01:09:27,271 --> 01:09:29,206
I remember when you
got that food poisoning

1622
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,275
a couple of years ago.

1623
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:32,510
- That was pretty bad.
- Oh, that was a nightmare.

1624
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,111
Remember how much
weight you lost?

1625
01:09:34,143 --> 01:09:35,679
10 pounds in six days.

1626
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,215
We never did find out
how you got that.

1627
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:40,684
Oh, it was the Branzino fish.

1628
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,487
- Really. You think so?
- Absolutely.

1629
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:45,055
Well, I had the Branzino fish
too and I didn't get sick.

1630
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:46,823
Well, maybe you had
a lovely piece.

1631
01:09:46,857 --> 01:09:48,059
I had a disgusting piece.

1632
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:50,728
Father Brooks had
the Branzino fish also,

1633
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,996
and he didn't get sick.

1634
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,898
Well exactly.

1635
01:09:54,932 --> 01:09:57,068
He never got sick.

1636
01:09:57,101 --> 01:09:58,268
The man was a pillar
of health.

1637
01:09:58,302 --> 01:10:01,973
Did you ever see Father Brooks
sick one day in his life?

1638
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:03,173
- Never.
- Never. Not once.

1639
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:07,077
That's one of the reasons
I don't understand how this...

1640
01:10:07,111 --> 01:10:10,247
...virus could be the one thing
that could kill him.

1641
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:12,550
- It doesn't make sense to me.
- It doesn't.

1642
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:16,120
The man was a priest
for fifty years

1643
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:19,223
and this is how he's repaid
for his servitude?

1644
01:10:20,723 --> 01:10:22,726
Well, servitude is the reward.

1645
01:10:22,759 --> 01:10:24,027
I know that.

1646
01:10:25,062 --> 01:10:27,131

- Should we switch sides?

No, I don't think so.
We don't need to do that.

on the other side.

You know why
I become a priest?

1669

Do you know why
I joined the church?

1670
01:11:44,907 --> 01:11:48,079
- Well, I assume because...
- I did it to piss off my father.

1671
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,749
Oh...

1672
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:52,849
I was just...

1673
01:11:52,883 --> 01:11:55,152
You know, when I was a teenager,
I was...

1674

I just didn't know
what I wanted.

1675

I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

1676
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:02,125
I had no ambition.
My father was an overachiever.

1677
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,162
He was always breathing
down my neck and um...

1678
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:07,164
I just thought,

1679
01:12:07,196 --> 01:12:09,666
"What could I do
that would really get to him?"

1680
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,902
so I thought,
"I'll become a Christian."

[laughing]

1682
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,340
So, all of this
was to spite him?

1683
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:21,379
No. Eventually, Catholicism
took on great meaning for me,

1684

which it still does.
I just...

1685
01:12:26,983 --> 01:12:31,688

the most noble intentions.

01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,601
Well, sure I do.

1733
01:14:57,634 --> 01:15:00,003
No. You have faith that you
know but you don't know,

1734
01:15:00,036 --> 01:15:02,872
indefatigably,
that the soul exists.

1735
01:15:02,906 --> 01:15:07,411
I have 30 years of study
that tells me the soul exists.

1736
01:15:07,443 --> 01:15:09,245
Yes,
but you can't measure it.

1737
01:15:09,278 --> 01:15:11,381
So it's still predicated
on faith.

1738
01:15:11,415 --> 01:15:15,352
I don't need an EKG machine
to show me that a soul exists.

1739
01:15:15,384 --> 01:15:17,887
It's the foundation
of the Catholic church.

1740
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,322
Christ died to save your soul.

1741
01:15:19,356 --> 01:15:21,559
When you were drinking,
your soul was in jeopardy,

1742
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:23,093
you made a decision to stop.

1743
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:26,162
That wasn't a fluke.
That was your soul talking

1744
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:27,264
and maybe your liver.

1745
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:29,532
Listen. I saw the soul,

1746
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:32,303
the physical soul,
leave a body.

1747
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:34,938
Okay. Well, you know,
I've heard that before.

1748
01:15:34,972 --> 01:15:36,407
Somebody has
a a loved one who dies,

1749
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:39,509
they see the soul leave,
and then the body is at peace.

1750
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:41,144
You're not special there, Paul.

1751
01:15:41,178 --> 01:15:43,948
I'm not talking about
the soul leaving a dead body.

1752
01:15:43,981 --> 01:15:45,349
I'm talking about
seeing it leave

1753
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:47,585
someone who is still alive,

1754
01:15:47,617 --> 01:15:50,321
and then hover over them
for an extended period of time,

1755
01:15:50,353 --> 01:15:52,188
and then reenter their body.

1756
01:15:52,222 --> 01:15:54,892
Yeah, I think you were on
some pretty intense drugs

1757
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:56,125
when you saw that.

1758
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,295
Acid. Mushrooms.
I did my time in the 80s.

1759
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:01,064
[chuckling]
You were tripping.

1760
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,466
I was not tripping.

1761
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:04,168
My friend can do it.

1762
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:06,470
She's been trying to teach me
but I haven't mastered it yet.

1763
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:07,403
That's what I'm doing

1764
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,137
when I'm sitting in the church
all night.

1765
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:10,907
Wait.
You're staying here now?

1766
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,443
So you're talking about
astral projection?

1767
01:16:12,476 --> 01:16:13,878
I think astral projectionists

1768
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:15,513
wish they could do
what she does.

1769
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:20,284
What does it look like?

1770
01:16:20,317 --> 01:16:22,019
<i>Everyone,</i>

1771
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:23,920
this is my friend Anna.

1772
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:24,588
Hello.

1773
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,022
- Hello.
- Hello.

1774
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:28,192
I apologize if I smell.

1775
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:29,626
I don't like to waste water

1776
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,629
and I haven't been
showering much.

1777
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:32,929
No. You smell fine.

1778
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,398
Yeah, from over there I do.

1779
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,467
But if you came closer,
you would see.

1780
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,035
It's okay.
Even if you did smell,

1781
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,235
we wouldn't know it.

1782
01:16:39,268 --> 01:16:41,472
We're also standing
at a distance

1783
01:16:41,504 --> 01:16:43,973
because of the virus.

1784
01:16:44,006 --> 01:16:45,476
Yeah, that's good.

1785
01:16:45,509 --> 01:16:48,112
I've known a few people
who died already.

1786
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:50,080
People are dropping
like dominos.

1787
01:16:50,112 --> 01:16:51,447
We appreciate you for coming.

1788
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:52,249
It's my pleasure.

1789
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:53,983
I was happy to get
your phone call.

1790
01:16:54,017 --> 01:16:56,019
It's probably good to get
out of the house, right?

1791
01:16:56,053 --> 01:16:58,189
I leave the house
every night.

1792
01:16:58,421 --> 01:16:59,924
Really?
Where do you go?

1793
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,092
Everywhere I went before.

1794
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,193
Last night, in fact,

1795
01:17:03,226 --> 01:17:05,996
I went to the Museum
of Modern Art.

1796
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:09,066
I spent three hours
looking at the Dali painting

1797
01:17:09,098 --> 01:17:10,633
Persistence of Memory.

1798
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:11,500
Do you know that one?

1799
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:13,137
That's the one
with the melting clocks.

1800
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,305
Yes.

1801
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,140
it takes on a new meaning
with our current situation.

1802
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,976
It's like there is no
time now.

1803
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,379
Everything is moving
extremely slow.

1804
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:30,154
Well, I didn't think that
the museums were open.

1805
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,390
Do you have a friend
who works there?

1806
01:17:33,423 --> 01:17:36,293
No. I left my body,
traveled through the sky,

1807
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:37,695
and flew into the building.

1808
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:40,364
Yes, I was telling them
you can do that.

1809
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:42,099
Yeah. I've been going
to all the museums.

1810
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:43,599
The Museum of Natural History.

1811
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:45,436
The Guggenheim.
The Whitney.

1812
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:46,971
Even the Museum of Sex.

1813
01:17:47,004 --> 01:17:49,273
[laughing]
Paul here tells us

1814
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:52,675
that you have something
you'd like to show us.

1815
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:56,313
Yes. You'd like to see how
I do it with your own eyes.

1816
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:58,415
I mean... Sure.

1817
01:17:58,447 --> 01:18:00,416
Yeah.
I can see you're skeptical.

1818
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:03,253
Well, obviously,
you can understand why.

1819
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:05,189
I've found that scientists
and men of the cloth

1820
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:08,459
are threatened by new phenomena
that they can't explain.

1821
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:10,626
Surely, after I show you
what I'm capable of,

1822
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,262
you will find a way
to refute it.

1823
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:15,165
Well, the notion of the soul
doesn't negate religion.

1824
01:18:15,197 --> 01:18:17,166
Right?
If anything it strengthens it.

1825
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,635
I don't agree
with that at all.

1826
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:20,336
We can discuss it afterwards,
if you like.

1827
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:23,207
So why don't we
get the show started. Huh.

1828
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,343
It's not a show.
I'm not a performer.

1829
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,711
And this isn't a magic trick.

1830
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:30,546
Right. Okay.

1831
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,649
So, should we have a seat
or something?

1832
01:18:32,682 --> 01:18:34,585
Yeah, follow me.

1833
01:18:35,285 --> 01:18:39,790
You can find a seat
somewhere here in the middle.

1834
01:18:39,822 --> 01:18:42,759
I'm sorry. I don't want to
smell up the church.

1835
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,572
[coughing]

1836
01:18:55,604 --> 01:18:57,707
I feel like I'm watching
a David Blain show.

1837
01:18:57,741 --> 01:18:59,643
I had a friend who made out
with David Blain.

1838
01:18:59,675 --> 01:19:00,744
- Really?
- Yeah,

1839
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,046
they were drunk in a bar.

1840
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:02,813
When was this?

1841
01:19:02,845 --> 01:19:03,813
Like, eight years ago.

1842
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:06,317
- Could you please shut up?
- Quiet please.

1843
01:19:16,526 --> 01:19:19,095
[whooshing]

1844
01:19:31,174 --> 01:19:33,277
[echoes]

1845
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,554
[whooshing]
[echoes]

1846
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:54,198
[echoes]

1847
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,670
[whooshing]

1848
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:20,189
Did you catch that?

1849
01:20:20,223 --> 01:20:21,792
[clapping]

1850
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:23,527
Unbelievable.

1851
01:20:24,126 --> 01:20:26,162
You don't have to do that.

1852
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,298
It's not a performance.

1853
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,833
You have got to show me
how to do that.

1854
01:20:30,866 --> 01:20:33,403
It takes years to master.

1855
01:20:33,771 --> 01:20:36,340
It's like reaching
enlightenment.

1856
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:37,773
See?

1857
01:20:37,807 --> 01:20:40,510
I told you.
We have souls.

1858
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:42,212
You just saw it.

1859
01:20:42,245 --> 01:20:43,714
Hey.
Do that again.

1860
01:20:44,414 --> 01:20:45,849
I can't.

1861
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:46,982
Why not?

1862
01:20:47,017 --> 01:20:49,720
Because I only have the energy
to do it twice a night

1863
01:20:49,753 --> 01:20:52,723
and I'm meeting someone
at the Queens cemetery later.

1864
01:20:53,356 --> 01:20:55,925
We have souls.
Isn't that reassuring?

1865
01:20:55,959 --> 01:20:59,595
To know that we keep going?
There's no death.

1866
01:20:59,629 --> 01:21:02,198
I can't say there's no death.

1867
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,635
Maybe this thing inside
of us only exists

1868
01:21:04,668 --> 01:21:06,903
while the body is alive.

1869
01:21:06,937 --> 01:21:10,140
Maybe the body
is like a lightbulb.

1870
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,410
Maybe the soul grows
weaker over time,

1871
01:21:13,442 --> 01:21:16,280
and when it can no longer
power the body,

1872
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:19,782
The body dies and the soul
is extinguished.

1873
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:20,751
Yeah, but...

1874
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:22,419
I don't understand
the technical details.

1875
01:21:22,451 --> 01:21:24,253
I just know how to move it.

1876
01:21:24,286 --> 01:21:26,889
Yeah, but you said you're
going to the cemetery later.

1877
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:29,193
Don't you see the souls
of dead people there?

1878
01:21:29,226 --> 01:21:31,827
No.
This isn't The Sixth Sense.

1879
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:33,497
- [laughing]
- I interact with the souls

1880
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:36,200
of people
who are still living.

1881
01:21:36,232 --> 01:21:38,401
I don't know what happens
after we die.

1882
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,702
I assume it all ends.

1883
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:41,838
Really?
I didn't know you believed that.

1884
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,839
I assumed you believed
in an after life.

1885
01:21:43,872 --> 01:21:46,242
Well, you shouldn't
assume things, Paul.

1886
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,778
I know.
I do it all the time.

1887
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:49,545
And I assumed you were
smarter than that.

1888
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:51,247
There has to be
an explanation.

1889
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,417
Yeah, like I said,
you will try to discredit it.

1890
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,352
Paul, it has to be
an illusion.

1891
01:21:55,384 --> 01:21:58,222
- Right.
- Andrew, she's not Mysterio.

1892
01:21:58,254 --> 01:21:59,589
Don't try to explain away

1893
01:21:59,622 --> 01:22:01,290
something that you
can't understand.

1894
01:22:01,323 --> 01:22:03,559
Well, Paul, there has to be
an explanation.

1895
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:04,827
Let me ask you something.

1896
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:07,898
You said you go to museums
and stuff.

1897
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:10,567
What do you do?
You just fly through the sky?

1898
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:12,369
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

1899
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:15,938
Sorry.
This is ridiculous.

1900
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:16,974
Perfume.

1901
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:18,775
What perfume?

1902
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,409
The perfume

01:31:32,795 --> 01:31:35,298
That I love him.
That I miss him.

2076
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,499
Me too.

2077
01:31:37,866 --> 01:31:39,302
[sighs]

2078
01:31:39,335 --> 01:31:40,904
You know...

2079
01:31:40,937 --> 01:31:42,839
...Father Brooks
was very devout.

2080
01:31:43,673 --> 01:31:47,510
He believed with every
fiber of his being.

2081
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:49,445
But he used to always
say to me

2082
01:31:49,478 --> 01:31:53,817
that he didn't care
if God existed or not.

2083
01:31:53,849 --> 01:31:57,387
That if science proved that all
it was all just some hoax,

2084
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:02,091
some, you know,
great cosmic accident...

2085
01:32:02,124 --> 01:32:06,196
he'd shrug and go back
to reading his Bible.

2086
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:08,231
"It's just a damned good story,"

2087
01:32:08,263 --> 01:32:11,200
is what he'd always say.
[laughing]

2088
01:32:11,233 --> 01:32:13,836
Did he really say that?
I've never heard him say that.

2089
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,205
I'm paraphrasing.

2090
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:17,139
He seemed more resolute
than that.

2091
01:32:17,173 --> 01:32:18,174
He was.

2092
01:32:18,206 --> 01:32:19,843
But he had moments
of uncertainty.

2093
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:21,276
Was he drunk?

2094
01:32:21,309 --> 01:32:23,178
He'd had a few drinks, yes.
when he said it.

2095
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:24,914
Are you remembering it
correctly?

2096
01:32:24,946 --> 01:32:28,050
I seem to recall,
I remember he used to say,

2097
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,552
"God lives, God damn it!"

2098
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,254
"God lives
and don't you forget it!"

2099
01:32:31,286 --> 01:32:32,487
Well, he did.

2100
01:32:32,522 --> 01:32:34,591
He said that too but he was also
plastered when he said that.

2101
01:32:34,624 --> 01:32:35,892
[laughing]

2102
01:32:35,924 --> 01:32:37,559
He sounds like a great guy.

2103
01:32:37,593 --> 01:32:39,429
Well, he actually really was.

2104
01:32:40,162 --> 01:32:42,165
But he could be
a real jerk sometimes.

2105
01:32:42,197 --> 01:32:44,233
But he would always apologize.

2106
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,134
He did.

2107
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,235
And then he would say,

2108
01:32:46,268 --> 01:32:48,171
"You have to accept my apology
because where would

2109
01:32:48,204 --> 01:32:49,906
Catholicism be without
forgiveness?"

2110
01:32:49,938 --> 01:32:51,273
[laughing] That's right.

2111
01:32:57,379 --> 01:32:58,614
Paul, would you like
to say something

2112
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:00,115
in Father Brook's honor?

2113
01:33:00,148 --> 01:33:02,517
Me? No.
I didn't know him.

2114
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,054
It would be wrong for me
to say anything.

2115
01:33:05,987 --> 01:33:07,589
He would have liked you.

2116
01:33:07,622 --> 01:33:09,157
Yeah.

2117
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:11,394
He would have wanted you
to say something.

2118
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:14,264
Okay, uh...

2119
01:33:14,796 --> 01:33:17,634
I just want to say
that I'm really...

2120
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,268
[sniffs]

2121
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:21,070
...honored...

2122
01:33:21,103 --> 01:33:22,539
...to be here.

2123
01:33:24,106 --> 01:33:26,276
And I'm very honored
to be alive.

2124
01:33:26,308 --> 01:33:27,643
[sniffs]

2125
01:33:29,577 --> 01:33:31,546
[crying]
I don't want to die.

2126
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,917
[crying]

2127
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:36,952
Hey.

2128
01:33:37,753 --> 01:33:39,554
I thought you weren't
afraid of death.

2129
01:33:39,588 --> 01:33:42,893
I wasn't until last night.
Now, I'm terrified.

2130
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,327
Paul.

2131
01:33:46,228 --> 01:33:48,164
[snorting]

2132
01:33:48,196 --> 01:33:49,431
Paul.

2133
01:33:51,267 --> 01:33:53,637
[crying]

2134
01:34:00,142 --> 01:34:01,912
Do you want to be saved?

2135
01:34:02,577 --> 01:34:03,679
No.

2136
01:34:06,514 --> 01:34:07,983
No.

2137
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:29,104
Goodbye, Father Brooks.

2138
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:32,275
Goodbye, Father Brooks.

2139
01:34:32,607 --> 01:34:34,043
Goodbye.

2140
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:38,348
Okay.

2141
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:40,951
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

2142
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,084
Wait.

2143
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,586
We're not going to scatter
the ashes?

2144
01:34:45,254 --> 01:34:46,622
Of course not.

2145
01:34:47,522 --> 01:34:48,490
Why?

2146
01:34:48,523 --> 01:34:50,293
The church frowns on
the scattering of ashes.

2147
01:34:50,326 --> 01:34:53,463
Cremation wasn't even allowed
until the 60s.

2148
01:34:53,495 --> 01:34:54,596
Really?

2149
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:56,231
Yeah.
For centuries,

2150
01:34:56,264 --> 01:34:58,735
cremation was an act of defiance
against the church.

2151
01:34:58,768 --> 01:35:01,304
It was seen as an insult.

2152
01:35:01,336 --> 01:35:02,671
Why was it an insult?

2153
01:35:02,705 --> 01:35:04,407
Because it evokes paganism.

2154
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:06,009
Well, it goes against the idea

2155
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:09,144
of the soul transitioning
into the afterlife.

2156
01:35:09,178 --> 01:35:11,046
When you scatter the ashes,

2157
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,683
you're returning the body
to the earth.

2158
01:35:13,715 --> 01:35:16,018
That's a kind of desecration.

2159
01:35:16,052 --> 01:35:17,019
I don't know.

2160
01:35:17,053 --> 01:35:18,588
I think you're all
overthinking things here.

2161
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,589
Yeah, it's true.

2162
01:35:20,622 --> 01:35:21,758
There's a lot of history
behind this.

2163
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,258
The church doesn't like it.

2164
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:26,429
So, why did we bring the ashes
to the beach?

2165
01:35:26,461 --> 01:35:28,397
- Father Brooks liked the beach.
- He did.

2166
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:30,465
It's too bad we can't scatter
his ashes here.

2167
01:35:30,499 --> 01:35:32,335
It's too bad
we can't bury him.

2168
01:35:32,367 --> 01:35:34,202
That's what he really wanted.

2169
01:35:34,236 --> 01:35:36,305
I wonder what he would
have wanted in his casket.

2170
01:35:36,338 --> 01:35:37,407
He told me.

2171
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:38,508
Oh yeah.

2172
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,476
A bible

2173
01:35:39,509 --> 01:35:41,244
- and a fifth of bourbon.
- A fifth of bourbon.
