[ Both speaking Kaqchikel ]

51
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,400
We want to live as close as possible to the
reality of poverty, so we're replicating a

52
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:46,972
few key aspects of it. Our budget for the
trip is one dollar a day each, for 56

53
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:51,710
days. But instead of giving ourselves
one dollar every day, we're

54
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:56,448
making our income unpredictable.
This way, we do not know when

55
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,554
we'll get paid. We're doing this because
many of our neighbors are employed

56
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:07,025
informally as day laborers or farmers, so
they never know when they'll get paid or how

57
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:14,666
much they'll make. We're simulating this
by taking our total budget of one dollar

58
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:20,172
a day each and splitting it into
random numbers between zero and nine.

59
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:24,142
Then, every morning, we'll pick a number out of a hat.
If we pick a nine, we make

60
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,146
nine dollars that day. >> Pulled a nine.

>> Dude. He's good.

63
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:42,227
A second aspect of poverty we want to simulate
is the process of starting our own business.

64
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:48,099
So we're taking out a loan of $125 to pay for
somewhere to live and for a plot of land to

65
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:56,101
grow radishes on. Our small loan is
part of a service for the poor called

66
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:01,012
microfinance. Zach and I have heard
both good and bad things about these

were helping in peña blanca, both from our

68
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:12,657
neighbors and by taking out a loan ourselves.
This means that, every 15 days,

69
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:20,198
we'll have to pay back small installments of
$6.25, or else have to default on our loan.
