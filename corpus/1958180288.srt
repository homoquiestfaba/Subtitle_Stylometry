- Yes, thank you. You too.

4
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,330
Good morning. What am I going to give you?

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,251
Where is curly hair lady?

6
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:00,118
Sarah?

7
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,073
She's sick, or at least that what she says.

8
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,829
She's got a new boyfriend.

9
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:05,988
What can I get you?

10
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,385
Usually it's my usual

11
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,974
and usually she has it ready, because usually I'm already late.

12
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,869
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

13
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,160
It's a PB and BRHC on a bun.

14
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,144
Okay, so PB would be peanut butter, I guess?

15
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,069
Yes, and BR bananas and raisins,

16
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,727
H would be honey, and C cheese, all served on a bun.

17
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:21,823
Are you blessed with a fast metabolism.

18
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,842
Are you running a marathon or something?

19
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:25,601
You know, my sister ran a marathon once,

20
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:26,800

21
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:27,993
She's not dead.

22
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:30,022
She's just exhausted.

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,410

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,465
But everyone has to work in the morning.

25
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:34,096
Yes, I have to go to work.

26

Alfred, I really can't talk.

31

Good morning, Mr. Allen.

32
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:48,631
No, I'm late.

33
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,556
And I'm starving, and the curly-haired girl isn't here,

34
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:51,849
and her name is Sarah, and she has a boyfriend.

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,976
We have a situation at the Gotham General.

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,672
A robbery gone wrong.

37
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:57,690
It's in the middle of the morning.

38
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,852
Why is our bat-friend even awake?

40
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,237
That was the first thing I thought.

41

My other first thought.

46
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,562
It's rather annoying that she is not picking up.

47
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:13,522
How many first thoughts exactly did you have...

48
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:14,850

Bruce, why does it sound
like you're fleeing the scene?

76
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:42,115
Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

77
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:45,211
He put a crew together and broke
into the lab of Gotham General.

00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,876
You need to focus your motion.

183
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,474
Do the work. 
Close the case.

184
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,070
Move on.

185
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,535
You have a lot of potential, Barry.

186
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:50,999
You shouldn't still be getting coffee

187
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,533
after all these years.

188
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,873
You're right. That, that's true.

189
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,037
Go get me a coffee.

190
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,405
- With 2 sugars?  
-Oh ya.

191
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,766
They gonna love this.

192
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,003
I am very satisfied with the ruling in the Johnson case.

193
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,767
The evidence, our lab analyzed...

194
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,100
was more than sufficient, to be conclusive...

195
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,465
We are still working at on the tests.

196
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:29,804
By constant diligence, hard work and concentration...

197
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,869
Barry was still working on that evidence...

198
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,069
If that was up to you,

199
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,499
<i>RESEARCH CENTER</i> 
- we still would be scraping Ted Bundy's molars.

200
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,169
Do you know what?

201
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm so happy you find this all so hilarious,

202
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:42,598
But we are dealing with real people lives.

203
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:43,597
people's families,

204
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,900
And I don't think they can grasp the gravity of it,

205
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,529
so why don't you leave me alone?

206
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,168
- Barry Allen?

207
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,395
Iris West.

208
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:53,997
You know my full name also?

209
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,770
Yes. From school.

210
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,034
Barry, you didn't tell us you had a friend from school.

211
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,065
We didn't actually know that Barry had a friend.

212
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,526
Yeah, what does that make you now?

213
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:02,999
- One? 
- One.

214
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,866
You guys...

215
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:06,867
And bye, guys.

216
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,899
Okay, old friend.

217
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,397
They're not really my friends.

218
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,562
They are my work friends.

219
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:13,968
So you work here?

220
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,265
Yes, I do.

221
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,198
God, it's been a long time, huh?

222
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:23,561
I feel that we saw each other 
a few years ago, right?

223
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:28,731
No, because we haven't seen each other since college.

224
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,431
Maybe I was just thinking about you.

225
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,428
I am really glad I ran into you.

226
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,731
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

227
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,930
Your father's appeal is tomorrow, right?

228
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:40,797
Yeah, how...

229
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,593
Sorry, how do you know about that?

230
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,297
I'm covering it for the paper.

231
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,629
How is he holding up?

232
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:51,960
Are, are you asking me for the paper?

233
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:54,029
No, I'm asking as a friend.

234
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,929
Although, I'm sure the public would want to know as well.

235
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,924
Well, my only official comment is that my dad is innocent.

236
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:04,928
Right.

237
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:09,527
No one would want to believe that their father killed their mother.

238
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:10,529
What do you mean <i>believe</i>?

239
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,727
My dad shouldn't be in jail. 
My mom should be alive.

240
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:15,126
It's not about what I believe.

241
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,260
It is about what the truth is.

242
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,296
Right. 
No, yes, that's...

243
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,095
Oh my God, that's what I meant.

244
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:21,659
Right.

245
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,393
Sorry, I have no official comment at this time.

246
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,258
<i>CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL</i>

247
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:51,394
You have a collect call from Iron Heights Penitentiary.

248
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,693
- Do you wish to accept? 
- Yes.

249
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,453
- Hey, Dad. 
- Hey, Barry.

250
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,492
- How are you doing? 
- I'm fine.

251
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,558
- Do you get out a lot? 
- Yeah.

252
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,790
Well no. 
No.

253
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:08,225
But, I ran into an old college friend, 
Iris West, today.

254
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,422
Didn't you have a monster crush on her?

255
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:11,759
Well, if she doesn't have a boyfriend...

256
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,220
Why don't you ask her out?

257
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:17,819
Dad, I had a friend run the...

258
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,953
old security camera footage...

259
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:22,222
from the store
through this new program he's developed.

260
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,193
And it's crystal clear now.

261
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,290
It's just...

262
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:29,522
You never look up, dad.

263
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,990
You can't see your face.

264
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:35,223
So without new evidence to support your alibi,

265
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:37,518
We'd better start thinking about...

266
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,919
- the next appeal. 
- No.

267
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:42,020
You need to stop worrying about your old man.

268
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:46,217
If you did that, you might
actually have time for a girlfriend.

269
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,249
Dad, I don't want...

270
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,552
You've done this before.

271
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:53,484
This this was a last ditch effort, 
and we'll go through the motions tomorrow.

272
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,883
I'm fine, really.

273
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:57,716
You know, sometimes I even think it's probably...

274
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,754
easier for me to be in here, than out there,

275
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:03,489
without her.

276
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,818
So I can imagine, that she is alive.

277
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,185
Out there, living her life.

278
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:13,654
Barry.

279
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,056
Barry?

280
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:17,854
Are you there?

281
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,486
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

282
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:22,184
Hey, you remember the sauce you make on Sundays?

283
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:26,215
The whole house smelled of basil and tomato.

284
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:29,916
She put on my sweats and start singing.

285
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,917
Yeah, but what was that song?

286
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,546
<i>What was that song?</i>

287
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,518
Remember that part.

288
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:45,513
- It's not fair. 
- What's not fair, monkey?

289
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:47,978
This question is stupid.

290
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,181
How many calculations can
you think of with an answer of 24?

291
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,781
There are bajillion answers.

292
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:54,079
How am I supposed to fit them all in?

293
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,045
You are right.

294
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:57,745
There are a bajillion answers to that question.

295
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,114
Not every problem has a solution.

296
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:02,081
Sometimes you just have to let go.

297
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,341
Keep your brain at rest and help me make the pasta.

298
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:06,680
Come on.

299
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,012
No. <i>Mierda</i>.

300
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:10,980
Henry?

301
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,384
Yes, <i>cariño mío</i>.

302
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,246
I need you to do me a favor.

303
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,412
I don't do favors.

304
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:16,380
OK.

305
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:18,582
Barry needs you to do him a favor.

306
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,483
Barry. Yes, anything.

307
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,748
I need another can of tomatoes.

308
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:25,076
You have a can of tomatoes.

309
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,275
I need another one.

310
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,281
I thought you guys went to the store this morning.

311
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,482
But I forgot the tomatoes.

312
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,587
This looks way more fun.

313
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:35,526
Let's just let Barry go to the store.

314
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:37,288
- You drive, don't you, silly? 
- What?

315
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:39,520
You are now so big, you can do anything.

316
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:40,555
Look at you.

317
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:41,786
You're getting gray, actually.

318
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,890
The green can, not the blue one, okay?

319
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,255
Got it. The blue can

320
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:46,322
Not the green one, right?

321
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:47,254
- No! 
- What?

322
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,457
The green can, not the blue one.

323
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:51,789
Good God!

324
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,792
It start singing.

325
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,489

<i>Don't worry about tomorrow.</i>

<i>We always knew it was a long shot.</i>

344
00:23:13,096 --> 00:23:14,562
"Dad"?

345
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:19,331
<i>Your call with Iron Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.</i>

346
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:20,302
No!

347
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,772
Barry Allen?

348
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,676
You have to focus on what you know.

349
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:19,642
Was that fast enough for you?

350
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:26,406
...fast enough for you...

351
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:09,273
Are you saying that you went back in time, like in Pozharnov?

352
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:11,939
Yes, as in Pozharnov, except that in Pozharnov it was a second,

353
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,540
this time I went back a whole day.

354
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:18,207
So let's imagine, that it is in fact possible for you run faster...

355
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:22,076
than the speed of light, and so doing, travel back in time.

356
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,910
It still would be wildly irresponsibe.

357
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,375
I knew you were going to say that.

358
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:30,107
Yes, because Barry, if you were going to the past,

359
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,139
any interactions you have with your parents or yourself,

360
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,476
You step in the wrong blade of grass

361
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:37,377
You have no idea of ​​the consequences that could be.

362
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,307
No. I know, the butterfly effect, right?

363
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:40,008
Yes.

364
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,843
I get it, but Bruce, I can fix things.

365
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:45,844
You can also destroy everything.

366
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:48,078
I can save her.

367
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,408
I can save them both.

368
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:54,844
Save your parents.

369
00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:59,946
Barry, these scars that we have, they make us who we are.

370
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,977
We are not made to go back and fix them.

371
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:07,780
And there's nothing broken in you that needs to be fixed.

372
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:12,613
Take that from an old guy that has made a lot of mistakes.

373
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,750
Don't live in your past.

374
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:17,182
Live your life.

375
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,815
Don't let your tragedy define you.

376
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,885
What if it supposed to define me?

377
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:25,881
Your tragedy made you a hero.

378
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,551
It also made me a loner.

379
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,416
We could hang out.

380
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,149
Do you want to go get a bite?

381
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,615
I'm still hungry.

382
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,551
Not this time.

383
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,083
Maybe some other time.

384
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,882
Yeah.

385
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,713
Nice ride.

386
00:27:58,446 --> 00:28:00,149
You have fancy friends.

387
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,950
It was an Uber.

388
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,116
Exec.

389
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:06,246
Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the case at all.

390
00:28:06,347 --> 00:28:09,188
I am not here as a reporter.

391
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,887
Can we talk?

392
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:18,716
Come on in.

393
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:27,319
I'm not gonna lie, it's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

394
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,352
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

395
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:31,420
Yeah, well, I'm a pretty tidy person.

396
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:37,618
Can I offer you a drink?

397
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:38,483
Sure.

398
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:39,783
I'll take a beer.

399
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,153
Beers, beers, beers.

400
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:57,785
I keep them in my fridge.

401
00:28:58,017 --> 00:28:59,320
Thanks.

402
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:05,825
Look, I feel really bad about earlier.

403
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:12,894
I should have been more sensitive.

404
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:17,387
And I could probably have been less sensitive.

405
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:20,021
I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through.

406
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:23,091
It's like you lost both parents in one day.

407
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,256
Yeah, I did.

408
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,820
I lost my mom in a tragedy,

409
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:29,857
and I lost my dad due the failures of the justice system.

410
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:32,789
Is that why you got into criminal forensics?

411
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,891
You're trying to fix the system?

412
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:38,925
Yeah.

413
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:40,593
Yeah, to fix it.

414
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:44,222
There's gotta be a way to fix it, right?

415
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:46,757
I mean, that's why I also got into journalism to.

416
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,087
I could make it right, if I just could go back somehow

417
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:52,325
and warn them, without them knowing that I have warned them.

418
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,994
Thinking like that...
drive you crazy.

419
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:59,022
If I could just go back in time and stop the guy who did it...

420
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:02,024
No, I can't do that, because that's way too much interaction.

421
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:05,823
My dad wasn't even at home.

422
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:08,358
My mother sent him to get a can of tomatoes.

423
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,789
I think whoever broke into the house thought it was empty,

424
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,690
but then my mother was in there, with a knife in her hand,

425
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:16,722
and things turned bad, just an absurd chain of events.

426
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,960
And it's like this footage should
have finally supported my dad's alibi

427
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:24,725
but instead, three lives ruined by a can of tomatoes.

428
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:32,499
Oh my God!

429
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,029
What?

430
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,625
Well, that could be it.

431
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:38,527
If my mother doesn't forget about the tomatoes in the first place,

432
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,665
so he never leaves and she never dies.

433
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,761
No one even would have to see me.

434
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,325
Bruce said no interaction. This is no interaction.

435
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,060
This is just quick in, quick out, back to the present,

436
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,027
like I was never even there, and that's how I'll fix it.

437
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:51,663
Oh my God, Iris. 
Thank you so much.

438
00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:52,964
This has been great.

439
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:59,301
- I'm sorry. I have to leave. 
- Okay, bye.

440
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,698
By the way, I had a really great time. 
We should do that again.

441
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,262
Kal-El. The son of Krypton.

442
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:23,629
This is a bad idea.

443
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:32,101
That defines you.

444
00:31:34,963 --> 00:31:36,931

Is that Barry? And he is early?

458
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,107
What universe is this?

459
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,677
You cut your hair.

460
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,877
Now I can see your eyes.

461
00:34:58,885 --> 00:34:59,954
It looks terrible.

462
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:02,418
- Henry! 
- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

463

What are they doing to you over there?

464
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,287

I love you too.

Go take a shower and change.

471
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,717
You smell like feet.

472
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:23,186
Go Go go.

473
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:26,017
Old?

474
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:27,054
Seriously?

475
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,751
No, I mean like mature.

476
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,454
At that age you want to look older,

477
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:32,886
you know, gets into the bars that way.

478
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:34,717
How can I help?

479
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,956
Mom, how was your day?

480
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:43,652
Or your month?

481
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:45,021
Or the last 18 years?

482
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:46,651
That's a weird question.

483
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:47,653
Because I was here.

484
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:50,554
But, obviously we share those memories together.

485
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:51,350
Or I don't know...

486
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,382
Maybe we'll make new memories.

487
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,349
Like going to the aquarium or the circus...

488
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,353
or to the park and you push me on a swing.

489
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,352
That's also weird, because now I'm an adult...

490
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:00,449
so I probably power my own movement on a swing.

491
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,616
So how was it this week?

492
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:02,820
How is school?

493
00:36:04,753 --> 00:36:07,654
The school is going well.

494
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:08,851
The school is very good.

495
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:12,350
I am working very hard there on my studies.

496
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:14,518
Did you asked out that girl from Economics?

497
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,116
I know Freshman Year is...

498
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,417
About going out, meeting people, okay?

499
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,053
Exploring things.

500
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:22,920
To experiment.

501
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:27,051
But, you have to be very careful.

502
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:28,519
Oh, shit.

503
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,955
I have to shit.

504
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:34,617
Outside.

505
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:37,652
Help!

506
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,652
Why are you here?

507
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:45,317
What year is it?

508
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,086
No no no no...

509
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:55,184
That is my face.

510
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:57,383
You stole my face?

511
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:59,148
I'm having a mushroom flashback?

512
00:36:59,249 --> 00:36:59,850
Is that a thing?

513
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,318
How old are you?

514
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,251
18.

515
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,516
This is mad trippy.

516
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,078
So we are like in the future.

517
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:20,446
No wait. This is not trippy, dude.

518
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:21,613
This is catastrophic.

519
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,182
And no, we are not in the future.

520
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,751
I was supposed to be back in the present...

521
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:25,848
but I'm still in the past.

522
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,551
And there aren't supposed to be two of me.

523
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,421
You and I, we're not supposed to occupy...

524
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:31,748
the same reality at all, let alone interacting.

525
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,450
I can't believe I'm a time traveling superhero.

526
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:35,482
No no no.

527
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,581
You are not anything.

528
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:39,448
Which is good. You don't want to be a superhero.

529
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,886
It's scary and bug spider get stuck...

530
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,618
on teeth, all the time.

531
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,453
Awesome.

532
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:46,953
Do that thing again.

533
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,985
No, you don't have time.

534
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:52,449
Mom!

535
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,314
What are you doing? 
Now are you going to accuse me?

536
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,847
Do the thing!

537
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:57,117
Fine.

538
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,347
- Yes.
- Happy?

539
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,883
Yes. Now undo it.

540
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:26,650
Barry, are you okay up there?

541
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:28,847
We're fine. I'm fine.

542
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:29,979
OK.

543
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:32,945
So, you have like a plane that goes underwater...

544
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:35,414
or a boat that can fly?

545
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,843
How old are you, like 40?

546
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,849
Okay, you don't stop talking.

547
00:38:39,146 --> 00:38:41,179
It's not charming, it's abrasive

548
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,048
and exhausting and oh my god,

549
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,949
I starting to realize what people mean.

550
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,576
Just do me a favor

551
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:49,245
and promise me that meeting me...

552
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:51,514
Isn't gonna screw up space-time.

553
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:53,449
Brosky?

554
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:54,946
I got you.

555
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:56,348
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

556
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,980
What do you mean?

557
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,212
That's right.

558
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,051
I can drug you.

559
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,747
Yes, I can drug you.

560
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:05,180
And then you pass out, you wake up

561
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,577
and you forget that anything ever happened

562
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,178
And it wouldn't be wrongd, right? Because you are me.

563
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,081
No! We should not.

564
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:12,078
Please don't drug me.

565
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,047
- No? 
- No...

566
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:14,480
Because here is the thing I've thought about before...

567
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:17,314
I don't want to get drugged, but I'm sure we can think...

568
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:18,913
of another way.

569
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,445
Let's put on our Barry thinking caps

570
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:23,847
and let's think of a different solution for memory loss.

571
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:27,345
Also, I am a green belt in Quera

572
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:29,543
and I have extensively studied wrestler

573
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:32,209
And I could go lunatic on you.

574
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,512
Besides, I have a date tonight.

575
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:37,681
OK.

576
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,509
How hard do you have to hit someone to make them forget stuff?

577
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,478
If I hit you in the past...

578
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,147
Will it hurt me in the future?

579
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,176
Wait, did you say you have a date tonight?

580
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:46,848
Yes. Wait, what were you doing there?

581
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:48,978
Nothing. Who's your date with?

582
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,808
With a super babe in my econ class.

583
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:52,677
Iris West.

584
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:55,079
My God, do we marry her?

585
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,774
You're going on a date with her tonight.

586
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,777
That's why I need mom to do my laundry.

587
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:00,479
You don't even do your own laundry?

588
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,681
Do you?

589
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,448
OK.

590
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,877
- I'm actually going to go. 
- What do you mean?

591
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:08,911
Enjoy your life or do you.
Change literally nothing.

592
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:10,476
I'll see you again never.

593
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,142
But I have some more questions.

594
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,544
We have a lot to learn from each other.

595
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:16,673
Great.

596
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:20,146
You leave me and now this storm is going to ruin my date.

597
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,442
What day is today?

598
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:27,879
Sunday?

599
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,144
No, the date.

600
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,009
It's September 29.

601
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:34,978
Shit.

602
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,610
This is the storm, this is the day.

603
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:39,141
What day?

604
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:40,673
The day I got my powers.

605
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,078
The day you get your powers.

606
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:44,774
Powers?

607
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,375
Listen, I can't tell you why I traveled back in time time.

608
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,611
And I can't tell you what I changed.

609
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,408
But essentially, in my version of reality,

610
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,810
I ended up interning at the Central City Crime Lab.

611
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,880
in my Freshman Year.

612
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:57,678
That's where it happened.

613
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:58,574
Happened.

614
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:01,844
Tonight, September 29, the accident that gives me my powers.

615
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:03,547
And if you're not there in...

616
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:05,910
30 minutes,

617
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,877
then you won't get your powers.

618
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,807
Which means I won't get the powers,

619
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:11,609
maybe,

620
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,510
and then, that would mean I lose my way...

621
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:16,341
to go back in time, in the first place.

622
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:19,109
And then I literally have no idea what happens.

623
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,912
Powers?

624
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:26,306
Wait, but what will happen to our date tonight?

625
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:28,877
She might be our future wife.

626
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,647
There may not be a future

627
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:33,876
if you don't come with me...

628
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,378
right now.

629
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,379
<i>CENTRAL CITY RESEARCH CENTER</i>

630
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:42,909
Eight minutes.

631
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,405
How are we going to get inside? 
What are you doing?

632
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:46,574
Stop whining.

633
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:48,706
It's going to feel kind of weird.

634
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:14,543
We go through the door.

635
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:15,939
Yes.

636
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,572
It's okay. It's called phasing.

637
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:18,974
Come on.

638
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,812
I love phasing.

639
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,608
Everybody moves.

640
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:56,003
Well, this is it.

641
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,004
This is where I was sitting.

642
00:42:58,105 --> 00:42:59,638
And actually, let me take this...

643
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,105
- for you. 
- Thank you.

644
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,806
Okay, I just opened those windows...

645
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:08,041
to clear the fumes.

646
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:09,701
We are right on time.

647
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:11,668
And I was sitting in that chair

648
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:13,738
and it was right under this shelf of chemicals

649
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,573
and that was when the lightning hits.

650
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:18,069
Wait, I get hit by a lightning?

651
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,771
No no no. You won't get hit by the lightning.

652
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:21,204
Okay, because for a second I thought you said...

653
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:23,736
The lightning hits the chemicals, with which you get...

654
00:43:23,837 --> 00:43:25,504
bathed and that's what electrocutes you.

655
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:27,445
Okay, but I don't wannabe electrocuted.

656
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,234
No. No, you already have. I already have the powers.

657
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:31,399
You already have the powers.

658
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,536
- Exactly. 
- I'm not geting struck...

659
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:35,467
by lightning.

660
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,170
It worked.

661
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:25,404
Looks like you've lost a tooth.

662
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:32,435
No?

663
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,170
You have lost a tooth.

664
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,769
Very good.

665
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,103
We have to go.

666
00:44:50,934 --> 00:44:52,202
What happened?

667
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,004
The alarm, upstair from the lab.

668
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:55,835
Go check it.

669
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:01,970
Securing the entrance.

670
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:06,805
We have to go.

671
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:49,635
Hey.

672
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:55,035
Shit!

673
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:00,766
I'm slow.

674
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:09,829
Why is your place so much nicer...

675
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,697
than I expected it to be?

676
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:14,167
Do you like it? Mom had to help decorate.

677
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:15,534
You know mom.

678
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:17,967
Right. Yes. Classic mom.

679
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:19,868
Classic mom.

680
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:27,564
What a day

681
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,666
Barry, the accident gave you powers,

682
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,296
but took mine away.

683
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,333
So, I don't know how I get back.

684
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:35,663
Without access to the speed force, I don't know...

685
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:37,530
how I ever leave.

686
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,402
Do you understand what I'm saying?

687
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,263
I may be stuck.

688
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:42,566
Wait.

689
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,000
I have powers now?

690
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:46,900
Yes, but...

691
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:03,661
Oh, speed balls.

692
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:06,058
OK. I know this is incredibly exciting,

693
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,429
because I went through it...

694
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,097
Speedy Gonzalez.  Yeah.

695
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:10,897
I've done it many times myself.

696
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,667
You can't just start...

697
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:15,196
Shit!

698
00:47:51,727 --> 00:47:53,030
Oh my god!

699
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:29,428
I'm leaving!

700
00:48:56,528 --> 00:48:57,693
What did you do?

701
00:48:57,794 --> 00:48:59,764
Nothing. Why?

702
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:08,294
Barry, let me tell you about the clothes.

703
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:09,591
It's friction. you run too fast

704
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:11,495
and therefore, normal tissues are burned.

705
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:13,560
It's the same reason you can't move people very far...

706
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:16,162
at hyperspeed. That broccoli looks rotten.

707
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:17,725
Look, some things can be moved.

708
00:49:17,826 --> 00:49:20,297
For example, you can move

709
00:49:20,428 --> 00:49:21,665
a microwave.

710
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:24,295
But you can't move something like, say,

711
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:25,693
- a baby. 
- Barry, it's like...

712
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:27,359
I had never eaten anything before.

713
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,193
Everything has vivid flavor.

714
00:49:30,294 --> 00:49:32,429
Well. Take a bite.

715
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,127
That's bad, isn't it?

716
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:36,094
That's not good. No, I was kidding.

717
00:49:36,195 --> 00:49:37,897
Amazing. We are amazing.

718
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:39,996
And I'm very hungry.

719
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,326
Hey, wait.

720
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:43,728
I wanna try that phasing thing.

721
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:45,960
- How do I do that? 
- You don't.

722
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,360
Not yet. okay? It's very complicated.

723
00:49:48,492 --> 00:49:50,091
It takes a long time to train your body...

724
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:51,795
to be able to speed up, while your molecules...

725
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:54,090
slow down enough to pass through the molecular...

726
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,861
structure of solid objects.

727
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:07,724
You've got to start let me finish...

728
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:09,060
my sentences.

729
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,790
Are we always so sleepy

730
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,194
and hungry and naked?

731
00:50:14,326 --> 00:50:15,992
Well, the first two, yes.

732
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:17,728
The third, no. I figured...

733
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:19,759
that part out. And honestly...

734
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,658
if we gonna do this, there's a lot I am gonna have...

735
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:23,661
to explain to you. So, a good place to...

736
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,428
start, I guess, is that...

737
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,463
yes, the original soup...

738
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:29,727
it was actually made of this poly...

739
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,089
Or we'll...

740
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,529
pick this up tomorrow.

741
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,891
So the suit is inside the ring.

742
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,925
- Yeah. 
- What?

743
00:50:39,057 --> 00:50:39,756
Am I going to have this?

744
00:50:39,857 --> 00:50:41,689
No, you can't have it. You can...

745
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,458
borrow it, so you don't kill yourself using your powers.

746
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:44,762
My God!

747
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,554
You're going to press this button and the silk molecules go...

748
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:49,655
to uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases and expanding...

749
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,828
the suit in full size. Ready?

750
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,778
He was so little, brother.

751
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:13,809
You have to put it on, before it falls to the ground.

752
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,438
What, how to change?

753
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,963
- Right here, in front of you? - There's not even anyone here...

754
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:19,833
How are you, Barry.

755
00:51:20,862 --> 00:51:21,593
Man.

756
00:51:21,694 --> 00:51:22,696
Tight.

757
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,884
It hurts. Do you know where it hurts?

758
00:51:26,413 --> 00:51:28,148
- In my dick. 
- Okay, I know...

759
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:31,878
I know, but I don't need to know. 
I'm sorry, can we move on?

760
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:33,906
Here's what I am thinking.

761
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,075
If I can train you to move like I do,

762
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,528
then we can recreate the chronospace.

763
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:39,490
- Chrono space? - In the speed force.

764
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:40,624
Speed force.

765
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:41,620
And then maybe we can find some way...

766
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,819
- so I can go back to the future. 
- Back to the Future!

767
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,010
Yes! Eric Stoltz is your boy...

768
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:51,168
in that movie. What a embodied performance.

769
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:52,549
You mean Michael J. Fox?

770
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:53,961
Back to the Future?

771
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:54,995
Yes, in the movie Back to the Future.

772
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:56,197
My God!

773
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:01,687
What's going on?

774
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:10,472
You have to take this suit off now.

775
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:12,032
Thank God!

776
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:19,925
- A mysterious object is hovering over...
<i>A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT FLYS OVER THE EARTH</i>

777
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:21,829
- the Australian seaboard
<i>A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT FLIES OVER EARTH</i>

778
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,867
- We have obtained images... 
- Zod.

779
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:25,304
And as you can see...

780
00:52:25,603 --> 00:52:26,806
Zod.

781
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,311
What is a Zod?

782
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,606
<i>Thanks to US government officials,</i>

783
00:52:31,707 --> 00:52:33,411
<i>satellite data has confirmed...</i>

784
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:35,385
<i>the presence of a spacecraft.</i>

785
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:36,886
<i>Will be...</i>

786
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:43,061
<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

787
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,400
<i>I come from a world far from yours.</i>

788
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:50,236
<i>For some time, your world...</i>

789
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:51,264
<i>has sheltered...</i>

790
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:53,608
- No. 
<i>- To my citizens.</i>

791
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:55,578
This can not be happening.

792
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:57,851
Not now.

793
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:00,416
What is happening?

794
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:03,654
Zod is looking for Superman.

795
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:05,393
What is a Superman?

796
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,023
Superman is an alien living on Earth.

797
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:11,330
I'm assuming he's still incognito.

798
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:13,169
But, yes. He is an alien and...

799
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:16,146
it is very powerful and he is just the best.

800
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:19,490
And then Zod, he's an alien from the same planet,

801
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:22,236
also very powerful, but he is just the worst.

802
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:25,010
And Zod, came here to find Clark.

803
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:28,050
- Wait, who is Clark? 
- Clark is Superman.

804
00:53:29,187 --> 00:53:31,428
- OK. 
- But then Zod, also tried...

805
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,701
terraform the planet with that world engine thing

806
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,275
and Superman stopped him eventually,

807
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:37,546
but not before Zod killed the thousands...

808
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:38,651
of people.

809
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:42,065
At that time, there was nothing I could do.

810
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:47,107
Wait.

811
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,849
You were there?

812
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:52,727
Yeah. I just got my powers.

813
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,545
<i>I was still putting the finishing touches on my suit.</i>

814
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,691
<i>This thing, Zod's world engine,</i>

815
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:04,496
<i>it started to destroy Metropolis,</i>

816
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:05,798
<i>so I just went there</i>

817
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:08,311
<i>and I started trying to save people.</i>

818
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:10,884
Daddy!

819
00:54:11,894 --> 00:54:14,196
Listen to me!  Escape!

820
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,128
Run away!

821
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:22,464
<i>There is this kid,</i>

822
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:25,364
<i>and I got him, but then...</i>

823
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:27,364
<i>I couldn't get his dad.</i>

824
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,031
Daddy!

825
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:48,560
<i>That was all I could do</i>

826
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,598
<i>to save that one kid.</i>

827
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,027
Only Superman could stop Zod,

828
00:54:55,463 --> 00:54:57,134
but not in time to save those people.

829
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,396
And now it's about to happen again.

830
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:00,931
But...

831
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:03,430
if I can find the entire Justice League.

832
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:06,565
Superman and the rest of the gang, I...

833
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:10,397
maybe then I can prevent all this from happening at all.

834
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,466
- Give me your laptop. 
- OK.

835
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:17,863
What is that smell?

836
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:19,931
It could be anything.

837
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:24,000
Who is that?

838
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,062
It's Gary.

839
00:55:25,163 --> 00:55:26,297
That's where the smell comes from.

840
00:55:26,663 --> 00:55:28,667
Don't worry, he's busy.

841
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:31,232
We can do it.

842
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:34,468
Let's see. Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

843
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:38,963
That's my roommate, Patty.

844
00:55:39,064 --> 00:55:41,097
Is Patty is your roommate?

845
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:43,266
And that's her boyfriend, Albert.

846
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:44,866
What's up?

847
00:55:45,063 --> 00:55:47,401
Good morning.

848
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:51,163
Sorry. And, guys,

849
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,399
this is my cousin,

850
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,331
Barry.

851
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,569
I'm starving.

852
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:06,568
OK.

853
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:08,398
Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

854
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:09,864
Yes, here he is.

855
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,462
Victor Stone, star quarterback of The Knights...

856
00:56:12,563 --> 00:56:13,663
Shit, okay.

857
00:56:13,764 --> 00:56:15,165
Not the Cyborg yet.

858
00:56:15,266 --> 00:56:18,800
Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman.

859
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:21,536
Las Vegas residency.

860
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,164
Illusions, juggling and zebras.

861
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,665
No, that is not Diana.

862
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:28,466
- Aquaman. 
- Aquaman?

863
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,332
Is he like a super mermaid?

864
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:32,735
No, Albert. He's not a super mermaid.

865
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,430
Okay, he's half Atlantean, half human...

866
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:37,598
With superhuman strength, he can control marine life...

867
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:38,366
with his mind.

868
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:39,565
So I guess that makes him a super merman?

869
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:42,831
- No, Albert. 
- Can you believe this guy?

870
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,702
Let's try Arthur Curry,

871
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,672
Maine,

872
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:49,735
Lighthouse

873
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:50,467
Here we are.

874
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:52,435
Thomas Curry. That's his father.

875
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,040
Phone.

876
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,869
- Hello. 
- Hello, Thomas Curry?

877
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,000
- Yes. 
- Could I speak to Arthur?

878
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:01,436
Is Arthur around?

879
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:02,972
Do you wanna speak to my dog?

880
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:04,969
What? No no.

881
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,802
Sorry.  Is this Thomas Curry?

882
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:08,741
<i>Yes</i>

883
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:10,697
And you work in a lighthouse?

884
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:11,800
- Yes. 
- OK.

885
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:14,236
And your wife is the Queen of Atlantis?

886
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,102
No...

887
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:25,199
Right, but maybe a fishlike woman washed into your life...

888
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,700
at some point?

889
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:28,570
<i>Very funny, asshole.</i>

890
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,434
Arthur Curry was never born.

891
00:57:32,766 --> 00:57:33,366
What?

892
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:36,402
This is a disaster. I completely destroyed history.

893
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:37,466
Like Eric Stoltz.

894
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:39,403
Okay, why do you keep saying Eric Stoltz?

895
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:40,903
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

896
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:42,437
- What? 
- Timetravel?

897
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:44,401
Are they talking about Back to the Future?

898
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,499
Come on. Who is this guy?

899
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,067
Okay, yeah, I know. I've seen all the movies

900
00:57:49,168 --> 00:57:51,700
and Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly.

901
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,339
Really?

902
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,303
So explain Marty McThigh here .

903
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:57,635
I can't explain it to you, Gary.

904
00:57:57,736 --> 00:57:59,137
That's not your thigh.

905
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:01,839
It's the wrong actor, and it's upside down.

906
00:58:03,368 --> 00:58:04,903
Is it?

907
00:58:07,605 --> 00:58:10,406
The point is that in Back to the Future,

908
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:11,569
Marty McFly...

909
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,101
is very famously played by Michael J. Fox.

910
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:15,205
The guy from Footloose?

911
00:58:15,306 --> 00:58:16,838
No, that's Kevin Bacon.

912
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:17,506
Bacon.

913
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,404
Kevin Bacon is Maverick, with the volleyball,

914
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:21,036
- and the gay guys of the planes. 
-Top Gun.

915
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:22,904
- Big Balls of Fire. 
-Top Gun.

916
00:58:23,005 --> 00:58:24,174
- No no no. 
- I...

917
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:26,939
I completely broke the Universe.

918
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,998
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

919
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:32,805
- Yes. 
- Thank you.

920
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:35,307
I have created a world with no metahumans.

921
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:37,970
And now there is no one to defend us...

922
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:39,440
from Zod, Albert!

923
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:42,536
There is no Cyborg.

924
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,700
There is no Aquaman.

925
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:44,800
There is no Wonder Woman.

926
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:46,700
There is no Superman.

927
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:47,901
There is no Batman.

928
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,602
I'm Batman.

929
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,971
What did you just say?

930
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:56,174
I'm Batman...

931
00:58:58,874 --> 00:59:00,502
- Does Batman exist here? 
- Of course.

932
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,708
Yeah, dude. Nobody knows who he really is

933
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:04,300
but he exists.

934
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:07,042
Right. Well we...

935
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:09,003
me and my cousin barry

936
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,436
We have to go to this cousin's dinner.

937
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:12,907
Now.

938
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:16,940
But it's been a pleasure to meet you all.

939
00:59:17,073 --> 00:59:18,908
- And Gary. 
- Barry.

940
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:20,839
- Barry. - Gary.

941
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:22,305
Barry!

942
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,329
Are you freaking kidding me with this place?

943
00:59:47,992 --> 00:59:49,598
What is this? Hell?

944
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:00,264
It's open.

945
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:11,795
Look at all this cool shit.

946
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:15,265
Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

947
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:21,600
Hello?

948
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:23,927
Bruce?

949
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:26,934
Bruce, are you there?

950
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:29,668
Oh boy!

951
01:00:32,698 --> 01:00:34,703
Hey, I didn't know you painted.

952
01:00:35,234 --> 01:00:36,700
They are good.

953
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:39,669
Bruce Wayne?

954
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:54,268
Bruce?

955
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:03,997
Hey, check this out.

956
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:06,764
There are bells connected to every room in this house.

957
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:08,368
Hey, maybe we can find this Bruce guy...

958
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,333
If we ring all these bells, right?

959
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,603
Don't understand how service bells work?

960
01:01:12,704 --> 01:01:13,498
That's what bells are for.

961
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,166
You ring them from all the other places.

962
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:15,897
What?

963
01:01:15,998 --> 01:01:18,100
You don't have Downton Abbey in your Universe?

964
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:19,702
What is Downton Abbey?

965
01:01:19,803 --> 01:01:21,801
The chain of family style restaurants?

966
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:24,137
It's like, a cheaper Banana Bees?

967
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:27,104
Do you know what I really go for right now?

968
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:29,607
Abbey's Sizzlin' Zucchini Pie.

969
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:36,775
OK.

970
01:01:58,904 --> 01:01:59,906
Do it, old man!

971
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,507
I am helping you.

972
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:11,140
My God!

973
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:38,282
Who the hell are you?

974
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:40,178
I'm the guy who lives here.

975
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,045
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

976
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,715
Are you hungry?

977
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:50,882
<i>ALIEN MESSAGE CAUSES MASS HYSTERIA</i>

978
01:02:52,045 --> 01:02:53,348
So...

979
01:02:57,679 --> 01:02:59,377
You are the same person as him,

980
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:00,980
but from an alternate time?

981
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,082
Yes

982
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,688
In which...

983
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:06,181
you and I are friends.

984
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,882
Yeah, you're probably my best friend.

985
01:03:09,312 --> 01:03:10,210
Yeah.

986
01:03:10,011 --> 01:03:11,718
Well, but you're a bit...

987
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:15,315
- chronologically different. 
- Older.

988
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:17,588
Well, and that's what I can't understand.

989
01:03:18,248 --> 01:03:21,049
I traveled in time from here to here,

990
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,686
but somehow everything all changed...

991
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:25,248
back here.

992
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:27,182
Like when you were born, so...

993
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:29,785
Well, time is not linear.

994
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:31,248
Right?

995
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,450
Right.

996
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:37,553
At some point, you probably saw a movie...

997
01:03:38,116 --> 01:03:39,322
what tells you...

998
01:03:39,752 --> 01:03:41,756
that if you went back and changed the past...

999
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:44,282
You will create a kind of branched timeline.

1000
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,050
Right.

1001
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,852
How, look...

1002
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:51,619
New present.

1003
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,452
And new future.

1004
01:03:53,553 --> 01:03:56,190
- Yes. 
- Well, time doesn't work like that.

1005
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:57,353
That's not how time works.

1006
01:03:57,454 --> 01:03:59,050
When you go back and change the past,

1007
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:01,255
you create a foothold.

1008
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:03,586
You put yourself in whole another strands...

1009
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:04,923
of the spaghetti.

1010
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,053
New future.

1011
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,520
New past.

1012
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:11,140
It is retrocausal.

1013
01:04:11,302 --> 01:04:12,704
It goes both ways.

1014
01:04:12,805 --> 01:04:14,503
Actually, it goes in many ways.

1015
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,605
Maybe another time.

1016
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:18,809
Agreed, but in an ontological paradox model,

1017
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,209
there is no...

1018
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:22,876
What you did was change the future

1019
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:25,012
and you changed the past.

1020
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:28,445
If a person is stupid enough...

1021
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:30,013
to mess with time...

1022
01:04:30,144 --> 01:04:33,014
you eventually end up with this.

1023
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,818
A Multiverse.

1024
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,614
Some strands run almost parallel.

1025
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:41,950
And there will be inevitable intersections.

1026
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:44,088
And others that are simply...

1027
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,949
wildly divergent.

1028
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:47,952
But this is...

1029
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:50,088
It's a hot mess.

1030
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:53,025
The crapshoot.

1031
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,386
It's all just a crapshoot.

1032
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:55,585
And what does the Parmesan mean?

1033
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:57,558
The metaphor is over. He's just a garnish.

1034
01:04:57,659 --> 01:04:58,990
Can I tell you something?

1035
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:01,559
A person would have to be...

1036
01:05:02,056 --> 01:05:04,896
an idiot, to play craps...

1037
01:05:05,224 --> 01:05:06,999
with the space-time continuum.

1038
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:08,692
Yes, an idiot.

1039
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:11,932
Here.

1040
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:17,726
Are you joking with the chewing noises, right now?

1041
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:19,201
So...

1042
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,800
you are the reason that...

1043
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:23,131
this Zod character is...

1044
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:24,632
about to destroy the Earth.

1045
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,800
- Maybe. 
- And there's a guy called Superman...

1046
01:05:27,935 --> 01:05:30,069
- who can stop Zod? 
- Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,476
And does flies?

1048
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:33,202
Shoots lasers out of his eyes.

1049
01:05:33,303 --> 01:05:35,607
Yes, he flies, and he shoots lasers out of his eyes, yes.

1050
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:37,544
No one said Superman.

1051
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,575
I might be a little on the nose.

1052
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:43,243
- Do you call yourself Batman? 
- Yes.

1053
01:05:43,344 --> 01:05:45,414
But I don't call myself Super-Batman.

1054
01:05:46,941 --> 01:05:48,479
Wait, he is Batman?

1055
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,315
What do you think we are doing here?

1056
01:05:51,445 --> 01:05:53,646
This was the cousin's dinner.

1057
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:56,081
He is... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1058
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:58,017
Not really. Not so much anymore.

1059
01:05:58,847 --> 01:05:59,852
You know,

1060
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:01,584
They don't really need me.

1061
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:04,287
Things have changed.

1062
01:06:04,388 --> 01:06:05,520
Gotham is now...

1063
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:07,252
one of the safest cities in the world.

1064
01:06:07,353 --> 01:06:09,859
I need you. We need you.

1065
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:10,957
In my timeline,

1066
01:06:11,058 --> 01:06:13,357
Batman is our strategist, our leader.

1067
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,758
The world needs Superman.

1068
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:15,958
And you are the best Detective in the world.

1069
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,257
You're probably the only person who can help me find it.

1070
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:20,393
So will you help us?

1071
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:22,863
Pass.

1072
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:29,167
Like, pass the salt?

1073
01:06:29,664 --> 01:06:30,963
Bruce?

1074
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:34,299
He doesn't wanna help us?

1075
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,332
We're gonna use his bat shit.

1076
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:37,635
Bat shit?

1077
01:06:39,002 --> 01:06:39,664
Yeah, his bat stuff.

1078
01:06:39,765 --> 01:06:40,935
His bat things.

1079
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:42,839
Stand on that thing.

1080
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:45,900
OK.

1081
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,402
Do you remember when you went through the ground?

1082
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,200
Yeah.

1083
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:50,674
I need you to do it again.

1084
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,077
What is this place?

1085
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:09,040
Dude.

1086
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:12,910
This place is straight beeves.

1087
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:14,382
Beeves?

1088
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:26,856
Barry.

1089
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:28,900
I almost died...

1090
01:08:29,032 --> 01:08:29,793
in an abyss

1091
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:32,936
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1092
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:35,448
Is this what I think it is?

1093
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:47,044
Holy Shit.

1094
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:50,497
I used to see this thing on the news, when I was a kid.

1095
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,693
OK. Fine search. Date of birth.

1096
01:08:55,794 --> 01:08:58,302
He wasn't born, he arrived.

1097
01:08:58,417 --> 01:08:59,479
Barry, look.

1098
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:01,093
I'm busy.

1099
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:02,195
With what?

1100
01:09:02,454 --> 01:09:04,277
Looking for unidentified objects.

1101
01:09:04,378 --> 01:09:05,670
Entering Earth atmosphere...

1102
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:08,226
anywhere near Kansas, in the last 50 years.

1103
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:10,301
He has a backdoor into NASA.

1104
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:12,004
Of course he has.

1105
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:15,505
Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

1106
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,335
His bag laughs.

1107
01:09:17,538 --> 01:09:18,661
<i>Joker's Laughing Bag (Jack Nicholson, Batman - 1989)</i>

1108
01:09:18,762 --> 01:09:21,296
Can't you take anything seriously?

1109
01:09:21,397 --> 01:09:22,636
Stop messing around.

1110
01:09:22,737 --> 01:09:24,398
Dude, come on.

1111
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:26,265
Have you seen this place?

1112
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,073
It's amazing.

1113
01:09:28,174 --> 01:09:29,416
Hello.

1114
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:32,317
Had the gravity of this not sunk in for you.

1115
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,688
Stop messing around, Barry.

1116
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:34,807
I won't say it again.

1117
01:09:37,061 --> 01:09:37,952
Sorry mom.

1118
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:39,618
Shut up.
Shut up.

1119
01:09:40,353 --> 01:09:42,204
You have no idea how lucky you are.

1120
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:44,846
You have no idea. You take everything for granted.

1121
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:45,948
You don't even appreciate.

1122
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:50,583
You just walk around thinking you are so funny and so cool.

1123
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,131
And it's embarrassing.

1124
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:54,202
Because you are not any of those things.

1125
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:57,675
Hey, screw you, man.

1126
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,998
I've done nothing but everything you've asked.

1127
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:01,703
You made me get struck by lightning.

1128
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:03,273
I fell naked through the floor.

1129
01:10:03,374 --> 01:10:06,428
I terrified Mrs. Johanson.
Now probably gonna have to move.

1130
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,714
And you don't even tell me why you're here.

1131
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:12,955
Could you at least tell me why you are being so mean to me, for no reason?

1132
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:15,501
You used monkey as a dart board.

1133
01:10:16,563 --> 01:10:17,864
Wait what?

1134
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:19,508
Forget it.

1135
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:22,882
The monkey?

1136
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,879
So you are mad at me for playing with a toy?

1137
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:28,247
It's not a toy.

1138
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:30,702
Mom bought us this monkey.

1139
01:10:30,803 --> 01:10:33,125
Because she calls us monkey...

1140
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:35,715
she gives us monkey stuff all the time.

1141
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,426
Right.

1142
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:39,438
Look.

1143
01:10:40,086 --> 01:10:41,122
I'm sorry.

1144
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:45,310
I'm not really good with people.

1145
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:47,114
Even myself.

1146
01:10:47,236 --> 01:10:50,036
Oh, come on...

1147
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:51,517
you're not that bad.

1148
01:10:51,662 --> 01:10:54,399
Just be kind of a dick sometimes but....

1149
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:58,185
let's face it i am pretty obnoxious.

1150
01:10:58,286 --> 01:10:59,915
I just get excited.

1151
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:00,842
Come on.

1152
01:11:00,943 --> 01:11:02,594
This place is pretty cool, right?

1153
01:11:03,771 --> 01:11:04,772
Yeah.

1154
01:11:07,298 --> 01:11:08,557
Right, cool.

1155
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:11,800
I let you work.

1156
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:32,917
I know you're there.

1157
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:37,623
You know what I'm stuck on.

1158
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,960
That thing you said with the spaghetti.

1159
01:11:40,298 --> 01:11:43,438
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

1160
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:46,731
<i>TO BW FROM YOUR FRIEND ALFRED</i>
- You had an Alfred.

1161
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:48,542
My Bruce has an Alfred.

1162
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:50,542
Different worlds. Different times.

1163
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:52,936
Yet, there it is.

1164
01:11:53,037 --> 01:11:54,373
Certain people.

1165
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:56,291
Certain events.

1166
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,544
Certain strands of spaghetti.

1167
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:02,042
Drawn to each other like, like magnets.

1168
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:07,950
I've read all about temporal paradoxes and causal loops, but...

1169
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,166
This is more than that.

1170
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:14,254
Inevitable intersections or something none of
the theories could have anticipated, because...

1171
01:12:14,355 --> 01:12:18,329
well, how do you explain that, except for...

1172
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:20,176
fate.

1173
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:22,296
You are listening.

1174
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,065
I'm sorry about your parents.

1175
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,114
I was trying to save mine.

1176
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,078
And there must be a way.

1177
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:34,796
There is a way Barry. 
Keep trying, keep trying.

1178
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:14,317

1179
01:13:18,265 --> 01:13:19,596
I found it.

1180
01:13:19,697 --> 01:13:21,242
Barry, wake up.

1181
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,148
- Clark is being held by a mercenary group...
<i>ASTEROID IMPACT... ALIEN LIFE ON BOARD...</i>

1182
01:13:23,249 --> 01:13:25,472

<i>RECOVERED FOR INVESTIGATION... SIBERIA...</i>

1183
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:26,400
Get up Barry.

1184
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:28,536
My cat is on fire.

1185
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:29,677
We're going to Russia.

1186
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,451

1188
01:13:37,392 --> 01:13:39,058
How will we get to Russia?

1189
01:14:16,106 --> 01:14:18,368
I'm going to help you find Superman.

1190
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,683
And then...

1191
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:20,835
you are on your own.

1192
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:25,190
Yeah...

1193
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:27,441
You're...

1194
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:29,265
you are.

1195
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:34,916
Yeah.

1196
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,752
I'm Batman.

1197
01:15:25,371 --> 01:15:26,640
So what's the plan?

1198
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:30,093
Let's go to what? Take out Superman and escape before it turns ugly?

1199
01:15:30,195 --> 01:15:31,196
I don't know.

1200
01:15:31,431 --> 01:15:33,021
You should ask him.

1201
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:35,577
- You ask him. 
- You should ask him.

1202
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:36,366
Yeah

1203
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:37,247
I am not asking him.

1204
01:15:37,461 --> 01:15:38,916
Why not? I thought Batman
was supposed to be a friend.

1205
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:40,554
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1206
01:15:40,844 --> 01:15:41,406
We're here.

1207
01:15:41,507 --> 01:15:43,424

Ejector seat.

Ejector seat?

1211
01:15:56,903 --> 01:15:57,976
Okay, there are stages.

1212
01:15:59,873 --> 01:16:01,829
You are strapped to parachutes.

1213
01:16:04,248 --> 01:16:05,679
And where is yours?

1214
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:18,251
This is so super.

1215
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:39,724
All clear. Let's move

1216
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,246
OK.

1217
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:05,995
GOOD.

1218
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:07,964
Everybody is fast now.

1219
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:09,266
But why is it so cold?

1220
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:10,841
It's the arctic, Barry.

1221
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:14,291
Where did he go?

1222
01:17:14,392 --> 01:17:16,255
I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1223
01:17:21,378 --> 01:17:23,390
Superman will be down there, for sure.

1224
01:18:06,451 --> 01:18:07,452
OK.

1225
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:35,876
What did you do?

1226
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,550
- I had to move you. 
- But I just did it a little.

1227
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:48,547
This may hurt.

1228
01:18:57,298 --> 01:18:58,366
Just let it out.

1229
01:19:35,362 --> 01:19:36,363
Let's go.

1230
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,683
That's where they keep Superman.

1231
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:47,912

We gotta go.

1241
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:05,159
Wait.

Look at her.

You go.

What's the plan?

1273
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:49,526
Batman, what do we do? What now?

1274
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:57,128
Now... we try not to die.

1275
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,726
Oh, you guys should have seen that in slo-mo.

1276
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:38,669
Yeah, I just realized I didn't think it through very well.

1277
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,094
There are good Kryptonians and there are very, very bad Kryptonians.

1278
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,924
<i>ALIEN CRAFT SUSPENDED OVER US AIR FORCE</i>

1279
01:26:45,025 --> 01:26:46,841
I was sure we would find Superman.

1280
01:26:46,942 --> 01:26:50,083
And if we found Superman, all this would be super simple...

1281
01:26:50,215 --> 01:26:50,810
Who are you?

1282
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,014
Holy funions.

1283
01:26:54,178 --> 01:26:55,179
Hi.

1284
01:26:55,618 --> 01:26:57,046
- I'm Barry. 
- We're Barry.

1285
01:26:57,739 --> 01:27:00,077
We were were trying to find Kal-El.

1286
01:27:00,294 --> 01:27:02,122
But, we found you instead.

1287
01:27:02,223 --> 01:27:03,224
What do you want with Kal-El?

1288
01:27:03,743 --> 01:27:05,245
We were trying to rescue him.

1289
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:06,347
Why?

1290
01:27:07,043 --> 01:27:09,150
Because he is my friend.

1291
01:27:09,946 --> 01:27:11,306
Do you know him?

1292
01:27:11,407 --> 01:27:13,130
She looks angry. Get ready.

1293
01:27:13,231 --> 01:27:15,695
It could shoot laser beams at us or freeze us...

1294
01:27:15,796 --> 01:27:17,607
with your breath not start throwing us.

1295
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:18,863
My name is Kara.

1296
01:27:19,497 --> 01:27:20,855
Daughter of Zor-El.

1297
01:27:21,598 --> 01:27:23,051
Kal-El was my cousin.

1298
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:24,586
Yes, but who was Kal-El?

1299
01:27:24,692 --> 01:27:25,517
It's Superman.

1300
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:27,003
No, you said it was Clark.

1301
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:28,141
Who is Clark?

1302
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:31,102
Clark is his human name.

1303
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,621
Clark.

1304
01:27:35,706 --> 01:27:37,609
He was an infant when we left.

1305
01:27:39,108 --> 01:27:41,190
The last son of Krypton. I...

1306
01:27:42,685 --> 01:27:44,417
I was sent to protect him.

1307
01:27:44,518 --> 01:27:47,521
It looks like he never made it to Earth in this Universe.

1308
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:50,600
Our pods, They must have separated.

1309
01:27:50,745 --> 01:27:54,713
Wait, so you thought a baby was
gonna protect us from this Zod guy?

1310
01:27:54,814 --> 01:27:56,304
General Zod is here?

1311
01:27:56,643 --> 01:27:58,326
He must have tracked my pod's signal.

1312
01:27:58,427 --> 01:27:59,428
I have to go.

1313
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:00,734
No, don't wait.

1314
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:03,097
You have to regain your strength.

1315
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,380
Hey Barry,

1316
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:05,762
take her to the roof...

1317
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:07,704
and put her into the sun.

1318
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:09,097
Yeah

1319
01:28:09,448 --> 01:28:10,727
Yeah, wherever you like it...

1320
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:14,531
If you charge it with sunlight, I congratulate you because I have tried.

1321
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,103
How about we take that with us?

1322
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:32,323
Can I turn around now?

1323
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:37,215
Are you dresssed in a red cape?

1324
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:45,351
You're levitating?

1325
01:28:53,046 --> 01:28:54,560
Is there always so much noise?

1326
01:28:57,335 --> 01:28:58,962
Is there a lot of noise?

1327
01:28:59,323 --> 01:29:00,461
Are you okay?

1328
01:29:00,562 --> 01:29:02,046
Do you feel how...

1329
01:29:02,664 --> 01:29:04,185
strong or...

1330
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:12,362
Yes. It seems that you are already strong.

1331
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:15,298
You know, Grandpa Barry down there...

1332
01:29:15,399 --> 01:29:20,090
He says that if we don't stop Captain Zod, he will kill thousands of people.

1333
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:21,291
Billions of people.

1334
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:22,519
Billions?

1335
01:29:24,549 --> 01:29:25,759
All of your people.

1336
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,546
Good people.

1337
01:29:26,647 --> 01:29:27,648
Good people?

1338
01:29:28,784 --> 01:29:32,417
We came to this planet
looking for a safe place to live.

1339
01:29:32,518 --> 01:29:34,038
And they put me in a cage.

1340
01:29:34,756 --> 01:29:36,941
Yes. A lot of humans are dicks.

1341
01:29:37,498 --> 01:29:41,293
But, there are also babies and...

1342
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:43,863
balerinas and entertainemnt wrestlers.

1343
01:29:43,964 --> 01:29:45,187
Many are worth saving.

1344
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,036
Maybe for you.

1345
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:50,875
But I am not human.

1346
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:53,469
I am Kryptonian.

1347
01:29:57,027 --> 01:29:58,459
She's gone.

1348
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,691
I have to get my powers back.

1349
01:30:03,259 --> 01:30:05,804
If I can recreate the accident that gave me my powers...

1350
01:30:05,905 --> 01:30:07,460
I could reconnect with the speed force...

1351
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,173
and maybe we'd stand a chance against Zod.

1352
01:30:10,684 --> 01:30:12,814
Or, kill yourself in the process.

1353
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,151
Tell me something...

1354
01:30:18,768 --> 01:30:20,344
If you get your powers back...

1355
01:30:20,884 --> 01:30:22,220
you could go anywhere.

1356
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:23,322
To another time line.

1357
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:24,882
To another universe.

1358
01:30:25,393 --> 01:30:29,071
Why do you wanna stay and fight to save this one?

1359
01:30:29,827 --> 01:30:31,988
Because it is the Earth where my mom lives.

1360
01:30:32,763 --> 01:30:33,764
They...

1361
01:30:35,408 --> 01:30:37,178
I went back in time to save her.

1362
01:30:38,203 --> 01:30:39,718
I'm not going to lose her again.

1363
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:41,663
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1364
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,914
How do you tell someone something like that?

1365
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,525
I lost my parents, but...

1366
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:54,798
that pain...

1367
01:30:58,794 --> 01:31:00,140
made me who I am.

1368
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:01,892
I'm not sure I know where I am without it,..

1369
01:31:01,993 --> 01:31:02,994
actually.

1370
01:31:07,088 --> 01:31:08,858
I spent a lifetime...

1371
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:13,145
trying to right wrongs of the past.

1372
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:18,235
Believing that wearing a cape and fighting crime...

1373
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:20,407
would bring my parents back.

1374
01:31:26,179 --> 01:31:27,534
You actually did it.

1375
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:29,826
So...

1376
01:31:30,326 --> 01:31:31,633
I guess the plan...

1377
01:31:31,864 --> 01:31:35,908
is douse yourself in industrial chemicals, while electrocuting yourself.

1378
01:31:36,245 --> 01:31:37,536
Yap

1379
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:42,571
Want some help?

1380
01:31:44,569 --> 01:31:46,574
Oh yeah. That would be very useful.

1381
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:48,610
In fact, he already borrowed his...

1382
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:51,988
and I'm sitting in this chair.

1383
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:53,945
I'm advancing.

1384
01:32:05,314 --> 01:32:08,143
- Understood. 
- Lima-Zebra, in sight.

1385
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:16,917
- This is the main group B601. - Primary team, confirm your ranks.

1386
01:32:35,807 --> 01:32:37,252
All emphasize.

1387
01:32:39,747 --> 01:32:41,599
You bring me nothing.

1388
01:32:43,594 --> 01:32:45,364
I gave you a warning.

1389
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:48,632
Your failure to deliver the Kryptonian traitor,

1390
01:32:48,733 --> 01:32:50,704
is been taken as an act of war.

1391
01:32:56,418 --> 01:32:57,419
No.

1392
01:32:58,711 --> 01:33:00,581
We need air support.

1393
01:33:29,173 --> 01:33:29,693
OK.

1394
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:31,277
When I flip the switch...

1395
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:34,987
the current will travel through the cable and will attract lightning directly.

1396
01:33:35,205 --> 01:33:36,485
Here, put that on.

1397
01:33:36,685 --> 01:33:38,456
It's heat and impact resistant.

1398
01:33:38,557 --> 01:33:39,558
I'll protect you a bit.

1399
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:42,201
Yes, but the point is for me not be protected.

1400
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,751
OK.

1401
01:33:47,448 --> 01:33:49,876
- You will have to move away. 
- I will.

1402
01:33:54,413 --> 01:33:55,639
To electrocute us.

1403
01:34:01,434 --> 01:34:02,620
It's going to work, right?

1404
01:34:03,021 --> 01:34:04,476
Of course it will work.

1405
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,342
Nothing we haven't done before.

1406
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:08,216
Beside, this time we have Batman.

1407
01:34:08,317 --> 01:34:09,345
What could go wrong?

1408
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,876
For the record, I think this is insane.

1409
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:15,283
Get back

1410
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,765
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1411
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:33,251
We meet again, Mr. Lightning.

1412
01:34:40,468 --> 01:34:41,713
Do it!

1413
01:35:03,702 --> 01:35:05,219
Wait. What, no!

1414
01:35:05,419 --> 01:35:07,628
No. Stop, stop it. No.

1415
01:35:14,185 --> 01:35:15,517
Oh no. No.

1416
01:35:15,745 --> 01:35:16,746
Oh, no.

1417
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,996
Barry, no.

1418
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,181
Go again.

1419
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:25,106
But...

1420
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:26,722
please.

1421
01:35:34,408 --> 01:35:35,942
The circuit is fried.

1422
01:36:34,202 --> 01:36:35,673
I've got you.

1423
01:37:07,285 --> 01:37:09,263
Hey Barry.

1424
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:12,639
You're fine like the last time, right?

1425
01:37:12,945 --> 01:37:13,946
Now you have to heal.

1426
01:37:32,204 --> 01:37:36,120
Look, look, look. It's working. It works, it works.

1427
01:37:36,221 --> 01:37:38,448
Hey, it's healing, it's healing.

1428
01:37:38,678 --> 01:37:40,658
What a relief that you are well.

1429
01:37:40,759 --> 01:37:42,734
I was scared to death.

1430
01:38:26,557 --> 01:38:27,849
Did you wake up?

1431
01:38:28,163 --> 01:38:29,437
How do you feel?

1432
01:38:30,193 --> 01:38:31,194
Slow.

1433
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,281
Maybe this will help.

1434
01:38:46,376 --> 01:38:48,412
Yes. Hey, you look good.

1435
01:38:48,513 --> 01:38:49,674
Irresistible.

1436
01:38:49,893 --> 01:38:51,450
Man. Feels good to be back.

1437
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:52,552
Yeah.

1438
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,509
And what are we wearing tonight?

1439
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:55,182
Do you like it?

1440
01:38:55,283 --> 01:38:57,417
I did it myself in that old batsuit.

1441
01:38:57,719 --> 01:38:59,925
But I did it with our colors and everything.

1442
01:39:00,026 --> 01:39:01,027
And look at this.

1443
01:39:02,852 --> 01:39:04,115
Less adjusted.

1444
01:39:06,522 --> 01:39:07,523
Flashy.

1445
01:39:08,677 --> 01:39:11,373
Hey, are you serious?

1446
01:39:11,507 --> 01:39:17,559
I really don't know what Flashy means.

1447
01:39:17,693 --> 01:39:19,030
Sounds like a positive thing.

1448
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:20,531
What are you doing?

1449
01:39:23,575 --> 01:39:24,593
You came back.

1450
01:39:24,694 --> 01:39:26,160
I'm glad you're okay.

1451
01:39:26,841 --> 01:39:28,213
I have to ask you something.

1452
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:32,158
When you found me in the hole they put me in...

1453
01:39:33,435 --> 01:39:35,566
and you saw that it wasn't Kal-El...

1454
01:39:37,696 --> 01:39:39,587
Why did you help me?

1455
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:41,233
Because you needed help.

1456
01:39:43,991 --> 01:39:45,586
Do you know what this symbol stands for?

1457
01:39:46,786 --> 01:39:47,647
Supergirl?

1458
01:39:47,883 --> 01:39:48,993
It means hope, right?

1459
01:39:49,094 --> 01:39:50,484
Hope. Does it mean hope?

1460
01:39:51,305 --> 01:39:54,293
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1461
01:39:56,007 --> 01:39:58,082
We are a people of hope.

1462
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,643
Not war.

1463
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:01,993
General Zod...

1464
01:40:02,216 --> 01:40:04,162
<i>We broadcast live from Metropolis, where a few moments ago...</i>

1465
01:40:04,263 --> 01:40:06,764
- Zod is maybe from Krypton,
<i>THE ALIEN SHIP HOVERS OVER METROPOLIS</i>

1466
01:40:06,865 --> 01:40:09,479
but he is not of my people.

1467
01:40:09,705 --> 01:40:11,967
So, you're saying...

1468
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:13,069
Yes.

1469
01:40:13,767 --> 01:40:15,301
I will help you fight Zod.

1470
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,305
Yes.

1471
01:40:20,024 --> 01:40:21,968
An interesting group.

1472
01:40:22,255 --> 01:40:25,818
What did you say our names were?

1473
01:40:26,262 --> 01:40:28,113
We're The Justice League.

1474
01:40:28,329 --> 01:40:28,891
No.

1475
01:40:28,992 --> 01:40:29,588
No?

1476
01:40:29,689 --> 01:40:31,707
Well, I mean.

1477
01:40:33,344 --> 01:40:36,215
We are going to lack an authentic Goddess and...

1478
01:40:36,442 --> 01:40:38,026
a friendly Terminator...

1479
01:40:38,243 --> 01:40:39,464
a super mermaid...

1480
01:40:39,964 --> 01:40:42,204
and it would be very nice to have a Batman.

1481
01:40:45,345 --> 01:40:46,346
You're in?

1482
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:53,486
Do you want to get nuts?

1483
01:40:55,394 --> 01:40:56,615
Let's get nuts.

1484
01:41:10,056 --> 01:41:12,705
In my world, Superman appeared just as Zod called out to him.

1485
01:41:12,806 --> 01:41:14,926
So from now on we are in unknown territory.

1486
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:17,329
What I do know is that Zod controls...

1487
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:18,863
somehow, the world engine that...

1488
01:41:18,964 --> 01:41:20,872
is going to destroy much more than just Metropolis...

1489
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,137
with every second that passes and let's not stop them.

1490
01:41:23,238 --> 01:41:24,318
Barry, what are you doing?

1491
01:41:24,675 --> 01:41:25,676
What?

1492
01:41:27,184 --> 01:41:28,631
Our kids will want to see this.

1493
01:41:28,732 --> 01:41:29,733
Your kids?

1494
01:41:31,757 --> 01:41:34,899
Well, the children of all the children of the whole world.

1495
01:41:35,023 --> 01:41:36,292
They will want to see this.

1496
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,801
We're getting close.

1497
01:41:40,098 --> 01:41:42,555
I will stay in flight to shoot down your ships in the air.

1498
01:41:42,656 --> 01:41:43,726
And Barry, to clear this up...

1499
01:41:43,827 --> 01:41:46,925
It means that it will only be you and me against the entire Kryptonian army.

1500
01:41:47,451 --> 01:41:48,101
Chill.

1501
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,542
Kara must be given time to defeat Zod.

1502
01:41:51,261 --> 01:41:53,890
Oh, and don't forget that your suit doesn't dissipate energy like mine...

1503
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:56,572
so you must take breaks or you will accumulate too much charge.

1504
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,981
Like what?

1505
01:42:19,124 --> 01:42:20,271
Hold on.

1506
01:42:25,747 --> 01:42:27,187
The humans we came to protect?

1507
01:42:27,405 --> 01:42:29,178
They don't know we're on their side.

1508
01:43:04,309 --> 01:43:05,310
Zod.

1509
01:43:14,674 --> 01:43:15,818
Kara Zor-El.

1510
01:43:16,344 --> 01:43:17,794
We've been waiting for you.

1511
01:43:47,185 --> 01:43:49,815
Hey, that space giant...

1512
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:51,575
and Miss Murderer...

1513
01:43:51,676 --> 01:43:53,012
Are they also our responsibility?

1514
01:43:53,113 --> 01:43:55,033
Hey Hey hey. Don't think about them. Just calm down.

1515
01:43:55,213 --> 01:43:56,710
We'll start with those guys over there.

1516
01:43:57,013 --> 01:43:58,940
What if they're Kryptonians and we can't kill them.

1517
01:43:59,041 --> 01:44:00,968
But we can stop them, so she can take them down.

1518
01:44:01,069 --> 01:44:02,070
One at a time.

1519
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:06,224
Okay, I disarm them and then you engage.

1520
01:44:08,347 --> 01:44:09,712
Punch them!

1521
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,851
Come on, Barbie!

1522
01:44:12,815 --> 01:44:13,935
Let's go party?

1523
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:23,049
OK.

1524
01:44:31,347 --> 01:44:33,703
Hey, calm down. you are fine Get up.

1525
01:44:33,836 --> 01:44:35,404
Wow, they are seriously fast.

1526
01:44:35,537 --> 01:44:37,079
Yes, but not as much as us.

1527
01:44:40,764 --> 01:44:42,780
The terraforming has begun.

1528
01:44:43,024 --> 01:44:46,711
This world must die, so that ours can revive.

1529
01:44:55,211 --> 01:44:58,194
We have to go. Let's go Danny. Run! Run!

1530
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:01,268
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1531
01:45:01,501 --> 01:45:03,951
Your uncle Jor-El...

1532
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:08,449
hid the key to Krypton's rebirth...

1533
01:45:09,586 --> 01:45:12,048
inside a Kryptonian child.

1534
01:45:12,149 --> 01:45:15,988
All the genetic material needed to start again.

1535
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,034
Encoded inside the DNA...

1536
01:45:18,135 --> 01:45:20,585
and sent to Earth in an escape pod.

1537
01:45:20,712 --> 01:45:22,764
He's not here. You have failed.

1538
01:45:23,926 --> 01:45:25,331
We found him.

1539
01:45:26,918 --> 01:45:28,926
We intercepted his pod.

1540
01:45:31,162 --> 01:45:33,923
But your cousin was not the one we needed.

1541
01:45:35,554 --> 01:45:37,051
You are the one.

1542
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,282
Kara Zor-El.

1543
01:45:39,383 --> 01:45:42,541
It is your blood, which we must harvest.

1544
01:45:42,642 --> 01:45:43,930
What did you do to Kal-El?

1545
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:48,797
Your sacrifice, that will allow Krypton to live again.

1546
01:45:48,911 --> 01:45:50,457
What did you do to?!

1547
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:56,392
The infant did not survive.

1548
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:31,288
Look, new plan.

1549
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:33,005
I'm going to create a cyclonic diversion...

1550
01:46:33,106 --> 01:46:34,689
and then you just come in hard...

1551
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:35,791
feet first this time.

1552
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,711
Yes!

1553
01:46:53,362 --> 01:46:54,663
Barry, did you see that?

1554
01:46:54,764 --> 01:46:56,597
Careful, you are accumulating a lot of charge.

1555
01:46:58,192 --> 01:47:00,005
Why don't I just singe it?

1556
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:02,349
No no no no.

1557
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:32,816
Barry, that was actually only half stupid.

1558
01:47:32,935 --> 01:47:34,812
But if you want to do that and not die...

1559
01:47:35,024 --> 01:47:39,185
You need to complete the circuit, by putting your hands together, like this.

1560
01:47:41,981 --> 01:47:43,091
oh shit

1561
01:47:44,887 --> 01:47:45,888

I've been hit.

1576
01:49:20,751 --> 01:49:21,752
Bruce, do you copy?

1577
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,583
Where is Kara?

1578
01:49:23,684 --> 01:49:24,685
You go find her.

1579
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,554
Bruce.

1580
01:49:31,538 --> 01:49:33,545
<i>Ejection system failing.</i>

1581
01:49:33,646 --> 01:49:35,702
<i>Ejection system failing.</i>

1582
01:50:15,115 --> 01:50:16,766
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1583
01:50:22,367 --> 01:50:23,405
I'm going down.

1584
01:50:28,717 --> 01:50:29,945
But I'm not going alone.

1585
01:50:30,046 --> 01:50:31,151
No no no no.

1586
01:50:31,353 --> 01:50:32,354
Bruce.

1587
01:50:32,477 --> 01:50:34,150
Bruce, eject.

1588
01:50:34,251 --> 01:50:35,252
Bruce, you must eject.

1589
01:50:42,907 --> 01:50:43,908
No

1590
01:50:55,814 --> 01:50:56,815
Kara.

1591
01:51:03,245 --> 01:51:04,790
This shouldn't...

1592
01:51:06,952 --> 01:51:08,620
This was not supposed to happen.

1593
01:51:14,674 --> 01:51:15,675
Kara is dead.

1594
01:51:16,144 --> 01:51:17,145
And Batman.

1595
01:51:17,642 --> 01:51:19,002
It didn't have to be, right?

1596
01:51:19,698 --> 01:51:21,744
Because we can go back.

1597
01:51:22,155 --> 01:51:22,970
Like you did.

1598
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:24,313
You're not that fast yet.

1599
01:51:24,437 --> 01:51:25,438
Are you sure?

1600
01:51:28,371 --> 01:51:29,372
Barry.

1601
01:51:30,664 --> 01:51:31,665
Barry, wait!

1602
01:51:45,438 --> 01:51:46,911
Is this back enough?

1603
01:51:47,215 --> 01:51:48,648
Yeah, I guess so.

1604
01:51:55,143 --> 01:51:56,629
Listen, Barry.

1605
01:51:58,199 --> 01:51:59,200
What?

1606
01:51:59,411 --> 01:52:01,251
It's ok, we can fix this.

1607
01:52:02,308 --> 01:52:03,224
Do you know what to change?

1608
01:52:03,325 --> 01:52:04,478
I know I will change.

1609
01:52:09,658 --> 01:52:11,366
I'm going after the big one.

1610
01:52:13,724 --> 01:52:16,007
Bruce aborts, the ship has a protection shield.

1611
01:52:16,126 --> 01:52:17,127
Roger that.

1612
01:52:20,742 --> 01:52:21,743
But he's not.

1613
01:52:23,015 --> 01:52:24,514
GOOD.

1614
01:52:24,615 --> 01:52:26,351
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1615
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:08,830
Yes.

1616
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:06,005
Here I am. Here I am.

1617
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:09,421
No.

1618
01:55:10,046 --> 01:55:11,047
Hey...

1619
01:55:11,924 --> 01:55:12,994
You will be ok.

1620
01:55:13,559 --> 01:55:14,560
Not this time, kid.

1621
01:55:17,384 --> 01:55:19,462
Maybe some other time.

1622
01:55:25,147 --> 01:55:27,197
We can't bring you back, can we?

1623
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,384
You already did.

1624
01:55:31,803 --> 01:55:33,584
You already did it...

1625
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:45,398
Come on, Barry.

1626
01:55:46,221 --> 01:55:47,816
Gotta get up. Come on.

1627
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:48,513
Barry.

1628
01:55:48,625 --> 01:55:49,626
Go again.

1629
01:55:57,189 --> 01:55:58,320
Let's go.

1630
01:55:58,739 --> 01:55:59,985
Barry, there is no point.

1631
01:56:03,008 --> 01:56:04,009
Barry.

1632
01:56:24,355 --> 01:56:26,205
Phase!

1633
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:33,000
I have to get that out.

1634
01:56:33,243 --> 01:56:35,077
- No no. I have to get that out. 
- I'm fine.

1635
01:56:35,178 --> 01:56:36,560
This must have been before.

1636
01:56:54,147 --> 01:56:55,148
Again.

1637
01:56:57,051 --> 01:56:58,052
Barry.

1638
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:08,584
OK. Can we please just take a minute?

1639
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:09,968
Sorry.

1640
01:57:10,069 --> 01:57:11,515
Bro, of course.

1641
01:57:11,864 --> 01:57:14,786
That's the whole thing. 
We can take as much time as it takes.

1642
01:57:15,408 --> 01:57:16,805
No. that's not what I mean.

1643
01:57:16,906 --> 01:57:17,907
Hey hey.

1644
01:57:38,826 --> 01:57:40,350
OK. Ready?

1645
01:57:40,651 --> 01:57:41,189
Come on.

1646
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:42,291
I need you in there.

1647
01:57:42,643 --> 01:57:44,326
- Let's go. 
- Barry, just listen to me.

1648
01:58:02,932 --> 01:58:03,902
Where were you?

1649
01:58:04,031 --> 01:58:05,924
Did you stay here the whole time?

1650
01:58:06,035 --> 01:58:08,922
Barry, this is an inevitable intersection.

1651
01:58:09,023 --> 01:58:10,685
You have to stop now. Barry!

1652
01:58:26,259 --> 01:58:27,391
At Barry, wait.

1653
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:34,796
Barry, listen.

1654
01:58:35,473 --> 01:58:37,173
There's someting I should tell you.

1655
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,653
I went back in time initially.

1656
01:58:42,117 --> 01:58:42,751
Because...

1657
01:58:42,852 --> 01:58:44,228
Yes, because mom died.

1658
01:58:44,837 --> 01:58:46,112
And how do you know?

1659
01:58:46,213 --> 01:58:48,277
It doesn't matter.

1660
01:58:48,973 --> 01:58:50,987
I have to undo what I did.

1661
01:58:51,879 --> 01:58:53,642
No, it's not a mistake.

1662
01:58:53,772 --> 01:58:54,773
We can save her.

1663
01:58:55,202 --> 01:58:56,336
And we can save them.

1664
01:58:56,437 --> 01:58:57,490
No, we can't.

1665
01:58:58,292 --> 01:59:00,454
This is what Bruce was talking about.

1666
01:59:00,876 --> 01:59:02,171
Barry, this is inevitable.

1667
01:59:02,272 --> 01:59:05,602
We can try a million times, 
and we are not able to fix this.

1668
01:59:06,402 --> 01:59:07,605
No matter what we do.

1669
01:59:08,497 --> 01:59:12,268
This world, dies, today.

1670
01:59:13,293 --> 01:59:14,616
Look around.

1671
01:59:18,622 --> 01:59:20,701
Look at the damage we're causing.

1672
01:59:26,607 --> 01:59:28,930
Now we have to stop, okay?

1673
01:59:29,431 --> 01:59:31,128
Look, I was just doing my laundry.

1674
01:59:31,229 --> 01:59:32,378
You were the one who came.

1675
01:59:32,479 --> 01:59:34,024
and told me I am a superhero.

1676
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:37,757
And now you're saying what? 
You don't want me to be.

1677
01:59:37,881 --> 01:59:40,010
Well guess what...

1678
01:59:40,581 --> 01:59:42,353
I am...

1679
01:59:43,396 --> 01:59:44,397
The Flash.

1680
01:59:44,759 --> 01:59:46,576
And I can save everyone.

1681
01:59:47,032 --> 01:59:48,117
Nobody dies.

1682
01:59:48,446 --> 01:59:49,447
Barry...

1683
01:59:51,393 --> 01:59:53,324
Not every problem has a solution.

1684
02:00:01,996 --> 02:00:04,078
<i>Not every problem has a solution.</i>

1685
02:00:08,285 --> 02:00:09,796
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1686
02:00:09,897 --> 02:00:11,687
<i>Sometimes you just have to let go.</i>

1687
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:14,204
Let go? From mom?

1688
02:00:14,807 --> 02:00:18,566
She will always be alive somewhere in time.

1689
02:00:19,264 --> 02:00:20,423
Always.

1690
02:00:21,064 --> 02:00:22,724
Not for us.

1691
02:00:23,315 --> 02:00:24,842
You are full of shit, dude.

1692
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:26,511
I'm going back.

1693
02:00:26,642 --> 02:00:28,615
You'll going back to kill Mom.

1694
02:00:28,837 --> 02:00:29,838
No!

1695
02:00:30,121 --> 02:00:31,122
You stay!

1696
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:33,844
You stay. Right here.

1697
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:36,354
Just give me one more time.

1698
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:38,707
Barry, wait!

1699
02:01:12,451 --> 02:01:14,110
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1700
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,481
Let's start again.

1701
02:01:15,786 --> 02:01:16,787
I am The Flash.

1702
02:01:17,316 --> 02:01:18,439
What's your name?

1703
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,897
I've lived...

1704
02:01:20,988 --> 02:01:23,112
more than you can dream.

1705
02:01:23,213 --> 02:01:24,668
Not an answer.

1706
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:26,885
Did you rehearse that?

1707
02:01:34,182 --> 02:01:35,183
Get outta here, Barry!

1708
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:51,930
That scar.

1709
02:01:53,352 --> 02:01:54,692
Oh my god.

1710
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:57,039
So, you are...

1711
02:01:57,682 --> 02:02:00,852
Yes, I am you.

1712
02:02:03,897 --> 02:02:05,406
We are so close.

1713
02:02:06,066 --> 02:02:07,587
I almost have it figured out.

1714
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:10,728
How long have you been doing this?

1715
02:02:10,829 --> 02:02:12,815
Time is inconsequential.

1716
02:02:13,544 --> 02:02:15,480
Come on, Barry.

1717
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:26,515
<i>In the sky! It's a bird!</i>

1718
02:02:26,616 --> 02:02:27,870
<i>It's a plane!</i>

1719
02:02:27,971 --> 02:02:29,459
<i>It's Superman!</i>

1720
02:02:29,762 --> 02:02:31,602
<i>The Adventures of Superman (George Reeves, 1951)</i>

1721
02:02:37,057 --> 02:02:39,781
<i>Jay Garrick / Black Flash (Teddy Sears, 2015)</i>

1722
02:02:55,087 --> 02:02:58,593
<i>Superman - The Movie (Christopher Reeve, 1978)</i>

1723
02:02:58,751 --> 02:03:02,381
<i>Supergirl (Helen Slater, 1984)</i>

1724
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:13,663
<i>Completely foolproof!</i>

1725
02:03:15,027 --> 02:03:17,136
<i>Only the Joker would come up with that.</i>

1726
02:03:45,929 --> 02:03:49,154
<i>Superman Lives (Nicolas Cage, 1998)</i>

1727
02:03:55,229 --> 02:03:57,862
Please look at what's happening.

1728
02:03:58,665 --> 02:04:00,191
These worlds.

1729
02:04:09,188 --> 02:04:11,098
They are colliding and collapsing.

1730
02:04:13,174 --> 02:04:14,199
We did this.

1731
02:04:16,593 --> 02:04:18,755
We are destroying the fabric of everything.

1732
02:04:20,986 --> 02:04:22,368
You have to stop.

1733
02:04:22,469 --> 02:04:25,009
I'll stop when I fixed it.

1734
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:29,920
It's not entirely your fault, Barry.

1735
02:04:30,034 --> 02:04:33,071
I pushed you out of chronospace that September 29th...

1736
02:04:33,189 --> 02:04:35,375
for you to put me on this path.

1737
02:04:36,631 --> 02:04:39,006
How do you like our endless paradox?

1738
02:04:39,346 --> 02:04:41,683
I made you create me.

1739
02:04:42,555 --> 02:04:44,231
And now you are the one...

1740
02:04:45,217 --> 02:04:46,302
in my way.

1741
02:04:47,282 --> 02:04:49,705
No matter how close I get to winning this fight.

1742
02:04:50,238 --> 02:04:53,956
You go back and let mom die.

1743
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,844
You are the inevitable intersection.

1744
02:04:57,136 --> 02:04:58,446
I need you after let go.

1745
02:04:59,271 --> 02:05:01,148
What's he talking about?

1746
02:05:02,549 --> 02:05:03,710
You are my hero.

1747
02:05:17,212 --> 02:05:18,213
What did you do?

1748
02:05:19,504 --> 02:05:21,037
Hey, hey, don't worry.

1749
02:05:21,138 --> 02:05:23,001
It's gonna heal. 
It's gonna heal.

1750
02:05:23,928 --> 02:05:25,681
I just wanted, that...

1751
02:05:40,917 --> 02:05:41,918
Barry.

1752
02:05:42,708 --> 02:05:44,602
Tell mom that I love her.

1753
02:06:55,965 --> 02:06:57,175
Don't forget the tomato.

1754
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:12,745
I loved that cereal, when I was a kid.

1755
02:07:13,362 --> 02:07:14,416
Yeah.

1756
02:07:15,034 --> 02:07:16,835
My son was mad for it.

1757
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:22,299
They stopped making it.

1758
02:07:22,529 --> 02:07:25,614
I know that they were talking about discontinuing it.

1759
02:07:25,715 --> 02:07:26,395
Do I know you?

1760
02:07:26,496 --> 02:07:27,885
No, I'm not from around here.

1761
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:30,059
I'm just visiting my mom.

1762
02:07:30,655 --> 02:07:31,695
Maybe I know her.

1763
02:07:31,872 --> 02:07:32,873
What's her name?

1764
02:07:33,982 --> 02:07:35,497
She's the best.

1765
02:07:36,856 --> 02:07:38,701
The kindest person in the world.

1766
02:07:38,843 --> 02:07:39,476
Are you okay?

1767
02:07:39,777 --> 02:07:40,848
Yeah, it's just...

1768
02:07:41,706 --> 02:07:42,954
I'm really gonna miss her.

1769
02:08:03,929 --> 02:08:07,576
I know I'm just a random lady in the store...

1770
02:08:07,677 --> 02:08:08,786
But do you want a hug?

1771
02:08:09,964 --> 02:08:10,965
Sure.

1772
02:08:16,968 --> 02:08:17,969
I'm sorry.

1773
02:08:18,106 --> 02:08:19,978
Oh, don't say that.

1774
02:08:21,503 --> 02:08:24,466
Your mom must be grateful that you came to visit her.

1775
02:08:24,896 --> 02:08:27,077
She is very lucky to have you.

1776
02:08:34,342 --> 02:08:35,995
I'm really lucky to have her.

1777
02:08:36,436 --> 02:08:39,373
Ah,  you have to tell her that.

1778
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:41,775
Moms like to hear these kind of things.

1779
02:08:42,788 --> 02:08:43,834
Believe me.

1780
02:09:12,762 --> 02:09:13,910
<i>FROZEN FOOD</i>

1781
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:24,488
I love you, mom.

1782
02:09:31,872 --> 02:09:33,328
I love you more.

1783
02:09:35,522 --> 02:09:37,370
I loved you first.

1784
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:44,723
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1785
02:10:17,711 --> 02:10:18,712
I'm back.

1786
02:10:26,747 --> 02:10:29,277
I didn't know when you would return. See you in court. Iris.

1787
02:10:29,479 --> 02:10:30,731
Shit.

1788
02:10:31,070 --> 02:10:32,071
The court.

1789
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:43,619
The evidence initially...

1790
02:10:47,728 --> 02:10:48,362
I'm so sorry.

1791
02:10:48,463 --> 02:10:49,464
<i>JUDGE</i>

1792
02:10:52,673 --> 02:10:54,308
As I was saying.

1793
02:10:55,196 --> 02:10:59,296
The same security camera footage, Exhibit F, in the original trial...

1794
02:10:59,397 --> 02:11:01,148
was initially considered useless.

1795
02:11:01,564 --> 02:11:02,895
But has now...

1796
02:11:03,131 --> 02:11:04,796
been enhanced...

1797
02:11:04,916 --> 02:11:06,852
using the latest tech...

1798
02:11:07,187 --> 02:11:08,724
of Wayne Enterprises.

1799
02:11:09,521 --> 02:11:15,630
It confirms, the alibi, Mr. Allen has argued, and his son...

1800
02:11:15,761 --> 02:11:16,762
Barry...

1801
02:11:17,264 --> 02:11:20,541
was corroborated, since day one.

1802
02:11:26,038 --> 02:11:27,039
Here.

1803
02:11:29,954 --> 02:11:33,801
Right here you can clearly see my client Mr. Allen.

1804
02:11:34,389 --> 02:11:36,609
reaching for a can of tomatoes...

1805
02:11:37,452 --> 02:11:39,377
from the top shelf.

1806
02:11:55,862 --> 02:11:59,156
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, could you tell us a bit more about what happened, please?

1807
02:11:59,542 --> 02:12:00,704
Well the...

1808
02:12:01,804 --> 02:12:04,281
the tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to the top shelf...

1809
02:12:04,382 --> 02:12:07,496
and subsequently, uncooked the spaghetti.

1810
02:12:08,929 --> 02:12:09,930
Unquote.

1811
02:12:12,401 --> 02:12:13,924
I'm sorry that makes absolutely no sense.

1812
02:12:14,025 --> 02:12:15,033
What are you talking about Sir?

1813
02:12:15,134 --> 02:12:15,662
Thank you.

1814
02:12:15,784 --> 02:12:17,904
- The allegations... 
- Thank you so much.

1815
02:12:18,092 --> 02:12:20,151
See you later. Thank you.

1816
02:12:22,429 --> 02:12:23,659
Hey, was what I said right?

1817
02:12:23,794 --> 02:12:25,433
Yes. Spaghetti.

1818
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:29,756
Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking...

1819
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:32,975
You should ask me to dinner.

1820
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:35,003
Dinner with me?

1821
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,296
Yes. A date, Barry.

1822
02:12:37,397 --> 02:12:39,413
Iris West, do you want dinner date with me?

1823
02:12:40,339 --> 02:12:41,893
- I'd love to. 
- Thank you.

1824
02:12:42,459 --> 02:12:43,774
- I'd love to also.

1825
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:45,332

Congratulations.

1830
02:13:09,428 --> 02:13:11,767
You have no idea how big it is to hear your voice.

1831
02:13:12,962 --> 02:13:14,208
I have so much to tell you, the next time I see you.

1832
02:13:14,309 --> 02:13:15,310
Well, you were right.

1833
02:13:15,491 --> 02:13:16,691
Okay, and I didn't listen to you.

1834
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,985
And things got very, very weird.

1835
02:13:19,086 --> 02:13:20,726
But I put everything back. I promise.

1838
02:13:24,263 --> 02:13:25,983
To the side, to the side. Everyone please back.

1839
02:13:26,883 --> 02:13:28,409
I want to ask...

1840
02:13:29,816 --> 02:13:31,330

He will not answer questions.

1844
02:13:43,519 --> 02:13:44,520
Hi Barry.

1845
02:13:45,591 --> 02:13:46,957
No. Where is...

Your...

1847
02:13:49,128 --> 02:13:50,473
No, it can not be.

1848
02:13:51,214 --> 02:13:53,358
You're not Batman?

1849
02:13:55,875 --> 02:13:56,876
What's wrong with you?

1850
02:14:04,478 --> 02:14:05,479
What?

I tell you that because of my metabolism I can't get drunk.

1853
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,368
And I don't get bitter either.

Listen, listen.

1855
02:15:54,726 --> 02:15:57,843
Because... No, no, no, no. I try to
explain to you as simple as I can.

1856

I promise you.

1857
02:15:58,737 --> 02:16:00,985
All were Batman. Everyone was Bruce Wayne.

1858
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:03,269
But each was a very different person.

1859
02:16:03,370 --> 02:16:06,436
- So, in the other time... 
- Negative.

1860
02:16:06,647 --> 02:16:07,624
I am the same.

1861
02:16:07,725 --> 02:16:09,593
Yes, in fact more or less. You're adorable,

02:16:13,477 --> 02:16:14,478
OK. Hey...

1864
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:18,230
Thank you for making it
simpler for me, Mr. Simple.

1865
02:16:18,331 --> 02:16:19,332
I do what I can.

1866
02:16:19,784 --> 02:16:21,899
Hey, but you're not understanding me.

02:16:26,388 --> 02:16:27,828
Okay, up.

1869

Get up.

1870
02:16:29,896 --> 02:16:31,238
Get up now.

I live here.

1875
02:16:44,352 --> 02:16:45,353
OK.

1876
02:16:45,555 --> 02:16:46,556
What, what?

1877
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,289
More beer.

1878
02:16:49,717 --> 02:16:50,583
Go fast.

Yes. Yes, tell them that.

1883
02:17:03,066 --> 02:17:04,082
Yeah.

1884
02:17:04,624 --> 02:17:05,625
