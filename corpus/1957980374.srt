0
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,357
This shit hole?

1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Seriously?

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,803
This place gives me the heebie jeebies.

3
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,051
Look what I found.

4
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:02,890
No, thank you.

5
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,379
Don't mind if I do.

6
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,880
You're not drinking that.

7
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,509
Now, can someone please tell
me why we left Hader's pad

8
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,833
to come to this shit hole?

9
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,789
Would you rather still be there?

10
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,739
Listen to his bullshit stories

11
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,799
about how he's going to
Yale to save the world?

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,259
Yeah, at least we'd be getting high.

13
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,329
You know who else would be getting high?

14
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,269
Stone fox Ally.

15
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,949
Listen, Casanova.

16
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,229
You're not going to get
down her pants anyway.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,029
She thinks you're a prick.

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,469
She's just playing hard to get.

19
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,723
No, she really does
think you're a prick.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Told you.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,873
So are you going to tell us what happened?

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,989
Old man beat the shit out of her again.

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,029
He's not my old man.

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,863
All right.

25
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,219
Step old man.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,989
Why do you let him do that to you?

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,989
Can we just forget
about it and get serious?

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,549
What's the candle for?

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,403
We're gonna have a
orgy via candle light?

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,979
Yeah, that's it.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,689
So why don't you go upstairs

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,690
and wait till we're done and no peeking.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,693
Wait, are you serious?

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,699
Do you seriously have
to write everything down?

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,589
It helps my anxiety.

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,563
Plus, when I get older,

37
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,799
I can look back and see how I've changed.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,019
Trust me, to where you're going,

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,629
you're gonna be the same
old prude you are now.

40
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,009
Hey, I'm just waiting

41
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,439
for the right person
before I offer my body up.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,972
Speaking of offering bodies,

43
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,989
I have something that just
might spice up the evening.

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,990
Like what?

45
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:47,343
Oh, just something
to help pass the time.

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,769
Truth or dare?

47
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,209
Lame.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,170
Streaking?

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,170
Too cold.

50
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,619
Bloody Mary?

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,689
Does it look like we have a mirror?

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,523
No.

53
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:02,399
What I plan is to call
upon the servant of Satan.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,049
Servant of what?

55
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,269
You know, Satan's minion?

56
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,379
The one you call upon

57
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,603
when you wanna unleash hell on someone?

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,469
You think that's a good idea?

59
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,363
What's the matter? Scared?

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,299
Why would you even think of that?

61
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,290
Judging by the black eye,

62
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,913
it's not hard to figure out.

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,329
Sophie, there are other
ways to go about it.

64
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,009
Call the cops on him next time.

65
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,109
And have him free in just a few days?

66
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,159
No, thanks.

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,087
This will be more fun.

68
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:33,809
I don't want a demon
hanging out in my body.

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,409
Don't worry. It's all
voodoo garbage anyways.

70
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,959
Everyone hold hands and close your eyes.

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,189
Sophie.

72
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,713
Hold hands and close your eyes.

73
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,372
Hold on.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,556
Take a deep breath and clear your mind.

75
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,549
We summon these servants
to claim our bodies

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,419
to help unleash fury on
those who cause us harm.

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,819
Our bodies will be your bodies

78
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,679
and the souls you take shall be given

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,693
to your master for all eternity.

80
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,300
Come, thy loyal servant.

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,553
Awesome job. The servant
blew out the candle.

82
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,555
Were you writing this whole time?

83
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:37,556
Yeah.

84
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:40,139
You didn't even have your eyes closed.

85
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,869
If you messed this up,
this is all your fault.

86
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,919
Come on, guys.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,370
Let's pack it up and go home.

88
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,179
If you don't feel comfortable
going home tonight,

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,463
you can stay at my place.

90
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,989
Well, that was a bust.

91
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,335
It is pretty creepy.

92
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,836
You ready to go?

93
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:03,392
Sophie?

All right, ladies. Here we are.

105
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,669
Welcome to our personal party barn.

106
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,499
No need to worry about drinks.

107
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,029
Mama brought the good stuff.

108
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,249
Out of all the places for a reunion,

109
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,196
this is what you picked?

110
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,269
Yeah, seriously, what is this?

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,249
Does this place even have running water?

112
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,659
Come on, ladies.

113
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,579
Use your imagination.

114
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,759
Think of it as a
beautifully rustic getaway

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,229
with no one to bother us.

116
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,009
Yeah, until a crazed psycho
with a chainsaw arrives.

117
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,289
Yeah, Melissa, do you
realize how many horror movies

118
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,789
start with a bunch of girls drinking

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,989
in the middle of the woods?

120
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,819
Why can't we just get drunk at my place?

121
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,859
Because your place smells like ass.

122
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,169
Tell your dad to stop
smoking in the house.

123
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,799
Anyways, ladies, what is
with the lack of enthusiasm?

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,079
I don't see Trish complaining.

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,524
She doesn't even know
where she is right now.

126
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,029
I could have been at home
watching ALF right now.

127
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,909
What? I like electricity
and toilets that flush.

128
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,109
Trust me.

129
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,809
After a few drinks, it
won't matter where we are.

130
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,789
Well when are the guys getting here?

131
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,079
I didn't invite them.

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,089
Oh.

133
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,020
Bye.

134
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,070
Whoa, whoa, freeze!

135
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,009
I can't believe you guys.

136
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,883
I went through all this
trouble to get this place.

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
It's great work.

138
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:53,069
I thought it would be fun
to do something different.

139
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,659
Come on, can we just
go check this place out

140
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,310
before you losers decide to bail?

141
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,579
Fine.

142
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,249
Let's go check out the creepy murder barn.

143
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,659
That's the spirit.

144
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Come on.

145
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,593
Hey.

146
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,189
You know, when you agreed
to hang out with us tonight,

147
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,279
I thought that meant you would
actually hang out with us,

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,259
not just pretending we don't exist.

149
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,009
I told you it takes me a
minute to warm up to new people.

150
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,869
Okay, and you're gonna
get used to new people

151
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,243
by listening to ABBA by yourself?

152
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:29,410
I guess not.

153
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,949
Come on, we wanna
get to know you, Trish.

154
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,809
Trust me, I know what it's
like to move somewhere new

155
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,609
and not know anybody.

156
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,610
Let me help?

157
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,899
Great, this place is even
here spookier on the inside

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,733
than it is on the out.

159
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,749
Oh my God.

160
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,678
What is it?

161
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:50,511
Are you okay?

162
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,125
No.

163
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,419
What? Did you see something?

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,209
There's words written
on the wall in blood.

165
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,444
What do they say?

166
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,081
It says...

167
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:04,785
Gullible.

168
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:06,926
I got you, I got you.

169
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,181
And I got you.

170
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,182
Bitch.

171
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,449
Find anything cool?

172
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,589
Oh, nice.

173
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,999
What murder house would be complete

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,450
without a giant, scary knife?

175
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,606
So, what does everyone think?

176
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,959
It'd be better with some light.

177
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Isn't there a switch for that somewhere?

178
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:22,824
Better?

179
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,539
Well I think this is the worst thing

180
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,829
you've ever done to us.

181
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,739
Maybe not worst, but
definitely mixed into my top 10.

182
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,719
Do you know who lives
here or what it's for?

183
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,639
Nope, all I know is that this place

184
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,269
has been abandoned for
years and tonight it's ours.

185
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,129
I just wish you'd brought some boys.

186
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,449
Yeah, I agree.

187
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,829
Least would've made it's interesting.

188
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,449
Simmer down, horn dogs.

189
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,373
Tonight is girls night.

190
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,983
I'm sure we can find our own fun.

191
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,379
Here's to all of us
needing tetanus shots

192
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,879
by the end of the night.

193
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,269
Cheers, bitches.

194
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,850
Yes. Let's get this party started.

195
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:23,339
Come on, this is the magical concoction

196
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,103
that will make that shy
persona just disappear.

197
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:29,929
Okay.

198
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:35,309
What if I told you it's mostly just juice?

199
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,310
Bottom's up.

200
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,689
See, it's not that bad.

201
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,939
Mostly juice my ass.

202
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,079
Yeah, there might have been

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,123
just a little bit of vodka in there.

204
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,669
Can I have another?

205
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,109
Oh, just like that.

206
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,729
She is a changed woman.

207
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,739
Yeah, I'll make you another.

208
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,829
But first, let me in a little.

209
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,439
Tell me something I
don't know about Trish.

210
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,599
Well what do you wanna know?

211
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,949
Well, for starters, why
don't you talk to anybody?

212
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,399
I guess I'm just afraid
I'll say something stupid?

213
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,309
Okay, Melissa says stupid
shit literally all the time

214
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,610
and that doesn't stop her.

215
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,389
What is it?

216
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,350
Nothing.

217
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,113
No, you can
tell me. What is it?

218
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,026
There was this guy I used to like

219
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,649
and I thought he liked me, too.

220
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,489
So when I finally worked up
the courage to ask him out,

221
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,999
when I went to speak, I
couldn't form real words.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,842
I looked like an idiot.

223
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,173
His friend just stood
there, laughing at me.

224
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,966
And so now every time I go to talk,

225
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,169
that's all I can think about.

226
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,170
Oh, God.

227
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,019
What's his name?

228
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,240
Mark.

229
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,340
Mark?

230
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:58,340
I'm sorry, you're going to
let an asshole named Mark

231
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,659
affect your thinking like that?

232
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,219
You know what's probably going on

233
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,233
in Mark's head right now?

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,501
Elevator music.

235
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:08,370
Trust me.

236
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,370
You're better off.

237
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,500
It didn't seem like it at the time.

238
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,109
Look, I'm sorry that he made you feel

239
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,739
like what you had to say wasn't important,

240
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,129
but we can't let men affect
our thinking like that.

241
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,233
Especially not assholes named Mark.

242
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,049
I like getting to talk to you

243
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,929
and I don't think you sound stupid at all.

244
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,963
I bet the rest of the
girls would agree with me.

245
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:37,274
So, about that other drink?

246
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:41,166
Right.

247
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,659
Planning on taking
that shot anytime soon?

248
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,842
Don't rush me.

249
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,839
Keep doing this aiming
bullshit all night,

250
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,390
you're still not gonna make it.

251
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,460
See, you rushed me.

252
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,189
Keep telling yourself that.

253
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,629
Drink.

254
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,919
I feel like this isn't how the game

255
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,899
is supposed to be played.

256
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,689
That's because you're
losing, bitch. Drink.

257
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,669
Mind if I take a guest shot?

258
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,379
Only you're better than Sam.

259
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,330
My grandma's better than Sam at this.

260
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,929
Yeah? You think you
can make it in one shot?

261
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,599
Ooh, how about if you make it

262
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,019
into any one of those cups,
you have to take a shot.

263
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,981
That sounds good to me.

264
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:27,815
Uh-uh.

265
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,059
There's no way I'm
passing out on this floor.

266
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,799
Let's make it two shots.

267
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,633
Deal.

268
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:33,633
No.

269
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,536
You don't even have a ball.

270
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:39,712
What?

271
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,530
I hate you.

272
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,696
You know you love me.

273
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,030
I do, but I also hate you.

274
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,737
See you soon, floor.

275
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,618
Mm-mm.

276
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,119
Go on.

277
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,684
Floor, I'll see you soon.

278
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,166
You know, I feel like it's a good time

279
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,452
for an urban legend.

280
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:11,399
Wait, wait, wait, are
you talking about the time

281
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,729
when you had all three Fregosi
triplets in the same night?

282
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,030
'Cause that was legendary.

283
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
That was her?

284
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,899
Scary setting calls for a scary story.

285
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,479
It's not gonna be too scary, is it?

286
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,169
This is the story of
the servants of Satan.

287
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,393
Sounds stupid, but sure. Go ahead.

288
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,779
I'd rather hear about
the Fregosi triplets.

289
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,279
Shut up, Allie.

290
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Anyways, not too long ago,
on a night just like tonight,

291
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,719
a group of girls came to spend the night

292
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,189
in this very barn.

293
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,480
Mm, convenient.

294
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,149
Anyways, as it was winding down,

295
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,449
they were trying to think of
fun ways to pass the time by.

296
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,763
Truth or dare? No, too lame.

297
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,213
Streaking? No, too cold.

298
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,963
Reciting Bloody Mary in the mirror?

299
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,479
Closer.

300
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,659
Until one girl named Sophie Miller

301
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,459
recalled this old story she heard

302
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,563
about the servants of Satan.

303
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,299
So she told the group that
they could summon a demon

304
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,089
and the demon would come
and possess one body

305
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,759
and kill anyone around it.

306
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,629
But the trick is that they
don't know they're possessed

307
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,059
until the demon is about to kill.

308
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,079
So it kills, moves on to
the next body.

309
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,809
Who would wanna summon that?

310
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,163
I bet Sophie Miller did.

311
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,170
Anyways, Sophie led them
through the recitation

312
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,739
and after they finished the
incantation, nothing happened.

313
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,839
They waited and waited to no avail

314
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,443
and they just decided to call
it a night and went to bed.

315
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,209
The next morning, their bodies were found

316
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,689
horribly, horribly, mutilated

317
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,573
and carefully laid out in
the shape of a pentagram.

318
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,410
Sophie Miller's body
hung from the chandelier,

319
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,470
a cold, terrified look in
her dead, open eyes forever.

320
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,319
That's it?

321
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,569
That was supposed to be scary?

322
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,206
I don't know, I thought it was scary.

323
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,040
No, it's not.

324
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,889
It was a pot of bullshit.

325
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,309
Well, if it's not scary,
let's summon one ourselves.

326
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,599
I don't think that's a good idea.

327
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,979
It's just a story, Trish.

328
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,030
Yeah, no I'm good. Total waste of time.

329
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,589
Oh yeah? Or you're just scared?

330
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,293
I'm not scared.

331
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:46,529
This shit's not real.

332
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,993
If it's not real, then
what do we have to lose?

333
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,933
Fine, if this is how you
guys wanna spend your time.

334
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,089
Hm.

335
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,189
Legend says the demon has until midnight

336
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,169
to collect as many souls as it can

337
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,179
before having to go back to hell.

338
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,629
Then I say we wait until 11:59.

339
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,039
What time is it anyway?

340
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Uh...

341
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,779
10:26.

342
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,069
Perfect.

343
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,420
Everyone, close your eyes
and let's hold hands.

344
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,619
We summon thee, they loyal servant,

345
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,759
to take our bodies and use
them to serve your master.

346
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,909
We offer our bodies as sacrifice.

347
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,653
Come, thy loyal servant.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,336
What was that?

349
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,349
Just Melissa blowing out the candle,

350
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,879
trying to freak us out.

351
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,799
Did you see me blowing out the candle?

352
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,389
I didn't do that.

353
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,119
Okay, then it was gust of wind.

354
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Or was it?

355
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,773
The demon could be in any one of by now.

356
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,533
It could be in you.
Stop.

357
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,610
Or you.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,683
Or it could be in the nonbeliever.

359
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,909
One thing's for sure,
that you're just a group

360
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,713
of drunk bitches that'll
believe anything.

361
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,839
Wow, Melissa, that was so funny.

362
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Trish?

363
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:34,428
Yeah?

364
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,333
Please come back.

365
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,017
That was just Melissa being an idiot.

366
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,099
What if it's not just some scary story?

367
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,560
Come on, you don't really
believe in that stuff, do you?

368
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,659
I guess not.

369
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,729
Come on, my trepid little mouse.

370
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,169
Trepid?

371
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,583
Yeah, like afraid, fearful.

372
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,919
Okay, don't look into it.

373
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,880
Let's just go back out there

374
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,769
and enjoy the rest of the night.

375
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,349
Allison gets so funny when she gets drunk.

376
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,309
She gets all like lovey dovey
and tries to kiss everybody.

377
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,310
Come on.

378
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Come on.

379
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,590
I think you've had enough.

380
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,983
I think you're just being
a big old party pooper.

381
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,249
Babe, I'm telling you
this because I love you,

382
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,809
but you're getting to that level of drunk

383
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,699
where you start licking people's faces

384
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,903
and flashing your boobs.

385
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,719
You're just jealous 'cause you're part

386
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,716
of the itty bitty titty
committee.

387
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,077
Hey. Itty bitty and proud.

388
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,329
Oh, I'm sorry, Sammy.

389
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,099
Why don't you just give me your face

390
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,190
and I'll give you a big old
smooch right on the lips.

391
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,339
No, no.

392
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,844
How about I just get
you some water instead?

393
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,095
Okay, thanks.

394
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:05,759
Hey, you know, you're the
best friend a girl can have

395
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,359
and everybody else thinks
you're a big old toughie,

396
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,823
but I think you're a big old softy.

397
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,880
And I mean, I know you best.

398
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:17,248
I mean, yeah, but shh.

399
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,993
You'll ruin my rep.

400
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,501
Melissa?

401
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:24,853
Great.

402
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:28,867
Come on, go.

403
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:31,346
Come on.

404
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:34,362
Okay.

405
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:42,783
Power's out, party's
over. You bitches win.

406
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:46,829
On the contrary.

407
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,873
The party's just beginning.

408
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,209
You all picked the perfect
place to perform my ritual.

409
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,349
Isolated, miles and miles away from anyone

410
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,763
who can hear you scream.

411
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,339
I wonder how long it will take

412
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,649
for someone to find your bodies,

413
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,593
just like Sophie Miller.

414
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,266
You girls seem afraid.

415
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:15,269
What? Is this not what you wanted?

416
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,439
You thought I wouldn't come

417
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,589
after you so graciously
offered to me possession

418
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,479
of your physical form?

419
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Pity. Now, whose soul should I take first?

420
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Should it be you?

421
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,273
You reek of liquor.

422
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,263
Maybe it should be you.

423
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,979
No one here really seems to know you you,

424
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,409
so you'll be missed the least.

425
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,839
But then again, maybe it will be better

426
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,733
to get rid of the arrogant one.

427
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,199
No, I can hear your thoughts.

428
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,809
There's a clear consensus.

429
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,349
Who's the one that brought
you all here and summoned me?

430
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,959
That's who you all hate the most.

431
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,213
I can sense it from each one of you.

432
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,040
It's been decided.

433
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,389
Anyone who tries to leave this barn

434
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,253
will be met with immediate death.

435
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,999
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

436
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,703
Who can you trust?

437
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:58,616
That, that wasn't me.

438
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,198
Grab her.

439
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,326
What? What, no, no.

440
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,786
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:06,910
No, it's not.

442
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,479
It moved on, I felt it leave me.

443
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,980
That means it's in one of you.

444
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,938
What are you doing?

445
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:17,820
If that thing wants to get us,

446
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:20,102
it's gonna have to send one
of us out there to get it.

447
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:23,947
What if it, what if it kills
with more than just a knife?

448
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,359
What do we do now?

449
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,109
- Tie up Taylor.
- No, I just told you.

450
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,110
It's not in me.

451
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,619
We don't know that.

452
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,989
That's the whole point, you don't know.

453
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,653
What we do know is that
you just killed Melissa.

454
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:42,614
So sit your ass in the
chair and we'll tie you up.

455
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,126
What, are you fucking kidding me?

456
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:49,366
Let me go. Trish!

457
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:52,276
I'm sorry, Taylor.

458
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,832
Can't take any chances now, can we?

459
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,379
The demon's in Sam.

460
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,839
The demon's in Sam, let me go.

461
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,809
She's trying to tie me
up so I can't fight back.

462
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,760
Come on, you have to believe me, Trish.

463
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,135
Trish?

464
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,969
Un-fucking-believable.

465
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,029
So this is it? This is the plan?

466
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,519
You're just gonna tie me up
so that thing can kill me?

467
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,820
- Just until midnight.
- What time is it now?

468
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,281
11:03.

469
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:27,989
Listen, we'd do the same thing

470
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,943
if it was one of us who killed Melissa.

471
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,980
What do you expect us to do?

472
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,532
What...

473
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,033
What are we gonna do with her?

474
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,586
What do you mean?

475
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:44,639
Call me crazy, but I don't
wanna be looking at my friend's

476
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,625
disemboweled body all night.

477
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:47,626
Me neither.

478
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:50,313
Fine, we'll move her.

479
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,619
Trish, you stay with Taylor.

480
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,179
Yell if she does anything.

481
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,180
No, Allison, I'm telling you,
you can't be alone with her.

482
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,419
Why don't you just shut your mouth

483
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,133
and try not to murder anyone else?

484
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,549
Please, Trish. You have to believe me.

485
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,113
Samantha's going to kill her.

486
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,060
I don't know what to believe anymore.

487
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,759
Come on, you know me. You can trust me.

488
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,863
You can trust me more than anybody, Trish.

489
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,963
You're just trying to trick me.

490
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,900
What would you do if you were me?

491
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,089
I would...

492
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,793
I would think about this logically.

493
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,909
Do you remember in the story,

494
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,810
Melissa said that the demon
would move on after it killed?

495
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,526
Trish, you don't know what it
feels like to be possessed.

496
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,803
I do, and I'm telling you, it's not in me.

497
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,409
Please.

498
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,922
Are you sure?

499
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:56,046
Yeah.

500
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:57,047
On my life.

501
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,209
Hurry up.

502
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,219
What are you doing?

503
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,270
Nothing. I just tripped over something.

504
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,369
Well, come on, I don't wanna leave Trish

505
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,839
with Taylor for too long.

506
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,099
What's with the shovel?

507
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Self defense.

508
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:26,367
Guys.

509
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Come here.

510
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,139
I don't think the demon's
in Taylor anymore.

511
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:45,750
I guess her heart just
wasn't in it anymore.

512
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:48,474
Oh, god.

513
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,285
No.

514
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,119
No.

515
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,386
No!

516
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:56,804
You killed her.

517
00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:00,908
I didn't, that thing did.

518
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,810
Allie.

519
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,041
Allie, help me.

520
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,241
It's in her, she's trying to kill me.

521
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,519
No, Allie, stay back.

522
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,353
Don't listen to her.

523
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:13,559
Don't listen to her.

524
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,616
It leaves you once it
kills. It's in Samantha.

525
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,710
- Sammy, what do I do?
- Help me.

526
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,183
Allie!

527
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:33,184
Allie?

528
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,001
I can see you.
Stay back!

529
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:39,440
I said stay back.

530
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:42,914
Put the screwdriver down.

531
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,514
No.

532
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:47,070
I'm not gonna hurt you.

533
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:52,071
Are you gonna hurt me?

534
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:00,068
None of this would have happened

535
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,911
if we'd just gone back to
my place like I suggested.

536
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,143
Definitely the worst thing
Melissa's ever done to us.

537
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:08,261
I don't know.

538
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,589
Getting suspended in the women's bathroom

539
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,007
for smoking was pretty bad.

540
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,946
I almost forgot about that.

541
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:20,489
And then she narked
on us. Fucking bitch.

542
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,550
Show some respect.

543
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:23,789
She's dead.

544
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,079
She deserves it after all

545
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,430
she put us through tonight.

546
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:32,666
We're gonna make it
out of here, I promise.

547
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:37,636
We're gonna make it out of here?

548
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:40,393
Or at least one of us will.

549
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:53,097
No.

550
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:55,382
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,164
Dead.

552
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,599
You killed her?

553
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
You killed Taylor.

554
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,269
Where'd you get that?

555
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,649
Found it on the ground next to me

556
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,239
after you knocked me out.

557
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
Or maybe you went outside and got it

558
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,777
because the demon's in you.

559
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:30,578
Maybe it's in you because
you killed your best friend.

560
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,139
Only two left.

561
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,089
I wonder who will make it to midnight.

562
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,023
Should I stay over here,
or should I come over here?

563
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,229
Tricky, tricky.

564
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,639
Maybe I should just be a spectator

565
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,190
and let you fight to the death.

566
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,796
Well, well look who came out of her shell.

567
00:32:58,797 --> 00:32:59,797
Do it.

568
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Please.

569
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,820
I don't wanna die.

570
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:33,476
I made it.

571
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:34,652
I made it.

572
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:35,486
I made it.

573
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:37,544
I made it, you motherfucker!

574
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:38,841
I made it!

575
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,947
Congratulations.

576
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,323
