1
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,140
- Mm, so good.

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,370
What kind of perfume
are you wearing?

3
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,970
- It's an expensive French
import, it's called
soap and water.

4
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,970
Drives men crazy.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
- You bad.

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,050
- Daddy, wanna play soldier?
Sergeant Steel is my favorite.

7
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,799
- Come here.

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,820
- Daddy! I wanna play...
Murphy... ugh.

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,619
- Why don't you play
something else? You wanna play
cards, do a puzzle?

10
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,600
- No, that's boring.

11
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,369
- What about Go Fish?

12
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,019
- No, you can be Sergeant Steel.

13
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,770
- Ah you're winning, bad...

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,770
Come back.

15
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,770
You won.

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
- What?

17
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,050
What are you smiling about?

18
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,280
- I guess I feel lucky.

19
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
- Lucky in love?

20
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,440
- Very lucky in love.

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
- How's that for romantic?

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,280
- Mommy, I can't see my food.

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,040
- I'll get some candles,
honey can you check the fuse?

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
- Okay.

25
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,760
- I'll be right back Jimmy.

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,130
- Noooooooo.

27
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
- Jimmy!

28
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,380
- Daddy!

29
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,200
- Jimmm!
- Ow! Oww!

30
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
- No!

31
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,700
- Nooooo!

32
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,269
- This is nothing like
Cuckoo's Nest,
you'll be fine...

33
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,620
The first thing you need to
know about night duty

34
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,099
is that your most important
reference guide is a TV guide.

35
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,060
Yea, right, no kidding.

36
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
- Hey, hey, excuse me, sir, sir.

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,529
- Mr., let's get you
back in bed we can't have
you roaming the hall.

38
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,450
- It's planted in everyones'
teeth, yes they do, I
know it! Yes, they do!

39
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,330
- That's alright Mr., we'll just
get you back in bed. Come on.

40
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,329
- Don't, I'm telling you.

41
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,032
- It's ok.
- They're here,
they're every where.

42
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,288
- It'll be gone in the morning.

43
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
You calm down, calm down.

44
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,660
It's ok, it's ok.

45
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,430
- What's wrong now?

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,260
He's been here for two years,
total un-functional,
he never says a thing.

47
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,160
Hardly ever gets out of bed.

48
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,160
- What happened to him?

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,160
- His wife and child were
killed. House burned down.

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
- Did he do it?

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
- They don't know

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,330
- Sound...

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,330
Wretch... like meee

54
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,640
- Jim!

55
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
- Hello, security?

56
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,810
There's been a breakout
in section three.

57
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,870
What code? I don't
know, I'm new here.

58
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,260
I don't know if he's dangerous.

59
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,420
He could be. Could
you just hurry please?

60
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,860
- I love you.

61
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,300
- I love you too, sweetheart.

62
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,140
Alex, come to me.

63
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,420
Alex...

64
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,200
Come to me Alex.

65
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,340
Alex...

66
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Alex!

67
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,260
Come to me.

68
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Alex, please come to me.

69
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,100
- Leaves... healing leaves.

70
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,020
Charlie.

71
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,020
Charlie

72
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,659
- Vengeance shall be mine.

73
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,980
- Sayeth the lord.
- For there is an evil among us.

74
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,940
- And God with His hand
smote my enemies
with righteous vengeance!

75
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,620
- What do you want!

76
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,699
- Charlie?

77
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,040
- Alex? Please!

78
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,980
Find the man who did this to
us before he does it to
millions of others.

79
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,260
- Whoever did this to us...
I swear I'll kill them.

80
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,380
Kill me!

81
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,540
- Basket case, you don't
even know who I am, do you?

82
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,540
Do you!

83
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,170
- Fear not!
- For I will be with you...

84
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,000
- We'll be blind but
then we'll see!

85
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,299
- And there were
men who broke his heart.

86
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
- And they were the children.

87
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,879
- Yes, come to papa.

88
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
- Hey! Quit it!

89
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,539
Oh, cut it out.

90
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,020
- Yesss

91
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,200
- Oh yea? Take that!

92
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,580
- Shit! Son of a...!

93
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,280
Oh God.

94
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,780
Shit!

95
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,179
We hit somebody.

96
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,180
- What the hell do you
mean we hit somebody?

97
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,320
- That guy was like
fricking Tarzan.
- Ah shit!

98
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,180
- Tarzan.

99
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,899
- Great, we hit fucking
Tarzan. Shit!

100
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Hey Tarzan!

101
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
Umgawah! - Hey I'm not kidding
you man, we hit somebody!

102
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,480
- Yea, we hit
somebody... Oh my God!

103
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
You're right man.

104
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Tarzan the apeshit man.

105
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,180
Hey you alright?

106
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,259
Great a 5150, we'll be in
psycho central all night long.
- I hate that fucking place!

107
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,260
- Alright come on man, get up.

108
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,820
Let's go Sasquatch,
I don't have all night.

109
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,000
Ahhh! Christ this guy
needs a hose down.

110
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,620
Smells like a goat!

111
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,500
You know what,
you hit him, you tag him,
I'll log him in.

112
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,580
Alright, come on. Come on
goat boy, let's go. C'mon!

113
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
- Hey!

114
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,140
What the hell.

115
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,740
Come on!

116
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,640
What are you doing?

117
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,400
- What?

118
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,220
- Yea, hi, it's me.

119
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,359
- Oh yea, Jesus,
not another deadbeat.

120
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,000
I know, I know but
he fits the profile.

121
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,000
- I mean it's Titan, right?
- Right.

122
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
See you there.

123
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,760
- Is this part of the game?

124
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,980
Come here! C'mon,
get back into bed.

125
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
- Sorry.

126
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,500
It's business.

127
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Give me your number, ok?

128
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,839
- Nobody goes until
I'm finished.

129
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
- Let go.
- Shut up!

130
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Jesus.

131
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,960
- If you're here when
I get back I'll kill you.

132
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
You understand?

133
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,040
Don't bleed on my sheets.

134
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,779
- That's not what happened,
see, I was just...

135
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,860
- Hey Carter!

136
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,079
Have I got one for you.

137
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,200
- Forget it, I'm off.

138
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,960
- Oh, no, no,
Carter, duty first.

139
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,560
Now myself and my
partner are on street duty...

140
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,549
which means the sooner
we are back on said
street the safer it

141
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,879
will be for the inhabitants of
this fine yet dull community.

142
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,300
Which means your duty
is to cut down the amount
of time we spend here.

143
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,300
Of course to monitor
and supply the paper cups by
that water cooler,

144
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,359
thereby in your own minute
way to keep the streets safe.

145
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,919
- Nice but I am off.

146
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,640
- Oh but did I mention this
guy is a 5150 which means he
has to be tended to right away.

147
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,640
Goat boy.

148
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,820
- Hey Halliday, only reason
you're on the street and I'm
not is because you were a jock.

149
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,260
I'll be it in a minute way.

150
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
- Oh yea really.

151
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,720
- Sit down!

152
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,660
Ok, don't.

153
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Name.

154
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
Do you know where
you are right now?

155
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,160
When was the last time you ate?

156
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,859
Are you thirsty?

157
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
Do you want some?

158
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,380
Go ahead.

159
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,140
I didn't touch it.

160
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,320
That's my dog, uh,
my dog actually died.

161
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,220
Do you have a dog?

162
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,740
Oh god!

163
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,360
Here, here, here.

164
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,060
Ok.

165
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,460
I'm gonna bandage you up
and then I'm gonna send
you over to county.

166
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,520
- Let's go.

167
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,500
What is it this time Ms. Beloc.
Find another juicehead
in the ditch somewhere?

168
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,280
That's five this year alone.

169
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,580
- If you like the money
don't bitch about the job.

170
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,979
Beloc, Marie. Wallace, Edgar.
Poe, Allen. Clearance one,
chairman suite.

171
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,340
Positive voice
recognition, thank you.

172
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,760
- So Edgar, how is life?

173
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,080
- Call me Eddy, call me Wallace,
but don't call me Edgar.

174
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,260
How's life?

175
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,040
Life is well and truly fucked.

176
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,760
I have worked for some seriously
warped individuals in my time
but this nut job takes the cake.

177
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,369
- Mr. Burroughs know
you feel this way about him?

178
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,270
- I don't give a rusty fuck
what Mr. Burroughs knows.

179
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,020
Shit, I used to jack up little
punks like that in high
school for their lunch money.

180
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,340
This is an un-programmed stop.

181
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,150
You're late.

182
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,960
- I'm sorry sir, we came
as soon as we got the alert.

183
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,400
- Mr. Burroughs we're going
to be even later if you don't
turn the elevator back on.

184
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,500
Motion restored, proceeding
to chairman suite.

185
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,160
- Dang!

186
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,520
You think he heard me?

187
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,520
- What do you think.

188
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,770
- Well?

189
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,770
- It's like the other four,
a man was found in the desert,
no clothes, no ID.

190
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,860
Right now he's being held
at the county holding facility.

191
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,680
- Go ahead.

192
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:47,740
- I'll send a man.
- No, no, you send a team.

193
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,920
What!

194
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,999
- On an operational level...

195
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,520
it doesn't make sense to
send three professionals to
handle another basket case.

196
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,800
If you don't mind.

197
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
- Actually.

198
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,700
I do mind.
You see I pay for them.

199
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,979
Therefore I get to waste them.

200
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,360
If that's alright
with you Mr. Wallace.

201
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,880
Is that alright?

202
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,460
Yes, sir.

203
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,080
- Hey!
- Hey no, I'm just gonna
drain the lizard, man.

204
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Hey.

205
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,600
Welcome to the
gerbil cage big guy.

206
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,220
My name's Shazam man,
because I like to fly.

207
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,140
You know, fly?

208
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,040
Get ready for the holding block.

209
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
- Yea.

210
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,700
Hey you like to fly, man?

211
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,039
Hey what are you on, man?

212
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,080
Open it up.

213
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,580
Like acid or shrooms?

214
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,720
Or something better?

215
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,960
Me first, dump these guys
off like it's the YMCA...

216
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,920
Caption's orders...
fine! Like it's one more
thing that I have to do.

217
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,019
Put these guys in these
three beds, they'll be
fine till the morning.

218
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,170
Me? I'm gonna be up
all night. C'mon let's go.

219
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,150
If the warden didn't
have me around...

220
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,039
- Hey, welcome to the
gerbil cage man, my name's
Shazam, I like to fly.

221
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,799
This guy wants to kiss me.

222
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
- No man!

223
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,540
- You the nature boy? 6'1",
long hair, 180 pounds.

224
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,060
- That's him, we'll see if we
can get him up.

225
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,340
- Look at that, get the monkey.

226
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,119
Kill that fucker! C'mon! Kill
that fucking man! Give me
something! Give me something!

227
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
- Here.

228
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,139
Come on down!

229
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
- I got him!

230
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,900
Open the holding cell now!

231
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,939
- PCP, got it.

232
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,100
- Hey! What the
hell happened here?

233
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,280
- Gerbils ate each other.

234
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,520
- Escaped prisoner.

235
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Patching into the
county video system now.

236
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,240
- He was like a gorilla
or something, he tore the
bars right out of the walls.

237
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,859
- How does one man?

238
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,380
- No, no, he's not a man.

239
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,980
He's savage.

240
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,940
- What the fuck is a
savage, who is this guy?

241
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,220
- Up until this point he was
my worst nightmare, now he's
your worst nightmare too.

242
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,240
- I don't have nightmares.

243
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,350
Now what do I tell the
troops about this savage

244
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,600
where's he going, and what
kinda weapons he's carrying.

245
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,860
- He's coming here.

246
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,920
And as far as weapons
are concerned, he is the weapon.

247
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
- C'mon!

248
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,440
Give me my boy.

249
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,280
Let it go.

250
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,580
Play gangster?
- No, no, no, yes!

251
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,350
- I'm ready to fax.
- No, no, wait, wait.

252
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,420
They would have wanted him to
fit in, he'll have cut his hair.

253
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Sit.

254
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Ms. Beloc, your
blouse is undone.

255
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,260
Did you get dressed in a hurry?

256
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,970
- Yes, I did.

257
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,870
- Well button up.

258
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
- Let's go.

259
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,999
What's next is to move
beyond virtual reality...

260
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,420
you see the silicon language
limits virtual reality to an
internal experience,

261
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,870
exploring our fantasies
but within someone else's idea
of a perfect environment.

262
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,350
Virtual reality is the beginning
of a whole new concept.

263
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,599
- Mr. Burroughs is
experimenting with a variety
of different drives,

264
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,149
worth protecting the
revolutionary virtual
reality machines.

265
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,299
- But it's random, you
can't control it, you're more
than just a player, you're god.

266
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,619
- Now consumers quickly fell
in love with these enormously
entertaining Titan games.

267
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,269
However teams of highly
skilled engineers and scientists

268
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,219
have failed to duplicate
the technology.

269
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,149
The reclusive billionaire
is closely associated
with Titan plaza

270
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,450
where Burroughs spends
most of his waking hours.

271
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,299
- The plain of the immortal..

272
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,020
Kill me!

273
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,470
- Why me? Why my family?

274
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,269
- You will own a master
of all you survey

275
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,270
and the universe
bends to your every will.

276
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,400
- Is your memory maxed out?
I know mine is.

277
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,120
Do you know where to go
for more megabytes
than you've ever dreamed of?

278
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,820
I do. Follow me to the
electronic kitchen, we

286
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,370
- Cops spotted at Market Street.
- Wallace, Wallace, turn on your optic feed.

287
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,220
- Ok, 3324 Street.
- Oh, you too.

288
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,500
- Ok.

- You bet I did, I never seen

315
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,619
- Yea well that guy
didn't score a goal.

316
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,319

- Rock and roll!

343
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,970
- Don't you see it!

344
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,220
- Don't you see him!

345
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,650
- Oh please Mr. Savage,
don't hurt me.

346
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,650
- Poe, do you hear me?
Kill him now!

347
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,399
- University Street looks like...
- That's it I'm a dead man

348
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,870
- Paramedics sort
through the carnage...
-He'll be coming here next.

349
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:51,369
- Go on what are
you waiting for?
Make your move Ms. Beloc.

350
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,470
We both know you're too smart
to just stick around and wait
for the proverbial shoe to drop.

351
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:02,250
Tell you what, you just go
to the bathroom... we'll both
pretend you're coming back.

352
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,550
- Relax, I never
leave home without it.

353
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,719
- Ok, a atypically
candid admission.

354
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:11,720
I'm a fan, you're a master,
this guy's a master and I've got
the best seat in the house.

355
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,870
- This is not a game!
Are you out of your mind?

356
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,319
In my games if you're very very
good, if you're very very good
you should always be in control

357
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
but this is out of hand.

358
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,769
I was so close,
three or four months.

359
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,899
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.

360
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,700
- I would have had it,
just two or three months.

361
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,120
- I don't want to overstep
my boundaries here

362
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,450
so maybe if we just
talk this out we can
get a new perspective.

363
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,650
- Talk this... what are you
thinking! This isn't therapy!

364
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,100
- This may sound simplistic

365
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:03,950
but you knew a man would
try to stop you from solving X,
that's why you hired us.

366
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,350
You say you need three or
four months to crack this.

367
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,019
The fact that he's here now

368
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,650
is an indication that
you're closer to your solution
than you might think.

369
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,070
Or at least that's what they
think.

370
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,920
- The fuck happened in that bar!

371
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,299
- Mr. Burroughs wants
his facility locked up airtight.

372
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,099
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- There are a dozen
men in the lobby.

373
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,099
- Wait a minute this
guy looks familiar.

374
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,719
Jesus Christ!
It's the guy from the ranch.

375
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
- Yes, you idiot!

376
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,250
That's why you should
have finished him off!

377
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,120
Now they're using
his rage as a perfect
tool for my destruction.

378
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,799
Wait, wait, wait, wait a second
maybe not so perfect
who is that?

379
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,300
- Who?
- The woman! Who's the woman?

380
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,620
- It'll be on the police report.

381
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,619
- Mr. Wallace you may
be about to start earning
your Christmas bonus

382
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,870
you keep him away
for a few hours.

383
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,450
Access granted.

384
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,670
- Got it.

385
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,250
Nicole Carter.

386
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,450
She's a cop.

387
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,300
- What's so special about her?
- I don't know.

388
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,199
But a savage is supposed
to be obsessed with his
quest, his calling.

389
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,519
He shouldn't
possess any emotions
except for bloodlust and anger.

390
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,650
But, but, he,
he saved this woman,
therefore he must care for her.

391
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,520
Which makes him vulnerable.

392
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,300
He's vulnerable.

393
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,549
Wallace here, yea, ok out.

394
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,000
Morning Edgar.

395
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,599
- Sir she's just no leaving the
station, if you don't mind I'd
like to handle this personally.

396
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,700
- Fine do it.

397
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,275
- Aw I think you hurt the
big ape's feelings.
- Please.

398
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,775
Please!

399
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,825
Who is it?

400
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:29,550
Who is it?

401
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,875
- Check it out.

402
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:23,175
Alright just gonna loosen
the ends here.

403
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:47,375
- If you had to break
into this place, would you hack
your way through?

404
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:50,275
- I could hack my way through
any code in high school

405
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:58,074
I'm a real student of cryptology
used to break into NSA files,
missile codes, fun stuff

406
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,070
- Precocious.

407
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,925
Please.

408
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:38,150
- May I?
- Please

409
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,725
- Monitor out on level six.

410
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:14,519
-Cro-magnon?

411
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,019
- Yes, cro-magnon.

412
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,000
Our savage forefathers
fifty-thousand years ago.

413
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,125
You know you continue
to impress me, Ms. Beloc.

414
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:33,000
- I don't understand.

415
00:54:34,225 --> 00:54:35,599
This is not cro-magnon.

416
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,625
- Oh it absolutely is,
I was a member of the original
expedition that found it.

417
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:42,850
The only surviving
member as a matter of fact.

418
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:47,400
The others met with a little
accident on the way home.

419
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:57,900
- Down there.

420
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,350
- Dent, Lester. Clearance two.

421
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,525
- And these pictographs?
- Symbol cryptography!

422
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,025
- Like the fraternal crypt
used by the Rosicrucians
and Freemasons.

423
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,750
- Yes, only its binary.

424
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,950
The cryptographs translate
to key numbers which
translate to cyber text.

425
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:40,650
- Bur cro-magnon?
- Eden Ms. Beloc, mythical Eden.

426
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,300
- All the earth's
early cultures...

427
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:47,899
Hebrew, Phoenician,
Greek, Goth, Druid, Sioux
Indian, Astic, Scandinavian.

428
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,473
They all share the legend
of an extraordinary civilization

429
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:53,300
unsurpassed in spiritual
and creative genius...

430
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:57,050
Which vanished in a
cataclysm, a deluge if you will.

431
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,875
- But that's myth.
- Why would every culture come
up with the same myth?

432
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,999
Pyramids continents apart

433
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,150
in Egypt and South
American they bear identical
architectural features.

434
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,399
You don't honestly believe
that a primitive people

435
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,523
could construct technological
marvels like Easter Island
and Stone Henge

436
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:17,025
out of sheer primitive
inspiration, do you
consider this?

437
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,949
Geologists estimate

438
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,949
that the end of the last ice age

439
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,699
the one that parted
the straights of Gibraltar and
filled the mediterranean basin

440
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,599
at around the same time
as Plato and Herodotus
approximated the disappearance

441
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,775
of Atlantis.

442
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,569
Another coincidence?
Read the data.

443
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,425
The virtual reality that Titan
sells is nothing but a crude
version of this technology.

444
00:56:39,426 --> 00:56:40,875
Don't you see?

445
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,599
The ancient ones
created a virtual universe

446
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,769
an infinite paradise
in cyberspace

447
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,149
but they had to have
food and they needed labor.

448
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,825
So they took the apes
down from the trees
our ancestors.

449
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:56,875
They trained them.

450
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:01,525
We are not the children
of gods, Ms. Beloc.
We are the offspring of apes.

451
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:03,850
I'm running out of time.

452
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:06,825
- What happened to them?

453
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:10,099
With all their technology
surely they could have
survived the cataclysm.

454
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,699
Well the cataclysm
didn't annihilate them

455
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,099
it merely erased their
fingerprints, proof of
their existence.

456
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,623
You see they'd reached such
a level of sophistication that
they left the flesh behind.

457
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:22,523
They simply transferred their
essence into cyber space.

458
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:25,699
The way we digitize sound
and light, they digitize matter.

459
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,999
Now they exist in a
cyber universe, immortal but
powerless in this world.

460
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,149
Which is why they sent
the savage to keep me from

461
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,749
deciphering the
key to immortality.

462
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,473
Don't you see? It's all about
scaring the apes, us,
into sheer ignorance.

463
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:41,200
You remember your bible?
Keep your hands off the fruit.

464
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:44,449
Keep your hands off the
fruit of the tree of knowledge.

465
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,049
God messing with the
men who dared to erect
the tower of Babel

466
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:51,499
Its amazingly
consistent, isn't it?
Knowledge is power.

467
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,975
And the key to immortality
is the ultimate power.

468
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,450
- But why, why would
they want to corner the
market on immortality?

469
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,269
A cyber universe...

470
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:09,200
- Ms. Beloc, enough please.
The end of our discourse we need
to pursue your solution now.

471
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:13,599
- Well the first thing we
should consider is all the
binary combinations

472
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,520
that you ran through the
computer about the time that
the savage appeared.

473
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,025
- Good.

474
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:23,150
- Just one question.
- What?

475
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:25,575
If I crack this...

476
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:29,375
Am I gonna have a
little accident too?

477
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:54,525
- Yes!

478
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,425
Force entry zone B.

479
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,649
- Abort!
- Abort!

480
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,399
- Four down, three
to go, Mr. Rose...

481
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,149
can you feed?
- Reese!
- What?

482
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,725
- My name.
- Reese? Good.

483
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,450
- He's in the building.
- What!

484
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,975
He's in the building.
Finish up!

485
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,975
Looking for me?

486
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:10,450
You are here to kill me, right?

487
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,799
Well you know we better hurry
up to deliver our speeches.

488
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,399
You know, my diabolical plans,
your determination to
keep me from succeeding.

489
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Blah, blah, blah.

490
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:23,275
You know what?
I say the hell with it.
It's the 90's let's watch TV.

491
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,450
Mr. Wallace. Can you hear me?

492
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:31,700
- Yea, I can hear you.

493
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,700
- Let her go.
- Oh I will.

494
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:44,925
Tomorrow, maybe the day after
until then you just keep your
distance.

495
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:00,850
Oh go on,
you can kill me,
you can kill me, go on.

496
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,549
But you'll be killing
her too, just the way
you were responsible

497
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,373
for the death of
your wife and child.

498
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:09,299
You know we made you
a generous offer on your ranch,
a very, very generous offer.

499
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,799
You want, you want
this woman's blood
on your hands too?

500
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Is that what you want? Hmm?

501
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:16,850
Choose.

502
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,925
At you.

503
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:35,725
Alright then.

504
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,569
Let's just play a
little game, shall we?
I'm going to count to three

505
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,800
and if you're still here...
then Mr. Wallace will just...

506
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,550
Well...
You know.

507
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,700
Ready?
One...

508
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:56,200
Two...

509
01:01:59,475 --> 01:02:02,050
Three...

510
01:02:19,225 --> 01:02:20,900
Wallace.

511
01:02:21,675 --> 01:02:22,899
We're on.

512
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,675
- To Nick, love dad.

513
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:47,074
That's nice.

514
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,069
How about a little wager?

515
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,200
- Sure... How about $500?

516
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,450
- Let's make it a
grand you punk.

517
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,150
I wouldn't move if I were you.

518
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,200
If I knick your carotid
artery you'll be dead.

519
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,775
- Missed sucker.

520
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,900
- Go to hell!

521
01:03:25,475 --> 01:03:26,825
- See you around.

522
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm going back to type.

523
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,050
Keep an eye on her.

524
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
- What is taking
Wallace so long?

525
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,650
- How did they...
-Turn a simple rancher
into a savage?

526
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,999
The brain is a computer
Ms. Beloc it operates
on electrical impulses.

527
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,649
You press the right buttons,
you tap the original hard drive

528
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,819
the cro-magnon programs,
the lizard algorithms and voila.

529
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,275
Access the beast within.
- Beast within? Sounds good.

530
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,300
- Shh. Go.

531
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,150
- Get back! Get back!

532
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:24,425
Where is he?
- I go, I go.
You see him?

533
01:05:34,075 --> 01:05:35,775
See him?

534
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:45,800
- Fuck this!

535
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,450
The fucking...

536
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,275
- What took you so long!
Did you set the detonator?

537
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,075
Come on!

538
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,900
- No more nightmare.

539
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,275
No!

540
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,450
Wait.

541
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,650
Wait!

542
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,200
Where are you going?

543
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:46,625
Are you going to Titan?

544
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,999
Will you stop for one second?

545
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,925
- I have no time.
- Wait.

546
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:52,475
What the hell is going on?

547
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,100
Who are you!

548
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,300
- I gotta go before...

549
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,574
- You gotta go before what!

550
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,575
It's me, it's me!

551
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:44,300
Look I've seen you in action
god knows what you are.

552
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,575
I'm not here to bust you,
I'm here to help.

553
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:49,950
Back off me.

554
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,750
What are we looking for?

555
01:07:54,775 --> 01:07:56,919
Hey! Don't walk away from me!

556
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,750
They burned down
my home, they killed my
best friend, now clue me in.

557
01:08:06,775 --> 01:08:10,550
This is really spooky,
where is every body?
Company picnic?

558
01:08:43,975 --> 01:08:46,425
What the hell is this place?

559
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:53,200
What is that?

560
01:08:54,425 --> 01:08:56,475
- There was something here.

561
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:04,250
A machine.

562
01:09:05,025 --> 01:09:08,125
- Machine? What kind of machine?

563
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,275
- A very powerful machine.

564
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:17,125
- Is that what
this is all about?
Industrial espionage...

565
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
All the...

566
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:45,175
God it's freezing in here.

567
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,625
Thank you.

568
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,950
Cut that out.

569
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,125
How'd you do that?
- I didn't.

570
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,119
- Then who did?

571
01:10:18,225 --> 01:10:21,375
- Rohmer here.
- Rohmer, why am I paying
you so much money?

572
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:25,500
- Shut up and listen.
Is it true that the
savage is still alive?

573
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:29,675
- We do have a lead on him.
- I'm leaving town right now.
I want the savage eliminated.

574
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,625
- Mr. Burroughs,
you never said anything
about killing people.

575
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:35,199
- Do I need to remind
you how you got
your position, Captain?

576
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,200
- I do remember everything
you've done for me,
Mr. Burroughs.

577
01:10:39,425 --> 01:10:40,850
- Good.

578
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,250
- It looks like something
or somebody is accessing t
he Titan corporate files.

579
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,575
Look, administrative records.

580
01:10:53,925 --> 01:10:58,400
Utility records, water, gas,
electric, waste disposal, phone.
There's gotta be something here.

581
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:00,025
Look at that.

582
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,873
Corporate retreat at Spirit
Rock $350,000 dollars.

583
01:11:02,874 --> 01:11:05,500
Why would anyone
need that much juice
at a corporate retreat?

584
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,725
- You know what to do, Moreno.

585
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,773
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot, no!

586
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:38,650
No, no, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot.

587
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,375
I talked to Captain Rohmer.
Captain Rohmer?

588
01:11:41,376 --> 01:11:43,649
Captain Rohmer?
- You heard her.

589
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,975
- Captain Rohmer
tell them to put
their weapons down!

590
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,775
- Stand down.

591
01:11:50,575 --> 01:11:54,075
- I called them I know you
don't understand but please
trust me, this is the best way.

592
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,649
You can't deal with these
people on your own.

593
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,625
Captain Rohmer... This...

594
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:02,725
I don't even know your name.
- Pleasure's all mine.

595
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:06,450
Good work, Carter. Please?

596
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,740
- Get your hands off of me.
What are you doing?

597
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,525
If you just relax everything's
going to be alright.

598
01:12:19,975 --> 01:12:22,450
- He's got a gun!
- He has no gun! Get off me!

599
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:28,900
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Put your guns down!

600
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,125
Calling all units,
pursuit in progress,

601
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,100
Two suspects in a stolen
black and white heading
east on 8th street.

602
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,749
Requesting addition backup.

603
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,749
Chopper one moving
into position.

604
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,100
Three, four and five,
cut them off at 7th street.

605
01:13:21,225 --> 01:13:22,125
Suspects...

606
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:24,350
- Oh god why did
that scumbag plant
a piece on you?

607
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,823
What the fuck is going on?

608
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:28,300
The Captain's in on
it which means
I know way too much.

609
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,600
I'm fucked, so fucked.

610
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,900
- Oh god!

611
01:13:48,225 --> 01:13:50,449
Suspects heading
south on Avenue B,

612
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,075
all units intercept, over.
- Holy!

613
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:03,015
We got three units in front of
them, they'll never get by.

614
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,400
- Hold on!

615
01:14:13,175 --> 01:14:15,049
We have visual contact,

616
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,625
two suspects in a black and
white heading west on Arroyo.

617
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,550
Suspects eluded roadblocks
now heading west, over.

618
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,049
- All I ever wanted to be
was a cop, get out on the
street and do some good.

619
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,949
Guess that's pretty much
over now that I'm a felon.

620
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,650
Assaulting an officer,
assisting an escapee,
grand theft auto,

621
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,100
aiding and abetting.
I'm fucked, really fucked.

622
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,975
I might as well get married,
my life is over.

623
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,274
- Got 'em in my sights
they're heading straight
for the freeway.

624
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:38,276
- Do not lose eye contact.

625
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,275
I'm sending all available units
to converge units to converge
on southbound freeway.

626
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:45,423
- All available units, we
have two suspects in a stolen
black and white, heading south.

627
01:14:45,424 --> 01:14:48,575
Converge and intercept and
prevent border crossing, over.

628
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,750
- I need to go to Spirit Rock.

629
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,400
- Where do you need to go?
Spirit Rock?

630
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:59,600
Hey, I know! And I bet you
want me to drive, right?

631
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,400
That's ok, my life is
over anyway, I might as well
go along for the ride.

632
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,300
- Wait a minute they
disappeared, I lost 'em.

633
01:15:11,575 --> 01:15:15,050
- Alright my friend Veronica
lives... she used to live
right over there.

634
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,600
We can take her car.
Ok, let's go!

635
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:29,300
- I had him Captain, I swear
I had him, I'm gonna double back
and see if I can pick him up.

636
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:31,300
- What do you mean you lost him?

637
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,499
I want a statewide APB
put out on both of 'em.

638
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,724
And when they're apprehended,
wherever that may be,
I want them held until I come

639
01:15:39,725 --> 01:15:43,475
to collect them.
My personal responsibility.
You got that?

640
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,575
The key's right here.

641
01:15:53,825 --> 01:15:55,400
Get in, hurry.

642
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:14,999
The fugitives including
Officer Nicky Carter.

643
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,674
Escaped from Titan plaza
in a stolen cruiser.

644
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:19,670
- So this was his land.

645
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,975
- I made him very offer too,
an exceptionally good offer
as a matter of fact.

646
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,450
Through a mining
subsidiary of mine.

647
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,999
And the idiot refused to sell.

648
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,373
- And this is the cave
I presume where you
found the machine.

649
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:31,075
- Mhmm.

650
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,975
- Well why must
you digitize here?

651
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,275
- Because it's a vortex point

652
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:39,223
it's a condenser of
elemental forces like
Stonehenge or New Grange.

653
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:41,275
Or the first temple
at Jerusalem.

654
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,999
Does this sound sort of New
Age stupid to you, does it?

655
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,099
You'll soon see.

656
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,025
- Alright lets go, come on!

657
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:16,675
- Look I really am sticking my
neck out for you. Could you at
least share something with me?

658
01:17:17,775 --> 01:17:20,900
Simple stuff... like your name.

659
01:17:23,525 --> 01:17:26,550
Who you are... what you do.

660
01:17:27,925 --> 01:17:30,625
Why I'm stuck in this
fucking car with you...

661
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,500
Stop that! You're
making me crazy here.

662
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,500
I'm not kidding, will
you stop that? You want
me to pull the car over?

663
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,000
- Sometimes they tell me things.

664
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,850
- What? Through the radio?

665
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:58,100
Like stairway to heaven played
backwards? Forget it, forget it.

666
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:03,400
Tell me about your family,
do you have a family?

667
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:16,325
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing!

668
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:21,725
Hello?
Get your hand off the seat!

669
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,574
We have to stop for gas.
- We have no time.

670
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:32,570
- Yea I know,
we also have no gas.

671
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,925
- Sorry! Fill her up?
- Yea.

672
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,349
Does the Titan corporation
have a place around here?

673
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:03,600
- Yea, about five miles north
of here near the old dig
site next to Spirit Rock.

674
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:18,875
- Al?

675
01:19:20,786 --> 01:19:21,840
Is that you?

676
01:19:25,986 --> 01:19:26,986
- Do you know him?

677
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:28,799
- Yea, you don't?

678
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,306
- Just tell me who he is.

679
01:19:30,826 --> 01:19:33,400
- He was a rancher, he lived
on the road a couple years ago.

680
01:19:33,773 --> 01:19:38,546
His whole family was killed.
They put him in a crazy place,
like a mental hospital.

681
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,306
- Really? Don't call the cops,
I will take care of it, ok?

682
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:46,626
I just don't want to
get him upset.

683
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,560
- Put me through to
Connie and hurry.

684
01:20:22,704 --> 01:20:25,168
- Is this where you...
- Found it?
Yes.

685
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:29,024
A cro-magnon cave to
be sure but these...

686
01:20:29,584 --> 01:20:35,200
They were obviously ancient
pictographs but there was
something, they seemed binary.

687
01:20:42,912 --> 01:20:43,936
- That's amazing.

688
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,432
- This is just the beginning.

689
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,456
- Sorry.

690
01:21:34,576 --> 01:21:37,136
- Come on let's go!
- No!

691
01:21:39,296 --> 01:21:40,832
Not until you come clean.

692
01:21:41,504 --> 01:21:42,504
- What?

693
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,912
- No wonder you wouldn't
give me a straight answer.

694
01:21:45,504 --> 01:21:46,504
Hey!

695
01:21:47,744 --> 01:21:49,280
Your whole family killed.

696
01:21:52,048 --> 01:21:53,376
Did you kill them?

697
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:59,696
Did the radio
voices tell you to?

698
01:22:00,432 --> 01:22:01,690
- No!

699
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,959
When they killed my wife
and my boy... nobody helped.

700
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,168
And nobody cared, except me.

701
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:12,528
- You turn your back on
me and I'm gone!

702
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:15,344
I care!

703
01:22:16,944 --> 01:22:19,600
I care! I just...

704
01:22:21,696 --> 01:22:23,568
Hey! Who do I trust?

705
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,216
- This is magnificent!

706
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:43,999
- What's going on!

707
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,344
- It's a generator!

708
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,664
It's the most powerful
machine ever created
but it takes time to...

709
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,590
It takes time to warm up!

710
01:23:51,184 --> 01:23:54,320
In about an hour we'll reach
maximal dimensional thrust...

711
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,880
and then...

712
01:23:56,336 --> 01:23:57,808
We digitize!

713
01:24:15,136 --> 01:24:17,616
A massive tremor rocked
the western United States.

714
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:21,647
Scientists are at a loss
to explain what is causing
the worst seismic activity

715
01:24:21,648 --> 01:24:23,640
in the history of
this hemisphere.

716
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:27,360
The quakes seem to be centered
at an area called Spirit Rock.

717
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:30,688
Strangely we have no record
of a fault line in this area.

718
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,568
- The damage to property
has been tremendous.

719
01:24:35,264 --> 01:24:36,848
- Woah! Oh my god.

720
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:37,912
- Everyone hold on.

721
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,080
- What's happening!

722
01:24:52,528 --> 01:24:54,576
- We're tearing
a hole in reality!

723
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,664
And reality has mixed
feelings about it!

724
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:56,272
Daddy? Wanna play soldier?

725
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,500
- Welcome home!

726
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,680
Looks like the place
could use some work.

727
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,824
Let's go, come on, let's
make it interesting bad boy!

728
01:26:49,024 --> 01:26:52,096
Yea? You're not fighting
back, huh. Why not?

729
01:26:55,712 --> 01:27:01,979
Oh yea. You wanna die don't ya?
You want me to put you out of
your misery.

730
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:07,904
You want me to do you like I
did your wife? I enjoyed that.

731
01:27:14,336 --> 01:27:15,568
- Please!

732
01:28:28,528 --> 01:28:29,760
- I believe you.

733
01:28:40,336 --> 01:28:43,248
Get up! It's not over!

734
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:54,048
- Power!

735
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,528
The power's incredible!

736
01:29:05,184 --> 01:29:06,416
- Mr. Burroughs.

737
01:29:06,752 --> 01:29:08,080
Reese!

738
01:29:08,672 --> 01:29:10,592
Maybe we should
stop, this is crazy.

739
01:29:12,336 --> 01:29:14,304
I mean if we tear a
hole in reality...

740
01:29:14,656 --> 01:29:16,300
it will cause so much death...

741
01:29:16,528 --> 01:29:18,000
so much destruction...

742
01:29:18,304 --> 01:29:20,863
that there will be no
one left to dominate with
our immortality.

743
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:22,859
There'll be nothing
left to come back to.

744
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,392
- Come back! Why!

745
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,760
We're ascending the heavens!

746
01:29:27,856 --> 01:29:33,184
To hell with the apes! It's just
too bad that the savage will be
too late to save them.

747
01:30:16,976 --> 01:30:18,720
- Hold on!

748
01:30:54,912 --> 01:30:55,912
Get down!

749
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,288
Then cover me.

750
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,592
What?

751
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:52,448
- Minorly amusing thought.

752
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:56,416
- Tell me.

753
01:32:00,976 --> 01:32:02,429
- I just thought...

754
01:32:03,694 --> 01:32:04,976
If you were a cop...

755
01:32:05,424 --> 01:32:07,216
We'd make good partners.

756
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:11,424
I think we'd get along.

757
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:44,736
Oh my god! Go, go, go!

758
01:33:01,104 --> 01:33:02,688
- No, no!

759
01:33:05,824 --> 01:33:08,304
Put this on! Put this on!

760
01:33:12,752 --> 01:33:14,960
Please! Be careful!

761
01:33:29,584 --> 01:33:32,304
- Yes! I've done it!

762
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,152
- Reese, get them away from me!

763
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,024
- They won't hurt you!

764
01:34:01,328 --> 01:34:02,880
They're powerless in this world!

765
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,759
When the digitized
their way to divinity...

766
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,071
They triggered a deluge that
almost wiped out the human race.

767
01:34:09,072 --> 01:34:13,359
Since then whenever
mankind deciphers the universe's
most potent secrets,

768
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:18,784
these cyber gods dispatch a
savage to keep us from
destroying ourselves!

769
01:34:21,616 --> 01:34:24,912
As if any self respecting
god would give a damn!

770
01:34:36,144 --> 01:34:38,384
All exit routes from
Manhattan are clogged

771
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:40,848
as residents try to escape
from the devastation.

772
01:34:41,136 --> 01:34:43,439
Ruptures in both the
Lincoln and Holland tunnels

773
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,344
left thousands stranded as
water levels continue to rise.

774
01:34:51,664 --> 01:34:53,660
- Can you hear me!

775
01:34:55,952 --> 01:34:57,664
- Oh god.
- Take care of him!

776
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,168
A tremendous fissure
has erupted...

777
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,688
- Open the door.

778
01:35:03,728 --> 01:35:05,152
- Come on Marie!

779
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:08,829
Life as we know
it is a horror story!

780
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:13,183
The constant fear of
sickness, age and death!

781
01:35:13,184 --> 01:35:15,179
Teeth that rot!

782
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,360
A back that can't
bear to stand upright!

783
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,869
N-Open the door!

784
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:21,615
- Marie, please listen to me.

785
01:35:21,616 --> 01:35:23,610
Let go of your physical self!

786
01:35:24,048 --> 01:35:28,959
Let go! Your body is keeping
your soul from freedom!

787
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,444
- I like my body, Reese!

788
01:35:30,445 --> 01:35:34,733
I think I'll keep it even
if that means I'll eventually
rot and die!

789
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:36,959
- Well then you leave
me no choice!

790
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,600
The Prime Minister has
declared a state of emergency.

791
01:35:40,912 --> 01:35:42,272
- How stupid!

792
01:35:42,912 --> 01:35:45,040
How apelike!

793
01:35:45,104 --> 01:35:46,448
...history.

794
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,224
- Reese! No!

795
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,032
It has never been seen before.

796
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,968
Churches are filled with
panicked citizens.

797
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:09,664
Fearing that this is
the final judgement of mankind.

798
01:36:09,888 --> 01:36:12,752
If things are true,
they may just be right.

799
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,799
Buildings are burning
throughout the nation,

800
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,293
cracks in the earth have
swallowed dozens of homes

801
01:36:37,294 --> 01:36:40,576
and panicked residents
are clogging the roads
attempting to escape

802
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,062
but there is no escape.

803
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:45,712
The devastation is everywhere,
the end of the world may
just be upon us.

804
01:37:22,032 --> 01:37:26,416
Be praised the sword that
brings salvation to the world.

805
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,533
- Though cruel misfortune
plagued thy steps.

806
01:37:29,534 --> 01:37:31,568
- We offer thee now thy reward.

807
01:37:31,744 --> 01:37:35,709
- Choose now if thy will to
shed the scars of the past.

808
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:38,253
- The painful memory
of loved ones gone.

809
01:37:38,254 --> 01:37:41,679
- Or else choose to
embrace the past and
all you have become.

810
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,447
- The first road is peace.
- The other, eternal war.

811
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,439
- In defense of the
meek and needy.

812
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,992
- Choose and so it shall be.

813
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,590
Electrical power has
been partially restored.

814
01:38:27,488 --> 01:38:30,352
Fire martial reports all
fires now under control.
