00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,463
and Thornhill Industries.

Mr. Cannon.

No, not now.
Sorry.

CONNIE MCKINNON [ON TV]: --thatif the strike is not resolved

00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:37,733
within the next two weeks,third-quarter profits

12
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,169
could hit an all-time low.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,215
Savatar Software closed
up six points today.

00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,694
Nobody's talking on the record.

15
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,914
But the rumor is their
new handheld direction

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,829
finder could be
rolled out about three

17
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,787
months earlier than predicted.

18
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:51,225

ROBERT: Will you stop
making excuses for him.

42
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,479
It is time for him to
take responsibility

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,567

Why can't we get theThornhill Explorer right?

72
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,774

this, and I'm gonna

00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,383
--I don't know what to say.

187
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:32,561
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

188
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,475
Thank you.

189
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,178
I want to see him.

190
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,832
If the Explorer
hadn't fallen behind,

191
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,662
then Kevin never
would've come out here.

192
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:47,968
What do you mean?

193
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:48,925
ORRIN MERCER: Well,
I encouraged him.

194
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,536
I-- I feel responsible.

195
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,842
ROBERT: Well, don't.

196
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,452
It's not the first
project that--

197
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,367
that's fallen behind.
ORRIN MERCER: No.

198
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,629
But it was Kevin's project.

199
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,509
I told you when this
thing started to treat

200
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,381
it just like any other.

201
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,905
Let's go.

202
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:15,256
[plane engine humming]

203
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,919
ORRIN MERCER: I'm afraid
I've got some more bad

204
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:29,357
news, Robert, about Savatar.

205
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:30,837
What?

206
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,100
I didn't want you to
read it in the papers.

207
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,449
Well, tell me.

208
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,146
The rumors are true.

209
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,669
They've just released
their own version.

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,801
And it isn't a beta test.

211
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,586
It's the full deal.

212
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,937
This is gonna cost us, Robert.

213
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,505
What do we do to catch up?

214
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,029
[sighs]

215
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,465
I don't know.

216
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,732
ROBERT: Nothing ever
changes in this town.

217
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,256
ORRIN MERCER: It sure is pretty.

218
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,215
You must've lovedgrowing up here as a kid.

219
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:08,875
You know, Orrin, I
couldn't wait to leave.

220
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,702
How do we fix it?

221
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,226
Are the chips still dirty?

222
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,488
No, I think we've
got that licked.

223
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,532
ROBERT: Then, what?

224
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,707
We know the software works.

225
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,405
Well, in a cruise
missile maybe.

226
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,842
But we're trying to pack
a lot of information

227
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,149
into a device you
hold in your hand.

228
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,585
We're rechecking
all the schematics.

229
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,499
We're--

230
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:28,416
ROBERT: Orrin, how long?

231
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,331
Six months.

232
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,549
Six months.

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,682
ORRIN MERCER: It's
just bad luck.

234
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,118
It'll kill the stock.

235
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:47,783
[door opens]

236
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,481
Sorry for your loss, Robert.

237
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,312
I appreciate your help, Ian.

238
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,098
I wish the help could've beenunder happier circumstances.

239
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,490
Where is he?

240
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,361
IAN MACRAE: He's up
at the funeral parlor.

241
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,234
I'm going to go see him.

242
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,453
Of course.

243
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,323
I'll meet you there.

[clears throat]

245
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,561
You don't have to
do this, Robert.

246
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,431
Yes I do.

Orrin's already made thearrangements for you to take

252
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,030
your brother back to Boston.

253
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,685
No, I will bury him here.

254
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,778
Kevin grew up here.

255
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:04,137
Six generations of
Cannons are buried here.

256
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,790
Kevin would like that.

257
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:06,704
Yeah.

258
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,927
How long will you be staying?

259
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,103
I don't know, a few days.

260
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,105
I can't leave the
office for too long.

261
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,327
Where will you be staying?

262
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:21,415
The house

263
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,112
I closed up the house.

264
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,464
Well, then open it.

IAN MACRAE: This is
such a great place.

267
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,244
I always liked it.

268
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,291
ROBERT: Well, I always
wanted to get rid of it.

269
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,207
Kevin loved it.

Thank you, ladies.

273
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,652
Can I get you a drink, Ian?

274
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,481
Well, mineral
water, if you have it.

275
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,570
Mineral water?

276
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,701
What is it, duty or--

277
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:31,615

Well, here's to old friends.

280
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,277
It's good to see you again.

281
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,148
And you, Robert.

282
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,806
What happened, Ian?

283
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,200
It's all in the report.

284
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,724
Three nights ago,
Kevin went out fishing.

285
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,466
We found his tackle in the boat.

286
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,685
Yeah, and?

287
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,471
And when we
spoke to the owner,

288
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,517
she said he headed off inthe direction of Shad Bay.

289
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,996
The owner?

290
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,912
Yeah, he rented asmall outboard motorboat.

291
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:09,958
Which marina?

292
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,177
The one down in
Mahone Bay where we

293
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,569
used to play when we were kids.

294
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,180
I thought they turned
that into landfill.

295
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,529
IAN MACRAE: [laughs]

296
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,834
As a matter of
fact, it's running

297
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,445
the best it's been in years.

298
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,794
ROBERT: Who's the owner?

299
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,491
IAN MACRAE: Evangeline
Shaw, an American.

300
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,624
She and her husband
bought it two years ago.

301
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,106
Her husband was killed lastsummer in a boating accident.

302
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,281
You're suing a widow.

303
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:28,977
ROBERT: What are
you talking about?

304
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,413
Who's suing who?

305
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,501
IAN MACRAE: You'velaunched a wrongful death

307
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,984
ROBERT: It-- it's just
the legal department

308
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,814
doing its thing, standardoperating procedure these days.

309
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,032
IAN MACRAE: I
thought it might have

310
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,251
something to do
with what she's been

311
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,383
saying about Kevin's death.

312
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,213
What's she saying?

313
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,779
Well, that it
wasn't an accident.

314
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:01,140
[birds calling]

315
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,173
EVIE: Worms are
on sale this week.

316

BOY: Worms are cheaper,
but my uncle says squid.

317
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,178
Well, different people
use different bait.

318
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,005
BOY: Well, what do you think?

319
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,572
EVIE: Well, it depends
on what you like.

320
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,486
Now squid takes--

321
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,314
Excuse me.

322
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,315
Hi.

323
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,709
Um, I'll just be one second.

324
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,927
Squid tends to last
longer and take--

325
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,278
I-- I wonder if
I could possibly--

326
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,757
Well, I'm just
with a customer.

327
00:19:56,717 --> 00:20:01,722
Um, if I were you, I woulduse bait that works fast.

328
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:06,117
So you see these guys here?

329
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,902
Now for the kind of fish
that you're catching,

330
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:11,210
I think these will work.

331
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,820
And you know what?

332
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,952
If it doesn't, you can alwaystry the squid tomorrow.

Now, can I help you?

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,357
Yes, my name is Robert Cannon.

340
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:31,752
I believe that you
knew my brother, Kevin.

341
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,188
Could you please leave?

342
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,233
I beg your pardon?

343
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,843
Let me make it simple for you.

344
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,323
Get out.

ROBERT: No, you--
you don't understand.

346
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,891
I need to talk to you.

347
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:42,676
I'm terribly sorry aboutyour brother's death,

348
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:43,981
but I have nothing
to say to you.

349
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,592
And why is that?

350
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,508
Because you're blaming mefor your brother's death.

351
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,814
You're suing me.

352
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,207
Oh.

353
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,600
Oh, the lawsuit.

354
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,558
Yes, well, um-- no,
you don't understand.

355
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,081
Uh, I-- I'm not suing you.

356
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:00,084

Software, is suing

your company, Shaw's Marina.

358
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,436
This is nothing personal.

359
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,351
It's not personal?

360
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,874
This marina is all I have.

361
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:07,788
It's personal.

362
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,922
Right.

363
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,837
Of course it is.

364
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,317
I'll tell you what.

365
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,754
I will get my lawyers
to drop the lawsuit.

366
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,543
But I want you to tell me whyyou believe that my brother's

00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:24,935
death was not an accident.

368
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,160
All right.

369
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,859
Let me show you something.

370
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,993
You see those boats on theother side of the dock?

371
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,212
That's my rental line.

372
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,779
Which one was Kevin's?

373
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,259
Kevin's was the
one at the end.

374
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,485
Now there's no way that hisboat quit like they said it did.

375
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:53,964
Of course not.

376
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,489
These look like the latestin high-tech design.

377
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,229
Yeah, well, high tech
isn't what you want.

378
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,143
Simple is better.

379
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,101
If you say so.

380
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,407
EVIE: Simple is reliable.

381
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,887
And I keep my boats
in tip-top shape.

382
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,847
I believe you do.

383
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,676
Five bucks says itstarts on the first pull.

384
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:10,981
That's three dollars
American, you know?

385
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,026
You're on.

386
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,375
You sure you can handle it?

387
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,682
I'll make sure the
plant cuts a check.

388
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:16,596
[laughs]

389
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,425
[engine starts]

390
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,993
How about double or nothing?

391
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:23,864
Sure.

392
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:30,740
[engine starts]

393
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,222
[pulls rope]

394
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,179

395
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,576
[engine starts]

396
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,234
[engine starts]

397
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,236
Well, what does that prove?

398
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,239
It proves that they'll startunder ideal circumstances.

399
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,068
Oh, you're tough.

400
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,983
You own your own company, right?ROBERT: Yes.

401
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,463
Why?

402
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,509
Well, it's just funny
because Kevin mentioned

403
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,772
that he had a boss, but he neversaid anything about a brother.

404
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,084
Excuse me.

405
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:15,829
[sighs]

406
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,355
[bells ringing]

407
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,496
It was a beautiful service.

408
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:35,109
I'm sure Kevin would
have appreciated it.

409
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,241
IAN MACRAE: Robert, we'reall gonna miss Kevin.

410
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,155
Mm.

411
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:53,388
EVIE: I'm really sorry.

412
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:01,918
Thank you.

413
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,616
I behaved horribly yesterday.

414
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:07,141
ROBERT: Well, I wasn't exactlya pillar of charm myself.

415
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,011
Mm.

416
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,677
Did you know Kevin well?

417
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,636
No.

418
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,811
But he was a wonderful guy.

419
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:25,681
I liked him.

420
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,081
This really is an
inappropriate time,

421
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,257
but did you look at
Kevin's fishing tackle?

422
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,436
He had very expensive gear.

423
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,308
And for gear that expensive,he never caught anything.

424
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,876
And he didn't run out of gas.

425
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,835
When they brought his boat back,his tank was still half full.

426
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,230
Thank you.

427
00:24:58,671 --> 00:24:59,802
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

428
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:15,035
[waves lapping]

429
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:19,953
[birds calling]

430
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,191
[door closes]

431
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:52,115
[beeping]

432
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:56,642
Beecham.

433
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:57,643
[laughs]

434
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:58,774
Hey, boss.

435
00:25:58,905 --> 00:25:59,645
We're all thinking of you.

436
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,255
Did the flowers arrive?

437
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,562
They did indeed.

438
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,041
Thank you.

439
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,609
And the sun shone, and
the minister was brief.

440
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,132
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
How are you doing?

441
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:11,265
When are you coming back?

442
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:12,396
I'm not sure yet.

443
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,137
I see.

444
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,748
What did you find out?

445
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,273
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Nothingdefinite so far, but there

446
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:22,102
are a few unanswered questions.

447
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,407
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
Please be careful.

448
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,105
Oh, I will.

449
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,497
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: Well,how long do you expect to be?

450
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,542
I'll arrange to send
you some more clothes.

451
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:28,587
About a week.

452
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:29,631
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: Don't worry.

453
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,764
I'll reschedule everything.

454
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,288
Even under these circumstances,it must be nice to be home.

455
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,942
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Well,it-- it would be good if I

456
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,857
could find something to eat.

457
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,642
Listen, you couldn't, uh,
order some sushi for me,

458
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:41,730
could you, from Takana's?

459
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,123
I hear they, uh, deliver.

460
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,037
[laughs]

461
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,432
Absolutely, but I think you'reout of their three-mile range.

462
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,391
You know, I'll have Mercer'sassistant go shopping for you.

463
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,568
No, no, no, no,
no, please don't.

464
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:58,442
The cupboard is full.

465
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,575
Look, there's something
I want you to do.

466
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:05,885
I want you to find out aboutand Evie Shaw, S-H-A-W,

467
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,408
first name, Evangeline.

468
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,279
Early 30s, American citizen.

469
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,892
She is the owner
of Shaw's Marina.

470
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,981
Could you do that?

471
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:16,504
[dial tone]

472
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,374
Bye.

473
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,996
ORRIN MERCER: Robert, youshouldn't be in today.

474
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,345
MAN: Did we get that shipment?

475
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,912
Unless we get the
Thornhill Explorer up

476
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,957
and running right
quick, our stock prices

477
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,351
are gonna melt down to China.

478
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,919
You just buried your
brother yesterday.

479
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,573
Nothing more I can do for him.

480
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,751
I want the latest anomalyreports, and I want them now.

481
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,145
[chattering]

482
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,627
[beeping]

483
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,150
ORRIN MERCER: The mappingsystem works fine.

484
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:58,807
But key in the intersectionof Brunswick and Duke.

485
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:02,071
[beeping]

486
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,858
Yeah, so what's the problem?

487
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,511
Sometimes theelevation function works.

488
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:08,730
Sometimes it doesn't.

489
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:09,688
[beeping]

490
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:12,865
Hm.
Right.

491
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,475
Now ask for a
view to the west.

492
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:15,694
[beeping]

493
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,607
[beep]

494
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:23,005
City Hall, past the Citadel.

495
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,093
So the memory's keyed in wrong.

496
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,442
That's all.

497
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,096
ORRIN MERCER: No, it
isn't that simple.

498
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:30,360
The actual building on thatcorner is the post office.

499
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:34,016
Not the Citadel, not CityHall, the post office.

500
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:37,019
Kevin figured that maybe
the access algorithm

501
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,542
wasn't syncing with the chip.

502
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,370
So he'd fix that, and thatwould offset something

503
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,720
else on something else.

504
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,939
And he ended up just
chasing his tail.

505
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,985
ROBERT: All right,
all right, all right.

506
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,248
Pull up the schematics.

507
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,118
Let's take a look at this.

508
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,907
[beeping]

509
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,691
ORRIN MERCER: Even thediscrepancies are inconsistent.

510
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,867
Everyone in the plant
has had a crack at this.

511
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:01,609
Well, do you mind if
I take a look at it?

512
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,132
You're the boss.

513
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:05,874
ROBERT: Orrin, how longhave we known each other?

514
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,571
ORRIN MERCER: 25 years.

515
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,532
And, uh, what was
my area of expertise?

516
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,186
Uh, computer software.

517
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,056
So don't humor me.

518
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,408
ORRIN MERCER: [laughs]

519
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,237
When was the last time
you wrote any code?

520
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:22,891
ROBERT: Yeah, well,
about six years ago.

521
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:23,674
And--

522
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,024
About six years.

523
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:26,416
--and darn tight code it was.- [laughs]

524
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:27,591
Six years is thedifference between the Pony

525
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:28,941
Express and email.

526
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,899
Ah, email, yeah.

527
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,859
All right.

528
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:38,602
All right, what do we do,keep it going or shut it down?

529
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,734
ORRIN MERCER: We
can't shut it down.

530
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,649
We put 30 million
in development.

531
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,782
Well, we can write it off.

532
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:44,957
Ugh.

533
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,960
All of Kevin's
work, for nothing?

534
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,831
I can't believe you said that.

535
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,398
Sentiment?

536
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:53,661
This is a business
decision, Orrin.

537
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,838
What are we gonna do?

538
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:57,796
Look, I'm sorry.

539
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,670
OK, here is what I'm gonna do.

540
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,760
I am gonna take this home,and I am gonna figure

541
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,894
out what is wrong with it.

542
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,331
I'll see you later, Orrin.

543
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,333
See you later.

544
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,334
[door opens]

545
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:18,338

[groans]

547
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,957
Hello.

548
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,567
EVIE: Oh, Good
morning, Mr. Cannon.

549
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:14,655
Good morning

550
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,657
[birds calling]

551
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:23,533
I, um-- I'd like to renta boat, uh, nothing fancy.

552
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,188
Um, maybe one of
these thingies here.

553
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,408
Oh, well, there's
nothing available.

554
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,018
Two of them are booked
out this afternoon,

555
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,020
and the other one
needs servicing.

556
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:33,326
Is that a big problem?

557
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:36,720
No, it's just regular
servicing, but--

558
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,722
So can you service it?

559
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:41,987
Well, I'm going to
later this afternoon.

560
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,119
How about now?

561
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,817
I'm busy now.

562
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,341
What's the big rush?

563
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,255
Oh, I'm sorry.

564
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:52,649
I'm sorry.
I just wanted--

565
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,347
I wanted to get out there.

566
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,436
And I wanted to, uh, find thespot where they found him.

567
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,398
I'm almost finished.

568
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,660
Thank you.

569
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:04,531
I'll just wait.

570
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,493
[engine starts]

571
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,886
I'll see you later.

572
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:12,756
Thanks again.

573
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:13,670
[engine roars]

574
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:14,584
Whoa!

575
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:15,890
Whoa.

576
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,285
EVIE: You might
wanna cast off first.

577
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:20,199
[engine roars]

578
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,026
Whoa!

579
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:24,768
I don't know where I'm going.

580
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:25,682
I'll draw you a map.

581
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:30,818
Um, OK.

582
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,782
This is Shad's Passage
right here, right?

583
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:41,611
Now, right here,
as you go along,

584
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:44,484
there will be a dock
on the left, OK?

585
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:48,314
And just past that, there'sa white navigation marker.

586
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,968
That's where they
found Kevin's body.

587
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,980
[beeping]

588
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:24,393

00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,864
[music playing]

590
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,773
[sighs]

591
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,780
[engine sputtering]

592
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:50,740
[groaning]

593
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:52,742
Oh, perfect.

594
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,269
Oh.

595
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,574
Oh, ah, hey!

596
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,576
Ah!

597
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,187
Oh.

598
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,057
Shoot.

599
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,468
Hey!

600
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,560
Over here!

601
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,474
Robert!

602
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,438
[sighs]

603
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:50,365
[laughing]

604
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,630
I think the proper nauticalterm is "ahoy there."

605
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:55,501
Yeah, well.

606
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:56,458
[sighs]

607
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,504
Are you OK?

608
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,245
Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,289
Well, what happened?

610
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,725
You were supposed to be back.

611
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,337
Well, what happened was
this perfectly reliable

612
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,642
engine of yours stalled.
- Mhm.

613
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:07,861
- That's what happened.
- Mm.

614
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,602
Well, I'm surprised
you didn't use

615
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,604
your mobile phone to call yourinternational headquarters.

616
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:12,518
Yeah, well, I--

617
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,997
I forgot it.

618
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:14,911
Mm.

619
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:15,999
Mhm.

620
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,262
Do you wanna throw me a line?

621
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,132
Where?

622
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,046
Over there?

623
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,308
Mhm.

624
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,179
Ah.

625
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:25,226
EVIE: You don't have a line?

626
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:26,662
I don't see any line.

627
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:27,663
EVIE: [scoffs]

628
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:33,103
[birds calling]

629
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:42,896
Come here.

630
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,114
I wanna show you something.

631
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,341
[groans]

632
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:54,212
See?

633
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,000
I, uh-- I guess that
explains what happened.

634
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,349
That's OK.
It happens.

635
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,568
- Mhm.
- Come on, I'll tow you.

636
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,050
[bird squawking]

637
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:16,234
You see that over there?

638
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,975
That there is Spyglass Hill.

639
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:19,933
No, it's not.

640
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,196
It's called Gibbons Bluff.

641
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,676
Nope.

642
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,547
That's called Spyglass Hill.

643
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:29,247
That's the name Kevin and Igave it when we were kids.

644
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:33,729
It's a haven for
smugglers and pirates.

645
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,515
He used to spend
hours up there looking

646
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,778
out for British men of war.

647
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,083
That's cute.

648
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:41,868
ROBERT: A lot of
people died around here

649
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:47,874
looking for buried treasure,out here and down by Oak Island.

650
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,571
During Prohibition,
they used to smuggle

651
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:53,445
booze from here down to Boston.

652
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:57,275
Piracy in these parts has hada long and venerable tradition.

653
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,080
Is there, uh--

654
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,124
[clears throat]

655
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,561
--any decent restaurant in town?

656
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,171
God knows there
wasn't when I grew up.

657
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,564
I'm starving.

658
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,000
- Why don't I make you dinner.- No.

659
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,523
No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

660
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,743
Uh, you've done more thanenough, uh, for today,

661
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:31,744
thank you.

662
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:32,614
I'm actually a good cook.

663
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:33,920
No, I believe you are.

664
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,444
But, uh, no, I'll just--

665
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,402
I'll just go home.

666
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,707
And make a box of cereal.

667
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,274
No, I was thinking
a can of beans.

668
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,450
I have to shop anyway.

669
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,712
OK, yes.

670
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:44,887
Great.

671
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,149
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

672
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,194
I'll be right back.

673
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,676
I just wanna call the office.

674
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:51,764
[door opens]

675

BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:

679

ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Beecham.

680
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,861
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: Hey, boss.

681
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,645
I faxed you the informationyou asked about on Ms. Shaw.

682
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:04,820
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Uh-huh.

683
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,605
You turn up anything
interesting?

684
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:10,086
She looks pretty ordinary onpaper, except for her picture.

685
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,131
She's very attractive.

686
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,089
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
What else?

687
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,091
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: Well, Ialso got a line on a housekeeper

688
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,267
for you-- uh, a
couple, actually.

689
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,182
She does the cooking, thecleaning, the shopping.

690
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,662
And he does the gardeningand the driving.

691
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:21,750
No.

692
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,838
No, that will not be necessary.

693
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,449
Well, you sure, boss?

694
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:25,711
I mean, I know you're onlygonna be there a few days,

695
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,886
but it will make you
more comfortable.

696
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:27,930
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: No, I, uh--

697
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,323
[door opens]

698
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,281
I'd rather be alone.

699
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,719
OK, well, if you need
them, give me a call.

700
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,068
I've got their number.

701
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,939
What would I do without you?

702
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,378
Uh, if you do, uh, go home,uh, be sure to let me know.

703
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,336
Boss, you know I always
sleep at the office.

704
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,729
Attagirl.

705
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:44,599
Thank you.

706
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,082
How much do you
pay that woman?

707
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,388
Beecham?

708
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:53,347
Not enough.

709
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:56,045
Let's go.

710
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,482
ROBERT: I can't believe this.

711
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,788
They got 15 different
types of olives here.

712
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,660
Things sure have changed
since I was a kid.

713
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,445
Yeah, well, they even havearugula and Reggiano-Parmesan.

714
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,926
Yes, and fresh
seafood on the coast.

715
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:07,970
Can you believe it?

716
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:08,884
Oh.

717
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:09,798
Oops.

718
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:10,712
[laughs]

719
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:11,800
You're a little excited.

720
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:12,932
I'm gonna go get the wine.

721
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:13,846
I'll do the shop.

722
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,982
[chattering]

723
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:22,463
Boy, oh boy, real food.

724
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:23,595
You really know
what you're doing.

725
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:24,596
[laughs]

726
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,553
You, I'm not so sure about.

727
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:26,424
No, I-- I don't know.

728
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,164
I was going for healthy.

729
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,688
But then, you know, I startedgetting all these cravings.

730
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,559
And I got-- I got
caught in a time warp.

731
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,952
But, uh, listen.

732
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,475
[ITALIAN ACCENT] Smell this.Mm, that aroma.

733
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:36,216
Mm, yeah.

734
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,130
With that diet, I don't knowhow you made it through puberty.

735
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,697
- I didn't.
- [laughs]

736
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:39,872
[ITALIAN ACCENT] Here,let me, uh-- let me, please.

737
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:40,655
- No, no.
- No, no, please.

738
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:41,526
No.

739
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:44,093
No, please, let-- oh.

740
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:45,312
Let me get this.

741
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,182
[beep]

742
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,183
[cash register whirring]

743
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,056
[waves lapping]

744
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,843
You are one great cook.

745
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:56,236
Oh, thank you.

746
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,064
I used to cater in California.

747
00:40:58,194 --> 00:40:59,282
It was really nice to do this.

748
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,675
I haven't done this
in a long time.

749
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,764
That's a far cry from
catering in California

750
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:05,419
to running a marina out here.

751
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,333
True.

752
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,247
[laughs]

753
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,381
Must've been pretty toughafter your husband died, huh?

754
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,166
It was, but not in
the way that you think.

755
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,863
What do you mean?

756
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,648
It was a big surprise.

757
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,998
Why?

758
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:20,695
It was an accident.

759
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,958
Oh.

760
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:25,047
How many years were you married?

761
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,701
Three years.

762
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,616
We met in California.
We got married.

763
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,879
And then we came here
and bought the marina.

764
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,318
Now why would you wannago from California to here?

765
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,016
It was Grant's dream.

766
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:40,498
He wanted to get away
from the rat race.

767
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,501
Why'd you stay?

768
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,025
His life insurance
paid for the mortgage.

769
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:49,332
And I mean, I could've
sold it and left.

770
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,204
But then I realized
that I loved it here.

771
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:57,602
And it gave me a
sense of independence.

772
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,604
Sometimes I feel
guilty for that.

773
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:02,432
Because his death
bought you your freedom?

774
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,870
No.

775
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,176
We got married too fast.

776
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,266
Grant had this way about him.

777
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,138
He was hard to resist.

778
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:13,008
So what changed?

779
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,100
You ever wake
up in the morning

780
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,101
and you're not in
love with someone?

781
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:25,543
I felt relieved that I
didn't have to tell him.

782
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,329
So--
[sighs]

783
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,286
--have you ever been married?

784
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:34,987
Um, no.

785
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:36,554
So Kevin's your only family.

786
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:40,470
Well, our parents
died when I was 18.

787
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,516
Kevin was about six.

788
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:45,475
I guess I became more of
a father than a brother

789
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,086
to him at that point.

790
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,566
You did a great job.

791
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:49,958
No, this had
nothing to do with me.

792
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:52,831
This was entirely his doing.

793
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:57,618
He was a pretty, um,
engaging little kid.

794
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:58,793
[laughs]

795
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:01,100
Never complained
about anything.

796
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,623
I, on the other
hand, as a parent,

797
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,147
was completely hopeless.

798
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:07,410
Mm.

799
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,064
One time I took
him to the movies,

800
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:12,241
when I was in college,with some friends of mine.

801
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,374
After the, uh,
film was over, I--

802
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:17,943
I forgot all about him, andI left him in the theater.

803
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,118
That's awful.

804
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,163
About an hour
and a half later,

805
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:22,121
I realized what I had done.

806
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,209
So I went--

807
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,906
I bolted back there.

808
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:30,869
And there he was, sittingexactly where I left him.

809
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:31,783
He hadn't budged.

810
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,480
[laughs]

811
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,137
You must have felt terrible.

812
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:42,445
He-- he told me that, um,he knew that I was gonna

813
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:45,710
come back to get him and--

814
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,799
and that he appreciated
the fact that he could

815
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,236
watch the movie over again.

816
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:54,022
And then he told me
that he was sorry that--

817
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:58,592
that he made me worry about him.

818
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,210
What do you do with
a kid like that, huh?

819
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:14,086
[crying softly]

820
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:19,657
[CRYING] I can't believe I'mnever gonna see him again.

821
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:20,962
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,226
Um, thank you for
a wonderful dinner.

823
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:27,882
Wait.

824
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:28,796
Are you OK?

825
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:29,710
I'm fine.

826
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,712
I'm fine.

827
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:32,670
[sighs]

828
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:39,198
I'm sorry to be such a
poor dinner companion.

829
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:40,155
Please stay.

830
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:40,982
If you'll excuse me.

831
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:45,987
[door closes]

832
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:46,901
[door opens]

833
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:01,786
[exhales]

834
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:09,707
[sighs]

835
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:28,116
[birds chirping]

836
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,945
I am opening it as we speak.

837
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:35,907
Where's the prototype?

838
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:37,169
What Prototype

839
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,344
ROBERT [ON PHONE]:
Kevin's prototype,

840
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:39,693
the thing that got
the whole thing

841
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,086
started in the first place.Where is it?

842
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:42,261
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: So
someone is sabotaging

843
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:45,830
the Thornhill Explorer project.

844
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,701
I am absolutely sure of it.

845
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:49,529
Now here's what
I want you to do.

846
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:53,228
I want you to go and buyme the Savatar Navigator,

847
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,709
and you send it
to me right quick.

848
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,059
You think Savatar got ahold of Kevin's prototype?

849
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,582
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: You
remember the Concorde?

850
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,019
You remember how
the Russians ended

851
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:03,456
up designing a
supersonic airliner

852
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:05,632
that looked exactly like it?

853
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,590
Yeah, everyone said itwas coincident technology,

854
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,679
that the problems dictated
identical engineering

855
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,855
solutions.

856
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:13,292
Yeah, that's what
everybody said.

857
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,511
And that's what Mercer's tryingto tell me about the Explorer.

858
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:18,514
Meanwhile, 20 years later,we cut to the Russians,

859
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:19,864
and guess what?

860
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,866
Somebody sold the
Concorde design to them.

861
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:23,824
Surprise, surprise.

862
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:26,479
You get me that Navigator.

863
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:29,656
I'm gonna find out
exactly how they did it.

864
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,527
What's going on
with Shaw's Marina?

865
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:32,702
Oh, yeah.

866
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,616
[sighs]

867
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,183
Financials just came in.

868
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:37,882
It's pretty much how
Mercer described it.

869
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,753
Evangeline Shaw is
getting by, but she's

870
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,755
certainly not getting rich.

871
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,061
The balance sheet
doesn't show much more

872
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:44,149
than you can see from the dock.

873
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,759
Uh-huh.

874
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,674
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
Why the big interest?

875
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,980
Dropped the lawsuit.

876
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,676
ROBERT [ON PHONE]:
Yeah, you're right.

877
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,851
Forget about it.

878
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:51,809
She's got enough
trouble as it is.

879
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:52,722
I gotta go.

880
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,159
I'll call you later.

881
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:55,638
[hangs up phone]

882
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:01,557
[beeping]

883
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:10,479
[beeping]

884
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,960
[watch beeping]

885
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,963
Oh, shit.

886
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:19,401
[birds calling]

887
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:33,851
Hello.
- Oh, hi.

888
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:34,808
I just wanted to say that--

889
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:35,853
I was gonna--

890
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:36,984
- Oh.
- Sorry.

891
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:37,898
Sorry.

892
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:39,117
No, after you.

893
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:40,858
I was just really
worried about you

894
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:42,207
when you didn't show
up this morning.

895
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,556
Oh, yeah.

896
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:44,818
I was, uh-- I was
working on my computer.

897
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:46,646
I got lost.
[chuckles]

898
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,474
Oh.

899
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:49,779
ROBERT: Where's my boat?

900
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,520
What do you mean, "your boat"?

901
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,696
ROBERT: Well-- well, I was gonnarent a boat today, remember?

902
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,568
You said you were gonnarent a boat this morning.

903
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,004
ROBERT: Yes, well, I
was busy this morning.

904
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,353
I have a business to run.

905
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:00,529
EVIE: Well, I have a
business to run too,

906
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,661
and so I had to
rent your boat out.

907
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,097
Otherwise I would've lost money.

908
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:04,794
ROBERT: Well, uh, I wish
you would've phoned me.

909
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,187
I-- I would've paid
for the entire day.

910
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,146
Well, I did phone you,

I'll rent this boat.

Well, then I will
hire you to be my guide.

915
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,163
No, I don't think so.

917

918
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:29,819
Well, something could come up.

923
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:40,526
In fact, I'll pay you to giveme boating lessons for the week.

924
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,833
I'll pay in advance, OK?

925
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,487
I don't take out tourists.

926
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:46,358
Please?

927
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:52,973
On one condition.

00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:54,279

It's free.

Aye aye, skipper.

931
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:13,037
OK, you wanna hug
close to the shore

a little bit to
adjust to the wind.

933
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:18,172
Otherwise you're gonna
get blown out too far.

where that big tree is?

ROBERT: Yeah.

00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,832
OK, you wanna head
straight for that.

00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:33,492
EVIE: There.

940
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,929
See it?

941
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,278
Yeah.

942
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,193
When it just passes
your left shoulder,

943
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:40,542
it's gonna be safe to turn in.

944
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,896
You have any idea
what Kevin was doing

945
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,638
out here the night he died?

946
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:51,162
No, he just said
he went fishing.

947
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,815
Do you know where exactly?

948
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:54,861
EVIE: He just said that heloved fishing when he was a kid,

949
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,951
so I figured he found somesecret spot that he remembered.

950
00:49:58,082 --> 00:50:01,128
ROBERT: Kevin hatedfishing when he was a kid.

951
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,088
EVIE: Then why did he
go out every night?

952
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:06,525
You said he never
came back with anything.

953
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:09,136
He wasn't fishing.

954
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,224
That's strange.

955
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:11,312

00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:14,707

957
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:20,713

958
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,022

963
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:40,037

ORRIN MERCER: I don't like it.

965

friendly with Evie.

And you don't worry enough.

974
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:58,838
I'm hardly going to
underestimate him.

975
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:01,449
ORRIN: Get serious, Shaw.

976
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,670
You don't have to face
him day after day.

977
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,151
I tell you, he
suspects something.

978

979
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:15,333

but he won't suspect me.

981
00:51:18,162 --> 00:51:21,904
And thanks to Robert
Cannon, very rich.

982
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,344
ROBERT: This is it, isn't it?

983
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:27,519
This is where they found him.

984
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:34,787
He was missing for 36 hours.

985
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,876
The currents usually
run this way,

986
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:42,838
so he was probably up onthe west part of the island.

987
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:43,709
I don't know.

would be a lot easier.

It doesn't tell me
a great deal, does it?

992
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,206

will be coming in.

how to drive safely.

give it another try.

in Boston, I could

we were in Boston,

00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,398
I wouldn't have a thing towear because I've been working

1026

could go to Ed's Diner.

1088
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:43,818
Now what would dessert entail?

1089
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:44,689
Oh, I can't tell you.

1090
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:45,777
It's a surprise.

1091
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:47,518
Oh, come on.

1092
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,345
Just give me a little hint.- No, it wouldn't be a surprise.

1093
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:49,171
No, just a little hint.

1094
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,000
Well, all right.

1095
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:54,133
In boarding school,
this stuff was

1096
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:57,963
so good that it wasforbidden to all and sundry

1097
00:55:58,093 --> 00:55:59,138
in the lower forms.

1098
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:00,139
Really?

1099
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,184
You're gonna have to wait.

1100
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,577
Now what if I don't
have any patience?

1101
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,231
- Eat up.
- OK.

1102
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,624
[laughs]

1103
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:13,326
ROBERT: Wow.

1104
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,327
[laughs]

1105
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:19,158
Well, I wanted to strikethe proper note of respect.

1106
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:20,812
I feel like I'm being
admitted into some kind

1107
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,727
of secret society.

1108
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:25,512
That's absolutely
magnificent, my dear.

1109
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:27,340
Now you have to,
um, come over here.

1110
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:28,515
Now don't look.
Don't peek.

1111
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:29,386
OK.

1112
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:30,430
OK?

1113
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:33,955
Now you're going to sit there.

1114
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:37,524
And I'm gonna sit here, OK?

1115
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:38,830
It's like a ritual.
- All right.

1116
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,744
All right, together.
That's good.

1117
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:40,658
Now--
- [laughs]

1118
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:42,094
--close your eyes.

1119
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,487
Close your eyes.
You can't look.

1120
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:44,705
- Mhm.
- All right, ready?

1121
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:45,576
OK.

1122
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,623
No peeking.

1123
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:50,711
I'm not peeking.

1124
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,104
- OK, open them.
- Oh, my god.

1125
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:52,974
Ha, ha-ha.
Mm.

1126
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:55,020
Gosh.
[laughing]

1127
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,325
[clears throat]

1128
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,849
- Yeah.- That's your big surprise?

1129
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,372
- Yeah.
- Mars bars?

1130
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,939
No, no, no, this isn'tjust, you know, Mars Bars.

1131
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:02,375
This is, like, frozen Mars bars.

1132
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,159
- Mhm.
- What, what, what?

1133
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,813
You know about it?

1134
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:07,336
Yeah.

1135
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,729
Oh.

1136
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,688
Haven't you seen my
freezer at the marina?

1137
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:12,124
No, why?

1138
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:13,430
Well, I sell them to
the kids all the time,

1139
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,389
and I actually have
my own secret stash.

1140
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,739
You mean to tell meeverybody knows about this?

1141
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,610
Mm, yeah.

1142
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,698
This is terrible.

1143
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:21,699
- Can I eat this now--
- Yes.

1144
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:22,830
--before it melts?
OK.

1145
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:23,875
Yes, there you are, my dear.

1146
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,354
Oh, look, a chocolate.

1147
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,573
Oh god, and vanilla.
Mm.

1148
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:27,400
Mhm.
- I love this.

1149
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,054
This is so good.
Mm.

1150
00:57:29,184 --> 00:57:30,447
Mm.

1151
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:31,186
You know what my sister
and I used to do?

1152
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,536
No, what?

1153
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,582
We used to take ice
cream and Mars bars

1154
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:37,236
and peppermint crunchy things--

1155
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,933
Mhm.

1156
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:39,978
--and pistachios, and weput them all together, right?

1157
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:41,545
Mhm.

1158
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:42,633
And then we'd stuff thembetween these two graham

1159
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:43,808
crackers.

1160
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,026
And then we'd put
it by the fire.

1161
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:46,071
And then it would all melt.- Mm.

1162
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,376
And then we'd take a big bite.

1163
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:48,508
And then we'd get it
all over our face.

1164
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:49,596
- Oh, god.
- And it was so good.

1165
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:50,815
It's a terrible addiction.

1166
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:51,772
Mhm.

1167
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:52,686
Mm.

1168
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,517
What?
- Oh, nothing.

1169
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:00,955
Hm.

1170
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,352
What?

1171
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,267
I think you might, um--

1172
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,791
I think you have a little, um--

1173
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:12,010
like a little, um--

1174
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,228
- Are you trying to kiss me?- Yes.

1175
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,229
OK.
[laughs]

1176
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,100
Mm.

1177
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,730
This one's hard to open.

1178
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:38,515
Mm, oh, well, I like totake a bite out of each one

1179
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:39,516
and then lick it--
EVIE: [laughs]

1180
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:40,734
ROBERT: --and toss it away.

1181
00:58:40,865 --> 00:58:42,083
I haven't had
this much chocolate

1182
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:43,868
since I was like eight.
- Mm.

1183
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:45,739
- Oh, my god.
- This is so strange.

1184
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,697
Mhm.

1185
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:47,915
What's strange?

1186
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:48,786
This is so strange.

1187
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,962
I grew-- I grew up here.

1188
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,354
This is my room.

1189
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:53,268
Really?

1190
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,792
Mhm.

1191
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:58,883
Well, OK, where are allthe, like, airplanes and--

1192
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,058
All those little dinosaurs?

1193
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:01,407
--toy cars and
little dinosaurs.

1194
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,321
Oh.

1195
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:03,365
Oh.

1196
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,716
I, uh, had it re-- redecorated.

1197
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:06,586
Yeah.

1198
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:09,023
So what do you think?

1199
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:10,590
Oh, yeah.

1200
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:11,939
- Pretty-- pretty bland, right?- Mm.

1201
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,201
Yeah.

1202
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,202
Well, I-- you
know, I didn't even

1203
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,509
meet the interior decorator.

1204
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,641
I wanted to get
rid of this place,

1205
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,120
but Kevin wanted
to hold onto it.

1206
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:21,688
Why'd you redecorate?

1207
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:22,559
It's a long story.

1208
00:59:29,304 --> 00:59:34,614
My dad bought this place formy mom cause she was sick.

1209
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:37,574
Now he thought that maybe thecountry would-- would help,

1210
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:38,575
do her some good.

1211
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:39,445
But it didn't, and she died.

1212
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:46,452
My father sank into a
very deep depression.

1213
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,324
A year later he killed himself.

1214
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:50,717
I'm so sorry.

1215
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:53,372
Well.

1216
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,287
Well, I still had Kevin.

1217
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:56,593
And Kevin had you.

1218
00:59:56,723 --> 01:00:00,335
No, not really, not at first.

1219
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,947
I pushed him away.

1220
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:07,212
But everywhere I went,there he was, looking at me.

1221
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:10,737
After school doing
my homework, I--

1222
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:11,782
finally, I went up to him.

1223
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:12,609
And I said, what do you want?

1224
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:22,357
He looked at me, and heasked, are you gonna die too?

1225
01:00:22,488 --> 01:00:23,358
Are you gonna go away?

1226
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:34,282
I-- I let him down.

1227
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,196
EVIE: No, you didn't.

1228
01:00:39,418 --> 01:00:40,506

1235
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:28,728
You scared me.

1236
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:29,903
I'm sorry.

1237
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:32,123
Oh, well, you just--

I'm snooping.

1241
01:01:40,435 --> 01:01:41,610
Oh, you're snooping.

1242
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:42,655
Mhm.

1243
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:43,961
And what are you snooping at?

1244
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:45,440
I just wanted to
see if I was right.

1245
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:46,703
About what?

1246

Yes.

1248
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:52,056
Ah!

Yes!

1250
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,842
You see, Kevin never
unwrapped his lures.

1251
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:56,713
Hey, what is that?

1252
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,413
This is Kevin's prototype.

1253
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:02,631

1257
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:06,723

I promise there are no
Mars bars on this tray.

1267
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:56,006
[pouring]

1268
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:59,444
What's wrong?

1269
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:00,401
Come over here.

1270
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:03,840
Take a look at this.

1271
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,319
[sighs]

1272
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,844
This is what Kevin was
working on when he died,

1273
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:11,021
the Thornhill Explorer.

1274
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:12,849
You tell it, uh,
where you wanna go,

1275
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:15,199
and it'll show you
how to get there.

1276
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:17,027
Well, it's a great idea.

1277
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:20,595
Yeah, except it doesn't work.

1278
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:24,556
And this here is the
Savatar Navigator.

1279
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:28,734
It does what this
is supposed to do.

1280
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,475
They didn't?

1281
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:35,784
Yeah, as a matter of fact,they did, and I can prove it.

1282
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,787
Take a look at this.

1283
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:41,442
That's the Explorer's software.

1284
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,270
Kevin designed that.

1285
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:47,535
He liked to play around, putlittle messages, show off.

1286
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,536
K-E-V.

1287
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,974
ROBERT: "Kevin."

1288
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,323
Now let's look at
the Savatar software.

1289
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,154
Again.

1290
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,636
See it?
There.

1291
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,116
Oh, my god.

1292
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:05,336
ROBERT: Identical software.

1293
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:06,772
It's not a coincidence.

1294
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:10,819
Kevin was murdered.

1295
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:15,650
[beep]

1296
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:21,221
I can't believe theykilled Kevin for software.

1297
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:22,744
Yeah, well, it's
worth millions to them.

1298
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:25,878
That's pretty good motive.

1299
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,707
Ah.

1300
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:32,058
I'm gonna have to buildone of these from scratch.

1301
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:34,931
Why when you
already have proof?

1302
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:38,717
Because whoever sabotagedproduction at the factory

1303
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:44,505
is behind Kevin's murder,and he's still around.

1304
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,855
Which means you can't getparts from your factory.

1305
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,031
No.

1306
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,642
And I can't trust anybody.

1307
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:54,733
I can go to Halifax for you.

1308
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:55,995
You know, you're
really something.

1309
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:02,436
[birds calling]

1310
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:12,794

1311
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:23,109

1313
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:27,635
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Hello.

1314
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:29,072
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1315
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,116
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: Ah, Beecham.

1316
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:31,161
It's OK.

1317
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,597
I didn't need a shower anyway.

1318
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:33,511
What's up?

1319
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:34,947
I'm sorry.

1320
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,862
But when you weren't
at the plant,

1321
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,777
I figured I should give
you a call at home.

1322
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,953
ROBERT [ON PHONE]:
Well, what is it?

1323
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,389
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
Evangeline Shaw.

1324
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,087
No, no, no, I--I thought we stopped all that.

1325
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:45,262
Uh, what's going on?

1326
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:47,525
More than meets
the eye, apparently.

1327
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:49,179
ROBERT [ON PHONE]:
Well, what is it now?

1328
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:50,528
Ferguson dig something up?

1329
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:53,444
Uh, she has a history
of family lunacy?

1330
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:55,011
She's got seven kids
somewhere, is that it?

1331
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,578
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
It's financial, boss.

1332
01:06:57,709 --> 01:07:02,018
Ferguson got new informationon both her and the marina.

1333
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,063
Well, then you better
tell me about it.

1334
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:05,934
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]: No, Ican't, not over the phone.

1335
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,198
It's too sensitive.

1336
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:11,592
I sent you Ferguson'sreport by encrypted email.

1337
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:14,813
Boss, I'm sorry to
say that Kevin's

1338
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:17,555
name appears all through it.

1339
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:20,384
Kevin?

1340
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:23,256
[beeping]

1341
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:25,824
Who else knows about this?

1342
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:29,436
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
Just me and Ferguson.

1343
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,786
ROBERT [ON PHONE]: I wantyou to keep this between us.

1344
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,137
Absolutely.

1345
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:35,094
[sighs]

1346
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:36,269
What do you wanna do?

1347
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,141
Play along.

1348
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,317
Someone went to a lot of
trouble to set this up.

1349
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,579
BEECHAM [ON PHONE]:
Oh, boss, come on.

1350
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,624
This is getting really scary.

1351
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,799
Kevin's dead because of this.

1352
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,062
Don't do anything foolish.

1353
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:46,932
Oh.

1354
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,977
Well, I have no choice.

1355
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:50,936
I'm gonna have to shake
this tree real hard

1356
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,416
and see what falls out.

1357
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:53,243
[door closes]

1358
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:56,507
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

[beep]

1360
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:01,642
EVIE: Oh, my god, this
stuff is so expensive.

1361
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:04,515
This guy thought that I wasthis real high-tech junkie.

1362
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,344
Oh, I stopped by the marina,and I got these tide tables too.

1363
01:08:07,474 --> 01:08:11,739
And-- what?

1364
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,876
I-- I thought you told
me that, uh, the marina

1365
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,486
didn't make a profit last year.

1366
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,706
EVIE: No, it didn't.

1367
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:23,142
And-- and you--

1368
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:25,362
you haven't bought a new
dress in over two years,

1369
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:27,059
is that right?

1370
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,409
Well, I haven't had
to until last night.

1371
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,368
ROBERT: And-- and you knewmy brother, Kevin, only--

1372
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:33,892
only to talk to him?

1373
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:35,850
All right, what's going on?

1374
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:38,244
- Tell me about "lantern."- "Lantern"?

1375
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,985
Tell me about "beagles."

1376
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,421
EVIE: "Beagles"?

1377
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:43,075
When was the last time
you were in Switzerland?

1378
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:45,251
Uh, Grant and I went
there two years ago.

1379
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:47,906
And while you were there,did you happen to visit Davos,

1380
01:08:48,036 --> 01:08:50,822
visit a charming,
discreet little bank?

1381
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:52,215
What?

1382
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:54,173
Take a look at this.

1383
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:58,177
A series of deposits in a Swissbank account, Shaw's Marina,

1384
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,483
in your name.

1385
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:00,919
What are you talking about?

1386
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:03,313
What I'm talking about
is deposits of 600,000

1387
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:08,883
in your name, deposits1,200,000 in your name, deposits

1388
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:12,017
of 450,000 in your name.

1389
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,323
[laughs]

1390
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,107
I would know if I
had that much money.

1391
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:16,369
You do.

1392
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,460
This is your account,
your passwords.

1393
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,114
Password, "lantern."

1394
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,072
Password, "beagles."

1395
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:27,163
Oh, and-- and one other
thing, coincidentally,

1396
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:30,644
the date of the deposits
coincides with the dates

1397
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,733
of Kevin's visits here.

1398
01:09:32,864 --> 01:09:36,650
That's a pretty good racketyou've got here, Shaw's Marina.

1399
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:38,565
You must think we're
all chumps, don't you?

1400
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,176
Is that what you thought
Kevin was, a chump?

1401
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:41,699
Wait a second.

1402
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:43,962
You're accusing me ofsleeping with your brother

1403
01:09:44,092 --> 01:09:45,355
in order to rip you off?

1404
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,835
I am accusing you of
stealing his designs

1405
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,446
and selling them
to the competition.

1406
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:50,664
That's what I'm accusing you of.

1407
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,013
Ugh.

1408
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:54,102
What do I know about
computer software?

1409
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,843
You don't have
to know anything.

1410
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:57,976
All you have to do is slip a--a disk into somebody's pocket.

1411
01:09:58,106 --> 01:09:59,804
Now why would he do that?

1412
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:00,674
Because he was jealous.

1413
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,202
Of you?

1414
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:08,726
You knew this whole houseof cards was gonna fall down.

1415
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,728
That's why you started thisaffair with me, isn't it?

1416
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:12,033
Oh, we had an affair.

1417
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:14,471
ROBERT: It all went
according to plan.

1418
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,690
"Keep your friends close andyour enemies even closer."

1419
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:19,302
What do I know about computersoftware and money laundering?

1420
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,652
ROBERT: Everything that
your husband taught you.

1421
01:10:21,782 --> 01:10:23,393
Or is this just coincidence?

1422
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:27,658
You--
[scoffs]

1423
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,444
You want to believe this.

1424
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:33,664
You let me into your life.

1425
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:34,752
You trust me.

1426
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:37,102
And now you're pushing me away.

1427
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,626
You'd rather believe that yourown brother sold you out than

1428
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:42,325
admit that you care about me.

1429
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:44,022
It's OK.

1430
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,067
If you're that afraid, go ahead.

1431
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:47,068
Call the cops.

1432
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:52,944
[keys jangling]

1433
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,380
Oh.

You really think shewas in on this with Kevin?

1438

Security dug up the secretbank accounts in Switzerland.

1439
01:11:16,402 --> 01:11:18,274
I don't think it.
I got proof.

1440
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,670
It's hard to believe.

1441
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:24,584
It explains everything.

1442
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:26,325
It explains the delays.

1443
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:28,893
It explains the disasters, whyyou couldn't get to the root

1444
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,897
of it, why it kept changing.

1445
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:35,029
I guess I should'vekept a closer eye on him.

1446
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:38,903
I don't know what I did wrong.

1447
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:46,171
I just wanted what
was best for him.

1448
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,216
ORRIN MERCER: You tried, Robert.

1449
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:49,740
Kevin had to learn
to help himself.

1450
01:11:58,488 --> 01:11:59,750
I'm real sorry about this.

1451
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:13,111
So am I.

1453
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:24,122
But why are you arguing with me?

1454
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,863
I wanna press charges.
In fact--

1455
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:27,168
- There is not enough evidence--- --I want you to press charges.

1456
01:12:27,299 --> 01:12:28,344
--to lay a charge.

1457
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:29,736
Oh, with all my
foreign accounts--

1458
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:31,172
Oh, you sound like
you're proud of that.

1459
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:31,956
--why am I stillselling worms to tourists?

1460
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:32,870
It's quite obvious.

1461
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,132
Because you're covering.

1462
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:35,263
- Oh, please.
- You're covering up.

1463
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,308
You're-- you're laying down.

1464
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:37,788
Look, I've got evidence here.

1465

I've got bank statements.

1466
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:40,617
I've got deposit times.

01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:41,748
I've got signatories.

1468
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:43,402
I've even got passwords here.

1469
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:44,751
I want her arrested.
- This is insane.

1470
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:46,100
- Gimme that.
- All right, I'll take--

1471
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,798
I want her in jail.

1472
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,930
I'll take this evidence,and I'll look into any charges

1473
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,105
that have to be laid.

1474
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:53,543
Oh, you're gonna
arrest me, Ian?

1475
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:54,805
No, I'm not.

1476
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:55,849
But, Evie, I don't
want you to leave

1477

1478
01:12:57,721 --> 01:13:00,114
Oh, well, where am I gonnago with all my accounts frozen?

1480
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:30,318
Well, Cannon is convincedthat Evie and his brother

1481
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:33,583
sold the plans to Savatar.

1482
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,975
He found the money
you put their account.

Controlled by the Widow Shaw.

1484
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:42,200

1486

1487
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:51,557
Well, now what?

1488
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:56,127
Now all we have to
do is get out of here.

[LAUGHING] I don't
have to go anywhere.

1490
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:00,305
Cannon doesn't
suspect me at all.

1491
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,743
Yeah, you're squeaky clean.

1492
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:07,355
This is my lovely wife.

1493
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:09,880
I'm going to take Evie
on our second honeymoon.

That's crazy.

1496
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:13,884
Well, I think she's earnedit, having to survive

1497
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:15,625
the past year without me.

1498
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:16,974
You can't come out of hiding.

01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:18,323
GRANT SHAW: Why not?

1500
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,456
I mean, who do you
think this is all for?

1501
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:22,153
It costs a lot to keep
a young wife happy.

1502
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:25,156
And I want to make
Evie very happy.

1503
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:27,071
Even though I had your bossfind a couple of million,

1504
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,987
there's more than enough leftover for us and Evie too.

1505
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:31,292
But she thinks you're dead.

1506
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:32,598
What if she doesn't
wanna go with you?

1507
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:34,992
Well-- well, what if
she goes to Cannon?

1508
01:14:35,122 --> 01:14:36,080
Then I'll take care of Cannon.

No.

- You're squeamish.

- --any more killing.
- You're squeamish.

1513
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:43,522
Kevin's death--
- All we had to do--

1514
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:44,741
- --was unfortunate.- --was keep Kevin quiet--

- --for a couple of weeks.- --you can't just turn it off--

1517
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:49,702
That's all we had to do.We shouldn't have killed him.

1518

- --whenever you feel like it.- I told you not to--

Grow up, Mercer.

01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:52,183
It's not a road.

01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:53,967
It's a roller coaster ride.

We made beer moneypirating computer programs.

Oh, oh-- oh, no, nothing
like this, of course.

01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:21,000
And when Mercer got the jobrunning the Thornhill plant,

1576
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:24,569
I bought the marina,
and we waited.

01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,052

01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:32,011
With all that money
we'd get, he and I

1580
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:35,014
could just take off forever.

I just figured nobody
would suspect you.

01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:06,698

to the marina's accounts
