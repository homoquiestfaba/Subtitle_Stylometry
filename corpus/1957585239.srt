1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,460
(bugs chirping)

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,030
(owl hoots)

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,150
- [George] Once in a
world much like our own,

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,490
there existed a lush, ancient,

5
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,020
and some say enchanted forest.

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,120
The forest hid many secrets;

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,630
rivers that would sing beautiful

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,250
melodies to you, floating lights,

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,970
magical stones that could take you

10
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,860
to places you couldn't imagine.

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,630
And children that never aged.

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,480
In the same forest, though,
lived more sinister beings.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,760
They came from they dark,
uncharted parts of the forest.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,520
They sought to overthrow the
sovereign ruler of their realm.

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,810
And together these two forces fought,

16
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,480
and continue to fight, to this day.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,880
- [Matthew] Can't you tell us

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,900
something that actually happened?

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,630
- [Renee] Matthew, don't interrupt.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,300
(dramatic atmosphere music)

21
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,450
- All right kids, it's bedtime.

22
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,390
School's in the morning.

23
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,550
- Yeah, grandpa's tired of his stories.

24
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,530
- [Matthew] Goodnight.

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,430
- Goodnight grandpa.

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
- Love you.

27
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,100
- All right, love you.

28
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,540
Love you, Luke buddy.

29
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,460
Get in there.

30
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,030
- You always bring the best out in them.

31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,490
I wish I could do that.

32
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,800
- You'll get the hang of it.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Comes with age.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,860
- How are you doing?

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
I'm more worried about you.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,270
- Don't waste your worry on me.

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,860
Between Dr. Andrews and the folks

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,270
at church I've got all the prayer,

39
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,100
care and casserole I can handle.

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,660
I'll be fine.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,570
You know, when your sister was about

42
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,750
their age, she went through a lot.

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,820
She was feisty and she was

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,150
quite the fighter to be honest.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,690
But she got through it.

46
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,270
They're gonna be fine.

47
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,630
- Okay dad.

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,830
- Goodnight sweetheart.

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,170
- Goodnight dad.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,870
Hey.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,310
Don't forget your meds.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,480
- Ehhh.
- Ehhh.

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,140
(phone rings)

54
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,500
- Hello?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,730
- Hi baby.

56
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,600
Is it late?

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,950
I mean is it late in Paris?

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,520
- Yeah, it's a little after 3 AM.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,650
What's going on, you okay?

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,100
- Yeah, I'm fine, just
miss hearing your voice.

61
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,630
- I miss you too sweetheart.

62
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,530
How are things holding up?

63
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,370
- This is harder than I expected.

64
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,630
Dad's doing the best he can,
but I'm worried about him too.

65
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,620
I think he's getting worse.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,590
- I know.

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,930
I'll be back Monday morning.

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,880
Just try to survive the weekend.

69
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,560
I'd love to talk, but my meeting's

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,710
in five hours and I gotta get some sleep.

71
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,130
- Sorry for calling so late.

72
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,120
- Hey, don't worry about it.

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,100
- I love you Tim.

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,070
- I love you too sweetheart.

75
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,290
Sleep well.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
- Okay.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,630
Night.

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,710
(somber piano music)

79
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,200
(dramatic atmosphere music)

80
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,550
- [Shiloh] You know how this ends.

81
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,080
- [Tanion] Let's play
our game then shall we?

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,120
- [Shiloh] Renee, I need your help.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
- I'm gonna take my walk.

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,910
- All right.

85
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,010
You take your meds?

86
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,010
- Yes, yes.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,450
(door slams)

88
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,800
- Three, two, one.

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,710
(alarm blares)

90
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,720
- Luke.

91
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,280
Get up!

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,590
- I don't wanna get up.

93
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,990
- [David] What's new?

94
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,820
Get up!

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
- What day is it?

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,430
- Get up!

97
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,420
- So how did everyone sleep?

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,180
How did everyone sleep, I asked.

99
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,010
- Fine.

100
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,580
- All right.

101
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,160
T-minus 10 minutes before we're

102
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,510
on the road to school okay?

103
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,700
Okay?

104
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,140
- 'Sup?

105
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,970
- What's up?

106
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,680
- Jade, hi.

107
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,510
- Good morning.

108
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,030
- Do you wanna go have
coffee in the morning?

109
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,990
Maybe to, I don't know,
catch up, a bit of a break?

110
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,820
- Yeah.

111
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,050
The bakery down the
street has a good brew.

112
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,610
8:30?

113
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,440
- 8:30.

114
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,270
- All right.

115
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,100
- Great.

116
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,000
- Drive safe.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,830
- Thanks

118
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,660
- Bye.

119
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,690
- Have a good day.

120
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,940
- Renee?

121
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,720
You better wake up.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,930
You have that test today.

123
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,240
- Hey guys, break it up.

124
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,780
- [Teacher] That's one of the reasons why

125
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,290
the moon landing is so
important, the Soviets

126
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,540
beat us at absolutely everything else

127
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,410
in space, so the moon landing becomes

128
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,930
the United States' first major success.

129
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,200
Mr. Adams, this is the second time

130
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,740
I've talked to you about your hat.

131
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,900
You can come and get it
from me after school, 2:30.

132
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,570
2:40, I put it online.

133
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,290
(laughing)

134
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,120
So.

135
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,920
- [Teacher] In this
illustration you'll see

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,490
where it is upright, it's more dull,

137
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,680
it's not as interesting, and then

138
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,660
in this one it's leaning, it looks

139
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,590
more urgent, you can see where

140
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,250
it's sprinting, the head is down.

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,130
- Dropped your books David.

142
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,070
You gonna pick them up?

143
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,270
Or do you want your mom
to get them for you?

144
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,580
- Matthew!

145
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,190
Let him go Matthew.

146
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,400
Now.

147
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,580
- He was messing with David!

148
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,890
- Nuh-uh, I didn't do nothing!

149
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,620
- Joe, I saw what happened.

150
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,540
You're both going to
Principal Corey's office now.

151
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,380
Come on.

152
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,260
- I've called your parents.

153
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,970
Guardians.

154
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,770
And we've agreed that neither
of you will get detention.

155
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,950
But this has to stop.

156
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,290
I better not see you back in my

157
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,240
office for the same thing again.

158
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,400
Either of you.

159
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,260
- Matthew!

160
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,280
Hang on.

161
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,400
Returning violence for violence
doesn't solve anything.

162
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,040
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

163
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,090
- If you're having issues like this,

164
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,940
I'm here to help you through them, okay?

165
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,230
- Yeah.

166
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,660
- I know that what you're
going through is hard.

167
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,360
- Miss Carmi, I'd rather
not talk about it.

168
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,280
- I know, but maybe you should.

169
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,630
Losing a parent is one of the

170
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,730
hardest things you can go through.

171
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,980
- I just wish I can escape.

172
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,330
- Sometimes facing reality is the

173
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,070
most courageous thing you can do.

174
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,270
Now get to class.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,480
(somber piano music)

176
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,320
- Another fight Matthew?

177
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,150
Really?

178
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,850
- Aunt Alice?

179
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,680
- Mmmhm?

180
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,660
Matthew!

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,120
Are you throwing that
ball in the house again?

182
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,050
- No!

183
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,710
That was David!

184
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,240
- Mmmhm, all right.

185
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,620
Put the ball down and back away slowly!

186
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,160
- Do you miss her?

187
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,620
- Every day.

188
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,030
- What was she like when she was my age?

189
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,120
- She was full of love.

190
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,060
I mean I swear it was like
her superpower or something.

191
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,300
You're a lot like her like that.

192
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,770
Smart like David,
adventurous like Matthew.

193
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,970
A lot like her.

194
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,300
I remember a time where
she ran away from home.

195
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,920
Didn't tell us where she
was going, just gone.

196
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,800
We were so worried.

197
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,570
I mean we were worried.

198
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,030
And then the next morning
she just popped back up.

199
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,980
She and Grandpa George had a long

200
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,570
conversation, I mean a long one,

201
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,380
and your Grandma Martha was so mad.

202
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,630
(chuckles)

203
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,300
And dad.

204
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,840
He just said let it go.

205
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,360
Just let it go.

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,810
So to answer your question.

207
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,980
Do I miss her?

208
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,940
Every day.

209
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,030
(somber piano music)

210
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,810
- Hey.

211
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,970
- I just finished this, I
thought you might like it.

212
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,440
- I don't really have time to
read for fun right now, Luke.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,270
- It's really good, I just thought--

214
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,950
- I have a lot of homework to do, okay?

215
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,440
- I know, I just--

216
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,630
- Just leave me alone.

217
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,320
Please.

218
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,040
- Aunt Alice told you
not to throw that inside.

219
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,240
(dramatic atmosphere music)

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,830
- [Shiloh] You know how this ends.

221
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,060
- [Tanion] Overconfidence has killed gods.

222
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,680
- [Shiloh] No, never a god.

223
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,310
Only those who thought they were.

224
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,850
Renee?

225
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,390
Renee?

226
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,930
- Stop it.

227
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,580
- Stop being such a nerd.

228
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,540
Let's go play catch.

229
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,700
- I'm not sure insulting someone

230
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,590
is the best way to preface a request.

231
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,960
- Does that mean no?

232
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,660
- Go ask Luke.

233
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,830
- I don't wanna go ask Luke.

234
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,840
- Fine.

235
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,670
10 minutes.

236
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,150
I've gotta put my books upstairs.

237
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,520
- So why does that kid bully you?

238
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,130
- I don't know.

239
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,530
Hey, don't throw it that hard.

240
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,380
- Learn to catch.

241
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,550
- Thanks for sticking up for me in school.

242
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,840
You know you don't have to do that.

243
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,670
- Hey, you're my brother.

244
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,600
Only I get to bully you.

245
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,250
- Mom would seriously
be so mad if she knew

246
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,840
you were getting into fights at school.

247
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,270
- Yeah, maybe.

248
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,270
- I have to go inside
and finish my homework.

249
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,780
- All right, I didn't get a chance

250
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,280
to cook dinner, so I hope this is okay.

251
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
- Are you kidding?

252
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
There's food on the table.

253
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,910
We are blessed, thank you Lord.

254
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,760
Can I have the beans?

255
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,590
- I think it's delicious.

256
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,540
- Oh great, thank you.

257
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,650
- So Luke, did you read
that book I gave you?

258
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,180
- [Luke] Yeah, it was really good.

259
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,540
- [David] I got an A
on my math test today.

260
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,810
- [Alice] Oh good, congratulations.

261
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,640
- We had a math test today?

262
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,590
- Yeah, it was when you were
in Principal Cory's office.

263
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,680
- Yeah, great.

264
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,730
- I think I wanna play
basketball next year.

265
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,310
- Yeah right, like you'd make a team.

266
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,380
- Hey.

267
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,720
Your dad says you should always try out.

268
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,310
- I think you should definitely try,

269
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,450
and I'll tell you what, after we're done

270
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,280
eating here I'm gonna take you

271
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
outside and show you a few things.

272
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,770
What?

273
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,540
When I was in high school, I'll have you

274
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,490
know I was the high scorer on our team.

275
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,990
- Oh wow.

276
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,840
- Just after basketball was invented.

277
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,980
(laughing)

278
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,040
All right kids, look.

279
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,330
I'm gonna go have coffee with

280
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,440
Ms. Carmi in the morning.

281
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,350
Grandpa George is in charge,

282
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,320
I want you to be good, you hear me?

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,800
- So you know what that means.

284
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,880
Fun fun fun!

285
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,420
(laughing)

286
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,520
We'll go to the park
and get some exercise.

287
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Maybe after that we'll
have some ice cream then.

288
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,030
We'll put some candy in it.

289
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,020
- Don't you dare!

290
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,290
- Well don't make fun of me then.

291
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,320
- [Alice] I'm sorry, it slipped.

292
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,530
It was a freudian slip.

293
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,070
- Don't make me sound
like I'm Fred Flintstone.

294
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,240
(laughing)

295
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,880
- [Alice] Okay, well close to it though.

296
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,720
(laughing)

297
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,130
- Oh god, I'm sorry.
- Oh man.

298
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,430
(dramatic atmosphere music)

299
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,390
- Mom?

300
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,230
- Hmmm?

301
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,680
- Did you just see that?

302
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,180
- I didn't see anything honey.

303
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,240
No running!

304
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,670
(music intensifies)

305
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,250
(serene atmosphere music)

306
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,670
- Hello?

307
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,960
What is this place?

308
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,900
You found that rock thing too?

309
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,980
- This place seems really old.

310
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,360
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

311
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,030
- Don't.

312
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,350
Could be dangerous.

313
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,160
(low rumbling)

314
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,810
What is that?

315
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,200
(deep otherworldly screech)

316
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,070
- Go!

317
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,520
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

318
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
- Hey!

319
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,540
- No running!

320
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,690
- [Matthew] What was that?

321
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,070
What happened?

322
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,500
Luke get out, we're talking!

323
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,730
- This is my room too.

324
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,560
- Get out!

325
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,180
- That may have been a little harsh.

326
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,620
- What happened to you
when you touched that rock?

327
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,580
- I had some sort of vision, there was--

328
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,960
- What's going on?

329
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,050
What were you guys talking about?

330
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,040
- None of your business!

331
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
- She should know.

332
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
- [Renee] Should I be nervous?

333
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
- Well I'm not really sure this will

334
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,890
make any sense, but we somehow ended up--

335
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,280
- Renee, your journal.

336
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,220
- My journal?

337
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,590
You were reading my journal?

338
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,420
- [David] Focus!

339
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,520
What about the journal?

340
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,810
- My dreams.

341
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,640
I've been having these
weird dreams about a forest.

342
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,320
There are these two men.

343
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,470
One of them was holding a rock.

344
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,300
- Renee...

345
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,820
Was this the rock?

346
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
This could be a coincidence.

347
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,370
- Yeah, no.

348
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,200
- There has to be some
logical explanation.

349
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,580
- Hey guys, make sure...

350
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,440
Everything all right?

351
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,500
Oh that's a neat--

352
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,340
- [David] No, it's--

353
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,890
- [Matthew] It's just a rock we found.

354
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,930
- Okay.

355
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,130
Homework.

356
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,960
Get it done.

357
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,250
Tonight.

358
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,800
- We've gotta go back.

359
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,670
- I think so too.

360
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,800
- You guys aren't thinking this through.

361
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,500
We don't know anything about this place

362
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,080
except that something
there was hunting us.

363
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,350
Sleep on it, we'll decide in the morning.

364
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,410
(somber piano music)

365
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,320
(ominous atmosphere music)

366
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,540
- What are you doing?

367
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,730
- Nothing.

368
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,800
- Are you looking for the stone?

369
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,690
- [Matthew] No.

370
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,650
- You were gonna take it.

371
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,720
- I was not and it doesn't matter.

372
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,550
It's not there.

373
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,790
- It's not there?

374
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,240
- [Matthew] I wanna know.

375
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,100
- Renee.

376
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,800
- What are you guys doing in here?

377
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,670
- [Matthew] The rock is gone.

378
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,340
(dramatic atmosphere music)

379
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
- See?

380
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,310
It's nothing.

381
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
- Hey David?

382
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,770
- What?

383
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,770
- It wasn't nothing.

384
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
- Mom?

385
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,650
- Honey.

386
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,230
(music swells)

387
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,160
David, Matthew.

388
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,070
I cannot stay long.

389
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,650
(low rumbling)

390
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,500
It's not safe here.

391
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,340
You have to stick together.

392
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,570
And trust one another.

393
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,820
I love you all.

394
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,480
Be sure to find--

395
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,960
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

396
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,630
(deep otherworldly screech)

397
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,560
- There's nothing there.

398
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,810
What are we running from?

399
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,140
Very good, nice shot, good form.

400
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,250
Might wanna keep your
wrist straighter though,

401
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,170
it'll give you a bit more power.

402
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,340
So who are you lot then?

403
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,390
- I'm Matthew.

404
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,530
- Wait a minute.

405
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,660
Who are you?

406
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,860
Why should we trust you?

407
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,190
- My name's Elza.

408
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,510
And I'm not asking for your trust,

409
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,260
I'm only asking for your name.

410
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,220
You owe me at least that much with him

411
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,450
trying to punch me in the face.

412
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,650
- He's got a fair point.

413
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,340
I'm Renee.

414
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,370
- David.

415
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,590
- Well the pleasure is mine I am sure.

416
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,870
So tell me, what are we
looking for in this field?

417
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,630
- There was something chasing us.

418
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,460
- Yeah.

419
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,610
It had this hood and was all like.

420
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,200
(loud screech)

421
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,110
(laughs)

422
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,860
- Well if it sounded like that,

423
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,870
it's probably nothing to be afraid of.

424
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,360
Nothing like a good laugh
to start a friendship huh?

425
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,050
Well so you're not Cadia natives then.

426
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,150
You're tourists from Skia.

427
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,870
- What's Skia?

428
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
- It's what we call your world here.

429
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,800
Is it Ee-arth?

430
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,750
Earth!

431
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,580
Earth, that's it, Earth.

432
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,920
Yes, yes, very good.

433
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,090
Well I should probably
take care of you then.

434
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,740
It's a big forest, there's
lots of scary stuff about.

435
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,910
Come along then.

436
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,500
(dramatic atmosphere music)

437
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,250
- All right, I'll let you sleep.

438
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

439
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,000
- How is your dad doing?

440
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,800
- He's fine.

441
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,320
The treatments are getting harder,

442
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,050
but the doctor's saying
he's doing really well.

443
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,920
- Good.

444
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,690
He's a fighter, he'll be okay.

445
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,010
- Yeah, he will, he will.

446
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,290
- And you're fine through all of this?

447
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,540
- Oh yeah, I'm good.

448
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,640
- Yeah?

449
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,470
- Yeah.

450
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,930
Stop it, I am fine.

451
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,850
- Alice, I grew up in a small town.

452
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,470
I never met my dad face to
face, but he would call.

453
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,020
My stepdad raised me with my mom.

454
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,830
Mom was a saint, and my
stepdad really loved me,

455
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,020
but I just didn't get
along with the other kids.

456
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,480
So, when I was ready, I left.

457
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,750
I spent time traveling and learning.

458
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,010
I spent time teaching in the

459
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,550
inner cities, rural areas, everywhere.

460
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,970
What I learned is no matter

461
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,420
where you go, people wear masks.

462
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,670
They act like everything's okay.

463
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,200
Not just the kids.

464
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,660
Adults too.

465
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,880
It only causes more pain for them.

466
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,640
So can you be honest with me?

467
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,550
Please.

468
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,470
- Jade, it's so hard.

469
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,640
It's so hard.

470
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,130
I feel like I'm drowning.

471
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,100
There's so many bills and
dad's cancer is getting worse.

472
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,480
Tim can pay for it, but he's never home.

473
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,640
I feel like I need a
miracle to get through this.

474
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,120
- Then call me a miracle
because I want to help you.

475
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,370
I'll be here for you whenever you need me.

476
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,450
(somber piano music)

477
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,880
- This is good coffee.

478
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,130
(laughing)

479
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,840
(George chuckles)

480
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,470
- Solve that, Vanna White.

481
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,320
Okay.

482
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,460
Here we go, now that goes there,

483
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,770
you go there, and you go...

484
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,310
(laughs)

485
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,140
Yessir.

486
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,880
(owl hoots)

487
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,680
- [Barsa] Our first priority
should be finding Luke.

488
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,860
- [Tangi] Yeah.

489
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,320
- [Barsa] (mumbles) will be
important in the final outcome.

490
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,300
- [Yakun] At this point
everybody's important.

491
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,750
Tanion's army is growing day by day.

492
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,340
We need to make sure--

493
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,010
- [Tangi] (mumbles).

494
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,740
(dramatic atmosphere music)

495
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,840
- [Barsa] Who are you?

496
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,260
- I'm Matthew.

497
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm not from here.

498
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
- [Barsa] Well where are you from?

499
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,230
- Skia.

500
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,380
Who are you?

501
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,420
- [Barsa] What do we do?

502
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,960
- [Grest] He seems harmless.

503
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,280
- [Tangi] Yeah, but a lot
of things seem harmless.

504
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,500
- [Yakun] We can't fight him.

505
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,850
Look at him, we'd kill him.

506
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,300
- [Aros] He joins us.

507
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,200
But we talk with him in the morning.

508
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,670
- Let him sleep a bit.

509
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,110
- [Grest] Nice.

510
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,240
- David.

511
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,590
David!

512
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,410
- (groans) What?

513
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,640
- Matthew.

514
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,330
- Where'd he go?

515
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,670
- Oh your brother could be anywhere.

516
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,610
We can only hope he's not
caught up in the fighting.

517
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,250
Good and bad.

518
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,730
Always fighting.

519
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,980
- Who's good and who's bad?

520
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,760
- Well that depends on who you is.

521
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,620
Good and bad depend.

522
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,780
- We need to find Matthew.

523
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,690
- Well it's a very big forest.

524
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,070
We could split up and look for him.

525
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,630
- That's the problem.

526
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,030
How will we find each other?

527
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,100
- Don't worry.

528
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,100
I'll find you.

529
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,790
- Wait!

530
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,420
He just left us here?

531
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,120
- We just need to avoid that...

532
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,380
(deep otherworldly screech)

533
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,310
- That, right?

534
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,720
That's the hooded thing?

535
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,550
- Yeah.

536
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,290
(whimsical atmosphere music)

537
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,710
- [Ryloh] Are you awake?

538
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,710
- Yeah.

539
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,350
- Good morrow, Matthew.

540
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,340
I can let you try that
again if you'd like.

541
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,070
- Whatever that thing you did with

542
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,060
your hand last night, not cool.

543
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,360
- You look okay to me.

544
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,480
We're the Castaways.

545
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,390
My name's Barsa.

546
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,650
We're part of the Hodos.

547
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,630
- Right.

548
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,420
I don't know what any of that means.

549
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,690
- Look, I wish I had
more time to teach you,

550
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,830
but things move fast around here.

551
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,270
There's a war going on.

552
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,530
- You're involved in all this?

553
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,930
You're barely older than me.

554
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,160
- Look, I don't know how old I am Matthew,

555
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,660
but I think I came to Cadia
about 2,000 years ago.

556
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,080
Why did you come to Cadia Matthew?

557
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
What are you looking for?

558
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
- I'm not looking for anything.

559
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,170
I was brought here.

560
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,980
- We're all looking for something Matthew.

561
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,430
Whether we realize it or not.

562
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,680
- Hello Matthew.

563
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,950
Welcome to the Castaways.

564
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,390
Remember our duty.

565
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,280
He must choose.

566
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,800
- Don't listen to them, kid.

567
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,630
- [Barsa] Yakun.

568
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,020
- He's only been here for 35 years, Barsa.

569
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,180
I've been here for over 500
and you don't see an issue

570
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,030
with nothing changing
in that amount of time?

571
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,990
- It is changing.

572
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
- Where's the proof?

573
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,540
- Barsa's right, kid.

574
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,610
We're all looking for something,

575
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,990
just don't expect to find it here.

576
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,920
- Tangi, don't do this.

577
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,790
- We have to try.

578
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,330
The old ways don't work anymore.

579
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,070
Come with us, Aros.

580
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,510
At least hear them out.

581
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,610
(dramatic atmosphere music)

582
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,350
- Two more gone.

583
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,020
- But we've added Matthew.

584
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,960
- Problem.

585
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,790
- [Barsa] What?

586
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,510
- Bye bye!

587
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,320
Uh-oh.

588
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,060
- Yessir, yessir, yessir.

589
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,690
Oh yessir, I'll take dogs for 100 Alex.

590
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,400
I was never allowed to sleep in this long.

591
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't move.

592
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,630
Renee sweetheart.

593
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,660
Renee!

594
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,140
Oh no.

595
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,360
The journal's gone.

596
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,800
(dramatic atmosphere music)

597
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,750
He took them.

598
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,780
- Maybe we could swim across.

599
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,530
- I don't wanna risk us getting
further away from Matthew.

600
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,700
We could get separated.

601
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,210
Good thinking though.

602
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,940
- David.

603
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,360
- [David] I wonder where it goes.

604
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,520
- Only one way to find out.

605
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,230
My journal?

606
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,240
(low rumbling)

607
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,910
- Renee?

608
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,050
- Is that--

609
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,230
- Yeah.

610
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,690
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

611
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,360
(deep otherworldly screech)

612
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,950
(dramatic atmosphere music)

613
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
- Well crap.

614
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,520
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

615
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,010
(music lulls)

616
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,170
(soft piano notes)

617
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,020
- It's beautiful isn't it?

618
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,200
Music.

619
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,270
I mean it's absolutely beautiful.

620
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,760
It's truly a gift to the world.

621
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,400
No no, stay where you are.

622
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,250
I'll come to you.

623
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,600
Please David, take a seat.

624
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,430
You're my guest.

625
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,890
(slow piano melody)

626
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,490
You can play with me, my friend.

627
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,580
I know you're afraid of failure.

628
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,750
Trust me, I understand that completely.

629
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,300
But what you need to
understand is to rise,

630
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,170
first we must learn to fall.

631
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,680
Piano isn't my instrument of choice

632
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,800
I'll admit, but it is pretty.

633
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,510
Come on David, play.

634
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,860
(harmonious piano melody)

635
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,330
I'm so sorry.

636
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,780
I forgot to introduce myself.

637
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,660
My name's Tanion.

638
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,650
- [River] Renee.

639
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,400
(whimsical atmosphere music)

640
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,920
- Renee.

641
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,360
Carefully then.

642
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,610
Step toward me.

643
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,670
- Where did you go?

644
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,160
- Come with me.

645
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,700
She will hurt you Renee, please.

646
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,650
She doesn't want to help
you find your family.

647
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,030
I can take you to David,
I know where he is.

648
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,770
- Then go find him.

649
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,950
Bring him here.

650
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,060
- You don't understand.

651
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,070
She will take you to Shiloh

652
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,040
and he will do nothing to help them.

653
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,810
- Elza has managed to separate
you from your brothers.

654
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,420
He will true to persuade you,

655
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,740
one by one, to turn against one another.

656
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,580
- I have to stop him.

657
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,410
- Take a moment.

658
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,000
Breathe.

659
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,510
Think.

660
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,650
Elza wants you to choose him.

661
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,150
- Why?

662
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,120
- Because if he can turn all of you,

663
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,730
it would be a crippling
blow to the side of light.

664
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,010
- [Shiloh] Peace, Renee.

665
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,730
Patience.

666
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,270
- I know that voice.

667
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,470
- He is the current, future, and past.

668
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,760
- [Shiloh] I am Shiloh.

669
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,720
- Go with him, child.

670
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,650
He will help you.

671
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,830
- I think he went this way!

672
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,920
The footprints end here.

673
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,540
- He must have followed the water.

674
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,060
- So we trust that River will find him.

675
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,970
- Not if Tangi or Yakun does first.

676
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,090
- He's not lost yet.

677
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:31,920
- Choice.

678
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,900
- Yeah, Ryloh.

679
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,350
Choice.

680
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,920
- Matthew must choose for himself.

681
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,750
- Yeah, I know.

682
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,900
I know, I just, I wish there was

683
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,250
a way we could protect him.

684
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:45,980
- Let's keep going.

685
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,810
- Yeah.

686
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,130
- You found me.

687
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,370
- You said you needed my help.

688
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,680
- Yes Renee, in due time.

689
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,050
- But we don't have time!

690
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,380
Apparently there's a war going on

691
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,210
around here and Elza--

692
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,700
- Elza is after David and Matthew.

693
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,410
And more than likely he'll
find one of them, if not both.

694
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,380
Which is entirely out of your control.

695
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,650
- In this war, you're one
of the good guys right?

696
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,540
- (laughs) Well everyone would say

697
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,720
they're good within their own mind.

698
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,850
Of course I would say I was good.

699
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,140
Now if you were going to
ask the question are you

700
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,850
good or evil, that would
be completely different.

701
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,040
You see, I'm incapable of evil.

702
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,830
- My mom said every person is capable

703
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,680
of evil, they just choose against it.

704
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,250
- Your mother is a wise woman.

705
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,080
However.

706
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,260
I'm not a person.

707
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,100
- My friend, if I may ask, what
has become of your siblings?

708
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:53,920
- I don't know.

709
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,430
Matthew left when we were sleeping.

710
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,550
I guess he didn't think
about taking us with him.

711
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,310
Renee, she disappeared while

712
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,160
we were running from that thing.

713
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,990
- The Tsayid.

714
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,050
A dark and dangerous beast sent by Shiloh

715
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,210
to hunt each and every one of you down.

716
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,220
(deep otherworldly screech)

717
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,180
It's there.

718
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,010
Go David!

719
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,380
Run, run!

720
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,370
Out the door!

721
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,200
Run!

722
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,000
- It's locked!

723
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,750
- [Tanion] Stay back!

724
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,020
Go David, I'll meet you in Cadia!

725
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,110
Go, I'll hold them off, run!

726
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:35,020
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

727
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,460
- Do you think he'll be different?

728
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,160
- Maybe.

729
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,970
When I left Skia, a lot of
people felt the same way.

730
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,510
Is it too much to ask to heal someone?

731
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,640
To protect someone?

732
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,280
No.

733
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,190
Yet he didn't do it.

734
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,020
- I know.

735
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,330
I'm just tired of fighting, Yakun.

736
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:42,260
I'm tired of thinking I
mean something to him.

737
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,450
If he's as powerful as he
says, why won't he end it?

738
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,600
Why do we even matter?

739
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,740
- Exactly.

740
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,910
But if we can take that power

741
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,660
for ourselves maybe we can end it.

742
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,240
Protect those we love.

743
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,100
Do what we couldn't do on Skia.

744
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,280
- Yakun.

745
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,660
Just promise you won't leave me.

746
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,830
I just left the only home I knew,

747
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,030
just please don't leave me.

748
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,860
- I won't.

749
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,570
(twigs snap)

750
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,990
(tense atmosphere music)

751
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,830
- Where do I go from here?

752
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,100
Any ideas mom?

753
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,870
- Nice, we got him.

754
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,110
- Let's take him to Elza
before Barsa shows up.

755
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,000
(idle chatter)

756
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,880
- And it kinda took off from there,

757
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,800
it just parlayed and it kept parlaying.

758
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,980
- Such a good opportunity.

759
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,120
- I know, I think so too,

760
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,510
I was really excited about that though.

761
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,470
(phone buzzes)

762
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:26,380
One second.

763
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,100
Hey dad.

764
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,530
- Alice, you need to come home.

765
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,180
(whimsical atmosphere music)

766
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,140
- Don't worry!

767
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,040
I didn't read it.

768
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,090
This belongs to your sister yes?

769
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,120
There's a name in this journal.

770
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,340
Right above Renee's.

771
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,810
And it shows me why I was so
called to bring you to Cadia.

772
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,330
Your mother is Maggie.

773
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,950
- Was.

774
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,080
She was Maggie.

775
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,250
Why do you care?

776
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,820
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

777
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,640
She was an incredible woman.

778
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,390
A lot like her father.

779
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,110
Your grandfather was extremely
important in this war.

780
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,770
Your mother also, but you,

781
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,310
you could be more than both of them.

782
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,220
Take my hand.

783
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,960
- So we're taking him to Elza?

784
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,790
- Yeah, after that we'll get the others.

785
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:52,620
Did you--

786
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,110
- Matty, good to see you again.

787
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,440
Tangi, Yakun.

788
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,780
How you guys doing?

789
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,140
I wanna get you back to Shiloh.

790
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,970
He'll be waiting.

791
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,800
- No.

792
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,710
- We're taking him to Elza.

793
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,540
- Come on.

794
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,790
- We're not just gonna give him up.

795
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,090
- Don't make us fight you.

796
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,100
- You made me do this.

797
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,820
Remember that.

798
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,050
Grest, release Ryloh.

799
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,020
- Hey.

800
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,190
Hey.

801
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,020
It's me.

802
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,770
- Ryloh.

803
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,520
Ryloh.

804
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,350
Honey.

805
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:39,660
- They're fine.

806
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,510
She only put them out for a minute.

807
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,920
(tense atmosphere music)

808
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,420
- You're coming with me.

809
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,330
Or else.

810
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,460
- Okay.

811
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,890
Okay, we'll come with you.

812
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,470
- Shiloh be with us now and always.

813
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,790
Shiloh be with us now and always.

814
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,880
(groans)

815
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,440
Thanks for trying to negotiate,

816
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,780
but I think we're done here.

817
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,890
- Right you are.

818
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,280
- Welcome to the beginning of time, David.

819
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,700
Now this is the moment
that he decided that he,

820
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,570
and only he, would have
the greatest power of all.

821
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,790
To create.

822
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,570
To begin.

823
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,330
Look now.

824
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,130
Existence starts in just a moment.

825
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,550
Do you know what power feels like, David?

826
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:45,540
If you touch it, you could achieve

827
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,280
a higher level of being than even Shiloh

828
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,330
because all he did was
speak to it, but if you

829
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,880
touch it, you'd be stronger than Shiloh.

830
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,180
You'd be stronger than me.

831
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,040
- I can't.

832
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,170
- David, we can stop the pain
and suffering of the Earth.

833
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,280
If you did this, if you
accept this responsibility,

834
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,040
we could save your
sister and your brother,

835
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,820
we could save your grandfather,
we could save everyone.

836
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,780
Surely that's what's good.

837
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,900
(dramatic atmosphere music)

838
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,090
- I can't.

839
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,010
- Focus David, focus.

840
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,040
Your mother, she didn't want this

841
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,560
responsibility, and your grandfather

842
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,290
felt that he didn't deserve it.

843
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,910
But you, you're smarter than they are.

844
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:27,990
You're stronger.

845
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,870
Matthew won't need to fight your battles

846
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,970
for you because you won't be able to fail.

847
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,960
We can save worlds.

848
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,600
- Why don't you do it?

849
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,340
You're stronger than I am.

850
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,770
- I've tried, but I'm unable.

851
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,610
You see, Shiloh created me as a messenger.

852
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,440
But you, you he created in his own image.

853
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,040
If you did this, if you touch it,

854
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,730
your powers would be limitless.

855
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,350
You won't be held back by the same

856
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,460
delusions of morality that blind Shiloh.

857
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,600
Now do it David, do it now.

858
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,030
- Where to begin?

859
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,220
(music swells)

860
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,330
- Was that...

861
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,230
- We missed our chance.

862
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,460
We're out of time.

863
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,520
We must leave.

864
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,350
Quickly.

865
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,040
- What?

866
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,040
Okay, okay, okay.

867
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,110
I'm so sorry I've gotta
run out on you like this.

868
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,160
- Just tell me what's going on.

869
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,200
- It's dad.

870
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,420
The kids are missing he said

871
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,830
and I think his treatments are

872
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,520
messing with him, I gotta go.

873
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,830
I love you, thank you so
much for meeting with me.

874
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,940
- I love you too, yes.

875
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,290
Believe him, Alice.

876
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,400
- Okay, all right.

877
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,750
I'll call you later?

878
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,740
- Yes, call me.

879
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,990
- [Alice] Okay.

880
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,160
- Can I take this cup away from you?

881
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,480
- That'd be nice, yes.

882
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,270
Thank you.

883
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,520
(serene atmosphere music)

884
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,320
- Matthew!

885
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:48,640
- Renee!

886
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,590
- Where have you been?

887
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:55,600
- I heard a noise during the night,

888
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,100
so I went out to check it out.

889
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,550
That's where I met, let me introduce you.

890
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,380
- Barsa!

891
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,630
You served valiantly at Eleuthopolis.

892
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,150
You humbled yourself as
unchosen, you strive for justice.

893
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,470
You oppose the enemy
wherever you find him.

894
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,750
Yet, yet you were told to secure

895
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,030
these three upon their arrival at Cadia.

896
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:24,790
And you brought me only one.

897
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:35,110
Had you given up, all
three might have been lost.

898
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,660
Instead, two are safe.

899
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,920
Well done, Barsa.

900
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,960
(laughs)

901
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,790
- Yay!

902
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:52,920
- Your locket.

903
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,760
May I?

904
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,210
Your mother was a wonderful woman.

905
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,330
Her love changed so many lives.

906
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,230
- She ran away when she was our age.

907
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,530
Aunt Alice said she had some

908
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,920
crazy story for Grandpa George.

909
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,530
(laughing)

910
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,020
- I thought there was something
familiar about you Matthew.

911
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,620
- Your grandpa, your grandpa was

912
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,470
Barsa's right hand man for a bit.

913
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,090
He stumbled into Cadia one day

914
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,620
and served in our battles here.

915
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,940
Both here and in Skia.

916
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,080
Your family has quite a legacy here.

917
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,720
- Why didn't they tell us?

918
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,510
- Well I seem to recall that you wanted

919
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:49,950
to know about, how was it you said it,

920
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,060
"something that actually happened?"

921
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,500
But now, I fear David's in trouble.

922
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,910
He's been captured by the enemy.

923
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:05,900
- I'm sorry I made you mad.

924
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,860
- I'm not mad.

925
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,120
I'm rarely able to revisit that moment.

926
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,660
It happened before my time.

927
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,360
But it wasn't our only
chance to win this war.

928
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,510
- What do I need to do?

929
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,150
- I need you to find somebody for me.

930
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:21,980
- [David] Who?

931
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,570
- You'll know when you find him.

932
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:24,810
Go to Qadess.

933
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,100
An enormous, empty city.

934
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,850
I believe you've been there before.

935
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,340
I know you can do it, David.

936
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,190
With you by my side, we can correct

937
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,070
the mistakes of your family and of Shiloh.

938
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,150
With you, we can win this war.

939
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,410
You've made the right
choice, Tangi and Yakun.

940
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,520
I can give you power.

941
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,600
- Just don't hurt the Castaways please.

942
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,190
- I wouldn't dream of it.

943
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,230
They've done nothing to me.

944
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,630
Shiloh's who we're fighting.

945
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,630
- Do you think she'll show up when you do?

946
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,540
- Perhaps, but for that to mean anything,

947
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,140
well they'll have to choose her.

948
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,990
- Prepare the gathering?

949
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,420
- Prepare the gathering.

950
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,200
- Hey!

951
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,520
Uh-oh.

952
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,120
- David.

953
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,500
- How'd you get here?

954
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,330
- The rock.

955
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:58,330
I saw you guys in the backyard with it.

956
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,840
I stole it.

957
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,430
During the night, I used it to come here.

958
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,350
I met Elza.

959
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,180
- Elza!

960
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,020
He helped us!

961
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,850
- So did I.

962
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,630
Tanion wants to give us power.

963
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,460
Imagine if we had Shiloh's strength.

964
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,240
Maybe Aunt Maggie would still be here.

965
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,960
He said we would be like brothers.

966
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:19,840
- I thought we already were.

967
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,690
- You never acted like it.

968
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,580
- David and Luke, my two favorite people.

969
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,470
I am so glad that you found each other.

970
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,300
- Tanion!

971
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,150
The Tsayid's here!

972
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,800
We should go!

973
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,960
- You don't need me to defeat the Tsayid.

974
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,260
You can do it on your own.

975
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,780
Prove you don't need Shiloh.

976
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,900
(deep otherworldly screech)

977
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,480
- David, focus.

978
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,400
The rocks.

979
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,000
(speaking in unknown language)

980
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,700
- Can I ask you something?

981
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,170
- You're wondering why, if I'm so good

982
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,920
and your mother was so loyal to me,

983
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,810
why did she have to die?

984
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,660
Death is the last great enemy, Renee.

985
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,520
Yes, I could have saved her.

986
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,600
But to intervene in the life process,

987
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,630
to use my power to save her,

988
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,750
would've been a violation of my own creed.

989
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,100
Skia's nothing but a beginning.

990
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,080
Your mother made a difference

991
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,220
because she lived her life with love.

992
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
You would do well to follow her example.

993
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,090
- What about Tanion?

994
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,300
Could we save him?

995
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:06,690
- I'm afraid my old
friend is lost forever.

996
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,080
Renee.

997
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,030
This is my gift to you.

998
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,290
You will know when to use it.

999
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,840
Castaways!

1000
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,130
David is in danger.

1001
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,410
- Castaways, on me.

1002
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,050
- David.

1003
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:41,550
(dramatic atmosphere music)

1004
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,680
- Elza, enough.

1005
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,310
Do you understand now?

1006
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:05,810
Shiloh doesn't care about you.

1007
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,240
I do.

1008
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,940
I could've let Elza destroy you.

1009
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,920
But I chose not to.

1010
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,600
I chose to intervene, I chose to save you.

1011
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,380
Shiloh chose to let you die.

1012
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:21,940
Just like he did with your mother, David.

1013
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,540
And just like he is with
your grandfather right now.

1014
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,430
(heavy breathing)

1015
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,740
(groans)

1016
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,020
- No!

1017
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,160
- Grandpa George?

1018
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,990
- Join me, David.

1019
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,170
Together we can end death.

1020
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,930
- Let's play a little game shall we?

1021
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,590
George Kennedy, you will see Maggie soon,

1022
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,240
but it is not yet your time.

1023
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,070
Awaken.

1024
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,700
- Thank you.

1025
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,440
- No!

1026
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,200
- It is finished.

1027
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,330
- Shiloh be with us, now and aways.

1028
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,950
Shiloh be with us.

1029
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,030
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

1030
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,860
- [Ryloh] Excuse me.

1031
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,690
- What?

1032
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,120
- Focus.

1033
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,960
- What?

1034
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,020
- You know, I really
thought that was gonna work.

1035
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,420
- When has that ever worked?

1036
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,990
- Once.

1037
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,290
Like 200 years ago.

1038
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:05,490
(music swells)

1039
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,110
- I can't let you go, David.

1040
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:11,860
I need you and the world needs you.

1041
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,030
Bye now.

1042
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,090
- Well kids, it has
been a blast as always.

1043
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,000
I am sorry you had to get her
involved, that is a shame.

1044
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,110
Never really know when
she's gonna show up do you?

1045
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,470
At least Tanion's consistent.

1046
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:34,300
- [Barsa] Shiloh is--

1047
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,140
- Right, right, hey, I don't care.

1048
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,320
Listen.

1049
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,520
I'm outnumbered, so...

1050
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,610
Bye!

1051
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,510
- [Barsa] After him!

1052
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,500
(Ryloh screams)

1053
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,820
- Ryloh, slow down!

1054
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,070
- [Ares] Grest, come on!

1055
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:53,110
- My bad, guys!

1056
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,000
(tense atmosphere music)

1057
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,650
- We can take 'em.

1058
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,480
- Barsa.

1059
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,830
Shiloh be with us now and always.

1060
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,620
- Shiloh be with us now and always.

1061
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,490
- [Group] Shiloh be
with us now and always.

1062
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,180
Shiloh be with us now and always.

1063
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,760
(music swells)

1064
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,820
- Well that worked.

1065
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,650
Nice job.

1066
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,050
Great.

1067
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,880
- Sorry I had to bring them into this.

1068
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,970
I can let you try that
again if you'd like.

1069
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,270
- Good shot, nice form.

1070
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,580
Might wanna keep your
wrist straighter though.

1071
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,630
Gives you more power.

1072
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,710
(war cries)

1073
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:39,290
(suspenseful action music)

1074
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,760
- Don't attack!

1075
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
Only defend.

1076
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,100
This doesn't seem fair.

1077
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,740
Come on man, I just wanna
be friends, big guy!

1078
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,570
- Get off!

1079
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,030
- Don't do this.

1080
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,400
- I'm sorry.

1081
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,230
- Me too.

1082
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,900
It's not too late.

1083
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,430
- We don't wanna fight you.

1084
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,920
We want to end this war.

1085
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,300
- I know.

1086
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,690
I won't fight you.

1087
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,970
- Look at all this violence!

1088
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,590
I can bring peace.

1089
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,200
I can give you what Shiloh won't.

1090
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,160
I can give you power.

1091
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,110
- I'd rather die with
love than live with power.

1092
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:37,920
- That's funny.

1093
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,380
Your mother said the exact same

1094
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,860
thing right before she died.

1095
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,060
- Let them go!

1096
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,720
- This tired old trick.

1097
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,300
Why do you get to be different?

1098
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,490
Why are you worth more to him than me?

1099
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,560
- I am him.

1100
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,010
- Skia has forgotten you.

1101
01:10:59,010 --> 01:10:59,970
You've lost your power.

1102
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,110
- No.

1103
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,550
Skia has changed, it hasn't forgotten.

1104
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,590
Only you have.

1105
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,010
- I will win.

1106
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,750
- You lost long ago.

1107
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,060
Returning violence for violence
doesn't solve anything.

1108
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,110
You can't beat him that way.

1109
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:28,280
Only light and love can drive
out darkness and hatred.

1110
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,950
(heavenly atmosphere music)

1111
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,570
- [Renee] It's not enough.

1112
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,300
- [Matthew] We can't hold him back.

1113
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,430
- The power that Tanion promises you...

1114
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,310
Is not what you need to heal your world.

1115
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:14,740
- You're Shiloh.

1116
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,460
You created all of this.

1117
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,940
- Not all of it.

1118
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,390
I created the light.

1119
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,020
Look between it.

1120
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,260
The darkness.

1121
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,970
The darkness did not come from me.

1122
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,690
However, you need it
for the light to exist.

1123
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,590
- You allow it.

1124
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,030
You allow the darkness to exist.

1125
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,130
- I must.

1126
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,550
Because without it, the
light wouldn't be seen.

1127
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,290
Tanion.

1128
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,950
Tanion was once my dear friend.

1129
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,030
I created him.

1130
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,700
When he chose the darkness,
I didn't interfere.

1131
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,100
It wasn't indifference on
my part, but rather love.

1132
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,950
You can't force a choice with love.

1133
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:18,620
And I can't do it.

1134
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,350
- People are dying, Shiloh.

1135
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,300
You could have saved her.

1136
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,460
- Yes.

1137
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,830
I could've saved her.

1138
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,270
And I could've pulled
Tanion from the darkness.

1139
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,380
I could force you to
turn from him right now.

1140
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,880
But...

1141
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,830
That's your choice to make.

1142
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,990
I simply wanted to meet
you before you make it.

1143
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:02,140
- Tanion promised me the
power to help people.

1144
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,340
- Well of course he did.

1145
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,250
But he's the reason they need help.

1146
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:12,690
I promise you the power to love them.

1147
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:20,810
Oh, and keep asking questions.

1148
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,560
But then truly take the time to listen.

1149
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,430
'Cause that's the only way we learn.

1150
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,080
It is the only way we make a difference.

1151
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,370
- David, think of the power,

1152
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:46,370
the strength we can have together.

1153
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,980
We can change the world.

1154
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,620
- I choose the light.

1155
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,880
- Renee, I can bring your mother back.

1156
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,490
- She's gone now.

1157
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,740
And that's okay.

1158
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:07,050
- Luke, they don't even like you.

1159
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,980
- Go away!

1160
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,820
- Tanion, listen to Luke.

1161
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,110
Go away!

1162
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,890
(epic atmosphere music)

1163
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,400
- No!

1164
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,300
- I didn't get to say anything cool.

1165
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,450
(laughs)

1166
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,290
- Look.

1167
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:38,850
(dramatic atmosphere music)

1168
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,560
My time has come again.

1169
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,780
I must leave Cadia.

1170
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,090
- [Renee] Will we ever see you again?

1171
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,720
- Yes Renee, you will.

1172
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,860
- Barsa, thanks.

1173
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,070
For everything.

1174
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,770
- Thank you.

1175
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,520
And Matthew, tell them I said hi.

1176
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,670
Tangi, Yakun.

1177
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:26,780
Welcome back.

1178
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,700
Thank you.

1179
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,240
All of you.

1180
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,070
Thank you.

1181
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,460
Castaways, on me!

1182
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,510
- Well done, children.

1183
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,810
All of you.

1184
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,420
- Are we supposed to use this?

1185
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:22,050
Oh, I bet my mom is freaking--

1186
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:23,950
- Kids!

1187
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,410
- Out.

1188
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,110
- I don't--

1189
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,810
- They're home and they're safe.

1190
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:32,930
- You left the house without telling

1191
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,260
Grandpa George where you went?

1192
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,090
- How was it?

1193
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,490
Are you okay?

1194
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,340
- Barsa says hi.

1195
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,010
- Dad, who's Barsa?

1196
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,570
- I've got a story to tell you.

1197
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,610
(music swells)

1198
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,970
(dramatic atmosphere music)
