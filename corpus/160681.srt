1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
Once upon a time

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,200
in a  kingdom far far away

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,200
The king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,560
And throughout the land
everyone was happy.

5
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
...Until the sun went went down

6
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,720
...and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a freightful enchantment

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,680
...that took hold each
and every night.

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,400
Desperate, they sought the
help of a fairy god mother

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,360
...who had them lock the
young princess away in a tower...

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
...there to await the kiss...

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
...of the handsome prince charming.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,789
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,560
travelling for many days and nights

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,920
risking life and lip...

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,004
to reach the Dragon's keep.

17
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,296
For he was... the bravest...

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,750
and most handsome

19
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,751
...in all the land.

20
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,124
And it was destiny

21
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:01,966
that his kiss

22
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,613
would break the dreaded curse.

23
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:07,800
He alone

24
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:09,758
would climb to the highest room

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,370
of the tallest tower

26
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,673
to enter the princess' chambers

27
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,436
cross the room to her sleeping
silhouette

28
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,471
pull back the gossamer curtains

29
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,622
to find her...

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,911
What?

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,036
Princess Fiona?

32
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:25,034
NO!

33
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:26,723
Oh, thank Heavens!

34
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:28,411
Where is she?

35
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,832
She's on her honeymoon.

36
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:30,791
Honeymoon?!

37
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,058
With whom?

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,670
So she said what's the problem baby

39
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,670
What's the problem I don't know

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,713
Well maybe I'm in love

41
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,231
Think about it every time

42
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:58,220
I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it

43
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,670
How much longer will it take to cure this

44
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:05,865
Just to cure it cause I can't
ignore it if it's love 

45
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:10,599
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
but I don't know nothing 'bout love 

46
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:15,416
Come on, come on
Turn a little faster

47
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,809
Come on, come on 
The world will follow after

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:27,147
Come on, come on
Everybody's after love

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,936
So I said I'm a snowball running

50
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:37,115
Running down into the spring
that's coming all this love

51
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:42,187
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,802
Well baby I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream

53
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:51,488
 Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it

54
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,308
But there's no escaping your love

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,956
These lines of lightning

56
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:02,500
Mean we're never alone,
Never alone, no, no

57
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,637
Come on, Come on
Jump a little higher

58
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:09,104
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter

59
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:17,417
Come on, come on
We were once upon a time in love

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,520
Accidentally in love

61
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:24,792
Accidentally in love

62
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,293
Accidentally in love

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,044
Accidentally in love

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,560
Accidentally in love

65
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:39,065
Accidentally in love

66
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,612
Accidentally

67
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:46,334
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,

68
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,886
Accidentally in love

69
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:55,230
I'm in love
I'm in love

70
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,756
It's so... good to be home!

71
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:03,283
Just you and me and...

72
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:10,114
Two can be as bad as one

73
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:10,997
Donkey?

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,108
Shrek! Fiona!

75
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,989
Well, aren't you two a sight
for sore eyes.

76
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:15,795
Give us a hug, Shrek.

77
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:18,328
You old love machine.

78
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,401
And look at you Mrs. Shrek

79
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,128
How about a side of sugar
for the steed?

80
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,316
Donkey, what are you doing here?

81
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:26,273
I was just taking care of your
love nest for you.

82
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,922
Oh, you mean sorting the mail

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,687
and watering the plants

84
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,415
Yeah, and feeding the fish.

85
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:33,911
I don't have any fish.

86
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,909
You do now.

87
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,441
I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a nasty devil.

88
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,317
Oh, look at the time. I guess you'd
better be going.

89
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:43,929
Don't you want to tell
me all about the trip?

90
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,925
How about a game of parchese?

91
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:50,723
Actually donkey, shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

92
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:52,719
Oh, yeah. That...

93
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:55,751
I don't know she's been all
moody and stuff lately.

94
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:58,322
So I thought I'd move back in
with you guys.

95
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:01,431
Well you know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

96
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,534
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.

97
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,180
Just with each other.

98
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:14,328
Alone.

99
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,976
Say no more. Say no more
You don't have to worry about a thing.

100
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,931
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

101
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,622
Donkey!

102
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,620
Yes, roomy.

103
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:23,309
You're bothering me.

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,972
OK...cool... I guess me and Pinnochio
was just gonna try to catch a tournament anyway...,

105
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:35,092
so... maybe I'll see you ...
Sunday...

106
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,888
He'll be fine. Now...

107
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,270
Where were we?

108
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:45,494
I think I remember.

109
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:49,217
Donkey!!!

110
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:52,595
I know, I know... alone.
I'm going... I'm going.

111
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,936
Hey, what do you want me to tell
these other guys?

112
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,563
Enough.

113
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,165
Dearest Princess Fiona.

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,502
You are hereby summoned
to the kingdom of Far Far Away

115
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:22,993
for a royal ball in celebration
of your marriage.

116
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:27,369
At which time the king will bestow
his royal blessing

117
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:32,281
upon you and your...err...
Prince Charming.

118
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:37,578
Love.
The king and queen of Far Far Away.

119
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:39,766
A.K.A.
Mom and dad.

120
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:40,917
Mom and dad?

121
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,529
Prince Charming?

122
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,602
A ball! Can I come?

123
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,792
We are not going.

124
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,560
What!!

125
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:52,394
I mean, don't you think they might be a
bit shocked to see you... like this?

126
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,196
Well, they might be a bit surprised.

127
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,266
But they are my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

128
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,838
And don't worry. They are gonna
love you too...

129
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:04,791
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'd be
welcome at the country club.

130
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,633
Will you stop it, they are not like that.

131
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,322
Then how do you explain sergeant Pompous

132
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,280
and the Fancy Pants Club band?

133
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:13,427
Come on! You can at least
give them a chance.

134
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:15,922
Oh, to do what?
Sharping their pitchforks?

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,069
No! They just wanna give you
their blessing.

136
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,600
Great! Now I need their blessing?

137
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,402
If you wanna be a part of this
family - yes.

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,398
And who says I wanna be part
of this family?

139
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:30,545
You did? When you married me?

140
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,963
Well, there's some fine print for you.

141
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:36,111
Ah! So that's it. You won't come.

142
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,991
Trust me. It's a bad idea.

143
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,908
We are not going.
And that's final.

144
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,821
Hey, come on, Shrek. We don't
wanna hit traffic.

145
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,003
Don't worry. We'll take care of everything.

146
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,958
Hey, wait for me.

147
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,016
Move on!

148
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,234


149
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,230


150
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:16,642


151
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,640


152
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,924
Are we there yet?

153
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,922
No.

154
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:34,835
Are we there yet?

155
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:35,948
Not yet.

156
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,823
Hey, are we there yet?

157
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,859
No-o.

158
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:43,816
Are we there yet?

159
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:44,622
NO!

160
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,196
Are we there yet?

161
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:46,734
Yes

162
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:47,232
Really?

163
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:48,192
NOO!!!

164
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,190
Aren't we there yet?

165
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:49,727
NO!

166
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:50,687
Aren't we there yet?!!

167
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,688
No we are not.

168
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,261
ARE WE THERE YET?

169
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,258
NOO!!

170
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,444
Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?

171
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,402
Hey, that's not funny.
- Hey, that's not funny.

172
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,400
Hey, that's really immature.
- immature

173
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,775
See, this is why I don't like ogres.
- don't like ogres.

174
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,347
I'm gonna just stop talking!

175
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:08,074
Finally!

176
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:10,454
But this is taking forever, Shrek.

177
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,989
And there ain't no flight movie or nothing.

178
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:17,900
The kingdom of Far Far Away, Donkey.
That's where we're going.

179
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,891
Far... far...away...

180
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,849
Alright, alright, I get it.

181
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,883
I'm just so bored.

182
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,608
Well, find a way to entertain yourself!

183
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,058
For five minutes.

184
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,898
Could you not be yourself?

185
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:58,086
For five minutes!

186
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,952
Are we there yet?

187
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,103
Yes

188
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,331
Finally!

189
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,505


190
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:26,949
It's gonna be champagne wishes

191
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,983
and caviar dreams from now on.

192
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,092
We'll be back to pick you up later.

193
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,666


194
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,728


195
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:43,683
Yeah, we're definitely not in the
swamp anymore

196
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,743
Hey, ladies
...yeah.

197
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:12,739
You work in that hat

198
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,948
Swimming pool, movie stuff.

199
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:03,595
Announcing the long awaited return
of the beautiful Princess Fiona

200
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,512
and her new husband

201
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,352
Now, this is it.

202
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:10,580
This is it.

203
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:11,732
This is it.

204
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:12,845
This is it.

205
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,254
Why don't you guys go ahead.
I'll park the car.

206
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,896
So, ...

207
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:46,582
You still think this is a good idea?

208
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:48,770
Of course...

209
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,802
Look, mom and dad look happy to see us.

210
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,182
Who on earth are they?

211
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,140
I think that's our little girl.

212
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:59,325
That's not little. That's a really
big problem!

213
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:02,780
Wasn't she supposed to kiss prince Charming
and break the spell?

214
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,039
Well, he's no prince Charming but
they do look...

215
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,078
Happy now?

216
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:09,995
We came. We saw them...

217
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,605
Now let's go before they light the torches.

218
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,872
They are my parents.

219
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,213
Hello, they locked you in a tower.

220
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:17,280
Hey, that was for my own...

221
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,015
Good!
Here's our chance.

222
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:21,318
Let's go back inside and pretend
we're not home.

223
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:22,537
Harold, we have to be...

224
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,467
Quick.

225
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:25,732
While they are not looking,
we can make a run for it.

226
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,650
Shrek! Stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

227
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,609
A disaster. They know...

228
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,221
You can do this.

229
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,142
But it's a really...

230
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,217
...really

231
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:39,358
Mom!

232
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:40,893
Dad!

233
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,883
I'd like you to meet my husband.
Shrek.

234
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,601
Well... .Aah... It's

235
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,634
easy to see where Fiona gets her
good looks from...

236
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,128
He... he...

237
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,438
Excuse me.

238
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:37,583
Better out than in I always say eh, Fiona?

239
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,876
I guess not.

240
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,257
What do you mean, I'm not on the list?

241
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,639
Don't tell me you don't know
who I am?

242
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:51,439
He hey! What's happening everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

00:15:51,500-->00:15:53,300
You know I had the hardest
time finding this place.

243
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,392
NO! NO!
Bad donkey, bad! DOWN!

244
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:58,808
No, no, dad, it's alright.
He's with us.

245
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:00,843
He helped rescue me from the dragon.

246
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,455
Yeah, that's me, the noble steed.

247
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:04,642
Hey, waiter. How about a bowl
for the steed?

248
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,178
Oh, boy...

249
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:09,517
Ah... Shrek...

250
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:12,050
Yeah?...
Oh, sorry...

251
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,775
Great soup, Mrs. Q

252
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,078
No, no, no...Darling.

253
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,330
So... Fiona. Tell us about
where you live.

254
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:29,168
Well... Shrek owns his own land.

255
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,471
Don't you, honey?

256
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,930
Yes... He, he.

257
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,809
It's in an enchanted forest.

258
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:40,990
abundant in squirrels and...
cute little duckies, and...

259
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,065
What?!

260
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,945
I know you ain't talking about the swamp.

261
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:44,521
Donkey.

262
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,784
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh, how original.

263
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,006
Well, I suppose that would be a fine
place to raise the children.

264
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,902
It's a bit early to be thinking
about that, isn't it?

265
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,397
Indeed! I've just started eating.

266
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,201
What's that supposed to mean?

267
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:09,968
Dad!

268
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,158
It's clean, OK?

269
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,502
Well, for his type - yes.

270
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,730
My TYPE?

271
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,534
I'm... going to the bathroom...

272
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,837
Dinner is served.

273
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,257
Never mind. I can hold it.

274
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,473
Bon appetit!

275
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,545
Oh, Mexican food!
My favourite!

276
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:32,499
Well, let's not just sit here with our
tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

277
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,689
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

278
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,511
So, I suppose the grand children I
could expect from you would be...

279
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,714
Ogres. Yes.

280
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:41,557
Not that there’s anything wrong with that,

281
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,785
right Harold?

282
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:45,088
Oh, no. Of course not.

283
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:48,120
That is assuming you don't eat your
own young.

284
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:48,888
Dad!

285
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:53,609
Oh, no! We usually prefer the ones
that've been locked away in a tower...

286
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:54,722
Shrek! Please.

287
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,526
I only did that because
I loved her.

288
00:17:56,564 --> 00:17:59,673
Oh, aye. Day care in dragon
guarded castle.

289
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,746
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father.

290
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,535
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

291
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,408
Harold!
- Shrek!

292
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:17,482
Fiona.
- Fiona.

293
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,864
Mom!
- Harold.

294
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:20,054
Donkey.

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,224
Your fallen tears have called to me.

296
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:30,600
So here comes my sweet remedy.

297
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:36,319
I know what every princess needs.

298
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:41,769
For her to live life happily...

299
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:42,882
Ah!
-Ah!

300
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,379
Oh, my dear.

301
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,375
Look at you... heh, heh

302
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,332
You're all... hm...

303
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,522
grown up.

304
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:52,056
Err, who are you?

305
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:55,817
Oh, this is Sweet Pea.
I am your fairy godmother.

306
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,352
I have a fairy godmother?

307
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,186
Sh, now don't worry. I'm here
to make it all better.

308
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:06,637
with...  just... a...

309
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:10,671
wave of my magic wand
your troubles will soon be gone.

310
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:13,100
with a  flick of a wrist
and just a flash

311
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,140
you'll land a prince
with a ton of cash. Ha-ha.

312
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:17,246
A high priced dress made by mice no less!

313
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:19,806
some crystal glass pumps
and no more stress!

314
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:21,917
Worries will vanish your soul will dance

315
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,989
Confide in your very own furniture friends

316
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,638
We'll help you set a new fashion trend!

317
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:29,171
I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great!

318
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:30,975
The kind of girl a
prince would date.

319
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:33,170
They'll write your name on the bathroom wall.

320
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,205
For happy ever after- give Fiona a call!

321
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,500
Swirling cash, arrive in style..

322
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:39,572
sexy men my chauffer Kyle.

323
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,491
Vanish your blemishes, tooth decay

324
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,487
say light thighs we'll pay the way

325
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:46,097
a roll in the the hay a new chauffeur’s day

326
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:49,936
Nip and tuck here and there,
to land that prince with the perfect hair.

327
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:51,663
lipstick, liner, shadows, blush...

328
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:53,467
to get the prince with the
sexy tush.

329
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,040
Lucky day, up boo bay.

330
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,149
Hear you swoon on the moon

331
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,685
with the prince do this tune

332
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,220
Don’t be drab you'll be fab

333
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,250


334
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,621
Look...

335
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,344
Thank you very much fairy godmother
but...

336
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,227
I really don't need all this.

337
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,710
Fiona?

338
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,823
Fiona!

339
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,885
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

340
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,535
Oh!... Ah...

341
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:35,955
Fairy godmother,

342
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:37,606
furniture...

343
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,293
I'd like you to meet my husband...
Shrek.

344
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,252
Your husband?!

345
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,250
What!?

346
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,208
When did this happen?

347
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:45,935
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

348
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:46,933
But that can't be right!

349
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,927
Oh, great! More relatives.

350
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,232
She's just trying to help.

351
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,151
Good. She can help us pack.

352
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,763
Get your coat dear. We're leaving.

353
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,451
What?
- Leaving? I don't wanna leave.

354
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,795
When did you decide this?

355
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,445
Shortly after arriving.

356
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,520
Look... I err... I'm sorry.

357
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:04,051
No, no, that's alright. I need
to go anyway.

358
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,663
But remember dear,

359
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:07,582
if you should ever need me...

360
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,768
Happiness... is just a
teardrop away.

361
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:14,645
Thanks. But we've got all the happiness
we need. Happy! Happy! Happy!

362
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,257
So I see.

363
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,020
Let's go Kyle.

364
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:23,588
Very nice. Shrek.

365
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:26,274
What? I told you coming here
was a bad idea.

366
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,076
You could have at least tried to get along
with my father.

367
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:33,452
Somehow I think I wasn't gonna get daddy's
blessing, even if I did want it.

368
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:37,635
Do you think it might be nice if somebody
asked me what I wanted?

369
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:40,245
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

370
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:42,280
You're unbelievable!

371
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:43,853
You behave like a...

372
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,809
Go on, say it!

373
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:48,152
Like an ogre!

374
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:51,456
Well, here's a news flash for you.
Whether your parents like it or not...

375
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,293
I am an ogre.

376
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:03,697
And guess what, princess?
That's not about to change.

377
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,177
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

378
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:21,276
That's real smooth, Shrek.
I'm an ogre! Arrrgh!

379
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,569
I knew this would happen!

380
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,642
You should. You started it.

381
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,175
I can hardly believe that Lillian,
I mean Lily

382
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:52,749
He's the ogre, not me!

383
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,011
I think Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

384
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,314
This is Fiona's choice.

385
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,615
Yes, but she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked out for her!

386
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,029
And you expect me to give my
blessings to this... this... thing?!

387
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:09,637
Fiona does. And she'll never
forgive you if you don't.

388
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:13,590
I don't want to lose our daughter
again, Harold.

389
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,659
Oh, you act as if love is
totally predictable.

390
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't you remember when we were young and...

391
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,917
we used to walk down by the lily pond...

392
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:24,759
they were in bloom.

393
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,026
Our first kiss...

394
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,175
It's not the same.

395
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:30,632
I don't think you realize
that our daughter

396
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,436
has married a monster!

397
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,931
Oh, stop being such
a drama king.

398
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:38,539
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong.
La-di-da-di-das

399
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,801
Oh, wonderful!
How can it get any worse!

400
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:42,952
Hello, Harold.

401
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,066
What happened?

402
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:45,524
Nothing, nothing, dear...

403
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,748
just the old crusade wound...
playing up a bit, ha-ha-ha...

404
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,087
I'll  err... just stretch it out
here for a while...

405
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,124
You'd better get in.

406
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:54,928
We need to talk.

407
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:57,538
Actually, fairy godmother...
just off to bed

408
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:01,337
Already taken my pills.
Tend to make me... a bit drowsy...

409
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,907
So...err... how about...
we make this a quick business?

410
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,440
Oh...err....hello...

411
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:12,161
So?... What's new?

412
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:15,539
Do you remember my son...
prince Charming?

413
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:19,684
Charming? Is that you?
My gosh! It's been years...

414
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,872
A...err... when... when...
did you get back?

415
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,558
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually

416
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,665
after I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

417
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:30,892
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest...

418
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,425
Mommy can handle this.

419
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,031
He endures blistering winds
and scorching deserts

420
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,022
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

421
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:43,442
and what does he find?

422
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:47,511
Some gender confused wolf
telling him that his princess...

423
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,969
has already married.

424
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:52,078
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

425
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:53,921
Stop the car!

426
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,991
Harold.

427
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:02,710
You force me to do something I
really don't want to do!

428
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,092
Where are we?

429
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,777
May I take your order?

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,777


431
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:11,269
My diet is ruined!
Now I hope you're happy.

432
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,992
OK...Two Renaissance ...

433
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,336
I'll have the medieval meal.

434
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,521
One medieval meal, and...
Harold, curly fries?

435
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,519
No, no, thank you.

436
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:21,556
Harold,....
what do you want?

437
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:22,554
No, really, I'm fine...

438
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,626
Your order, fairy godmother.

439
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,968
And this comes with medieval meal.

440
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,464
Here you are, dear.

441
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:33,416
You see,  we made a deal, Harold.

442
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:36,064
And I assume you don't want me to
go back on my part?

443
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,638
Indeed, not.

444
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:41,629
So Fiona and Charming
will be together?

445
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:42,589
Yes.

446
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,391
Oh, believe me Harold.
It's what's best.

447
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:48,116
Not only for your daughter...

448
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:50,995
but for your kingdom.

449
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:58,019
But what am I supposed to do
about it?

450
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:01,012
Use your imagination.

451
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,385

452
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:41,736
Come on in your majesty.

453
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:02,577
Excuse me...

454
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,765
Hey, do I know you?

455
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:08,066
Err... you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

456
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:12,633
Err... excuse me. I err... am looking
for the ugly step sister...

457
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,970
Aah... there you are... right...

458
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:22,382
You see, I need to have someone
taken care of...

459
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:23,534
Who's the guy?

460
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,374
He's not guy per se....ehm...

461
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,370
He's... ogre

462
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:33,206
Hey, buddy. Let me clue you in.

463
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,085
There's only one fella who can handle
a job like that...

464
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,424
And frankly,... he don't like to
be disturbed.

465
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,805
Where could I find him?

466
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:45,757
Hello?

467
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,672
Who dares enter my room?

468
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,859
Sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting

469
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:55,736
but I'm told you're the one to talk to
about an... ogre... problem?

470
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:57,578
You're told correct.

471
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:00,994
But for these I charge a great
deal of money.

472
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:04,065
Would... this be enough?

473
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,198
You have engaged my...
valuable services.

474
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:15,771
Your majesty.

475
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,533
Just tell me...
where I can find this ogre?

476
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,410
Everyone says I'm getting down too low

477
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,400
Everyone says,"You just gotta let it go"

478
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,460
You just gotta let it go.

479
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:09,928
I need some sleep.
Time to put the old bones down.

480
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:17,298
I'm in too deep
and the wheels keep spinning round...

481
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:24,821
Everyone says
- You just gotta let it go.

482
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,152
Dear knight, I pray that you take this
favour as a token of my gratitude.

483
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:55,488
Dear diary,

484
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,750
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow...

485
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:00,286
but dad says I can't go.

486
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,473
He never lets me out after sunset.

487
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:05,621
Dad says I'm going away for a while,...

488
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:08,307
Must be like some finishing school
or something.

489
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:10,994
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

490
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,141
my handsome prince Charming
will rescue me from my tower

491
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,022
and bring me back to my family.

492
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,477
And we'll all live happily
ever after.

493
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,737
Mrs. Fiona Charming

494
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,731
Mrs. Fiona Charming

495
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:28,688
Mrs. Fiona Charming

496
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,106
Mrs. Fiona Charming...

497
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,849
Sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting
or anything...

498
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,382
No, no,... I was just reading a...

499
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:48,916
a scary book.

500
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:54,097
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behaviour earlier

501
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:55,517
Ok?

502
00:31:55,556 --> 00:31:57,014
I don't know what came over me...

503
00:31:57,091 --> 00:32:00,277
Do you suppose we can just pretend it
never happened and start over?

504
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,349
Look, your majesty, I just...

505
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,424
Call me dad.

506
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:04,575
Dad,...

507
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,838
We both acted like ogres.

508
00:32:08,222 --> 00:32:11,100
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

509
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:12,636
Excellent idea.

510
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:15,975
I was actually hoping you
might join me for morning hunt

511
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:22,269
I know it would mean the world
to Fiona.

512
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:34,705
Shall we say 7:30 by the
old oak?

513
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,804
Face it, Donkey.
We're lost.

514
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,798
We can't be lost. We followed the
king's instructions exactly.

515
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:48,177
What did he say: head for the deepest
darkest part of the wood.

516
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,175
Aye.

517
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,286
Pass the sinister trees with
those scary looking branches.

518
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,284
Check

519
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,896
And there's that bush that's
shaped like Shirley Bassey

520
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:56,429
We passed that bush
three times already!

521
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:59,385
Hey, you were the one who said
you don't wanna stop and get directions!

522
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,459
Ah, great...

523
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:03,684
My one chance to fix things up
with Fiona's dad

524
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:05,910
and I end up lost in the
woods with you!

525
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,596
Alright. You don't have to get all hoppy
with me. I'm, only trying to help.

526
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:10,477
I know, I know.

527
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm sorry, alright?

528
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:16,081
Hey, don't worry about it.

529
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:19,190
I just really need to make things
work with this guy.

530
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:21,877
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with daddy.

531
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,549
Well, well, Donkey.

532
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,656
I know it was kind of a tender
moment but... but the purring?!

533
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:37,460
What are you talking about?
I ain't purring.

534
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,916
Oh, sure. What's next, a hug?

535
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:43,102
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
Who do you think I am, some kinda...

536
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:46,595
Ha-ha! Fear me!
If you dare.

537
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:48,590
Hey look! A little cat.

538
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,049
Look out , Shrek. We
got a beast.

539
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:53,810
It's a cat, Donkey. Come here
little kitty, kitty.

540
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:54,808
Come on.

541
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:59,184
O-ho, come here little kitty.

542
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,099
Oh, Shrek, I'm coming.

543
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:04,097
Come on!

544
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:05,479
Get it off!

545
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:07,167
Get it off!

546
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,308
Look out Shrek!

547
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,228
Get it off!

548
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,494
Hold still!

549
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:19,143
Did I miss?

550
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:20,639
No...

551
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,060
You got them!

552
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,088
Now the ogre.

553
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,467
Pray for mercy from -

554
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,497
Puss... in Boots

555
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:35,877
I'll kill that cat!

556
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,872
Hair ball

557
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,906
Ah, that is nasty!

558
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,478
What do you reckon
we should do with him?

559
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,704
I say we take the sword and
neuter him right here.

560
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:05,239
Give him the bar-barber treatment.

561
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:07,235
Oh, mercy! Please!

562
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:09,922
I implore you. It was nothing
personal senor

563
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,455
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she's sick

564
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,950
My father lives on the garbage.

565
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,174
The king offered me much in gold...
and I have little brothers...

566
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:22,626
Wow, oh-oh-oh. Fiona's father
paid you to do this?

567
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,545
The rich king? Si.

568
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:31,454
Well, so much for dad's royal blessing.

569
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:33,527
Oh, come on, Shrek. Don't feel bad.

570
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,331
Almost everybody that meets you
wants to kill you.

571
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,751
Gee, thanks.

572
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:43,621
Maybe Fiona would have been better off
if I were some sort of prince Charming?

573
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:45,732
See, that's what the king said.

574
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:50,568
Oh! Err...sorry.
I thought the question was directed at me.

575
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:54,445
Shrek. Fiona knows you'll
do anything for her.

576
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,516
It's not like I wouldn't change if I could.

577
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,045
I... just wish I could make her happy.

578
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,915
Happiness.

579
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:11,832
A teardrop away.

580
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:16,169
Donkey, think of the saddest
thing that ever happened to you.

581
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,549
Oh man, where do I begin?

582
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:22,042
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans

583
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,040
I never got over this.

584
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:24,997
Then this fool would often have a party

585
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:27,031
and he'd have all the kids
trying to pin a tail on me.

586
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,872
Then they all got drunk and
started beating me with a stick

587
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,869
Penada, penada!

588
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:32,443
What is a penada anyway?

589
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,130
No Donkey. I need you to cry.

590
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:36,934
Yeah. Well. don't go projecting on me.

591
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,006
I know what you're feeling man.
But you gotta let your own..

592
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,265
You little hairy... licking sucker...

593
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,899
Is it on? Is it on?

594
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:56,624
This is fairy godmother.

595
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,157
I am either away from my desk
or with a client.

596
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:03,609
But if you come by the office, we'd be
glad to make you a personal appointment.

597
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:05,029
Have a happy ever after.

598
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,823
Oh, are you up for a
little quest, Donkey?

599
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:15,661
That's more like it. Shrek and Donkey on
another worldwide adventure.

600
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:18,463
Ain't no stopping us now...

601
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:19,768
Stop Ogre!

602
00:37:19,883 --> 00:37:22,225
I have misjudged you.

603
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:24,067
Join the club. We've
got jackets.

604
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,059
On my honour. I am obliged to accompany you
until I have saved your life

605
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,824
as you have spared  me mine.

606
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:33,355
Sorry, the position of annoying
talking animal has already been taken.

607
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:34,622
Let go, Shrek!

608
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,311
Shrek?

609
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:45,829
Shrek!

610
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,324
Come on Donkey. Look at him...

611
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,167
And his wee little boots ...

612
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,007
How many cats can wear boots?

613
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:55,233
Honestly. Let's keep him.

614
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,269
What?

615
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,720
Oh, listen. He's purring.

616
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:03,025
Oh, so now he's cute.

617
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,174
Oh, come on Donkey. Lighten up!

618
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:08,244
I should lighten up. Look who's
teeling who to lighten up.

619
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,965
Shrek.

620
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:18,953
Shrek?

621
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,041
They're both festive, aren't they?

622
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,884
What do you think, Harold?

623
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,417
Ahem... yes. yes. Fine, fine.

624
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,558
Try to at least pretend that you're
interested in your daughter's wedding ball.

625
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:45,014
Honestly Lilian. I don't think it
really matters.

626
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:47,394
How do we know that there’s
even going to be a ball?

627
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,160
Mom! Dad!

628
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:50,580
Oh, hello dear.

629
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:53,228
What's that Cedric? Right. Coming.

630
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:55,608
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

631
00:38:55,685 --> 00:38:58,333
I haven't. You should ask your father.

632
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:03,054
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

633
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:04,858
Can I help you, your majesty?

634
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:09,502
Ah,yes. Exquisite. What do
you call this dish?

635
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,841
That would be the dog's breakfast,
your majesty.

636
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,526
Ah, yes. Very good.
Carry on, Cedric.

637
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,213
Dad, have you seen Shrek?

638
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:20,249
No, I haven't, dear.

639
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:24,586
I'm sure he went off to look for a nice
mud hole to cool down in.

640
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,505
After your little spat last night.

641
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:28,808
Oh, you heard that, hah?

642
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:31,111
Darling, the whole kingdom heard you.

643
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,679
I mean, after all it is in his nature
to be a bit of a... brute.

644
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:39,555
Him? Well you know you didn't exactly
roll out the welcome wagon.

645
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:43,010
What did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

646
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,579
Shrek loves me for who I am.

647
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:49,304
I would think you'd be happy for me.

648
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:53,066
Honey, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.

649
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,983
Maybe you should do the same.

650
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:11,259
No!? Really?

651
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:19,242
Ooh...

652
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:26,880
Oh,no, that's old  keepless place
Let's just back away slowly.

653
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:28,838
That's the fairy godmother's cottage.

654
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:32,254
She's the largest producer of
hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.

655
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:34,710
Then why don't we pop in
there for a spell?

656
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,245
Spell?

657
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:50,946
Hi. I'm here to see the...

658
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:52,020
fairy godmother.

659
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,208
I'm sorry, She's not in.

660
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,780
Jerome. Coffee and a
magic crystal. Now!

661
00:40:56,818 --> 00:41:01,309
Yes, fairy godmother.
Right away.

662
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:04,187
Look, she's not seeing any
client today, Ok?

663
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:06,337
That's Ok, buddy. We're from the Union.

664
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,680
The Union?

665
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,171
We represent the workers in all
magical industries - both evil and benign.

666
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,745
Oh...oh...alright.

667
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,969
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

668
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,080
Err... a little.

669
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:20,960
We don't even have dental.

670
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:22,380
Don't even have dental...

671
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:25,029
Ok. We're just gonna have a look around.

672
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:29,673
Oh, by the way. I think it'd be better if the
Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here?

673
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,055
You know what I'm saying, eh?

674
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,814
Of course. Go right in.

675
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,594
Drop of desire.

676
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:09,859
Naughty

677
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,620
A pinch of passion

678
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:22,410
And just a hint of...lust.

679
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:26,901
Excuse me?

680
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:29,894
Sorry to barge in like
this... but

681
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,696
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

682
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:38,300
Well... it seems that Fiona
is not exactly... happy.

683
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:42,368
Oh, there's some question as
to why that is?

684
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,978
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

685
00:42:47,473 --> 00:42:49,699
Ah... P, p, p... Princess

686
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:51,004
Cinderella

687
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:53,000
Here we are. ...lived
happily ever after.

688
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,649
No ogres.

689
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:57,836
Let's see Snow White.

690
00:42:57,913 --> 00:43:01,214
Handsome prince.
Oh... no ogres.

691
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,939
Sleeping Beauty.
Oh! No ogres.

692
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,012
Hansel and Gretel. No.

693
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,355
Thumbelina. No!

694
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:09,927
The Golden Bird, The Little Mermaid,
Pretty Woman...

695
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:14,034
No! No! No! No!
You see?

696
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,373
Ogres don't live
happily ever after.

697
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,371
All right. Look lady!

698
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:23,130
Don't you point those dirty
green sausages at me!

699
00:43:24,742 --> 00:43:27,621
Crystal and coffee...
Oh... Sorry.

700
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:31,613
Ah, that's Ok. We were
just leaving.

701
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:34,875
Very sorry to have wasted your
time, Miss godmother.

702
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:36,833
Just... go.

703
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:38,253
Come on, guys.

704
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:00,591
Working hard, hey Mac?

705
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,813


706
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:15,214
Hey man, you wanna get your
boot outa my face? That stinks!

707
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:18,707
Well, you don't exactly smell
like a basket of roses.

708
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:23,927
One of these has got to help.

709
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,576
Oh, I was just concocting
this very plan.

710
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:29,301
Already our minds are
becoming one.

711
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:33,484
When we need an expert on
licking ouselves, we'll give you a call.

712
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,056
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

713
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:39,433
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

714
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:42,619
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

715
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:46,457
No problemo, boss. In one of my
nine lives I was the great cat burglar

716
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:48,338
of Santiago de Compostella!

717
00:44:49,528 --> 00:44:50,756
Shrek,

718
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,982
Donkey, keep watch.

719
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:55,017
Keep watch. Yeah I'm gonna
keep watch

720
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:02,693
What do you see?

721
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,113
Toads softener?

722
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:08,335
Oh, yeah. I'm sure a nice B.M. is the
perfect solution for marital problems.

723
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:09,794
Alca seltzer?

724
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:14,246
No, try "handsome".

725
00:45:15,397 --> 00:45:16,779
Sorry, no "handsome'.

726
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,809
How about "Happily ever after"?

727
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:23,189
Well, what does it do?

728
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:26,490
It says: beauty divine.

729
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:29,867
You know, in some cultures donkeys
are revered as the wisest of all creatures.

730
00:45:29,906 --> 00:45:31,710
Especially us talking ones.

731
00:45:32,593 --> 00:45:33,936
Donkey!

732
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:37,505
That will have to do.
We got company.

733
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:46,180
Can we get over with this?

734
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:00,957
Nice catch, Donkey.

735
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,377
Finally.
A good use for your mouth.

736
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,902
Come on!

737
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:14,535
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

738
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:15,533
Yes, godmother.

739
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:20,484
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate.

740
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,135
Mother.

741
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,476
Charming. Sweetheart.

742
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:28,122
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mamma's working.

743
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:29,811
What happened here?

744
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,615
The ogre. That's what.

745
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:32,613
What!

746
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,764
Where is he, mamma?

747
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,528
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders.

748
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:38,754
I will smite him where he stands.

749
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:42,439
He will rue the very day he
stole my kingdom from me!

750
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:47,198
Oh, put it away, junior. You
still gonna be king.

751
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:50,269
We've just gonna have to come up with
something smarter, that's all

752
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:54,376
Pardon. Everything is accounted
for, Fairy Godmother.

753
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:56,218
Except for one potion.

754
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,369
What?

755
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,319
I do believe we can make this
work to our advantage.

756
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,999
Happily Ever After potion.
Maximum strength.

757
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:11,148
For you and your true love.

758
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:14,871
If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine:

759
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,174
happiness, comfort
and beauty divine.

760
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,403
You both will be fine?

761
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,703
I guess it means it will affect
Fiona too.

762
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:23,968
Hey, man. This
don't feel right.

763
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:25,887
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

764
00:48:25,925 --> 00:48:28,535
Why don't you just drop that
jug of voodoo and let's get outta here.

765
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:32,335
It says: beauty divine.
How bad can it be?

766
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:37,478
I see you're allergic to that stuff.
You're gonna have a reaction.

767
00:48:37,517 --> 00:48:40,971
And if you think that I'm gonna be
smearing baby rub all over your chest...

768
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:41,777
think again.

769
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:45,232
Just in case there's something
wrong with the potion...

770
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,882
allow me to take the first sip.

771
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:50,413
It would be an honour to lay my
life on the line for you.

772
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,908
Ah, no, no, no...
I don't think so.

773
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:55,710
If there's gonna be any animal testing,
I'm gonna do it...

774
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:59,126
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

775
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,190
How do you feel?

776
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:08,760
Well, I don't feel...
any different

777
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:10,065
Do I look any different?

778
00:49:10,142 --> 00:49:11,677
You look like an ass to me.

779
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:15,093
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

780
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:19,814
Well, here's to us, Fiona.

781
00:49:19,852 --> 00:49:20,812
Shrek!

782
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,731
If you drink that,
there's no going back.

783
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:23,575
I know.

784
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,648
But no more wallowing
in the mud?

785
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:27,260
No more itsy butt crack?

786
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,258
I know!

787
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:29,870
But you love being an ogre.

788
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:35,742
But I love Fiona more.

789
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:38,583
Shrek, no!
Wait!

790
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:56,430
I think you grabbed the fartier
... of the potion.

791
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:57,927
Maybe it's a dud.

792
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,497
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.

793
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:08,559
O-oh, what did I tell you?
I think something coming on.

794
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,939
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die!

795
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:13,126
I don't wanna die!
Oh, Please...

796
00:50:13,203 --> 00:50:17,272
I am melting!... I'm melting...

797
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,536
It's just the rain, Donkey.

798
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:21,954
All right.

799
00:51:04,558 --> 00:51:07,859
Oh, Shrek, don't worry. Things
seem bad 'cause it's dark and rainy

800
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:10,431
and Fiona's father hired a sleazy
hitman wacky.

801
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:12,465
It'd be better in the morning.

802
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,463
You'll see.

803
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,917
The sun'll come out...

804
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:19,873
tomorrow.

805
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:20,870
Bet your bottom...

806
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:23,711
Bit my bottom?

807
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:26,896
Donkey?

808
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:28,969
Are you all right?

809
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:32,155
Hey, boss. Let's shave him.

810
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:33,997
Do-do-donkey...

811
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:44,744
There you are. We
missed you at dinner.

812
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:47,431
What is it, darling?

813
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:51,231
Dad, I've been thinking
about what you said.

814
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:54,608
And... I'm gonna set things right.

815
00:51:54,685 --> 00:51:57,026
Excellent. That's my girl.

816
00:51:57,065 --> 00:51:59,214
It was a mistake to bring
Shrek here.

817
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,131
I'm gonna go out and find him.

818
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:05,816
And then we're gonna go back
to the swamp where we belong.

819
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:10,230
Fiona! Please.

820
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:14,106
Err... let's stop being rash, darling

821
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:18,520
Fiona!
- Fiona!

822
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:01,662
Look, look...
- Shh... quiet.

823
00:53:05,423 --> 00:53:07,380
Good morning, sleepy head.

824
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:11,257
Good morning!
- We love your kitty.

825
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:13,176
My head...

826
00:53:13,215 --> 00:53:15,210
Here, I fetched you
a pail of water.

827
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:16,899
Oh, eh,... thanks.

828
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,917
A cute button nose,...

829
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:29,450
thick wavy locks?!...

830
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,559
Taut round buttocks?!

831
00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:34,862
I'm... I'm...

832
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,860
Gorgeous

833
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:37,932
I'll say.
-  I'm Jill. What's your name?

834
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:39,237
I'm... Shrek.

835
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:40,926
Shrek? Wow!

836
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:42,231
Are you from Europe?

837
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:43,690
You're so tense.

838
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:46,991
I wanna rub your shoulders.
- I got it covered, thanks.
- I don't have anything to rub.

839
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:48,564
Well, get in line.

840
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,675
Have you, ladies, seen my donkey?

841
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:51,980
Who are you calling "donkey"?

842
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:55,396
Donkey?!
You're a...

843
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:58,121
A stallion, baby!
I can whinny!

844
00:53:58,198 --> 00:54:00,194
I can ...

845
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:01,844
Look at me, Shrek!

846
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:02,842
I'm trotting.

847
00:54:04,493 --> 00:54:07,180
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

848
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:10,826


849
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:16,353
Warning! Side effects may include:
burning, itching, oozing, weeping...

850
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:20,229
Not intended for heart patients,
or those with nervous disorders.

851
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,063
What?

852
00:54:26,255 --> 00:54:29,787
Senor! To make the effects of this
potion permanent

853
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:32,435
the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss...

854
00:54:32,473 --> 00:54:33,586
...by midnight.

855
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:36,619
Midnight? Why is it
always midnight?

856
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:39,305
Pick me! I'll be your true love.
- I'll be your true love...

857
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,531
I'll be true... enough.

858
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:45,254
Look. Ladies, I already have a true love.

859
00:54:46,636 --> 00:54:50,897
But take it from me, boss.
You're going to have one satisfied princess.

860
00:54:50,973 --> 00:54:53,929
Let's face it. You are
now easy on the eyes,

861
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,692
But inside you're still the same
old, mean, salty

862
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:58,765
cantankerous...
-All right then!

863
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:02,526
...angry ogre you've always been.
- And you're still the same annoying donkey!

864
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:03,678
Yeah!

865
00:55:05,904 --> 00:55:11,009
Well, look out princess!
Here comes the new me!

866
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,154
First things first. We need to
get you out of those clothes.

867
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:20,911
Ready?
- Ready!

868
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:27,436
Driver, stop!

869
00:55:27,513 --> 00:55:30,161
God, help me, please!!!

870
00:55:30,315 --> 00:55:33,923
I'm blind! I'm blind!
I'll never be able to play the violin again.

871
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,106
Oh, you poor creature. Is there
anything I can do for you?

872
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,371
Well, I guess there is... one thing

873
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:43,672
Take off the powder wig and
step away from your drawers!

874
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,928
Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

875
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:00,944
Father? Is everything
all right, father?

876
00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:07,852
Thank you, gentlemen.

877
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,232
Some day I will repay you.

878
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:13,610
Unless of course I can't find you,
or if I forget.

879
00:56:32,379 --> 00:56:37,023
Turn faces, strange changes

880
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:40,285
Don't wanna be a richer one.

881
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,503
Turn faces, strange changes

882
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,650
Just gonna have to be a different man.

883
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:55,369
Time may change me.
But I can't trace time.

884
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:02,470
Halt! Tell princess Fiona her husband
Sir Shrek is here to see her!

885
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:10,377
Still don't know what I was looking for

886
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:15,558
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets...

887
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:18,782
Every time I thought I’d got it made

888
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:22,198
It seemed the taste was not so sweet

889
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:25,269
Fiona!

890
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:26,344
Shrek?

891
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:36,515
Time may change me
But I can’t trace time...

892
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:37,666
Fiona!

893
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,771
Hello, handsome.

894
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,650
Shrek!

895
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:46,955
Princess!

896
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:48,759
Donkey?!

897
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:50,985
Wow, that potion worked on
you too, hah!

898
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,482
What potion?

899
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:55,783
It's kind of a long story but see,
Shrek and I took some magic potion...

900
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,354
... and well, now...
we're sexy!

901
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:00,695
Shrek?

902
00:58:04,802 --> 00:58:07,604
For you, baby...
I could be.

903
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:08,794
Yeah, you wish.

904
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:10,329
Donkey, where is Shrek?

905
00:58:10,406 --> 00:58:11,826
He just went inside
looking for you.

906
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,396
Shrek!

907
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:17,276
Fiona!

908
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:18,927
Fiona!

909
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:22,880
You wanna dance, pretty boy?

910
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,217
Where are you going
so soon?

911
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,597
Don't you wanna see your wife?

912
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:31,823
Fiona.

913
00:58:34,203 --> 00:58:35,162
Shrek?

914
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:38,156
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

915
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,768
What happened to your voice?

916
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:43,760
Err... the potion changed a
lot of things, Fiona...

917
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,485
but not the way I
feel about you.

918
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:48,136
Fiona?

919
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,669
Charming?

920
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:52,396
Ah, do you think so?...

921
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:53,739
dad.

922
00:58:53,778 --> 00:58:55,850
I was so hoping you'd approve.

923
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:57,808
Who are you?

924
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:59,458
Mom, it's me: Shrek.

925
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:03,373
I know you never get a second
chance of a first impression...

926
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:06,213
but well... What do you think?

927
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,930
Fiona! Fiona!!!

928
00:59:14,811 --> 00:59:16,270
Fiona!

929
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,378
Fiona!
-Fiona! Fiona!

930
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:24,023
I don't think they can hear
us pigeon.

931
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:30,010
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

932
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:32,774
I just wanted her to be happy.

933
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:37,380
And now she can be. Oh,
sweetheart.

934
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:41,525
She's finally found the
prince of her dreams.

935
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:45,094
But look at me. Look
what I've done for her.

936
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:48,779
It's time you stopped living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

937
00:59:49,048 --> 00:59:53,039
She's a princess. And
you're an ogre.

938
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:57,415
That's something no amount of
potion is ever going to change.

939
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:07,663
But... I love her.

940
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:13,382
If you really love her.
You'll let her go.

941
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,214
Shrek?
- Senor?

942
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,711
Hey! What's going on?

943
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:22,901
Where are you going?

944
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:33,916
You wouldn't have had anything
to do with this, would you Harold?

945
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,399
People just ain't no good

946
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:48,578
A thing that's well understood.

947
01:00:48,617 --> 01:00:49,883
There you go, boys

948
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:51,917
Just leave the bottle, Boris.

949
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:54,643
Hey, why the long face?

950
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,519
It was all just a stupid mistake.

951
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:02,856
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

952
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:06,810
I hate Mondays.

953
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,725
I can't believe you gonna just walk away from
the best thing that ever happened to you.

954
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,947
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty boy...

955
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:16,175
Prince Charming.

956
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:18,593
Ah, come on now. Is he
really that good looking?

957
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,742
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous.

958
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,698
He has a face that looks
like it was carved by angels.

959
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,116
Hmm, he sounds dreamy.

960
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:30,299
You know, shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

961
01:01:32,909 --> 01:01:36,095
Look guys. It's for the best.

962
01:01:36,594 --> 01:01:40,816
Mom and dad approve and Fiona
gets the man she's always dreamed of.

963
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,157
Everybody wins.

964
01:01:44,616 --> 01:01:49,452
Except for you. I don't get it,
Shrek. You love Fiona.

965
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:53,789
Aye... And that's why
I have to let her go.

966
01:01:54,288 --> 01:02:00,429
Ah...ahem... excuse me. Is she here?
- She's in the back.

967
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:03,308
Oh! Hello again.

968
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,140
Fairy godmother... Charming.

969
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:13,940
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

970
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:19,850
I'm afraid Fiona isn't really warming
up to prince Charming.

971
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:22,269
Not my fault.

972
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:23,919
Of course it's not, dear.

973
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:27,949
I mean, how charming can I be when
I have to pretend to be I'm dreadful ogre.

974
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:33,668
It's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best
if we call this whole thing off, Ok?

975
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:34,474
What?
- What?

976
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:37,621
I mean you can't force someone
to fall in love...

977
01:02:37,813 --> 01:02:40,807
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time.

978
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:46,104
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in
love with the first man she kisses...

979
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,292
which will be Charming.

980
01:02:49,328 --> 01:02:50,748
Err...no.

981
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:52,168
What did you say?

982
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:54,625
I... I can't. I won't do it.

983
01:02:54,663 --> 01:02:59,883
Yes you will. If you remember I helped
you with your happily ever after.

984
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:03,529
And I can take it away just as easily.

985
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:05,371
Is it what you want?

986
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:06,676
Is it?

987
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,056
No.

988
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:12,165
Good boy. Now, we have to go.

989
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:14,468
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

990
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:17,999
You know, it's all high in the front.
You can never get to the back.

991
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:19,918
You know you always need someone
to do the back of your hair.

992
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:21,492
Thank you, mother.

993
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,682
Mother!?

994
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,213
Err... a talking horse.

995
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:27,710
The ogre.

996
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,243
Stop them!

01:03:30,243-->01:03:32,239
Thieves, bandits!

997
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:33,697
Stop them!

998
01:03:37,118 --> 01:03:41,758
Far Far Away royal ball blow out.

999
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:46,670

1000
01:03:46,786 --> 01:03:51,315
Everyone who's anyone has turned up
to honour Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek...

1001
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:53,886
and oh my!... the outfits
look gorgeous.

1002
01:03:53,925 --> 01:03:56,189
Look! Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?

1003
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:01,601
And right behind them:
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina...

1004
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:03,597
Aren't they adorable?

1005
01:04:04,365 --> 01:04:06,744
Here comes Sleeping Beauty...
oh...tired old thing...

1006
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:12,041
Who's this? Who's this?

1007
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,528
Oh! It's the one. It's the only.
It's the Fairy Godmother.

1008
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:22,366
Hello, Far Far Away!

1009
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:32,806
May all your endings be happy and...
ah, you know the rest.

1010
01:04:33,573 --> 01:04:33,957


1011
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,797
We'll be right back with the royal
Far Far Away ball...

1012
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:38,026
after these messages.

1013
01:04:38,102 --> 01:04:41,825
I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears.

1014
01:04:41,864 --> 01:04:43,246
Put over to Wheel of Torture

1015
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:47,391
I'm not flipping anywhere, Sir, until
I see Shrek and Fiona.

1016
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:51,997
Bad wizards on you, guys.
Hey mice, pass me a buffalo wing.

1017
01:04:52,035 --> 01:04:54,530
No, no to your left.
Your left!

1018
01:04:57,408 --> 01:04:58,905
Tonight on Knights...

1019
01:04:58,944 --> 01:05:00,709
Ah! Now here's a good show.

1020
01:05:00,748 --> 01:05:02,705
We got a white bronco headed east
into the forest.

1021
01:05:02,744 --> 01:05:03,972
Requesting back-up.

1022
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,600
It's time for the men in steel to
teach this madcap..

1023
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,424
that this devil-may-care attitude
just won't fly

1024
01:05:11,571 --> 01:05:14,220


1025
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,327
I have to talk to Princess Fiona.
- We warned you.

1026
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:22,741
Will they get away with it?
Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

1027
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,270
Oh! Get it off!

1028
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:31,530
Captain, if I say it's not mine?

1029
01:05:32,758 --> 01:05:34,639
Find Princess Fiona!

1030
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,481
I'm a donkey!

1031
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:41,586
Quick! Rewind it!

1032
01:05:42,622 --> 01:05:43,428
Shrek!

1033
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:45,616
I'm her husband Shrek!

1034
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,211
Darling?

1035
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:21,043
I thought I might find you here. How about
a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?

1036
01:06:21,887 --> 01:06:23,384
I'm not going.

1037
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:26,723
But the whole kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

1038
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,830
There's just one problem. That'
not my husband.

1039
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,977
I mean, look at him.

1040
01:06:35,398 --> 01:06:40,272
Yes, he is a bit different. But people
change for the ones they love.

1041
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:43,419
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

1042
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:47,718
Change? He's completely
lost his mind.

1043
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:51,173
Darling, why not come down to the
ball and give him another chance?

1044
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:54,282
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

1045
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:57,199
But it's the old one I
fell in love with, dad...

1046
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,037
I'd give anything to have him back.

1047
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:09,097
Darling, that's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.

1048
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:16,927
Thanks.

1049
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:28,633
I wanna ... my Miranda rights.
I have the right to remain silent.

1050
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,361
No one said I have the right
to remain silent

1051
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:33,623
Donkey! You Have the
right to remain silent.

1052
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:36,041
What you lack is
the capacity.

1053
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,956
I must hold on before
I too go totally mad.

1054
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:41,184
Shrek?

1055
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:42,528
Donkey?

1056
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:44,370
Too late.

1057
01:07:44,485 --> 01:07:47,748
Gingie. Pinocchio! Get us
out of here!

1058
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:19,950
Quick! Tell a lie!

1059
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:21,524
Err, what shall I say?

1060
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,944
Anything but quick!

1061
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:25,439
Say something crazy like:
I'm wearing ladies' underwear.

1062
01:08:25,592 --> 01:08:28,394
I err... am wearing ladies'
underwear.

1063
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:32,923
Are you?

1064
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,650
I most certainly am not!

1065
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:37,721
It looks like you most certainly are.

1066
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,680
Am not!

1067
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:39,640
What kind?

1068
01:08:39,678 --> 01:08:41,866
It's a thong.

1069
01:08:41,905 --> 01:08:42,711
They are briefs.

1070
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:54,110
Hey, wait... Hey!

1071
01:08:58,562 --> 01:08:58,946
What?

1072
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:00,405
Puss!

1073
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:03,322
Sorry, boss.

1074
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,970
Quit messing around.
We've gotta stop that kiss!

1075
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,851
I thought you was gonna
let her go?

1076
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:10,499
I was but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1077
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:13,646
That's what I like to hear.
Look who's finally coming around.

1078
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:17,984
But that's impossible! We never get in the castle,
it's guarded and there's a moat and everything!

1079
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:25,199
Well folks, it looks like we're up
chocolate creek without a popsickle stick.

1080
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,262
Do you still know the muffin man?

1081
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:36,215
Well ,sure. He's down on
Dreary Lane. Why?

1082
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:41,589
Because we're gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.

1083
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:45,964
Gingy!

1084
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:50,762
Fire up the ovens Muffin Man.
We've got a big order to fill.

1085
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:57,210
It's... alive!

1086
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,666
Go, Mongo, go!

1087
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:22,772
There it is, Mongo.
To the castle!

1088
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:27,609
No, no, no, you great
stupid pastry! Come on!

1089
01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:37,818
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1090
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:41,810
That's right. Follow
the pretty pony.

1091
01:10:42,002 --> 01:10:43,998
Pretty pony wants
to play at the castle.

1092
01:10:47,606 --> 01:10:51,789
Ladies and gentlemen! Presenting
Princess Fiona

1093
01:10:51,866 --> 01:10:54,629
and her new husband, Prince Shrek!

1094
01:10:57,047 --> 01:10:59,120
Shrek, what are you doing?

1095
01:10:59,197 --> 01:11:02,076
I'm just... playing
the part, Fiona.

1096
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:04,494
Is that glitter on your lips?

1097
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:07,334
Cherry flavoured. Want
to taste?

1098
01:11:08,217 --> 01:11:09,829
What is with you?!

1099
01:11:09,905 --> 01:11:11,402
But, muffin cake.

1100
01:11:14,665 --> 01:11:17,083
C minor. Put in C minor.

1101
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:19,002
Ladies and gentlemen,

1102
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,260
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

1103
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,333
Princess Fiona..

1104
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,521
and Prince Shrek.

1105
01:11:28,866 --> 01:11:33,203
Fiona, my princess, do you
honour me with the dance?

1106
01:11:34,048 --> 01:11:38,346
Where have all the
good men gone and

1107
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:41,954
where are all the gods?

1108
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:50,475
Where's the street-wise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?

1109
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:54,851
Since when do you dance?

1110
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:58,919
Fiona my dearest, if there's one thing
I know, is that love

1111
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,838
is full of surprises.

1112
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:09,666
Late at night I toss and turn and I dream
of what I need

1113
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:11,931
Hit it!

1114
01:12:15,423 --> 01:12:17,266
I need a hero

1115
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:21,641
All right, big fella.
Let's crash this party.

1116
01:12:22,486 --> 01:12:24,021
Fire the catapult!

1117
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:27,207
Fire!

1118
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:41,600
The gumdrop button

1119
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:49,583
It's coming!...

1120
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:52,078
All right!

1121
01:12:54,803 --> 01:13:00,023
Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

1122
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,211
Go, Mongo! Go!

1123
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:18,869
That's it.

1124
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:22,438
Watch out!

1125
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,146
After you, Mongo!

1126
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,612
More heat! Let's go.

1127
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,567
Up where the mountains
meet the heavens above

1128
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,714
Out where the lightning splits the sea

1129
01:13:37,868 --> 01:13:42,666
I could swear that there's someone
somewhere watching me

1130
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:24,963
Come on!

1131
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:36,784
I need a hero

1132
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:40,661
I'm holding out for a hero
'til the morning light

1133
01:14:41,237 --> 01:14:47,454
He's gotta be strong
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

1134
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:49,796
Puss!

1135
01:14:53,519 --> 01:14:56,052
Go! Go! Your
lady needs you. Go!

1136
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,579
Today... I repay my debt.

1137
01:15:09,524 --> 01:15:11,750
En guarde!

1138
01:15:15,742 --> 01:15:18,697
And he's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

1139
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:21,307
And he's gotta be fresh
from the fight.

1140
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,188
I need a hero...

1141
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:24,071
Stop!

1142
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:32,937
Hey! You! Back away
from my wife!

1143
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,012
Shrek?

1144
01:15:34,933 --> 01:15:37,543
You couldn't just go back to
your swamp.. and

1145
01:15:37,581 --> 01:15:39,193
live well enough alone.

1146
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,496
No!
- Pigs on blanket.

1147
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,524
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1148
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,164
I'm a real boy!

1149
01:15:55,352 --> 01:15:56,849


1150
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:12,556
I'm a real... ha!

1151
01:16:16,693 --> 01:16:18,189
It's mine! That's mine!

1152
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:24,369
Pray for mercy from Puss

1153
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:25,367
And Donkey!

1154
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,744
She's taken the potion.
Kiss her now!

1155
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:33,235
No!

1156
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:56,379
Fiona.

1157
01:16:56,418 --> 01:16:57,646
Shrek.

1158
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:01,523
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1159
01:17:01,753 --> 01:17:05,783
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea.

1160
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,819
Mummy!

1161
01:17:06,896 --> 01:17:07,817
Mummy?

1162
01:17:09,736 --> 01:17:15,609
I told you ogres don't live
happily ever after!

1163
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:40,711
Dad.

1164
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:46,621
Is he up?

1165
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:50,460
He croaked.

1166
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:53,415
Harold?

1167
01:17:53,453 --> 01:17:54,413
Dad?

1168
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,821
I thought you'd never
see me like this.

1169
01:17:58,022 --> 01:18:00,422
-Hey, and he gave you a hard time.
-Donkey!

1170
01:18:00,477 --> 01:18:02,550
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry...

1171
01:18:02,627 --> 01:18:08,039
to both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.

1172
01:18:08,653 --> 01:18:12,491
But I can see now,
she already has it.

1173
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:16,060
Shrek, Fiona...

1174
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:20,091
Will you accept an old
frog's appologies?

1175
01:18:20,628 --> 01:18:22,240
and... my blessing.

1176
01:18:23,507 --> 01:18:24,466
Harold.

1177
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:29,264
I'm sorry Lilian. I just wish
I could be the man you deserve.

1178
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:34,599
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1179
01:18:34,983 --> 01:18:36,326
warts and all.

1180
01:18:39,896 --> 01:18:42,659
Boss! The Happilly
Ever After Potion.

1181
01:18:42,736 --> 01:18:44,463
Midnight.

1182
01:18:44,655 --> 01:18:47,649
Fiona. Is this what you want?

1183
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:51,372
To be this way forever.
- What?

1184
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:56,246
'Cause if you kissed me now,
we can stay like this.

1185
01:18:56,784 --> 01:18:59,739
You'd do that?
For me?

1186
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:01,390
Yes.

1187
01:19:09,872 --> 01:19:15,629
I want what every princess wants,
to live happily ever after...

1188
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,538
with the ogre I married.

1189
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,065
Whatever happens...
I must not cry.

1190
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:30,867
You cannot make me... cry...

1191
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:57,466
No, no, no... no!

1192
01:20:21,723 --> 01:20:24,870
You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1193
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:31,702
Now. Where were we?

1194
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:34,082
I remember.

1195
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:44,829
Aren't we supposed to be
having a fiesta?

1196
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:46,172
Uno, dos, quatro...
Hit it!

1197
01:20:55,921 --> 01:21:00,834


1198
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:06,284


1199
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,905
Hey, gorgeous.
