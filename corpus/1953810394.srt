No. No way. It's yummy.

It's like lemonade. No way.

You're never gonna make it
through college if you can't chug.

16
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:19,044
I can chug. I chugged
at Aaron Fink's party.

17
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,780
Oh, Aaron Fink's party in middle school,

18
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,315
where you drank all the root beer

19
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,284
until you barfed in the rec room?

20
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,985
It totally counts. Really?

21
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,720
And it was cute.

22
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,291

I will treasure forever.

You guys think I can fly?

27
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,935
Should really stay away from this stuff.

00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,003

much, and I'm, like, whoo.

00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,888
Hi, Ms. Hardy.

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,857
Didn't realize you were still here.

40
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,494
How's your sister doing?

00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,430
Uh, good. Thanks.

42
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,732
Good.

43
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,069
Cat, you have boys over,

door's open, okay?

45
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,939
Sorry, Mom.

46
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,875
Do you have any Coke, Mrs. Hardy?

47
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,344
Yeah, but it's a little
late for caffeine.

48
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,512
It's a school night.

49
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,113
Mom, two of our friends already got

50
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,481
their college acceptance letters,

51
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,416
and that means ours are coming next.

52
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,885
It probably is, but I'd love

53
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,853
to see you graduate high school first.

54
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,055
Come on, guys. It's getting late.

55
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,690
We'll wrap it up soon, Mrs. Hardy.

56
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,459
Thanks.

57
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,096

00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,031
Uh, good night, Mrs. Hardy.

59
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,501
Okay, okay. Good night.

60
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,709
Sorry. Mom's a mom.

61
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,413
Yeah, I should probably be getting
out of here pretty soon anyway.

00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,150

Okay. B-Bye, guys.

No. No. Uh...

69
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,742
it's Joan.

70
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,979
Cool.

71
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,114
♪ Hold me down, making the rounds...♪ 

72
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,984
Her birth mother's been calling

73
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,820
and asking to meet her.

74
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,156
And that's bad?

75
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,592
Joan doesn't know she's adopted.

76
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:50,429
Nobody does, besides family and...

77
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,663
and you.

78
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,967
It's none of my business,

79
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:58,437
but maybe it's time to tell her.

80
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,638
No. No, no.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,206
You... You can't tell her anything.

82
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,641
No, I won't. Okay?

83
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,209
That's not what I meant.

84
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,612
She's gone through enough, you know?

85
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,780
Things are tough enough for her.

86
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,186
Now, this... this woman gave Joan away.

87
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,788
She doesn't want her.

88
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,223
She just...

89
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,792
She just wants to come in her life

90
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,528
and ruin it for my sister again.

91
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,533
You're a good brother.

92
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,968

93
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,306
And a good boyfriend.

94
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,016
Eww.

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,055
I'm gonna send you
something tonight, hmm?

96
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,056
Mm-mm.

97
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,791
Something to cheer you up.

98
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,493
Really? Mm-hmm.

99
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,494
What?

100
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,195
Well...

101
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,830
You're right. Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,565
I already do like it.

103
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,669
That's just the first in a series.

104
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,836
Oh, a series.

105
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,638
Yeah.

106
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,043
Hey, now, I'm just a little bear.

107
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,912
I know.

108
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,847
You're a very sexy bear, though.

109
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,516
No, you're sexy.

110
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,217
Oh, me? I'm sexy?

111
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,586
Oh, stop it.

112
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,156
Oh, this is fun.

113
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,807
Good morning, sunshine.

114
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,842
Oh, not yet!

115
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,311
Come on, Kitty Cat.
Today's the big election.

116
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,281
You don't want to have to accept office

117
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,183
with bags under your eyes.

118
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,890
Cat?

119
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,393
Is that Daniel's
cologne I smell in there?

120
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,898
We weren't doing anything
crazy, Mom, just kissing.

121
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,702
Just be careful.

122
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,605
Well, you're a very sensitive girl,

123
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,707
and you know how boys can be.

124
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,975
Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,977
Getting physical for them doesn't always

126
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,714
mean the same thing to
them as it does to us.

127
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,585
Just ask your father, for example.

128
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,754
Here we go.

129
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,288
Are you listening to me?

130
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,857
Mom, look.

131
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,593
Did you just hear anything that I said?

132
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,761
Yes. Look.

133
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,662
You haven't been up three minutes,

134
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,164
and you're already online.

135
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:43,001
I've been promising Em
I'd post this for months.

136
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,171
Okay, go! Am I going first?

137
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,806
Yeah. Okay.

138
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,608
Ha ha!

139
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,076
I'm nervous. Gah!

140
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,944
Okay, we did it!

141
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,315
You two are so cute.

142
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,352
In AP English, we had to
map out our four-year plans,

143
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,921
and Emily and I have
everything all planned out.

144
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,956
We're gonna do the Brown/RISD
dual-degree program.

145
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,092
You can request the roommate
you want in the dorms,

146
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,827
and we'll be taking the
same dual-degree program,

147
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,128
graphic design and marketing,

148
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,963
which will give us the
edge when we graduate

149
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,932
and start our internships in New York.

150
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,200
Brown's so far away.

151
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,402
Well, I'll come visit on holidays.

152
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,972
My baby.

153
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,708
What happened to my little girl? Ohh.

154
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,045
You were only seven pounds,
two ounces when you were born.

155
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,780
Gosh, not the birth story.

156
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,650
You were the most delicate
thing the nurse had ever seen.

157
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,219
You were just like a
little porcelain doll,

158
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,221
this... Ooh. I gotta go!

159
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,323
This little finger.

160
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,324
Hey!

161
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,999
Sweetheart, I think your
four-year plan sounds great.

162
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,468
Okay. Bye.

163
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,138
Have a good day.

164
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,450
Has the Web had a positive or
negative impact on modern society?

165
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:09,221
This paper will make up
20% of your final grade,

166
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,956
so for some of you,

167
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,225
that will make or break your GPA,

168
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,726
so let's put some effort into it.

169
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,027
This paper will be due on Wednesday...

170
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,729
Are you ready to lose to me today?

171
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,464
Never.

172
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,366
It's okay to be a
one-term president, Cat.

173
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,235
History looks kindly on them.

174
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,704
There was Nixon

175
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,706
and George Bush

176
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,907
and Taft,

177
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,475
but I think he died.

178
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,345
No way. I'm winning.

179
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes, I can.

180
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,781
Yes, I can.

181
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,049
Yes, I can.

182
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,052
Shh. Some of us are
trying to pay attention.

183
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,022
Sorry, Jessica. Sorry, Jessica.

184
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:48,260
Was your parents' life better or
worse because of the World Wide Web?

185
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,862
Yes, I can. In terms of economics,

186
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,799
how has it changed society, religion?

187
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,937
Put the phone away, or it is mine!

188
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,747
Let's get to work.

189
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,221
Hey, Em! I voted for you.

190
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,256
Oh, thank you.

191
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,825
Y-You're hot.

192
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,561
Thank you.

193
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,364
You know what's more awkward than that?

194
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,366
Mr. Perryman calling it "the Web."

195
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,935
Who calls it "the Web"?

196
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,404
Well, I enjoy surfing
the World Wide Web.

197
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,072
Oh, mocking a teacher.

198
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,509
You're like this pink
candy shell on the outside

199
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,778
and like poisonous venom on the inside,

200
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,212
exactly how I like you.

201
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,281
Well, it's your bad influence, so...

202
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,416
Hmm. Well, yeah.

203
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,955
Your mom texts you, like,
a hundred times a day.

204
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,957
So? She loves me.

205
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,326
She's my second-best friend.

206
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,794
So I'm your first-best friend?

207
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,228
Yeah. Oh, okay. Good.

208
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,131
Then I shall be thanking
you in my acceptance speech

209
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,399
when I win for president.

210
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,400
Boo! Oh!

211
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,070
I got you.

212
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,404
Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,310
I like the pictures you
sent the other night.

214
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,613
Mmm. Shh.

215
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,819
You are very beautiful, really.

216
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,287
They're just for you.

217
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,288
I know. Mm-hmm.

218
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,289
They better be.

219
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,260
Bye, baby.

220
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,562
Bye.

221
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,298
Bye. See you.

222
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,266
Oh, good luck on the election!

223
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,136
Uh, both of you.

224
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,170
I, uh...

225
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,438
Uh-huh.

226
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,981
This camera is so
good. I love this lens.

227
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,018
Oh, look at this picture
of Daniel and Joan.

228
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,419
He's so sweet to her.

229
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,921
He really is.

230
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,890
"I'm gonna send you something later.

231
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,325
Kissy, kissy, kissy."

232
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,459
You heard that?

233
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,061
Yes.

234
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,362
Oh, sorry.

235
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,864
It's fine.

236
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,432
There's nothing better
than hanging out alone

237
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,167
while listening to you two make out.

238
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,902
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,337
It's okay. He's cool.

240
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,371
I get it.

241
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,274
That's a great shot.

242
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,443
Ms. Langran, I was thinking
maybe we could do a page

243
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,211
in the yearbook about Star Kids,

244
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,214
like feature Joan and some of
the other kids in the program

245
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,583
and maybe some of the volunteers
we know who work after school.

246
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,052
Like Daniel?

247
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,219
Well, I like it...

248
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,058
but we are gonna need a few more photos.

249
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,027
Do you think you guys could go
over to the volunteer center,

250
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,396
maybe grab some interviews,
get a few more pics?

251
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,497
Can we use this camera?

252
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,598
If you sign it out.

253
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,968
Did you take this?

254
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,370
Oh, yeah. Me and Cat.

255
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,238
You guys have a great eye.

256
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,908
I'm really glad you're both
thinking of graphic design.

257
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,109
Thank you.

258
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,311
Attention, students.

259
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:58,249
Election results are in
for Student Body Council.

260
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,320
Student body rep, Raymond Barajas.

261
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,191
Treasurer, Misty Jenkins.

262
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,461
Secretary, Pamela Ferguson.

263
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,930
Vice President, Casey Price.

264
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,433
And your president...

265
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,936
it was a close one...

266
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,537
Cat Hardy!

267
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,944
Congratulations to all our winners.

268
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,278
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,681
No, it's fine. She won fair and square.

270
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,349
Ah, congratulations.

271
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,123
You're not mad?

272
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,124
No!

273
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,158
Congratulations, silly.

274
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,326
Thanks.

275
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,028
Oh.

276
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,666
Aww.

277
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,537
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey!

278
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,572

Don't!

288
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,324
Don't!

289
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,026
Oh, does that bother you?

290
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,694
Get away from me!

291
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,563
Look at me, retard!

292
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,764
Hey!

293
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,199
What did you say?

294
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,567
It's just a joke.

295
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,068
Well, it's not funny.

296
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,436
Come on, Joan.

297
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,038
Sorry we can't all
be suck-ups like you.

298
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,139
Hey, shut up!

299
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,407
Make me! Maybe I will.

300
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,542
You know what, Emily?

301
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,210
She's not even worth it.

302
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,579
Why don't you shut your stupid mouth?

303
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,748
Excuse me, ladies. Is
there a problem here?

304
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,716
Yeah. Haylee's bullying Joan.

305
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,020
That's a lie. I didn't even touch her.

306
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,721
Joan, is that true?

307
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,024
She called me the "R" word.

308
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,158
Thank you, Joan.

309
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,426
Haylee, Principal's office

310
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,428
now. Now.

311
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,266
Come on.

312
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,110
Okay. Okay, now...

313
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,745
Now you can color two boxes,

314
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,482
and then you have to write
who, what, when, where and why.

315
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,585
Write along this red
line, down to this...

316
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,587
Okay, okay. Don't rush me.

317
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,726
So, anyway, Haylee's on probation now.

318
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,094
What's her problem? I don't know.

319
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,463
She's a piece of trash.

320
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,737
Sorry, guys.

321
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,405
I just...

322
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,141
I just don't like people
messing with my sister.

323
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,848
Thanks for having her back, Cat.

324
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,783
Of course.

325
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,784
Joan.

326
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,687
Say cheese.

327
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,726
I... I don't like pictures.

328
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,160
One more?

329
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,162
Okay.

330
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,675
Oh, we gotta go.

331
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,444
No! I wanted to interview more people.

332
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,247
I can drive you home.

333
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,316
Thanks.

334
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,251
Finally found a good one, Cat.

335
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,386
I know.

336
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,687
See you guys.

337
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,721
Bye.

338
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,796
Mom?

339
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,197
In here.

340
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,801
Madam President.

341
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,870
Oh, jeez, Mom.

342
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm so proud of you, honey.

343
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,275
And I made a special meal.

344
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,345
Well, I got a special meal.

345
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,181
Santa Fe Supremo from Antonio's,

346
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,482
your favorite, double guac.

347
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,285
Yay. You're the best.

348
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,321
I thought...

349
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,690
we might even have

350
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,893
one more reason we might be celebrating.

351
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,566
Oh, it's thin.

352
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,301
I don't think that matters.

353
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm too nervous! I can't open it!

354
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,341
Can you do it?

355
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,475
Okay. Really? Yeah.

356
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,443
All right.

357
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,212
Wait, wait, wait!

358
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,847
Maybe I should wait for Emily?

359
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,350
It's too late. You want me to s-stop?

360
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,384
No.

361
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,328
"Dear Catherine Hardy,

362
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,698

364
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,604

contingent on maintaining a 3.3 GPA."

369
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,983
Oh, Cat.

370
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,451
I got a full ride.

371
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,888
I got into Brown/RISD.

372
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,791
Oh, baby. Kitty Cat, why are you crying?

373
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,362
I'm happy.

374
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,897
It's finally happening.

375
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,735
Oh, Mom.

376
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,937
We've still got the rest
of spring and summer.

377
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,572
We'll spend tons of time together.

378
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,573
Yeah.

379
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,841
I'm gonna call Em.

380
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,553
Hello.

381
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,954
Did you get it?

382
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,389
Yeah.

383
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,259
Oh, no.

384
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,994
It sounds like you got in.

385
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,529
That's great. I don't get it.

386
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,431
You have a higher GPA than I do.

387
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,967
Um, maybe you have, like,
more activities, or...

388
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,271
you know, maybe you had a better essay.

389
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,307
Oh, Em, don't cry.

390
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,076
I'm sorry. It's...

391
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,879
Don't worry about me, okay?

392
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,048
This is really good for you.

393
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,416
Congratulations.

394
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,051
I'm not going without you.

395
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,853
Don't be stupid.

396
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,790
This is our plan, our dream!

397
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,692
We'll contest it together.

398
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,062
You would do that for me?

399
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,464
We're best friends.

400
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,467
They're not gonna split us up.

401
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,335
You know, come over tonight.

402
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,903
We'll write the admissions committee.

403
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,338
We'll change their minds.

404
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,006
Mom, is that okay?

405
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,675
Yeah.

406
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,946
Actually, come over now.
We don't have a lot of time.

407
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,315
Okay.

408
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,449
Okay, bye.

409
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,824
Jeez, you're taking
longer to proofread it

410
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,493
than we did to write it.

411
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,063
It's missing something.

412
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,931
It's...

413
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,366
What's that quote

414
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,401
Ms. Langran keeps in
the counseling office?

415
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,871
The one, uh, by Abraham Lincoln?

416
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,907
Yeah, something about let
no feeling of discouragement

417
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,943
set on you or something on you.

418
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,612
I don't know. I'll look it up.

419
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,815
I feel like if you put
something in the last sentence

420
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,618
that says that you respect
their decision either way,

421
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,819
that they'll like that.

422
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,554
Okay, like what?

423
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,489
Like...

424
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,490
hang on.

425
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,925
Um...

426
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,768
Mom.

427
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,969
What? "Precede"?

428
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,104
Don't you mean "proceed"?

429
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,039
No. How you wish to precede.

430
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,574
Is that not right?

431
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,042
No.

432
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,111
Are you sure?

433
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,547
Why don't you look that up, too, Emily.

434
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,415
Oh, I don't need to look it up.

435
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,717
It's pretty obviously welcome
to Wrongville, population you.

436
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,720
Hmm. Really?

437
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,455
Okay, okay, here it is.

438
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,025
"Let no feeling of
discouragement prey upon you,

439
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,793
and you are sure to succeed."

440
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,631
"...sure to succeed."

441
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,670
Okay. That's good, right?

442
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,938
This will do it?

443
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,673
This will change their minds?

444
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,974
What do you think, Mom?

445
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,143
I think it's a great letter of appeal,

446
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,945
and I think it's getting late.

447
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,415
Okay.

448
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,517
We have to stay together.

449
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,661
What?

450
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,108
So, what? I'm a loser?

451
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,542
I didn't post that.

452
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,611
Yeah, right. Nice quote.

453
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,612
Em, I swear.

454
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,880
Screw you, Cat.

455
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,962
What's up, guys? It's Emily.

456
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,499
Leave your name and a message,
and I'll call you back.

457
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,669
Emily, I would never even think
something like that about you.

458
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,705
I don't know what's
going on. Call me back.

459
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,051
The BuddyMe site administrators

460
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,053
just told me to change my password,

461
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,854
but they can't guarantee
it won't happen again.

462
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,657
Well, you kids put all your
business up on that site,

463
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,858
you're just asking for trouble.

464
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,894
I feel violated.

465
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,262
Ah, it's just a website, honey.

466
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,763
There's more important things in life.

467
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,931
Yeah, but, Mom, somebody actually got

468
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,633
onto my hard drive
and pulled that quote.

469
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,102
Emily actually believed I
would say something like that.

470
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,304
Well, pride can get the best of us.

471
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,772
What do you mean?

472
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,942
Madam President, need I remind you

473
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,911
that, for the last two years in a row,

474
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,814
you have beat out your
best friend for office?

475
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,049
On top of her rejection from Brown?

476
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,118
I mean, she must be...

477
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,888
You know, people do crazy
things when they're jealous.

478
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,957
She's not jealous. She's my friend.

479
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,895
Who had complete access to your
computer and your BuddyMe account.

480
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,297
She loves me.

481
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,266
Didn't stop her from
accusing you, now, did it?

482
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,635
Mom! Okay, okay.

483
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,970
Forget I mentioned it.

484
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,638
I'm gonna take your computer in today

485
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,307
and get one of those
fire thingies installed.

486
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,942
Firewall?

487
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,311
Fire... whatever.

488
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:03,214
Let's precede with our firewall plans.

489
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,083
Aren't you a little bit late for school?

490
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,920
Goodbye.

491
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,157
The BuddyMe site administrators

492
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,059
told me to change my password.

493
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,661
I just hope it doesn't happen again.

494
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,197
I'm sorry I freaked out.
It's just my stupid temper.

495
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,666
I know you'd never really
write anything like that.

496
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,202
I don't think you're a
loser. I think you're awesome.

497
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,006
I know.

498
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,841
Okay, I'll... I'll see you soon.

499
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,843
Okay, bye.

500
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,851
What's going on?

501
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,220
I don't know. I'm so over high school.

502
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,855
Hey, Cat. Nice work.

503
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,857
Definitely put that site to use.

504
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,226
Ha! For sure. So much better
to be an informed consumer.

505
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,429
What were those idiots talking about?

506
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,197
I have no idea.

507
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,333
Hey, Jessica. Hey, liar.

508
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,836
What? You think just
because you're going to Brown

509
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,971
and you're class president,
you can do whatever you want?

510
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,706
You want to tell me what
you're talking about?

511
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,209
You always did have such
a superiority complex.

512
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,179
Thought you were smart enough
to keep it to yourself, though.

513
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,880
Calm down, drama queen.

514
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,215
I don't know why you're defending her.

515
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,216
You're on the list.

516
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,551
What list?

517
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,355
Yeah, apparently you scored
with some security guard

518
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,890
at the mall where you work?

519
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:20,991
What the hell?

520
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,860
I don't even work at the mall.

521
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,161
Yeah! Way to go, Cat!

522
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,263
You suck, Cat. I'm taking my vote back.

523
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,066
Did you think this would make
you popular, you stuck-up bitch?

524
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,868
I had nothing to do with this!

525
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,309
Loser!

526
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,078
This is crazy.

527
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,379
Well, it's not me.

528
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,315
Well, these are all the
pictures that we took.

529
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,483
Well, I didn't create the page!

530
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,017
It must be the hacker,

531
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,886
the same one that posted
on my BuddyMe page.

532
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,454
Where did they get all these pictures?

533
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,022
They were on the yearbook camera.

534
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,757
I don't know.

535
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,759
Oh, no.

536
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,794
What?

537
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,462
They put Joan on here.

538
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,966
We should talk to Mrs. Langran.

539
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,804
Hey.

540
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,340
I would never do something like this.

541
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,941
Someone is setting me up.

542
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,978
I know you would never
do anything to hurt Joan.

543
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,883
Besides, most of those girls on
that website really are sluts.

544
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,920
That's what I heard.

545
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,922
That's a weird thing to say.

546
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,291
Girls, I need to see
you in my office now.

547
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,959
Ms. Langran, we have to talk.

548
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,829
And you, don't you have
a class you should be in?

549
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,898
Thank you. Come on.

550
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,800
Mrs. Langran...

551
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,569
Have a seat, girls.

552
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:43,140
Do you want to tell me
what I am looking at?

553
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,509
Somebody hacked into my
computer and posted this thing.

554
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,977
It's not me, I promise.

555
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,812
Correct me if I'm wrong,

556
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,382
but both of you girls
took these pictures.

557
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,883
Well, yeah, we did, but...

558
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,518
With the school's camera,

559
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,488
and then you hacked into
the admin's email database

560
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,957
and sent this to every
student in school?

561
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,158
No. We took those pictures,

562
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,826
but we didn't do the other stuff.

563
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,995
Who took the camera home?

564
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,997
I did.

565
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,000
Did you loan it to anyone?

566
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,135
No.

567
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,836
Okay, where's the camera now?

568
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,138
In my locker.

569
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,473
I'm gonna need the
camera back immediately.

570
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,474
Of course.

571
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,012
And both of you are off yearbook.

572
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,347
What?

573
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,516
That's B.S. I didn't even do anything.

574
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:27,418
Okay, Emily... I didn't
have anything to do with it!

575
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,986
I didn't even have the camera. Cat did.

576
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,256
Did Emily have access
to the camera last night?

577
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,427
No. I had it the whole time.

578
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,162
Okay, then. This is your responsibility.

579
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,631
I mean, this is very serious.

580
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,000
The school could be
held liable for this.

581
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,635
I didn't do this.

582
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,370
I would never do this.

583
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,572
Mrs. Langran, please.

584
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,575
Well, Emily, you are
off the hook for now.

585
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:55,446
And, Cat, we'll look into this,

586
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,448
but it's not just gonna go away.

587
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,620
All right, now back
to class, both of you.

588
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,063
Wow, Em. Way to have my back!

589
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,898
What? What do you want me to say?

590
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,033
Everything she said was true.

591
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,234
Um, how 'bout, "Cat would never

592
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,069
do something like that
in a million years.

593
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,237
Somebody else posted the site."

594
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,039
I defended you. No, you didn't!

595
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,408
You made sure you weren't
kicked off yearbook.

596
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,909
Look, you took those pictures,

597
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,978
and you had the camera the whole time,

598
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,648
so I don't know what happened, but
I'm not getting in trouble for it.

599
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,116
Cool!

600
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,418
I'm glad we've got the facts straight.

601
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,426
All right, here we go.

602
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,528
Best medicine in the world.

603
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,666
Heh. I don't think ice cream
is gonna fix this problem, Mom.

604
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,136
Honey, you remember that's the
same thing you used to say to me

605
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,538
when you were in third
grade and Billy Peterson

606
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,107
used to call you Cat,
Cat, the fatty fat.

607
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,111
Well, then you fed
the fat girl ice cream.

608
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:04,148
You were never fat.

609
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,949
Plus, it worked, didn't it?

610
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,451
You got over it,

611
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,719
and now Billy Peterson is fat

612
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,721
and works at that awful taco stand.

613
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,156
Thank you, ice cream.

614
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:13,290
He does.

615
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,367
Baby, I hate to see you so stressed out.

616
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,669
I'll get through it.

617
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,440
Good, because next we're gonna move on

618
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:32,576
to my second prescription
for a tough day, shopping.

619
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,011
It's very serious.

620
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:37,448
Oh, that sounds like serious business.

621
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:44,421
It's actually really impressive
how many times you're on that site.

622
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,024
You know what? You better be careful.

623
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,727
Wrap it up, so you don't
spread your disease.

624
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,428
You're on it more than me.

625
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,530
Oh, she burned you, Haylee!

626
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,499
What is wrong with you?

627
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,568
You're the one who outed the slut.

628
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,536
I didn't post that site.

629
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,338
Yeah, right.

630
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,407
Heard you got kicked
out of yearbook class.

631
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,511
Here. Have a couple.

632
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,347
You'll probably need
'em to keep your GPA up.

633
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,182
That's not all she's keeping up.

634
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,018
Are you all right?

635
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,653
I never even kissed a boy.

636
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,455
I know.

637
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,023
Here you go.

638
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,392
Welcome to the wonderful
world of politics.

639
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,532
What?

640
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,457
All right, so I'll put
you down on the list

641
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,559
that you're good with everything
in class and everything?

642
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,060
All right, perfect.

643
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,832
Hey, Casey, can I talk
to you for a second?

644
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,067
I'm kind of busy right now.

645
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,069
Please, Case? It's kind of important.

646
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,704
It'll just take a second.

647
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:08,806
I'll talk to you later.

648
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,775
What?

649
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,143
What is this?

650
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,145
Your website pissed off a lot of people.

651
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,080
You know me.

652
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,183
I would never do
anything to hurt anybody.

653
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,286
Is there anything you could say

654
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,354
that could change their minds?

655
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,422
This is crazy.

656
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,626
You don't believe me.

657
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:33,430
Cat, I'd like to believe
you. I really would.

658
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,098
Then I wouldn't feel like such a fool.

659
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,433
What is that supposed to mean?

660
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,135
How is it that my name

661
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,837
wound up on your little Internet list?

662
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,738
I don't know. I told
you, it's not my website.

663
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,540
Followed by the quote,

664
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:47,110
"Would do anything to make
out with Jason Myerson?"

665
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,879
I don't know.

666
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,716
You were the only one
I told that I was gay.

667
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,187
You were the only one,
the only person I trusted.

668
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,289
I even knew exactly when I told you,

669
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,158
two months ago in your bedroom,

670
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,860
helping you with your calc homework.

671
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,329
It was important for me to
be able to trust somebody,

672
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,130
all right, to get it off my chest.

673
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,532
Nobody else knew.

674
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,135
Casey, you can trust me.
I didn't tell anybody.

675
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,303
Really?

676
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,205
I was called horrible names

677
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,140
in the hallway this morning.

678
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,675
People laughed at me.

679
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,979
Jason is threatening to beat my ass.

680
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,782
If you didn't make this list,

681
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,718
then you told someone who did.

682
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,220
Maybe somebody guessed

683
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,822
just by the way you look at Jason.

684
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:34,324
Maybe you're not as on the
D.L. as you thought you were.

685
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,193
I don't know what's more offensive,

686
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,595
the idea that you may
have betrayed my trust

687
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,597
or the sentence that just
came out of your mouth.

688
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,598
Either way, we're done.

689
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,500
Oh, Casey, you have... No.

690
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,935
Hey, please!

691
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,436
No! I...

692
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,675
I don't know what's more offensive,

693
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,810
the idea that you may
have betrayed my trust

694
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,812
or the sentence that just
came out of your mouth.

695
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,247
Either way, we're done.

696
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,453
Heard you got kicked
out of yearbook class.

697
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,690
I don't know what happened, but
I'm not getting in trouble for it.

698
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,931
All in favor of impeaching
President Cat Hardy,

699
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,667
raise your hands and say, "Yea."

700
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,268
Yea. Yea.

701
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,205
It's unanimous.

702
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:26,543
All in favor of making Emily Hargrove
Student Body Council President,

703
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,745
raise your hands and say, "Yea."

704
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,747
Yea! Yea!

705
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,920
It's unanimous.

706
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,474
Cat?

707
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,920
What are you doing home from school?

708
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,922
Are you sick?

709
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:14,424
I'm not sick. I just...

710
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,893
I just...

711
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,595
I can't be there right now.

712
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,797
Everyone hates me!

713
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,934
Oh, Kitty Cat, I don't.

714
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,635
This isn't about you!

715
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,939
Mom, I'm sorry. I just...

716
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,709
I got kicked off Student Council.

717
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,945
What?

718
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,580
They can't do that!

719
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,581
Well, apparently they can,

720
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,349
because they already did it,

721
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,952
and they announced the runner-up
is gonna take over my office.

722
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,687
Emily?

723
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,590
Yeah.

724
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,726
Well, things are going pretty
well for her these days.

725
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,361
Look.

726
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,367
Yale?

727
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,670
After you guys spent all
that time petitioning Brown?

728
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,641
I didn't even know she applied to Yale.

729
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,577
Well, you two haven't had
secrets from each other before.

730
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,712
I know.

731
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,747
Oh, baby.

732
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,082
Oh, come he...

733
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,317
Oh, my sweetheart.

734
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,621
At least you still have Brown, okay?

735
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,991
What's the point if Emily's not going?

736
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:23,493
Honey, you know, in life,

737
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,897
things rarely go
according to your plans.

738
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,732
I'm sorry. It's really

739
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,668
all about being flexible, you know.

740
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,905
So maybe you put off
Brown and you stay here

741
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,341
for your first two years and
go to a community college,

742
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,477
and then you can live at home.

743
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,478
You're right.

744
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,013
I should go to Brown/RISD

745
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,347
and get my degrees

746
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,782
and start my own business,

747
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,617
because I don't need a partner.

748
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,420
Uh, honey, you're not really hearing me.

749
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,855
No, you're right.

750
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,625
Be flexible.

751
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,994
Yes, be flexible.

752
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,763
Cat, where are you going? To Emily's.

753
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,499
I'm gonna tell her I'm
gonna start my own business

754
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,633
and I don't need her.

755
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,003
Just... Honey, don't burn any bridges.

756
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,005
I'm not. I'm crossing them.

757
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,441
Cat!

758
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,627
Hi.

759
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,464
Emily, it's Cat!

760
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,106
Just a second, Cat.

761
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,575
Tell her to go away.
She's standing there.

762
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,611
I don't care! I don't
want to talk to her!

763
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,912
Just go. Just go.

764
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,953
Hi.

765
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,155
So I guess congratulations

766
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,023
are in order for Student Council.

767
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,425
You can't blame me for that.

768
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,561
Who can I blame for
lying to me about Yale?

769
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,763
I didn't lie! I just didn't tell you

770
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,698
every single little detail of my life.

771
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,470
We had a plan, Em.

772
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,804
We were a team.

773
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,779
You think I made that website,
don't you, and that BuddyMe post?

774
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,648
You don't think there's a hacker at all.

775
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,616
You know what?

776
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,918
I'm kind of over this,

777
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
so you just go to
Brown, I'll go to Yale,

778
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:32,088
and maybe I'll see you at
the reunion in 10 years.

779
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,792
Or not.

780
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,093
I have to go.

781
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,805
It's like, I'm gonna drive straight,

782
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,473
and then I'm gonna turn left.

783
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,878
Hey, I can help you
keep score if you want.

784
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,546
Oh, what's the matter, Cat?

785
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,547
Got your tongue?

786
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,050
Oh!

787
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,125
Hey, Cat.

788
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,827
You okay?

789
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,495
Oh.

790
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,496
Hi.

791
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:14,631
Roger.

792
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,236
What's going on? You look upset.

793
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,542
You got troubles, huh?

794
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,043
Yeah.

795
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,012
It's 'cause of that scoreboard website?

796
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,581
Look, I know it has my name on it,

797
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,583
but I didn't put up that site.

798
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,186
Somebody went through a lot
of trouble to screw up my life.

799
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,554
And it's not just the website.

800
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:38,922
It's the BuddyMe page.

801
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,258
Someone posted things
that I didn't post.

802
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,594
Worst part of it all is
nobody seems to believe me.

803
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,731
I believe you.

804
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:51,601
Look, nothing is safe on the Internet.

805
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,170
No matter how secure you think you are,

806
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:58,041
there are people out there
that can hack into anything.

807
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,176
Look, I know this guy.

808
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,679
He might be able to help you.

809
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:05,115
He's a full-on computer genius.

810
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,751
He... I had a problem. He
helped me out a few months ago.

811
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,753
What kind of problem?

812
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:12,689
Well, someone was catfishing this girl

813
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,591
using a picture of me from track.

814
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,127
So do you think he would help me?

815
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,262
Well, of course he would, yeah.

816
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,264
I mean, he's a good friend of mine.

817
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,333
That would be so great.

818
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,136
Why don't you meet me over at his place

819
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:29,139
after school, say, 5:00?

820
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,907
Sure.

821
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,042
Okay.

822
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,977
Here. I'll give you his address.

823
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,980
Thank you so much for your help.

824
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,581
I so appreciate it.

825
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,983
Yeah, it's okay.

826
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,919
I gotta run, but I'll...
I'll see you later?

827
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:43,920
Yeah. Okay.

828
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,221
Bye. Bye.

829
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,047
Cat! You made it.

830
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,049
Hey. Come on in.

831
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,889
Cat, this is my good buddy, Cool D.

832
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,959
Wassup? Cool,

833
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,062
this is the girl I was
talking to you about, Cat?

834
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,230
Hi.

835
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,900
Go ahead. Sit down.

836
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,138
He not only fixed my catfishing problem.

837
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,307
We actually found the
guy who was doing it.

838
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,975
Really?

839
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,276
Hell, yeah.

840
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,011
Just gotta know what you're looking for.

841
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:48,151
Cold one?

842
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,719
So you think you can help?

843
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,889
Well, that is always
a possibility, right?

844
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,161
Hey, yo, why don't you
give us some privacy

845
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,863
so I can converse freely with my client?

846
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,068
Okay, sure.

847
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,881
So? Holler at me.

848
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:20,016
Somebody posted a website

849
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,718
using information from my computer.

850
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,686
Yeah.

851
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:24,921
You mean this one?

852
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,926
Yeah.

853
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,031
Do you think you can find
out who hacked into my stuff?

854
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,866
If you remember when it happened.

855
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,302
I can look into the logs on your router,

856
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,839
see if there's any traffic going
into your computer, you know.

857
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,374
Someone maybe copied your data.

858
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,410
That is, if they hacked in
using one of them Trojans online.

859
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:53,316
Has anybody had access to your
computer without you knowing?

860
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,885
No. I'm the only one.

861
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,354
All right. Did you bring it with you?

862
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,956
Yeah, it's right here.

863
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,359
That's what's up.

864
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,032
So, when can you start?

865
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:11,501
Well, there's still
the matter of my fee.

866
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,436
Right.

867
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,171
How much do you charge?

868
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,073
Something like this

869
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,075
is gonna run you the tune of, like,

870
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,212
10 Gs.

871
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,214
Wow, that's a lot of money.

872
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:27,016
I do quality work.

873
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,752
Uh, I'll see...

874
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,089
I'm just messing with you, girl.

875
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,758
Damn. What?

876
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,327
I don't expect you to come up

877
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,095
with that type of money. You crazy?

878
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,198
Oh, okay.

879
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,833
Yeah, for sure,

880
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,835
'cause it's not always about the monies.

881
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,136
You know what I'm saying?

882
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,939
I don't,

883
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,042
but I can figure out
some way to pay you later.

884
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,147
Nah, you can pay me right now.

885
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,850
Come on, Cat. You
know you like to party.

886
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:01,851
Okay! Get off me!

887
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,126
Ah, come on, Cat. You're not leaving

888
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,795
before the money shot, are you?

889
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,531
That's right! You better run, slut!

890
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,143
Hello. Hey, Mom.

891
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,444
Could you come pick me up?

892
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,513
I missed the bus, and it's getting late.

893
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,582
How'd it go? Is everything okay?

894
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,250
Yeah, everything's fine.

895
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,819
Okay, I'll be there soon.

896
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,187
Okay.

897
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,839
Cat, you are typically
a really good student,

898
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:00,410
but I have to say I'm very
concerned with what is going on here.

899
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,279
I've had four girls come to talk to me

900
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,415
about this scoreboard
site just this morning.

901
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:10,186
They say boys are writing
stories about them,

902
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:12,522
lying in the comments section.

903
00:43:12,524 --> 00:43:14,257
They were very upset.

904
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,993
I'm upset, too.

905
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,128
I didn't post it. I think it's gross.

906
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,532
It doesn't seem like
something you would do.

907
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,701
It's not me, I swear.

908
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,137
I didn't post it.

909
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:31,307
Somebody hacked into my accounts.

910
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,344
Well, can you think of
who would want to do that?

911
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:37,280
I don't know. Somebody jealous,

912
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,649
somebody trying to ruin my life.

913
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,352
Like who?

914
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,456
I don't know.

915
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,291
Maybe Haylee?

916
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,229
Cyberbullying isn't
covered under state laws.

917
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,532
People are working on it,
but it's hard to define.

918
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:59,535
However, when we find
out who's behind this,

919
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,337
they will be expelled.

920
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,239
You believe me?

921
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,109
I don't know what to believe,

922
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,411
but this is not the Cat I know.

923
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,512
So don't worry.

924
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,981
We will get to the bottom of this.

925
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,484
Thanks a lot, Cat.

926
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,485
Bitch.

927
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,919
What was that?

928
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,255
Okay, you and you, in my office now.

929
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,591
I want to talk about these
stories that you wrote.

930
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:23,526
Now!

931
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,604
Who did that?

932
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,339
Who did that, Joan?

933
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,441
What are you all laughing at, huh?

934
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,575
You think it's funny?

935
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:42,145
Huh?! You think this is funny!

936
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,546
Get out of here!

937
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,014
Oh, Joan.

938
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,216
Hey, did you guys see
anything? Who did this?

939
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,586
It's not true.

940
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:51,688
I know it's not.

941
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,956
You said, but it's not true.

942
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,959
I would never say
anything bad about you.

943
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,561
I'm not adopted.

944
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,430
This is ridiculous! What?

945
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,298
Joan, get away from her.

946
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,966
Come on. Let's go home.

947
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,635
Daniel. Daniel.

948
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,207
Just go home.

949
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:14,977
What's going on?

950
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,279
Get out of the way.

951
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:19,015
Are you angry at me?

952
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,383
I defended you.

953
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,384
I just...

954
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,721
I just thought there was no way

955
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,256
you would ever post those things.

956
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,625
I bet you were just laughing
at what an idiot I was, huh?

957
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,494
I don't know what you're talking about!

958
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,130
If you want to hurt me, then whatever.

959
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:38,000
But to tell Joan after I trusted you?

960
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,269
I didn't tell Joan anything.

961
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,471
We're done!

962
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,407
Daniel!

963
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,759
No.

964
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,095
No!

965
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,096
No.

966
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,554
Aw, poor baby.

967
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:34,123
You should have kept my
name out of your mouth.

968
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,692
You told Mrs. Langran
that I wrote that list?

969
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,061
Now she wants to get
me kicked out of school.

970
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,130
Why are you doing this to me?

971
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,699
I didn't do anything to you, yet.

972
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:46,669
When my mom finds out,
she's gonna beat my ass,

973
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,137
so I'm gonna beat your ass first!

974
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,605
Get her!

975
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:51,407
Yeah! Come on!

976
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,676
That'll teach her.

977
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,545
Yeah!

978
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,281
Stop it, girls! What are you doing?

979
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,683
Get off her! Now!

980
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:02,752
I'm talking to all of you!

981
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:04,787
Right now!

982
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,364
Your students have
lost your minds today.

983
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,732
It was Haylee.

984
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,234
Yes, I know.

985
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,535
She's going to be
dealt with for fighting.

986
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,370
She did the other stuff, too,

987
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,738
the list and the hacking.

988
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,275
Cat, I looked into it.

989
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,411
I don't think she did it.

990
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:30,446
Nobody believes me.

991
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,582
I want to believe you, I really do,

992
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:35,718
but your story, it's just not lining up.

993
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,524
Cat.

994
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,672
Emily?

995
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,407
Why are you helping me?

996
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,676
Well, jeez, Cat, I'm mad at you,

997
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,378
but I don't hate you.

998
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,648
Thanks.

999
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,151
Okay.

1000
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,820
It's gonna be okay.

1001
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,896
Oh, my God. Baby.

1002
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,732
Oh, baby. Hi, Mom.

1003
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,467
Oh, my God. Oh, my baby.

1004
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,936
I came as soon as the
principal called me.

1005
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:28,938
Here, come in. Here. Just lay down here.

1006
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,773
Oh, careful, honey. Careful. Lie down.

1007
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,409
Maybe... Maybe I could come by later?

1008
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,213
If you feel like you have to,

1009
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,948
but maybe tomorrow would be better.

1010
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,349
I'm starting to think

1011
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,318
maybe she didn't do all those things.

1012
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,787
I'm her mother. I know.

1013
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,725
We'll get you to the doctor.

1014
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,375
Do you have trouble sleeping at night?

1015
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:07,710
Lately, yeah.

1016
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,379
Yeah, she has a history of anxiety.

1017
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,681
Oh. That's...

1018
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,950
No, that's not in her file.

1019
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,218
Well, it wasn't diagnosed,

1020
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,554
but she always had panic
attacks when she was a kid.

1021
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,756
Does anxiety run in your family?

1022
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,260
No.

1023
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,261
Depression or...

1024
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,495
No.

1025
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,297
Well, there was some trouble

1026
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:33,669
when I had a pregnancy,
um, a miscarriage.

1027
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,739
Um, but they said that
that was just hormonal.

1028
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:43,245
Okay, I'm gonna prescribe something
for you, Cat, for the pain,

1029
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,748
uh, just enough for the next few days.

1030
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:51,387
And I can prescribe
a mild antidepressant.

1031
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,424
Do you think that's necessary?

1032
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,761
Well, if anxiety is negatively
affecting her life, I...

1033
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,596
I don't have anxiety.

1034
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:02,331
Cat, please.

1035
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:07,336
Have you had heart palpitations
or trouble breathing?

1036
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,539
Do you feel like you've
had panic attacks?

1037
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,341
Uh...

1038
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,844
Yes.

1039
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:15,945
I'm asking you, Cat.

1040
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,452
Um...

1041
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,653
yes.

1042
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,958
Do you want to try the antidepressants?

1043
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,028
Okay.

1044
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,396
Okay.

1045
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,032
Okay.

1046
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,300
We'll get you started

1047
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:39,735
on a low dose of Alprazolam.

1048
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,303
Is it safe?

1049
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:43,305
It'll take her body a little while

1050
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:44,907
to get adjusted to the medication,

1051
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,642
but after that, she'll be fine.

1052
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:47,710
Okay. Okay.

1053
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,778
It'll be good.

1054
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,913
This is gonna help you, sweetie.

1055
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,516
Okay.

1056
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,766
Good morning.

1057
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,435
How are you feeling?

1058
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,971
Sore.

1059
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,109
Pain meds.

1060
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,883
Happy pill.

1061
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,454
Go on, baby.

1062
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,359
Good girl.

1063
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:39,795
They make my throat dry.

1064
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,730
I'll get you more juice.

1065
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,369
Em's coming over.

1066
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:49,405
I think she wants to make up.

1067
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,840
Do you trust her?

1068
00:51:50,842 --> 00:51:53,375
She was nice to me yesterday.

1069
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:55,111
Maybe she feels bad.

1070
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,615
Just be careful.

1071
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,721
Let me know if you need anything.

1072
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,164
All righty, I'm out of here, Dad!

1073
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,901
I got it!

1074
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,804
Hi.

1075
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,873
Hi.

1076
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,641
I'm Herb, Herbert.

1077
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,179
You are so beautiful.

1078
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,415
You're even more beautiful
than your picture.

1079
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,017
Excuse me?

1080
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,921
Are... Are you here to see my Dad?

1081
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,956
I thought you said we
were gonna be alone.

1082
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,424
Dad!

1083
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,460
That's no way to treat your Honey Daddy!

1084
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,995
Get the hell out of here! Dude!

1085
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,596
He knew my name.

1086
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,665
Hey! Hey, I want to talk to you!

1087
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,506
Honey Daddy.

1088
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,085
I'm calling the police.

1089
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,087
I wrote down his plate number.

1090
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,805
Oh, my God.

1091
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,176
Emily? They need to talk to you!

1092
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,011
Okay. Coming!

1093
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,055
Emily.

1094
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,156
"I'm young and dumb

1095
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:48,757
and ready to..." What?

1096
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,759
"I'll do anything you want for the price

1097
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:52,761
of a Coach bag, anything at all."

1098
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:55,297
That has my real name on
it, Cat, and my address!

1099
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,967
This is crazy.

1100
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,169
What's going on out here?

1101
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:02,838
You gonna tell her?

1102
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,073
Tell me what?

1103
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,908
Somebody posted...
Your daughter is sick.

1104
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,911
Thanks for setting me up
with Herbert the pervert, Cat.

1105
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,112
I really appreciate it.

1106
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:14,083
You still think I'm
doing this, don't you?

1107
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:16,518
That's a picture that you
took! That's on your bed!

1108
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,054
Yeah, but I've told you
and told you! It's a hacker!

1109
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:20,823
I-I've never heard of that.

1110
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,559
I've never heard of somebody
being able to take pictures

1111
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:26,562
off your phone unless you
sent them somewhere first.

1112
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,163
Who's hacking you, Bill Gates?

1113
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,798
You seem to know an awful lot about it.

1114
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,067
You're both insane.

1115
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,269
Okay, go home.

1116
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,938
You win, okay?

1117
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,274
You're better than me,
so just leave me alone,

1118
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:41,143
and keep me out of
your sick little games!

1119
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,611
Emily!

1120
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,047
Shh, shh, shh.

1121
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,715
It's okay, baby.

1122
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:48,284
Here. Just take a
breath. Here. Sit down.

1123
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,219
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

1124
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:53,022
Sit down. It's okay, baby.
You're not losing your mind.

1125
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,725
Cat, did you send that picture
of Emily to that website?

1126
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,093
No! Okay.

1127
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,896
If you tell me, I believe you.

1128
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,898
You're the only one.

1129
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,234
Mom, can't you call the police again?

1130
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:06,969
Shh. Oh, honey.

1131
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,072
I told you there's nothing
they can do about this.

1132
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,908
Here.

1133
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,109
You take another one of these.

1134
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,344
No!

1135
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:16,979
Yes. You're having an anxiety attack.

1136
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,181
Take one, baby. I'm
right here for you, okay?

1137
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:24,019
Shh. Shh.

1138
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,020
Breathe.

1139
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:26,755
What should I do?

1140
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,856
I don't know.

1141
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,025
Just concentrate on school, and...

1142
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:34,330
I don't know... finish
your AP English exam.

1143
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:37,232
You only have a few months to go.

1144
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:38,667
I mean, after graduation,

1145
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,769
these people won't matter.

1146
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:44,440
You'll never have to see any of
them ever again if you don't want to.

1147
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,943
What would I do without you?

1148
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,678
Oh, honey,

1149
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,816
let's never find out, okay?

1150
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,853
Ahem.

1151
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,144
How you holding up?

1152
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,980
Not great.

1153
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,316
Uh, how's... how's Joan?

1154
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:31,820
Mom's been keeping her
home until things calm down.

1155
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,089
Yeah, that makes sense. I just...

1156
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,992
You know, I don't get at
all this stuff with Cat.

1157
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,161
I mean, what do you think?

1158
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,662
I think she's twisted.

1159
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:43,665
First this nasty site
pops up mysteriously

1160
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,735
with a picture of me,
a picture that Cat took.

1161
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,205
Somebody sent it to the
admissions office at Yale.

1162
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,707
Are you serious?

1163
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,442
Em.

1164
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:56,812
Now they've revoked my acceptance.

1165
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,714
Em.

1166
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,416
I mean, It's not like there aren't

1167
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,751
plenty of sluts at
Yale anyway, you know?

1168
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,220
I'm really, really sorry.

1169
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,194
What?

1170
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:13,429
Nothing.

1171
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,401
Miss Hargroves.

1172
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,037
In my office, please.

1173
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,406
Great.

1174
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,309
Let me guess.

1175
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,844
Somebody sent you a link?

1176
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,946
Your father's on his way.

1177
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,921
She can't do that.

1178
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,256
Come on, come on, hand 'em over.

1179
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,193
There are no term papers good or bad,

1180
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:46,862
but thinking makes it so.

1181
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,731
Thank you.

1182
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:50,799
Thank you.

1183
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,136
No phones. Thank you.

1184
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,304
Thank you.

1185
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,505
Jess. Psst.

1186
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,807
What did I just say about the phones?

1187
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,776
Oh, my God.

1188
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,051
I'm gonna hit that.

1189
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:10,319
Oh, my God.

1190
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,355
I didn't know she was a slut.

1191
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,524
What could be so fascinating?

1192
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,459
Come on.

1193
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:18,927
All right, I'll take that.

1194
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,095
Hey! Hey, that's my phone!

1195
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,263
Come on.

1196
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:22,831
Hey, if Daniel's done with you,

1197
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,166
I don't mind sloppy seconds.

1198
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,401
I'm just saying.

1199
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,303
Hey, were... No,
seriously, were those silk?

1200
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,907
Hey, I was just...
Oh, I was just kidding.

1201
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:34,109
All right, all right!
Knock it off right now!

1202
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,844
Whoo, Cat!

1203
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,179
All right, all right, knock it...

1204
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,593
Oh, my God.

1205
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,986
You!

1206
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:19,521
You sent those pictures of me!

1207
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:22,324
That's right. Those were private!

1208
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:24,159
So was what I said to you about Joan.

1209
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,828
So was the stuff you sent
to Yale about Emily, Cat!

1210
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,964
What? You know what? I
don't even care anymore!

1211
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,566
You can't just mess
around with peoples' lives

1212
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,568
and expect to get away with it!

1213
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,370
I don't get it. So you
sent those pictures of me

1214
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,573
because of what you think
I did to your sister?

1215
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,575
Okay, but that other stuff?

1216
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:42,010
The scoreboard?

1217
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,278
Hacking into my phone?

1218
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,415
That stupid HoneyDaddy site? Why?

1219
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,483
What did I ever do to you?

1220
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:49,985
I sent the pictures, yeah,

1221
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,853
but... but don't you dare try

1222
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:54,489
and turn all that other
stuff you did around on me!

1223
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,558
Just admit it! You're the hacker!

1224
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,293
Oh. Oh, you'd like

1225
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:00,295
people to think that,
wouldn't you? Wouldn't you?

1226
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,464
You bitch!

1227
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,209
You know what? I am so sick of this!

1228
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,877
You know why you're so jealous?

1229
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:19,481
Because I earned being class
president. I earned Brown!

1230
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:21,883
I didn't have to beg for
those things like you.

1231
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,018
Face it, Emily.

1232
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,219
You're good, but I'm better,

1233
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:25,887
and you can't deal with it.

1234
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,457
I want to smash your face in.

1235
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,958
Oh, so do it.

1236
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,966
What in the world?

1237
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,601
Hey!

1238
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,069
Don't!

1239
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,305
Cat! Emily!

1240
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,406
Stop this right now!

1241
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,507
Cat! Emily! Emily!

1242
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,508
Stop this right now!

1243
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,909
Watch me! Emily, stop.

1244
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,311
Right now.

1245
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,348
Don't touch my daughter! Back off!

1246
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,117
Keep your hands off her! That's assault!

1247
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,918
She assaulted my daughter first!

1248
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,086
Hey, Cat started it.

1249
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:00,222
You be quiet! Whoa! Whoa!

1250
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:02,391
Put that phone away, or
I'll take it from you!

1251
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:04,259
Get back! Stay away from me!

1252
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:05,360
I'm calling the police.

1253
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:06,561
Good.

1254
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:07,929
No.

1255
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:10,265
No, it was me. I...

1256
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,633
I started it.

1257
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,406
What are you gonna do about it?

1258
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:19,007
I'm already suspended,

1259
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,610
so you guys don't have
to deal with me anymore.

1260
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,715
That's the second fight Cat's had

1261
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:27,949
on school property this week.

1262
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,284
So why isn't she suspended?

1263
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,019
Mr. Hargroves, I'll handle this.

1264
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,554
'Cause you're doing a real
bang-up job up till now!

1265
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:33,722
Give me that phone.

1266
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:35,424
Hey, no way. No way! This is for Emily

1267
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:38,160
if she decides to change her mind.

1268
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,728
Take that phone from him.

1269
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,396
You gonna let him post that online

1270
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,433
just like he did all
those dirty pictures of...

1271
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:45,734
Daniel, go home.

1272
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:48,403
Take his phone! Mrs. Hardy, please!

1273
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,105
My daughter is being bullied,

1274
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,741
and I don't see the school
doing a thing about it.

1275
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,710
Okay, we'll schedule a
meeting as soon as possible.

1276
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,113
You're damn right we will.

1277
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,114
Come on, baby.

1278
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,997
Can't find my phone.

1279
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,332
It's not in your bag?

1280
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,568
No. I think I dropped
it during the fight.

1281
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,704
We'll call the office and
see if anyone turned it in.

1282
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:24,506
I think someone picked it up.

1283
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:27,609
That's all I need, more
people looking at my stuff.

1284
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,682
Honey, where did those...

1285
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:36,351
underwear pictures come from?

1286
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,324
I took them.

1287
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,326
Why?

1288
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:46,695
I thought Danny was special.

1289
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:48,296
I thought he'd keep them to himself.

1290
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:52,167
What you kids just don't understand

1291
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,370
is that these things
that you put up online

1292
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:59,374
and these pictures that you
post or send or whatever you do

1293
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,743
is they... they stick around forever.

1294
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:05,347
They have a life. They...
Even if you erase them,

1295
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:08,383
people, creepy people, can
pass them on and on, and they...

1296
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,585
Okay, I don't need a lecture right now!

1297
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,123
I learned my lesson. I'll
never trust anyone again!

1298
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,758
Oh.

1299
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:23,665
Mom.

1300
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:24,733
Yeah?

1301
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,504
I didn't know you had a miscarriage.

1302
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,773
That was a long time ago, baby.

1303
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,777
Do you want to talk about it?

1304
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,484
Maybe I won't go to Brown.

1305
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,822
Maybe I'll just stay
at home like you said,

1306
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,423
go to community college.

1307
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,828
It's up to you, sweetheart.

1308
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,868
Just for a while.

1309
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,442
She can't sleep.

1310
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:08,877
She's been on antidepressants.

1311
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:11,613
I mean, this has just gone on too far.

1312
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,849
Daniel has admitted to
sending those photos,

1313
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,383
and we have suspended him accordingly.

1314
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:17,118
Well, that's not good enough!

1315
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,120
Well, we have no proof that
he's done anything else.

1316
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:23,391
My daughter is 17 years
old! She is a minor!

1317
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:26,895
What he's done is basically
distributed child pornography.

1318
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:30,465
I want him expelled permanently,

1319
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,667
and I'm gonna call the authorities.

1320
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,135
No, Mom, don't.

1321
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,137
I just want to forget
this ever happened.

1322
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:38,807
Honey, we cannot let him
victimize you like that.

1323
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:40,308
That fight,

1324
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,544
he's probably posting
that online right now.

1325
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,784
Yes, go ahead, and send both
of them in, please. Thank you.

1326
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,456
We have another problem.

1327
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,991
What now?

1328
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,831
Mr. Perryman, Ms. Langran,
you know Cat's mother...

1329
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,599
Hello, Cat. Mrs. Hardy.

1330
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,735
Hey. Mr. Perryman, go ahead.

1331
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,503
Mrs. Langran has a program

1332
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:10,805
that we run all of the
students' papers through.

1333
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:14,576
It checks the written
story to Internet archives.

1334
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,846
It's the first thing I do when
a student turns in an assignment.

1335
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:19,915
I hate to accuse you, Cat.

1336
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,850
You're an excellent student.

1337
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,518
Your AP final,

1338
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,655
the program found a
match for plagiarism.

1339
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:28,957
What? This isn't my paper.

1340
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,892
That's what you turned in.

1341
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:33,495
I didn't write this.

1342
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:36,531
That is the paper you
handed to me yesterday.

1343
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,608
I give up.

1344
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,811
This is serious, young lady.

1345
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:51,913
We take charges of
plagiarism very seriously.

1346
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:54,349
This, you take seriously?

1347
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:58,586
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to fail you, Cat,

1348
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,623
and you won't be able to
continue in the AP classes.

1349
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,491
But the school year's almost over.

1350
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,460
Those classes will be
removed from your record,

1351
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,731
and you probably will
not graduate this spring.

1352
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,299
This is insanity.

1353
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,734
She's going to Brown!

1354
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:15,503
Cat, this is so out
of character for you.

1355
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,305
You don't seem okay.

1356
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,873
She's not okay. She is being punished

1357
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,642
for absolutely no reason. Come on, Cat.

1358
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,911
Is anything going on
that I should know about?

1359
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:25,380
Maybe you should look
into how those essays

1360
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,716
ended up on your computer
program, Ms. Langran.

1361
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:28,950
What are you insinuating?

1362
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,953
I don't know what your problem is,

1363
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,788
but you've been doing everything you can

1364
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,623
to make sure that my daughter fails.

1365
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,526
Well, I am sorry you feel that way.

1366
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:40,662
We are suing you. We
are suing this district.

1367
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,731
We are suing those bullies!

1368
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:45,500
Mrs. Hardy, considering
everything that's happened,

1369
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,769
you might decide that homeschooling

1370
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:49,771
is more appropriate for your daughter.

1371
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:53,341
It'd be a hell of a lot
better than this zoo.

1372
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:56,478
And you can wipe that phony
look of concern off your face!

1373
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:05,487
It's okay, sweetie. I'm gonna
fight this thing all the way.

1374
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,055
Don't you get it?

1375
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,624
I don't want to fight anymore.

1376
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:12,560
They actually suggested you homeschool.

1377
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,095
Sounds good to me.

1378
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,411
You know what? I am so sick of this!

1379
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,912
I earned being president!

1380
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,947
I didn't have to beg for
those things like you did.

1381
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,450
You're good, but I'm better,
and you can't deal with it.

1382
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:37,118
I want to smash your face in.

1383
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,820
So do it.

1384
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:39,788
Oh!

1385
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,525
Oh, you okay, baby?

1386
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:45,827
You have a nightmare?

1387
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:48,096
Bad dream?

1388
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,999
Oh, I just keep thinking
about that fight with Emily

1389
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,001
and how Daniel has it on his phone

1390
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:54,702
and how I can't find my phone

1391
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,738
and how I'm just gonna
go online any minute

1392
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,808
and see this title like "Real Cat
Fight," and I'm just so sick of it.

1393
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,976
Calm down, baby. Calm down.

1394
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:03,711
Here. Take one of these.

1395
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,046
It's not time yet.

1396
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:07,015
It'll relax you.

1397
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:08,416
Come on.

1398
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,951
It'll make you feel better.

1399
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,661
I have to talk to Daniel.

1400
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,464
What? No.

1401
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:23,865
No good can come from that.

1402
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,834
Just stay away from those people.

1403
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:32,674
Come on. Let's get you back to sleep.

1404
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,080
Why did you send everyone
those pictures of Cat?

1405
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,188
What do you care?

1406
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,457
I thought you hated her guts.

1407
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,626
I do.

1408
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,461
We've been friends a
really long time, okay?

1409
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,097
It's hard to just stop caring about her.

1410
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,803
Do you still have that
video of us fighting?

1411
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,471
Maybe.

1412
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:04,739
Well, can you erase it?

1413
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,107
Because the last thing I need

1414
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,176
is for more embarrassing
crap to get out there.

1415
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:11,179
Maybe I'll erase it. Maybe I won't.

1416
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,614
I don't know yet.

1417
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,485
What?

1418
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,187
Are you the one doing all this stuff?

1419
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,757
W-Wait. Are you serious?

1420
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,128
You know what? I-I've figured you out.

1421
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,197
You're totally obsessed with Cat.

1422
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,665
That's what it is.

1423
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,534
That's what it's got to be.

1424
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:33,635
What? Yeah.

1425
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,537
Taking all the same classes.

1426
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,539
Making the same plans.

1427
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,841
You guys even go to
the restroom together.

1428
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,176
Yeah. We're girls.

1429
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,911
That's, like, what we do!

1430
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:45,146
I'm not the one who took her vulnerable,

1431
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,848
trusting first attempts at sexuality

1432
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,217
and just tossed them all out
there for the world to see!

1433
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:51,286
You know, whatever.

1434
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,720
Are we done here?

1435
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,856
You and I, yeah, we're done.

1436
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,725
You know what? I think
we're all pretty much done.

1437
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,726
Yeah, yeah.

1438
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:00,929
Well, peace, out!

1439
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,002
I know. Shut up.

1440
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,107
This sucks.

1441
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,002
Dad!

1442
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:43,705
Dad, I got into Brown! They just...

1443
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,573
They said they were moved by my appeal,

1444
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,041
and they're... they're letting me in!

1445
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:48,409
Dad!

1446
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,326
What time is it?

1447
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,797
You scared the life out of me.

1448
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,667
I wish you wouldn't
sneak up on me like that.

1449
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,672
How long was I asleep?

1450
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:18,940
A while.

1451
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,375
You probably needed it.

1452
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,378
Your body needs to recover
from all that stress.

1453
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,948
Ehh. I don't like this medication.

1454
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,316
It makes me sleepy.

1455
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:30,785
Well, the doctor said

1456
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:34,289
that you'd need time
to adjust to it, so...

1457
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:41,262
Is the sun coming up or going down?

1458
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,797
It's evening, honey.

1459
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,332
It's almost time for dinner.

1460
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,367
Are you hungry?

1461
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:47,769
No.

1462
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,042
Oh, Kitty Cat, why don't
you look at that after?

1463
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:55,677
It's from Brown.

1464
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,212
Well, maybe after you've
woken up or eaten something.

1465
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,848
Let's see.

1466
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:06,354
"We are sorry to inform you, d...

1467
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:09,691
"due to the extenuating circumstances,

1468
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:13,828
we have revoked your
acceptance to Brown/RISD."

1469
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,364
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

1470
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:19,233
I know how hard you've worked.

1471
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:22,737
You could still apply
to community college

1472
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:25,006
and live here

1473
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,674
and be near your friends.

1474
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:29,310
I don't have any friends.

1475
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,947
I could still look after you.

1476
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,150
What are we having for dinner?

1477
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:39,120
Pot roast and spinach salad.

1478
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:42,190
I want mac and cheese.

1479
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:44,025
Oh, baby, I think we're out,

1480
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,160
but I can make it from scratch.

1481
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,963
Mm, I like it from a box.

1482
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:50,198
Okay.

1483
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,266
I'll run to the store and get some.

1484
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:55,403
No, you don't have to do that.

1485
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:59,040
Baby, I love looking after you.

1486
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,743
Anything else you want me to get?

1487
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:04,879
Did you call the school
about my cellphone?

1488
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,748
Nobody's turned it in.

1489
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,716
Oh. I want to go look for it.

1490
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,785
We did that already, honey.
I talked to the office,

1491
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,220
and they said nobody's turned it in.

1492
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,921
Well, I want to go look again,

1493
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,256
because somebody took it, so...

1494
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:16,758
Don't get so upset.

1495
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,893
It's probably just in
the house somewhere.

1496
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,495
I'm sure I can find it.

1497
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,067
Maybe I'll go back to sleep.

1498
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,735
I think that's a good idea.

1499
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,504
I'm gonna run to the store,

1500
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:32,073
and I'll wake you up
when it's time for dinner.

1501
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,342
There's nothing like
a warm mac and cheese

1502
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:37,512
to make all your troubles fly away, hmm?

1503
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,295
HoneyDaddies. This is
Miles. How can I help you?

1504
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,496
Finally. I'm calling again

1505
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:57,165
about an account on your pervy website.

1506
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,299
I'm trying to delete it.

1507
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,534
Please hold. N-No!

1508
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,255
No, Daniel.

1509
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,424
"Due to the extenuating circumstances,

1510
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:24,492
we've revoked your acceptance."

1511
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:25,960
It's okay, sweetie.

1512
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,829
I'm gonna fight this thing all the way.

1513
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:30,064
No, it was me. I... I started it.

1514
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,033
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

1515
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,203
No, Daniel.

1516
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,004
I understand you want
to remove an account?

1517
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,506
Yeah. I-I'll call you back.

1518
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,078
Pick up. Pick...

1519
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,919
Thanks for calling, and
have a fantastic day.

1520
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,188
Cat, it's me. Please
call me back right away.

1521
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,624
I... I think I know who the hacker is.

1522
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,933
Hi. You've reached Cat's voice mail.

1523
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:14,068
When you hear the beep,
please leave a message.

1524
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,070
Thanks for calling, and
have a fantastic day.

1525
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,639
No wonder everyone hates me. I hate me.

1526
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,656
Whoa! What the...

1527
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:46,560
Hey! Hey!

1528
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:48,596
You stay away from my daughter!

1529
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:51,332
You stay away from her!

1530
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,282
Oh, my God.

1531
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,281
No!

1532
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,318
Mom.

1533
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,548
Oh, my God!

1534
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,550
I wish you wouldn't...

1535
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:52,653
Honey, I thought you were
gonna go lay back down.

1536
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,292
What?

1537
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,527
What?

1538
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,665
I saw your computer.

1539
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:10,871
I saw my BuddyMe page.

1540
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,208
I saw everything...

1541
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,583
all the videos and letters.

1542
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,418
What were you doing in my room?

1543
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,387
What were you doing in my room?!

1544
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,224
What is this?!

1545
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,663
You were spying on me.

1546
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:36,864
Why?

1547
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:39,700
Because I was worried about you!

1548
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:40,901
And I was right.

1549
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:43,604
You were sneaking boys into your room,

1550
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,307
and you were... you were drinking.

1551
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:49,710
You were sending nasty
pictures of yourself.

1552
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,581
You hacked into my computer!

1553
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:58,252
You... You posted
those disgusting things!

1554
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:02,590
You changed my AP English final!

1555
01:21:02,592 --> 01:21:05,392
You lied to my principal!

1556
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:07,695
You ruined my life.

1557
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:08,762
You're getting hysterical.

1558
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:09,897
I'm calling Dr. Greenburg.

1559
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:16,403
Oh, Kitty Cat.

1560
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,538
Stop calling me that!

1561
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,873
What is wrong with you?

1562
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,941
I'm protecting you.

1563
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:24,712
It's what I do. It's my job.

1564
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,780
You need help.

1565
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:27,982
I'm leaving.

1566
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,683
I'm packing my things.

1567
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:30,951
You can't do that.

1568
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:33,220
You can't do that!

1569
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,856
I can't stay here
another second with you!

1570
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:37,524
If you leave, I'll kill myself.

1571
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:39,360
I'll take every one of your pills.

1572
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,629
Oh, stop trying to manipulate me.

1573
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,765
Without you, I don't want to live.

1574
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:47,768
I don't want to live.

1575
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,239
I was an only child just like you,

1576
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:55,643
and I... I know what it's
like, and it's lonely,

1577
01:21:55,645 --> 01:21:59,847
and I tried to give you a
baby brother or a sister,

1578
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:02,316
but I kept losing them,

1579
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:06,353
my poor, beautiful babies.

1580
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:13,594
Then the doctor said that it
was too dangerous to try anymore,

1581
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,596
and that's when your father left.

1582
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:16,830
Oh, Mom...

1583
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:19,667
But I'm so proud of you.

1584
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:22,603
I'm so proud and so happy

1585
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,906
that you have so many
friends and you're so popular

1586
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:29,977
and you're into projects and
on teams and you run for office,

1587
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:33,314
and you're just... You're so amazing,

1588
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:35,349
and that's why I wanted...

1589
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:38,452
I wanted you to feel like
you were part of something.

1590
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,688
Then why did you ruin it?

1591
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:46,026
Because I just can't lose another baby.

1592
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:48,929
Cat!

1593
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:50,965
You've hurt people, Mom,

1594
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,300
people who I care about!

1595
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,902
They don't care about you!

1596
01:22:54,904 --> 01:22:56,603
Cat! Mom, this is my life!

1597
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:58,605
Stay out of it!

1598
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:01,642
Emily doesn't even care
about your four-year plan!

1599
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:04,645
Stay out of my life!

1600
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:05,646
Cat!

1601
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:08,549
Baby, don't. Don't!

1602
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:12,386
Oh, my God!

1603
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:14,388
Leave us alone!

1604
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,323
Stop it! No! Just leave us alone.

1605
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,858
Get off!

1606
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,993
Stop it! Can't take my daughter!

1607
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:20,928
You can't have my daughter!

1608
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,062
Stop!

1609
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,734
911. What's your emergency?

1610
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:27,868
It's my mother!

1611
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,770
She's attacking my best friend!

1612
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:31,805
Please hurry!

1613
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:32,940
Let go!

1614
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:34,508
Let go!

1615
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,576
Let go!

1616
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,811
Let go!

1617
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:39,813
Let go! Get off!

1618
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,882
Look at yourself!

1619
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:44,084
Look at what you're doing!

1620
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:46,487
Look at what you're doing!

1621
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,060
Em! Em!

1622
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:54,128
Breathe.

1623
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,662
Breathe.

1624
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,731
Breathe. You okay?

1625
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:01,468
Police!

1626
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,104
No! Hey, Hey!

1627
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:06,774
That's enough. That's enough.

1628
01:24:06,776 --> 01:24:08,108
Ma'am, that's enough.

1629
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,910
Calm down.

1630
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,445
Calm down. Cat!

1631
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:13,013
Oh, Cat!

1632
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:14,014
Cat!

1633
01:24:14,016 --> 01:24:15,015
That's enough.

1634
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:16,717
Cat! Cat!

1635
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:17,718
Calm down, ma'am.

1636
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,753
Cat!

1637
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,573
Mom.

1638
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,477
My baby. My baby.

1639
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,013
Better get off that thing. We
don't want to be late for class,

1640
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:22,749
especially after the way Professor
Claude chewed us out last time.

1641
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,651
Okay, I'm almost done.

1642
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:28,589
Hmm, Daniel sent you another one.

1643
01:25:28,591 --> 01:25:30,858
So romantic how he sends you real mail.

1644
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,894
Jeez, aren't you ever gonna forgive him?

1645
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:35,629
I know what he did was messed up,

1646
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,498
but he had... did have a lot going on

1647
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,532
with that whole birth-mom situation.

1648
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:39,967
I do forgive him.

1649
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,869
But?

1650
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,072
I can't forget.

1651
01:25:45,074 --> 01:25:47,908
Well, plainly that was a bonehead move.

1652
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:50,077
However, you did look
very hot in those pictures.

1653
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,979
Yeah. At least I'll have something

1654
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,247
to show my future grandchildren.

1655
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:57,918
Oh. It's my mom.

1656
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,853
I'm out.

1657
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,990
She feels really bad.

1658
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:05,225
She asks about you all the time.

1659
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,794
Cool, but I can't forget either,

1660
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:09,630
so see you in class.

1661
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:15,769
Hi, Mom.

1662
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,671
Hi, baby. How are you?

1663
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,174
Good. Really busy.

1664
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,642
How are you doing?

1665
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:23,810
I love it. How are you feeling?

1666
01:26:23,812 --> 01:26:26,180
I'm good.

1667
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:28,815
Still getting used to being in here.

1668
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:30,984
Don't think I ever will.

1669
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,254
I've been doing some painting.

1670
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:37,090
Are they still trying to
adjust your medication?

1671
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:40,594
Yeah. I feel like a lab rat.

1672
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:44,598
This last combination, I've
been on for, like, a week now.

1673
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,201
They say it could still take
some time to get it right.

1674
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:50,871
It seems like it's working.

1675
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,941
Haven't tried to kill
anyone lately. Heh.

1676
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:56,877
You can't blame yourself
for a chemical imbalance.

1677
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,679
Yeah.

1678
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:01,715
I know. That's what my therapist says.

1679
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,250
Now you're sounding like her.

1680
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:05,319
Mom, be patient.

1681
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,025
Uh, I've gotta go.

1682
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,031
Um, you're making progress.

1683
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:19,132
I can tell.

1684
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:21,568
Don't get discouraged.

1685
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,303
I love you, baby.

1686
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,373
Bye.

1687
