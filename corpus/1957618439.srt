1
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,265
A flying pickle?
What have I done?

2
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,235
A crime against humanity.

3
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,603
I didn't direct a movie,
I committed a crime.

4
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,273
Why is this limo so hot?

5
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,308
It's like a gas chamber
in here.

6
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,109
You made a
commercial movie, Harry.

7
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,345
I made toilet paper.

8
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,046
I think the kids
will go for it.

9
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,748
I committed
artistic suicide.

10
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,118
You will certainly die
from those filthy
French cigarettes.

11
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:09,323
I was sitting
in a 400-year-old stone house
in Aix-en-Provence,

12
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,058
Drinking an unbelievable
chablis,

13
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,227
and I went back to Hollywood
and committed suicide.

14
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,062
Why?
Tell me why I did it, Phil?

15
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,331
$400,000 in back taxes.

16
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,833
Then there's the question
of your two alimonies.

17
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,737
Plus the fact
your last few films
have not been hits, Harry.

18
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,739
How about
three disasters in a row?

19
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,741
Three huge bomberinos,
the record.

20
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,443
But The Pickle
will be a hit.

21
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,413
My nose tells me,
and my nose
is usually dependable.

22
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,915
How do you know
it's going to be a hit?
You haven't seen it.

23
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,550
Okay, it's a bomb.

24
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,085
I told you.

26
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,753
I'll be right out front
if you need me, Mr. Stone.

27
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,722
Great.
I may go see my mother.

28
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,124
Don't forget you have
an interview with the guy
from The Times at 4:00.

29
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,493
Cancel it.
I'm not talking to the press.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

31
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,231
It's not a review, Harry.

32
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,334
It's just a little story
about you being back
in the States again.

33
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,569
The Times has buried me
three times in a row.

34
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,937
Why should I
help them
make it four?

35
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,739
You already agreed
to it.

36
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,641
Welcome to the plaza,
Mr. Stone. It's an honor
to have you with us.

37
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,643
You're new, aren't you?
What happened to, uh...

What's his name?
The white-haired guy.

39
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,647

How many seats
do you want
for the preview?

46

Zero seats. I don't go
to my own funerals.

48
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,262
Oh, sure, she probably
wants to see the picture.

something for the baby.

Yeah.

Run down to Schwartz's
and get me a toy,
a nice big panda.

Uh, Purple Charlatan,
Roman Christmas.

was a masterpiece.

was the best Western
ever made.

let myself

about 16 or 17 at the most.

of weight recently,

The Pickle. Well,

117
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,417
The Pickle
is a film idea
that I have...

118
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,586
About a bunch
of farm kids from...

119
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,055
Kansas, Idaho.

120
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,257
You know, somewhere
warm and grassy.

121
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,560
A bunch of typical
blond-haired farm kids

122
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,961
who are into growing

123
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,397
these really, like,
super-duper large cucumbers

124
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,933
for the county fair.

125
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,067
Well,

126
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,370
all of a sudden,

127
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,873
they discover

128
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,476
That one of the cucumbers
won't stop growing.

129
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,616
It gets bigger and bigger

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,385
and bigger and bigger
and bigger.

131
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,354
And bigger.

132
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,090
And whoosh.

133
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:21,001
What do you mean, "bigger
and bigger and bigger"?

134
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,571
I mean, that the cucumber
turns into a spaceship.

135
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,972
That's what I mean.

136
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,173
A spaceship?

137
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,741
What's the matter, Phil?

138
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,643
You never heard of
a cucumber turning
into a spaceship?

139
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,344
Don't you read
the L.A. Papers?

140
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,446
Of course,
it's completely absurd.

141
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,215
Completely.

142
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,484
I'm talking about...

143
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,053
Rob "gorgeous" Lowe,
Molly Ringwald,
and Tom Cruise

144
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,489
flying, flying to the moon
on a pickle.

145
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,057
I'm talking
hysterically funny.

146

Hey, kid,

147
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,695
are you really
the head of production
for this studio?

148
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,998
Or is some gigantic joke
being played on an old man?

149
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,867
Mr. Stone,
I want to take the depth

150
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,303
and the irony,
and the black comedy,

151
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,238
and the social commentary,

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,109
and the absolutely brilliant,
razor-sharp, committed timing

153
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,312
that distinguishes
the films of Harold Stone.

154
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,014
And I want to mix it
into the stew

155
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,483
with this silly
little commercial piece
of Hollywood silliness,

156
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,019
and I want to see
what happens.

157
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,022
And I'm prepared to pay you
a ton of money.

158
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,557
When do you want
to shoot this thing?

159
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,026
Tomorrow.

00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:21,962

162
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,398

I got it. It's under control.
HARRY: Jesus Christ.

163
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,000

164
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,235
MAN: I know that.

165
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,737
And it should be green
and more mysterious.

They're landing
on a new planet.

167
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,372
I want poetry.

168
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,540
Go gather the cast.

169
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,975
Okay, for rehearsal?

170
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,209
No, we're gonna
shoot the rehearsal,
all right?

171
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,945
Lisa, get me some
coffee with Sweet'n Low.

172

the swimming pool scene.

874
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,959
That's not hard
to figure out, is it?

875
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,627
Here.

876
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:53,031
I, uh, I really like
that picture,
the Blue Dust.

877
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,632
Thank you, amigo.

878
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:56,634

879
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,837
What do you know?
He saw Blue Dust.

880
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,506
Are you here to stay,
Mr. Stone?

881
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,674
Harry.
Harry.

882
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,843
Here to live,
you mean?
Yeah.

883
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,311
No, I have
no future plans.

884
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,013
If anything,
I'm contemplating suicide.

885
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,348
(CHUCKLES)
He's joking.

886
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,784
No, he's not.

887
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:15,186
He's very anxious
about The Pickle.

888
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,454
Shut up, Francoise.

889
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,389
Would you call
The Pickle a comedy?

890
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,858
No, believe me,
it's a tragedy.

891
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,793
This dentist should
go to jail for life.

892
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:24,830
Phil, Phil,
meet Yakimoto Yakimura.

893

This is my agent,
Phil Hirsch.

894
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,532
Oh, hello.

895
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,134
I'd better come back
later, Harry.

896
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,535
Maybe I should
come back later.

897
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,770
Hello, Francoise.

898
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:34,505
Oh, no, no, continue
the interview, please.

(CHUCKLES)

900
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:41,112
Your films are sort
of like this scene
in the hotel room, Harry.

901
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:42,480
Is that good or bad?

902
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,415
I told you, I'm not a critic.

903
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,517
So, what's next?

904
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,720
Well, I don't know
what I'm gonna do next.

905
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,055
I know what
I should have done.

Harry.

907
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,858
No, I, I don't care
if they print it.

908
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,426
I should have done
Cortes and Montezuma.

909
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,862
Cortes and Montezuma.

910
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:00,065
I wanted Dustin Hoffman
and Warren Beatty.

911
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,902
Hoffman as Cortes,
Beatty as Montezuma.

912
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,904
An amazing story.

913
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:10,541
Cortes: Arrogant, cruel,
chivalrous.

914
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:15,380
Montezuma:
Painfully superstitious,
can't make a right move.

915
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,016
It's a wonderful tale.

916
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,851
I want to meet
Warren Beatty.

917
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:21,719
You're too old
for Warren Beatty.

918
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,422
I'm only 22.

Hello?

922
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:31,763
Yes, he is.
Just a minute, please.

923
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:32,898
Harry?
Hmm.

924
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,100
For you.
It's your son.

925
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,568
My son?
Yeah.

where the hell are you?

GREGORY: (OVER PHONE)
I'm downstairs.

928
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:48,947
Are you okay?

929
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,115
I'm fine.

930
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,282
You sure?

931
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,818
I'm sure.
Can I come up?

932
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,752
Okay, come right up.

933
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,990

934
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,558
He's okay?

935
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,060
We'll soon find out.

The drugs?

937
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,097
He's clean.
He's A.A. for
a whole year now.

938
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,633
Uh, maybe we can finish
this tomorrow, Mr. Stone.

Oh, sure, uh,
come by for lunch.

You're having lunch
with Ronnie Liebowitz
and Mike Krakower.

942
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,273
Well, how about breakfast?

00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,908
Uh, fine. 9:00?

944
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,243
No, make it 11:00.

Hi, Uncle Phil!
Long time no see.

952
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:37,562
You look like
you got a toothache.

953
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:38,997
Or, uh, or is that me?

00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,803
And this... This must be
Francoise. Hi, I'm Gregory,

955
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,374
and I just flew in
on the transglobal
airlines' $99 special.

956
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,043
No frills,
and also no engine.

957
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:54,012
You must be the publicist.

958
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,781
You look worried.
I assure you, I'm fine.

959
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,616
Or is it The Pickle
you're worried about?

961
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:04,022
And you.
You're either
the Japanese exhibitor,

962
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,924
or you're writing
my father's next film.

I'm Yakimoto Yakimura.

964
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:09,127
Of course.

965
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,196
I loved your piece
on Sigourney Weaver
in The Times.

966
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,165
And you did
something terrific
on Billy Wilder.

967
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,867
And I do not use
that term loosely.

968
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,002
Well, thank you.

969
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,369

00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,670
Yeah.

What are you on, Gregory?

972
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,845
You are absolutely gorgeous.

Relax, Harry.
It's not a pass.

974

You're on something
and I don't like it.

See you tomorrow.

Bye. Bye. Bye.

That was the publicist,
wasn't it?

Swear to me
you're clean.

982
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,033

this Christmas, pop.

that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,072
And I wanna see The Pickle,
and mom,

986
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,908
and Carrie,
Grandma Yetta, and the baby.

GREGORY:
It's a murder mystery.

991
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,755
It all takes place
in Laurel Canyon.

992
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,993
The detective
walks in a house,
picks up a cat.

993
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,594
He says, "I wish
the hell you could talk."

994
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,864
So the cat's the only
witness to the crime.

995
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:21,967
The cat looks him
straight in the eye
and he says,

996
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,102
"Look in the bathroom
under the sink."

997
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,104
What do you mean,
"the cat says"?

998
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,473
It's a talking cat.
It's funny.

999
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,110
It's ridiculous.

1000
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,123
Can I see
one of the new
blood pressure kits, please?

1001
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,624
They just came in.

1002
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,426
They are great.
Just a minute.

1003
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,828
You just made a movie
about a flying pickle.

1004
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,464
No one is gonna buy a script
about a talking cat.

1005
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,966

the head of the studio?

1007
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:57,902
He loves it.

1008
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,570
How did you meet him?

1009
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,472
All you have to do...
I told him
I was your son.

1010
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,508
Is insert your left
forefinger in the hole.

1011
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:04,942
I told him
I had an idea.

1012
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,811
There we are.
He told me to come in.
He liked it.

1013
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,446
Okay.
Are you pissed?

to your heart and press
the red button.

the other button.

00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,120
And we get
your blood pressure.

1018
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,787
He'll probably
ask me to direct it.

1019
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,089
I hope so.
No way.

1020
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,258
I will not direct a movie
about a talking cat.

1021
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,392
Okay.

1022
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,960
If my life
depended on it.

1023
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,295
If I had my back
to the wall,

1024
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:25,763
on my ass,
dead broke,

1025
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,932
no way
will I direct a movie
about a talking cat.

1026
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,302
What if the baby's life
depended on it?

1027
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,204
That's not fair.

1028
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:34,939
Who said anything
about fair?

1029
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,342
Gregory, I'm happy
if you sell the script,
but I have a career.

1030
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,344
I've a record of work
I'm proud of till now.

1031
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,745
And I love your movies, pop.

1032
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:43,081
But they're only movies,
they're not life and death.

1033
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:45,850
Oh, yes, they are!
A man's work is
life and death!

take it again.

so agitated.

Sit down,
sit down for five minutes
and take it again, Mr. Stone.

00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,735
Sit down.
It'll go way down.
You'll see.

01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,345
I had dinner
with him last night.

1559
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,014
I think he'd be perfect
for Cortes.

1560
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:06,182
Perfect.

1561
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,718
Perfect for Montezuma, too.

1562
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,920
He'd sure as hell
open the picture up big.

1563
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,456
He wants $6 million.

1564
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:14,758
RONNIE:
$8 million.
$6 Million was two years ago.

1565
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:18,327
Tell me, who do you see
as Montezuma?

1566
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,229
Oh, my potato.

1567
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,599
How about if we get
an unknown for Montezuma?

1568
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:23,867
I would love that.

1569
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,334
It could be exciting, Harry.

1570
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,936
You're great
at finding new people.

1571
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,272
So, when can I read
this material?
Whenever you want.

1572
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,940
Is everything
satisfactory, gentlemen?

1573
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,109
Oh, hi, Jose.
Could you bring me
another martini?

1574
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,444
Another scotch, amigo?

1575
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:36,946
Sure thing, Mr. Stone.
I like that Cortes story.

1576
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,081
(CHUCKLES)

1577
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:43,086
Harry, I got
a really crazy idea.

1578
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:45,722
Well, shoot, Ronnie baby.

1579
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,423
Let's update it.
Update what?

1580
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:51,294
Update Cortes. Let's make it
east L.A., today.

1581
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,496
Hmm?

1582
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,798
The barrio?
Cortes is a Chicano cop

1583
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,633
called in to clean up
the Aztecs,

1584
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:57,834
the Aztecas.

1585
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,603
Hmm?

1586
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,105
The Aztecas are
a really tough,
really tough street gang.

1587
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,309
And the leader
is... Montezuma.

1588
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,513
And Montezuma
has a girlfriend
named Marina

1589
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:11,681
who Cortes
falls in love with.

1590
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:13,617
I love that. I love it.

1591
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,118
It is a great commercial idea,

1592
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,153
and you still use Dustin
as Cortes.

1593
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,623
Sean Penn as Montezuma?

1594
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,491
And Meryl Streep as Marina.

1595
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,560
And you wouldn't have to
do any building.

1596
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,562
You'd shoot the whole thing
in east L.A.

1597
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,664
No. Streep, no. Forget it.
Not good for the girl.

1598
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,165
What about Madonna?

1599
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,500
That's terrific, Phil.
Oh, yeah.

1600
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,435
That's terr--
Great. Sean and Madonna.

1601
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,170
Sean and Madonna,
together again.

1602
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,805
No way!

1603
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:40,343
No way I will make
an updated version

1604
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,912
of one of the most
beautiful stories in history.

1605
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:44,013
Let's forget it.

1606
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,849
Harry.
This is insanity!

1607
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,350
Harry, come on now.
Just relax.

1608
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,318
Just relax. It's an idea,
a concept.

1609
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:51,655
Forget it, goodbye.
That's it. It's over.

1610
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,190
No.

1611
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,192
No, no,
I'm not gonna forget it.

1612
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,695
HARRY:
okay, folks? Folks?

1613
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,030
Excuse me, (STAMMERING)
let's take a vote.

1614
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,134
All those in favor

1615
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:08,371
of, of Cortes and Montezuma,

1616
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,207
raise your hands.

1617
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,143
Now all those who prefer
the updated version...

1618
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,690
AIDE: I'm crazy about you.

1619
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:27,857
MOLLY-GIRL: (PANTING)

1620
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,125
But you hardly know me.

1621
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,861
I've just never met
anybody like you before.

1622
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:33,697
No, don't.

1623
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,532
We always do it
on the first date
in Cleveland.

1624
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,901
Because you die
so young?

1625
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,035
Exactly.

1626
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,004
But it seems so empty.

1627
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,572
It's just sex
for the sake of sex.

1628
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,574
Don't you ever
feel guilty?

1629
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,476
We don't have any guilt
in Cleveland.

1630
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:51,147
We just love
just for the sake
of loving.

1631
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:55,218
Do you believe in God?

1632
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:56,285
(LAUGHS)

1633
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:59,188
Of course we do,
you sweet thing.

1634
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,530
This is our Bible.

1635
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:13,102
It's on video?

1636
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:18,742
AIDE: Now, in the beginning,
there were the heavens,

1637
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:23,780
and there was the sky above
and the land below.

1638
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,415
and there were the oceans,
and the lakes,

1639
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:28,284
and the rivers,
and the streams.

1640
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,853
(PLAYING INSTRUMENT)

1641
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,458
And all this...

1642
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,061
All this God did
on the very first day.

1643
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,128
(SIGHING)

1644
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,596
It's different.

1645
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:44,067
Well, God was in a hurry,
darling.

1646
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,304
AIDE:
So God created all the
animals on the second day.

1647
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,308
And on the third day,
God created Adam and Eve.

1648
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,746
And man was just
poisoned with desire.

1649
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:02,485
Cleveland was destroyed.

1650
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:07,757
And God, realizing
his... His terrible mistake,

1651
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:10,860
decided to create
Adam and Eve
all over again.

1652
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:15,865
Adam and Eve
knew they would never taste

1653
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:18,334
the fruit of desire.

1654
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,972
They would only eat,
eat the meat.

1655
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,012
PRESIDENT: If you want
your own copy
of the Cleveland Bible,

1656
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,847
call 1-800-BIBLE.

1657
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,982
I repeat. If you want
your own copy

1658
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:36,019
of the Cleveland Bible,
call 1-800-BIBLE.

1659
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:40,857
If you want your own copy
of the Cleveland Bible,
call 1-800-BIBLE.

1660
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,026
You can stop now.

1661
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,094
BUTCH: (OVER P.A. SYSTEM)
okay, Mr. Stone.

1662
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:47,530
Thank you.

1663
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,132
You're welcome, heshie.

1664
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,803
Do I know you?

1665
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:56,639
BUTCH: I was in your class
in P.S. 179.

1666
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:59,075
Butch. Butch Levine.

1667
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,313
Butch, I'm coming back.

1668
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,354
Hey, Butch?

1669
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,923
Heshie.

1670
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:16,225
(LAUGHING)
How are you?

1671
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,561
How are you?

1672
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,229
Oh, I can't complain.

1673
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:23,199
I know how you are.
You're doing great
all these years.

1674
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:24,600
Would you...
Would you recognize me?

1675
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:26,335
I don't know.
You look pretty good.

1676
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,671
I'll be 60,
come next March.

1677
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,006
You're in April, right?

1678
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:31,340
What a memory.

1679
01:18:31,474 --> 01:18:33,142
You ever see any of the guys?

1680
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,812
Pinnie, Marty,
Louie the Italian?

1681
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,347
Oh, no. I, I drove
by the old neighborhood
yesterday.

1682
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:39,582
It's pretty sad.

1683
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,484
Looks like a war zone.
Yeah.

1684
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,219
How's your mother?

1685
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,189
She's okay. She's, uh,
living in Brighton Beach.

1686
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,256
Uh-huh.

1687
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,058
Your father passed away,
didn't he?

1688
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:51,027
You know my whole story,
don't you?

1689
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,862
You're a famous man, heshie.

1690
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:55,198
Or should I call you Harry?

1691
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,934
I feel like I'm 10 years old
when you call me heshie.

1692
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,770
Ah, it goes like a bullet,
doesn't it?

1693
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,372
Well, anyhow,
I'm still married
to the same woman.

1694
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:07,811
I gottwo grown sons,
and a beautiful daughter,
and five grandchildren.

1695
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:09,612
And come next summer,

1696
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,448
I'm packing it in
and moving to Florida.

1697
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:15,718
You're retiring?

1698
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,887
I don't care
if I never see
another movie.

1699
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,089
Except yours,
of course.

1700
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,459
I've seen all
your movies, Harry.

1701
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,129
That's heshie.

1702
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,097
You made some beauties.

1703
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:29,598
What do you think of
this one?

1704
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:31,767
Well, I only
saw the one reel.

1705
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,036
It's a turkey, isn't it?

1706
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,170
(EXCLAIMS)

1707
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,039
Science fiction's
not my cup of tea.

1708
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:37,240
(CHUCKLES)

1709
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:38,975
You're not
a good liar, Butch.

1710
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,410
You never can tell,
the kids might love it.

1711
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,815
Hey, Butch, remember
the rabbi's daughter?

1712
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:47,150
What was her name?

1713
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:48,651
Uh, Naomi.

1714
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,119
She had black hair.

1715
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:51,921
And purple eyes.

1716
01:19:52,055 --> 01:19:53,489
And you were crazy
about her.

1717
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,790
I kissed her once.

1718
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:55,959
(CHUCKLES)

1719
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:58,061
In the doorway
of the rabbi's building.

1720
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:00,496
I thought I'd go to hell
for sure.

1721
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,031
My God, she was beautiful.

1722
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:03,666
Who'd she end up marrying?

1723
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,502
I don't know.
She never became famous.

1724
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,471
Well, good luck, hesh.

1725
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:10,840
Um...

1726
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:12,775
If you wanna have a drink,

1727
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:15,278
Give me a call.
I'm at the plaza.

1728
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,146

I had a girlfriend
named Molly.

and he was my great-uncle.

Morris was a cantor.

What a voice. A tenor.

1926

Could have sung opera.

Molly.

1928
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,565
He sings for his supper.

1929

1930
01:32:56,672 --> 01:33:00,676
Uncle Morris sang at my
