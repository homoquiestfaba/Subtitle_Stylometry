1
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,401
    YOU'RE LOOKING AT GARY,     
        INDIANA, U.S.A.,        

2
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,904
    A CITY WITH THE HIGHEST     
    MURDER RATE IN AMERICA,     

3
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,406
        MAYBE THE WORLD.        

4
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:51,144
    A FACTORY TOWN THAT SOMEHOW 
        BECAME A GANG TOWN.     

5
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:52,646
    BACK IN THE FIFTIES,        

6
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:55,649
    THE COMMUNITY WAS SUPPORTED 
    BY THE U.S. STEEL MILL.     

7
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,651
    IT WAS DAMN HARD WORK,      

8
00:00:57,718 --> 00:00:59,653
    BUT PEOPLE RAISED           
    THEIR FAMILIES WELL.        

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,589
    THEN JUST 20 YEARS LATER,   
        WITHOUT WARNING,        

10
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:06,025
    US STEEL SHUT DOWN          
    70% OF THE MILL.            

11
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,528
AT FIRST, THE WORKERS THOUGHT   
    IT WAS TEMPORARY,           

12
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:10,029
        BUT IT WASN'T.          

13
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:13,300
    THEIR SAVINGS WENT,         
    UNEMPLOYMENT RAN OUT,       

14
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,802
        AND SLOWLY,             
    THE FORMER STEELWORKERS     

15
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,305
    LOST THE LAST TWO THINGS    
        THEY HAD LEFT--         

16
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:20,873
    THEIR PRIDE AND THEIR HOPE. 

17
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,875
    AND THAT HAS BEEN           
    THE INHERITANCE             

18
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,877
    OF THE CHILDREN OF GARY.    

19
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,879
    THIS WAS THE PALACE         
        MOVIE THEATER.          

20
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:30,517
     THE LAST MOVIE THAT PLAYED 
         HERE WAS <i>STAR WARS.</i>    

21
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,018
    THAT'S THE BAKERY.          

22
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:33,520
        IT USED TO MAKE         
        THE BEST DAMN           

23
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,022
    GLAZED AND CHOCOLATE        
    DOUGHNUTS IN TOWN.          

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,525
        THAT'S WHERE            
HAYNES' RESTAURANT ONCE STOOD.  

25
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:41,794
    THEY HAD THE BEST           
    BARBECUED RIBS.             

26
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,796
            THIS IS             
    THE MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM--   

27
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,833
        HOME OF TWO STATE       
    BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS.   

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,402
    MORE THAN 350,000 BACK THEN.

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,404
        NOW THERE'S             
    ONLY 150,000 LEFT           

30
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:54,341
    THAT STILL CALL GARY        
        THEIR HOME.             

31
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,112
    THIS ABANDONED STEEL MILL   
        IS NOW HEADQUARTERS     

32
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,548
        TO A GANG CALLED        
        THE DIABLOS.            

33
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:05,552
    AND THE OLD TRAIN DEPOT     
IS A HANGOUT FOR THEIR RIVALS-- 

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,019
        THE REBELS.             

35
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,904
HEY, PUNK!                      

36
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:27,874
                FUCK HIM, MAN!  

37
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,377
WHAT'S UP, PUNK?                
YOU READY FOR THE BALL?         

38
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,379

                YOU GOT IT?     

39
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:33,880
YO, SHUT UP!                    

40
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,882
    HE'LL KNOCK YOUR ASS OUT!   

41
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,484
SHUT UP! SHOOT! SHOOT!          

42
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,668
        OH! THAT'S SHIT!        

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,704

THE BROTHER'S FROM,             

44
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:59,806
BUT THAT SHIT                   
IS NOT RIGHT.

        HELLO, MOMS.

                IN THE SHOULDER,

308
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,895

315
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,769
        I'M NOT GOING           
        INTO THE STORE TODAY.   

316
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:57,773
    I SHOULD'VE MADE YOU        
    LEAVE HERE A LONG TIME AGO. 

317
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:01,210
        WHEN IS THE LAST TIME   
        ANYBODY MADE HIM DO     
        ANYTHING?               

318
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:04,213
    POPS, THIS PLACE            
    IS JUST NOT RIGHT--         

319
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,717
                THIS PLACE WAS  
                A GOOD PLACE.   

320
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:09,719
                I COME HERE     
                WITH NOTHING.   

321
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,387
                GOT A JOB       
                AT U.S. STEEL.  

322
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:13,889
YEAH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.         

323
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:15,390
THE DAY THE WAR ENDED           

324
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,127
YOU QUIT THE MILL               
WITH $9,500 IN THE BANK.        

325
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,562
            MARRIED YOUR MOTHER,

326
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,364
            BOUGHT THE STORE.   

327
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:24,867
        IF I STAYED IN THE MILL,

328
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:26,368
        I MIGHT'VE MADE FOREMAN,

329
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:29,371
            BUT I'D BE          
            OUT OF WORK BY NOW. 

330
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:32,241
            MAYBE LIVING        
            ON THE STREET,      

331
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,243
        LIKE SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

332
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,013
            PEOPLE WORK         
            ALL THEIR LIVES     

333
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,151
            AND WIND UP SLEEPING
            IN A CARDBOARD BOX  
            IN A DOORWAY.       

334
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:43,653
            IS IT ANY WONDER    

335
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,656
            THESE KIDS TODAY    
            DON'T WANT TO WORK? 

336
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:51,293
            THEY DON'T EVEN WANT
            TO LIVE TO GROW OLD.

337
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:53,295
I'M GETTING YOU                 
OUT OF HERE                     

338
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,631
SO THIS CAN NEVER               
HAPPEN AGAIN.                   

339
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,000

         <i>TO MY FATHER.</i>          

566
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:09,377
     <i>YOU'LL HAVE TO MEET UP</i>     
     <i>WITH ME REAL SOON.</i>         

567
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,181
WE'RE GOING TO GET              
THAT ASS JOHN BOOKMAN.          

568
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:17,319
THANKS FOR BEING                
ON THE SHOW, JOHN.              

569
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:20,822
THERE'S A PHONE CALL            
FOR YOU--                       
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.             

570
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,991
                NO SHIT.        

571
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,058
                WHAT TOOK HIM   
                SO LONG?        

572
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,228
            SO TELL ME,         

573
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:29,731
            WHAT ARE YOU        
            GOING TO DO         
            ABOUT THESE GANGS?  

574
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,233
    FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,     

575
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,735
        YOU USED TO BE          
        A GANG MEMBER,          

576
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:36,972
        A FOUNDING MEMBER       
        OF THE REBS.            

577
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,974
            YEAH, THAT'S TRUE...

578
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:42,077
            BUT WE DIDN'T       
            KILL PEOPLE.        

579
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,512
YES, BUT, UH...                 

580
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,014
YOU STARTED SOMETHING,          

581
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,016
AND IT'S OUT                    
OF CONTROL NOW.                 

582
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,517
            BECAUSE YOU LET IT. 

583
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,519
DON'T LAY                       
THIS SHIT ON ME!                

584
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:54,522
YOU ARE PISSED OFF              
BECAUSE YOU'VE                  
BECOME A VICTIM                 

585
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,524
OF SOMETHING                    
YOU STARTED YOURSELF.           

586
00:26:56,592 --> 00:26:58,327
    YOU SEE, MR. BOOKMAN,       

587
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:01,263
    I'M AFRAID THAT IS          
    YOUR LEGACY TO GARY.        

588
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:03,265
    SO DON'T BE COMING IN HERE  

589
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,101
    WAVING THAT LITTLE CIGAR    
    AROUND, BLAMING US.         

590
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,603
MY OWN FATHER WORKED            
IN THE STEEL MILLS              

591
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,106
AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED          
ON THE JOB.                     

592
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:14,109
THE COMPANY SETTLEMENT          
PUT ME THROUGH LAW SCHOOL.      

593
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:17,612
I CAME BACK.                    
WHERE WERE YOU                  
ALL THESE YEARS?                

594
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,614
        LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT ME.

595
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,650
        LET'S TALK              
        ABOUT THE LOUSY JOB     
        YOU'VE DONE.            

596
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:25,153
            SO YOU THINK        
            IF WE GO OUT        

597
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:26,654
            AND FOCUS           
            ON THIS AREA,       

598
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,457
            CRIME IS GOING      
            TO DRY UP.          

599
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,959
    LIGHTEN UP, HUH?            

600
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,127
    CALM DOWN.                  

601
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:33,628
                    ALL RIGHT,  
                    ALL RIGHT.  

602
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,130
    NOW, OUR MAIN CONCERN HERE  

603
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,132
        IS THE SAFETY           
        OF YOUR FAMILY.         

604
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,135
    THEREFORE, I SUGGEST        
    WE SET UP A MEETING         

605
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:43,138
    WITH REVEREND DORSEY        
    AT THE CHRISTIAN CHAPEL.    

606
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:46,441
SO WHAT'S REVEREND DORSEY       
GOING TO DO?                    

607
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,810
            THE REVEREND SERVES 
            AS AN INTERMEDIARY  

608
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,312
            BETWEEN THE GANGS.  

609
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,813
WHAT ARE YOU                    
TELLING ME?                     

610
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,449
YOU'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE       
WITH THESE PUNKS?               

611
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:55,951
    THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.       

612
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,452
    UNLESS, OF COURSE,          
        MR. BOOKMAN,            

613
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,954
        YOU HAVE                
    A BETTER SUGGESTION.        

614
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,389
            MICHAEL, THAT'S     
            A HELL OF AN IDEA.  

615
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,958
        THANK YOU, SIR.         
        THANK YOU.              

616
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:04,426
    YEAH.                       

617
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,995
RIGHT. O.K.                     

618
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,496
SET IT UP.                      

619
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:09,731
                    GOOD.       

620
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,500
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,         

621
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,502
LIKE YOU SAID, MR. MAYOR,       

622
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:17,573
I STARTED THE REBELS.           
I CAN TERMINATE THEM.           

623
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:22,377
    I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU  
        FOR COMING.             

624
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:23,878
    I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED     

625
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:25,880
    ABOUT THE VIOLENCE          
        IN OUR CITY.            

626
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:29,384
    I JUST HAD A LONG TALK      
        WITH THE MAYOR.         

627
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:30,885
                WHAT EXACTLY    
                DID YOU DISCUSS?

628
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,887
    WHAT HE HAS TO DO.          

629
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:36,558
        HE'LL DO THEM           
    OR FIND A NEW MAYOR.        

630
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:43,364
         <i> WHEN I DIE</i>           
         <i> HALLELUJAH,</i>           
         <i> BYE AND BYE </i>         

631
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,734
         <i> ALL THE WAY </i>        

632
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:50,471
     I WILL GET                
    A BRIGHTER LOVE            

633
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,875
         OH, MY WORD          

634
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,477
         WHEN I DIE           

635
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,479
         WHEN I DIE           

636
00:28:57,547 --> 00:28:58,880
         WHEN I DIE           

637
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,749
         WHEN I DIE           

638
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,383
         WHEN I DIE           

639
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:04,920
         WHEN I DIE           

640
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:06,220
         WHEN I DIE           

641
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,556
         WHEN I DIE           

642
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,675
         WHEN I DIE           

643
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:11,777
         WHEN I DIE           

644
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:13,411
         WHEN I DIE           

645
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:16,214
         HALLELUJAH            
        BRIGHTER LOVE          

646
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:19,585
     BRIGHTER                 

647
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:23,021
         BRIGHTER             

648
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,923
         LOVE                 

649
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:29,227
         PRAY                 

650
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:36,068
            THE CHOIR CAN TAKE  
            A 10-MINUTE BREAK.  

651
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:38,269
    REVEREND, ARE YOU GOING     
        TO BE ALL RIGHT?        

652
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:41,673
I'LL BE FINE.                   
Y'ALL JUST GET SOME AIR.        

653
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:45,143
    AHEM!                       

654
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,081
                YOU REQUESTED   
                OUR PRESENCE?   

655
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:51,583
YES. THE MAYOR                  
CALLED ME TODAY.                

656
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:55,821
    AND HOW IS OUR FRIEND       
        THE MAYOR?              

657
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:57,222
VERY UPSET.                     

658
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,424
ESPECIALLY OVER THIS            
GROCERY STORE BUSINESS.         

659
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,259
            OH, YEAH.           
            I HEARD SOMETHING   
            ABOUT THAT.         

660
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:04,763
            I HEARD THE OLD MAN 
            HAD A CHATTERY SIDE.

661
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,766
NOW, MARVIN BOOKMAN             
IS AN OLD MAN.                  

662
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:12,270
YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES         
OLD MEN MAKE MISTAKES.          

663
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,272
    OLD MEN BETTER LEARN,       
        REVEREND.               

664
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,776
WELL, SOMETIMES                 
WE HAVE TO REACH                
DEEP WITHIN OURSELVES           

665
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:19,277
TO FIND FORGIVENESS.            

666
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,279
PERHAPS I SHOULD                
ALSO MENTION                    

667
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:24,783
THAT JOHNNY BOOKMAN IS          
A VERY HIGH-PROFILE PERSON.     

668
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,985
            I MET THE GREAT MAN.

669
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,503
            I WASN'T IMPRESSED. 

670
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,005
THE MEDIA, BROTHERS.            

671
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,007
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD      

672
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,009
DOING BUSINESS                  
IN A GOLDFISH BOWL.             

673
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:36,711
THE MAYOR CAN'T LOOK            
THE OTHER WAY FOREVER.          

674
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,196
            SO SHINE HIM ON.    

675
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:40,198
            GET BOOKMAN         
            ON A PLANE OUT.     

676
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:42,701
            IS THAT YOUR SERMON 
            OF THE DAY?         

677
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:43,902
LOOK...                         

678
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:47,472

00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:36,290

        YOUR PROBLEM, PARTNER.  

731
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:39,811

        TO HOLLER              

744
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:10,441
         THE WAY THEY          
        DO MY LIFE             

745
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,177

                 THIS AIN'T    
                LIVIN'         

747
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,948
                 THE BIBLE     
                SAYS           

748
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,451

                FORGIVIN'

THERE'S SOMETHING               
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, MAN.      

754
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,299
I WAS HOME                      
WATCHING TV ONE NIGHT.          

755
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,301
I WAS WATCHING                  
PAY-PER-VIEW.                   

756
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,303
I SAW YOUR BOY FIGHT.           

757
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,804
THIS GUY WENT PLUNK!            

758
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,306
            OH, MAN,            
            DON'T GO THERE.     

759
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,308
            I GAVE THE KID      
            HIS SHOT.           

760
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,311
            HE GOT KNOCKED DOWN 
            IN TWO ROUNDS.      
            SO WHAT?            

761
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,812
YEAH, RIGHT.                    
TELL ME SOMETHING,              

762
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,314
YOU STILL                       
IN CLEVELAND, RIGHT?            

763
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:50,815
            YEAH, MAN,          
            I'M IN CLEVELAND    

764
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,317
            TRAINING            
            SOME NEW TALENT.    

765
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:55,320
            YOU KNOW, JOHNNY,   
            THESE KIDS ARE      
            NOT LIKE US.        

766
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:56,821
            THEY DON'T WANT     
            TO WORK.            

767
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,323
            ALL THEY WANT       
            IS MONEY.           

768
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,259
            I GOT 20 YEARS      
            ON MOST OF THESE    
            SUCKERS.            

769
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:02,760
            I CAN STILL         
            KICK THEIR BUTTS!   

770
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:03,928
WHOA, WHOA!                     

771
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:05,430
CHILL OUT, BROTHER.             

772
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:08,233
LOOK, I KNOW WHERE              
YOU'RE COMING FROM, MAN,        

773
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,167
BUT I KNOW YOU DIDN'T           
COME ALL THE WAY TO GARY        

774
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:14,739
TO HELP ME                      
IN SOME STREET FIGHT.           

775
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:16,207
                I CAME BACK     
                TO BURY KENNY.  

776
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,808
LAURIE'S SON?                   

777
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,410
                    OUR SON.    

778
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:21,446
A SON?                          

779
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:24,249
DAMN, I'M SORRY, JAKE.          

780
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:26,251
            I NEVER KNEW HIM,   
            JOHNNY.             

781
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:28,853
            HEARD HE WAS        
            A GREAT ATHLETE.    

782
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,888
WHAT HAPPENED                   
BETWEEN YOU AND LAURIE?         

783
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:32,390
        IT WAS OVER BETWEEN US  

784
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,393
        WHEN SHE FOUND OUT      
        SHE WAS PREGNANT.       

785
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,595
        YOU KNOW LAURIE--       
        STRONG, BLACK WOMAN.    

786
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:41,733
        SHE MADE IT CLEAR       
        SHE WANTED THE BABY,    
        BUT NOT ME.             

787
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,834
DID HE KNOW                     
YOU WERE THE FATHER?            

788
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:47,338
        YEAH, SHE TOLD HIM      
        WHEN HE WAS 9 YEARS OLD.

789
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:49,840
        LOOK, I SENT MONEY.     
        I DID EVERYTHING.       

790
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:51,342
        SHE NEVER               
        CASHED MY CHECKS.       

791
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,978
        I DID THE BEST          
        I COULD DO.             

792
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:56,981
        SHE WANTED ME TO KNOW   
        THEY DIDN'T NEED ME.    

793
00:35:57,048 --> 00:36:00,985
THERE'S LOTS                    
WE'D BOTH LIKE                  
TO LEAVE IN THE PAST.           

794
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:03,321
         BAPTISTS...          

795
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,839
            JOHN!               
        JOHN BOOKMAN.           

796
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:07,975
    I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU         
        IN HERE.                

797
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:09,477
        THE FELLAS TELL ME      

798
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,479
        YOU GAVE THEM HELL      
        ON TELEVISION.          

799
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,948
     THROW UP BOTH MY HANDS   

800
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:15,450

00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:21,289
     THIS AIN'T LIVIN'...     

804
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,457
                JAKE TREVOR.    

805
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:25,826
                WHAT'S GOIN' ON,
                CHAMP?          

806
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:29,164
SLICK, IT'S BEEN                
A WHILE, MY MAN.                

807
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,831
            MEANING SINCE YOU   
            LEFT THE REBELS?    

808
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,435
        DAMN RIGHT,             
        IT'S BEEN A LONG WHILE. 

809
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:34,969
YEAH. I SEE                     
YOU'RE STILL HERE, HUH?         

810
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,605
            GOT A LITTLE        
            HARDWARE STORE      
            OVER ON GRANT,      

811
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,107
            BUT I'M DOING O.K.  

812
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:41,609
LOT OF SHIT'S CHANGED           
IN THIS TOWN.                   

813
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:42,910
            SHIT CHANGES,       

814
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:45,913
            BUT I WANT TO KNOW  
            WHAT'S HAPPENING    
            IN THE STREET.      

815
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:48,416
IF YOU REMEMBER                 
BACK IN THE DAY,                

816
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:51,419
WE WERE A GANG,                 
PROTECTION GANG.                
REMEMBER THAT?                  

817
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:52,753
                    YEAH.       

818
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:54,255
THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.            

819
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:55,590
NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT              
DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS.             

820
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:58,759
IT ISN'T ABOUT                  
ROCKS AND BOTTLES               
ANYMORE.                        

821
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:00,244
IT'S ABOUT                      
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.              

822
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:01,696
        I CAN UNDERSTAND        
        ALL THAT,               

823
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:05,366
        BUT I WANT TO KNOW      
        WHAT YOU KNOW           
        ABOUT KENNY'S DEATH.    

824
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,736
I DON'T SHOOT RUMORS, MAN.      

825
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:13,307
            HEY, SLICK, I SAID  
            I WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
            YOU HEARD, MAN.     

826
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,211
ALL RIGHT.                      
YOU WANT TO KNOW?               

827
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:21,432
MY BOY SAW KENNY                
HUSTLING A REBEL                
OVER A BASKETBALL GAME.         

828
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:22,867
            YOUR BOY SAW WHAT?  

829
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:25,119
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.             
I TOLD YOU.                     

830
00:37:27,756 --> 00:37:30,191
                    WHAT DID HE 
                    GET HIM FOR?

831
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:31,342
300 BUCKS.                      

832
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,345
        YOU TELLING ME          
        THAT MY BOY GOT KILLED  

833
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:35,847
        FOR 300 BILLS, MAN?     

834
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:37,281
        THAT'S WHAT             
        YOU'RE TELLING ME?      

835
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:40,284
NO, WHAT I'M TRYING             
TO TELL YOU IS                  

836
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:42,787
THEY DIDN'T KILL HIM            
OVER THE MONEY.                 

837
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,790
THEY KILLED HIM                 
BECAUSE HE WAS                  
HUSTLING THEM.                  

838
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:48,526
IT AIN'T ABOUT                  
BREAKING FINGERS ANYMORE.       

839
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,732
                WHO'S RUNNING   
                THE SHOW, MAN?  

840
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,235
JUST LIKE                       
THE OLD DAYS                    
WITH YOU AND JOHN,              

841
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:00,805
ONLY NOW IT'S                   
SPYRO AND DAMIEN.               

842
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:03,307
NOTHING GOES DOWN               
IN THIS TOWN                    

843
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,809
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT.          

844
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,812
                ALL RIGHT.      
                THEN I'LL TAKE  
                CARE OF THIS.   

845
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,647
WAIT.                           
WAIT A MINUTE.                  

846
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:14,084
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU             
AND JOHN BACK IN THE HOOD.      

847
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:15,920
I DON'T KNOW WHAT               
YOU GUYS ARE UP TO,             

848
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:20,925
BUT I'LL BET                    
THERE'LL BE CHANGES             
IN THIS TOWN.                   

849
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:24,228
I JUST WANT                     
TO BE A PART OF IT.             

850
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,293
         THE LORD             

851
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,397
     TOOK HIS SOUL            

852
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:45,333
         AND HE SET           

853
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:49,070
     HE SET MY CHILD FREE     

854
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:53,641
         HE'S GONE            

855
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,709
 HE'S GONE                    

856
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,978
     HE'S GONE TO HEAVEN      

857
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:59,346
 HE'S GONE TO HEAVEN          

858
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:02,867
         OH, HOW HAPPY        

859
00:39:02,935 --> 00:39:05,570
     HOW HAPPY HE'LL BE       

860
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:11,576
     YEAH, YEAH, HE WON'T      
        HAVE TO WORRY          

861
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:15,580
         OR SHED               
        NO MORE TEARS          

862
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:20,084
     FOR HE'S GONE HOME       

863
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:24,221
     WHERE HE'LL HAVE          
    NO MORE FEARS              

864
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:29,426
     ANOTHER ANGEL            

865
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,428
     HAS GONE ON HOME         

866
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,464
 TO BE WITH MY LORD           

867
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:37,935
     ANOTHER ANGEL            

868
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,837
     HAS GONE ON HOME         

869
00:39:40,038 --> 00:39:42,639
 TO BE WITH MY LORD           

870
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:45,943
     ANOTHER ANGEL, YEAH      

871
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,278
     HAS GONE ON HOME         

872
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:51,582
 TO BE WITH MY LORD           

873
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:53,450
            HOW'D YOU FIND OUT? 

874
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,954
JOHNNY WENT ON                  
SOME TV SHOWS,                  

875
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,456
AND SOME NEWSPAPERS             
PICKED UP THE STORY.            

876
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,025
I READ IT SOMEWHERE.            

877
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,929
YOU KNOW,                       
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED ME.        

878
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:09,033
            I JUST DIDN'T WANT  
            ANY MORE KILLING.   

879
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:12,053
WHAT DO YOU THINK               
I'LL DO,                        

880
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:14,188
JUST FORGET WHAT                
THEY DID TO KENNY?              

881
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:15,690
        IT WON'T BE FOR KENNY.  

882
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,759
        IT'LL BE                
        FOR JAKE TREVOR,        

883
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,761
        WHO'S ALWAYS            
        LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.    

884
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:21,862
        WHO'S ALWAYS            
        GOT TO HIT SOMEBODY,    

885
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,864
        EVEN IF IT MAKES        
        EVERYTHING WORSE!       

886
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:26,267
        GIVE ME THAT!           

887
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,806
WHAT'S UP, JAKE?                

888
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,081
            OH, MAN.            

889
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:44,585
        I FOUND OUT WHY         
        THEY KILLED KENNY, MAN. 

890
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,588
        THE REBELS HAD          
        A B-BALL RACKET GOING.  

891
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,090
        KENNY MADE A SLICK MOVE 
        ON THEM.                

892
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,594
DOES LAURIE                     
KNOW ABOUT THIS?                

893
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,364
            NO, SHE DON'T KNOW  
            ABOUT IT YET.       

894
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:59,033
        THAT'S THE WAY          
        I WANT TO KEEP IT, MAN. 

895
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
            YOU READY TO MAKE   
            THIS HIT WITH ME?   

896
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,536
HEY, MAN, SLOW DOWN.            

897
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:03,170
I GOT A MEETING TOMORROW        
WITH THE REBELS                 

898
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:05,105
AT THE CHURCH                   
ON 35th STREET.                 

899
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,507
                    WHAT FOR?   

900
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,976
SET UP A TRUCE.                 
START A DIALOG.                 

901
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:11,579
            YOU MUST BE         
            OUT OF YOUR MIND.   

902
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,948
            I NEVER THOUGHT     
            YOU'D SELL OUT!     

903
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,617
HEY, HEY.  COME ON, JAKE.       
THIS IS ME YOU TALKIN' TO !     

904
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:17,552
        IT AIN'T GOING          
        TO COME DOWN THAT WAY!  

905
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:19,754
BULLSHIT! YOU KNOW              
AS WELL I KNOW                  

906
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:22,390
YOU GOT TO HAVE POWER           
TO MAKE A TRUCE.                

907
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,525
WHERE'S YOUR POWER,             
JOHNNY?                         

908
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:27,094
                    ALL YOU WANT
                    IS REVENGE? 

909
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:28,396
DAMN RIGHT,                     
I WANT REVENGE!                 

910
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,431
    WHAT I WANT HERE            
    IS A LITTLE RESPECT!        

911
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,968
            TAKE THIS OUT       
            TO THE STREET!      

912
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:35,370
HAVE YOU HEARD?                 

913
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:38,373
OUR GOOD FRIEND JOHNNY          
WANTS TO MAKE A TRUCE           

914
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,875
WITH THE PEOPLE                 
THAT KILLED OUR SON.            

915
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,877
            AND LET THEM        
            OFF THE HOOK?       

916
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:45,880
    NO, I WANT THEM ARRESTED    
        AND PUT ON TRIAL.       

917
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:47,382
            IT WON'T            
            HAPPEN THAT FAST.   

918
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:49,884
            THEY GOT A LOCK     
            ON THE POLITICIANS. 

919
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:51,386
            WE GOT              
            TO NEGOTIATE.       

920
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:54,889
            WE DON'T LIKE       
            WHAT THEY SAY,      
            WE GO ANOTHER WAY.  

921
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,391
    I WANT TO BE THERE.         

922
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,893
            I WAS HOPING        
            YOU'D BOTH BE THERE.

923
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,328
YEAH, WELL,                     
YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT.           

924
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:03,831
LET ME TELL                     
BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING.          

925
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,834
I KNOW                          
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.              

926
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,335
                AW, JAKE, MAN.  

927
00:42:08,404 --> 00:42:09,704

                HEY, JAKE!

00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:11,839
                JAKE, MAN,      
                COME BACK. JAKE!

929
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,809
                        OH!     

930
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,332
        [TIRES SCREECH]         

931
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,844

00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:52,446
RIGHT THERE.                    

933
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:03,958
YOU WANT SOMETHING,             
BROTHER?                        

934
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:05,793
                YOUR NAME SPYRO?

935
00:43:05,861 --> 00:43:07,962
YEAH. WHY?                      

936
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,965
            I JUST WANTED TO SEE
            WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. 

937
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,968
            RIGHT NOW I'M JUST  
            LOOKING FOR NAMES   
            AND FACES.          

938
00:43:14,036 --> 00:43:15,169
YOU'RE JAKE TREVOR.             

939
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:19,106
MY OLD MAN TOLD ME              
HOW GREAT A FIGHTER             
YOU WAS.                        

940
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:20,607
        YOUR OLD MAN WAS RIGHT. 

941
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:22,109
    I HEARD OF YOU.             

942
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:23,811
    HEARD YOU WERE              
    BACK IN TOWN.               

943
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:24,946
    WHAT FOR?                   

944
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:27,882
                KENNY THOMPSON. 

945
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,383
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.             

946
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:32,086
THAT KID WHO WAS                
AT THE BASKETBALL--             

947
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:33,587
WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST?           

948
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,289
            HE WAS MY SON, MAN. 

949
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:38,525
            WHAT DOES THAT      
            LEAVE YOU, SPYRO?   

950
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,763

00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,365
            YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!

        "YOU A DEAD MAN."       

954
00:43:54,892 --> 00:43:56,327
        YOU SEE ME, MAN?        

955
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,662

        RAP SHIT

     THIS MOTHERFUCKER RAY IS

    I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU       
    FOR COMING HERE

    HOUSE OF WORSHIP

00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:33,814
    TO TRY AND SETTLE MATTERS   

971
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:36,984
    REGARDING THIS SERIOUS      
    AND TRAGIC SITUATION.       

972
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,387
    I'LL BE LEAVING YOU         
    IN THE PRIVACY

                    MR. CASEY.  

978
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:51,999
YOU'RE WELCOME.                 

979
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:56,504
    I'VE KNOWN THE BOOKMANS     
    FOR AS LONG                 
    AS I'VE BEEN HERE.          

980
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:59,607
    I'VE KNOWN LAURIE THOMPSON  
        SINCE SHE WAS,          

981
00:44:59,674 --> 00:45:01,742
        WHAT, THIS HIGH?        

982
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,244
        SPY, DAMIEN--           
        I KNOW YOUR FOLKS.      

983
00:45:04,312 --> 00:45:07,431
    AND THE REST OF YOU,        
    I KNOW YOUR COUSINS,        

984
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,299
        YOUR AUNTS,             
    YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  

985
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:12,319
    SO I'M STANDING             
    IN THE MIDDLE HERE.         

986
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:15,456
    I AM THE MEDIATOR,          
    SO LET'S TALK.              

987
00:45:15,524 --> 00:45:17,458
    LET'S STOP THIS THING.      

988
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:20,461
            IF THE OLD MAN KEEPS
            HIS MOUTH SHUT,     

989
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:21,862
            WE'LL CALL IT DONE. 

990
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,464
        SHORT, SWEET, SIMPLE.   

991
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:25,966
        DONE IS DONE,           
        FACT IS FACT,           

992
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:28,436
        AND GOD'S TRUTH         
        IS THE TRUTH.           

993
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:30,805
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE--         
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.              

994
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,005
WHO SHOT MY FATHER?             

995
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:34,007
            I THOUGHT           
            WE'RE BEING SERIOUS.

996
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:35,960
                    I DON'T WANT
                    NO JOKES.   

997
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,462
    DAMAGE WAS DONE             
    ON BOTH SIDES.              

998
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,215
    MARVIN BOOKMAN              
    DID THE WRONG THING,        

999
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,317
    BUT THE RETALIATION         
    WAS WRONG, TOO.             

1000
00:45:43,384 --> 00:45:44,819
JUST A MINUTE.                  

1001
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:47,487
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T               
DO ANYTHING WRONG.              

1002
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:49,990
THESE ANIMALS                   
KILLED HER SON                  

1003
00:45:50,058 --> 00:45:52,159
IN FRONT OF OUR STORE.          

1004
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:55,546
        HOLD UP.                
        YOU DON'T NOTHIN'       
        ABOUT THAT SHIT, BITCH. 

1005
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:58,482
THAT'S PRETTY TOUGH TALK        

1006
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:03,454
COMING FROM A FAGGOT            
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT SEX         
HIS MOTHER IS.                  

1007
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:05,456
        REVEREND,               
        THIS WASN'T OUR DEAL,   

1008

            WHAT IS             
            YOUR PROBLEM?       

1117
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:38,005
MY PROBLEM IS,                  
YOU'RE IN MY FATHER'S ROOM.     

1118
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:40,073
YOU WANT TO GET OUT?            

1119
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:46,062
    [ANGRY MURMURING]           

1120
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:51,501
    HOLD IT!                    

1121
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:54,003
WE'RE STILL                     
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.            

1122
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:56,306
I WANT YOU                      
TO REMEMBER THAT.               

1123
00:51:56,774 --> 00:51:58,826
I TALKED TO JOHNNY              
AND GRACIE.                     

1124
00:51:58,893 --> 00:52:00,461
YOU KNOW THEM.                  

1125
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:03,997
THEY'RE JUST AS UPSET           
AS YOU ARE.                     

1126
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:06,066
                THEY BROUGHT IT 
                ON THEMSELVES.  

1127
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,068
NO! NO, DON'T SAY THAT.         

1128
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:10,237
THEY DIDN'T BRING IT            
ON THEMSELVES.                  

1129
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:14,157
        WE GOT TO MAKE 'EM GO   
        FOR OUR OWN SAKE!       

1130
00:52:14,225 --> 00:52:18,462
ANNIE, HOW CAN YOU,             
OF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM,        
SAY THAT?                       

1131
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:21,498
YOU LOST TWO SONS               
TO DRIVE-BYS.                   

1132
00:52:21,565 --> 00:52:23,033
    JOHN.                       

1133
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:31,474
MY FAMILY REGRETS THE PROBLEMS  
    THAT YOU'RE HAVING.         

1134
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:33,977
    BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS,    

1135
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:37,981
        TO SURVIVE--            
    IS THAT ALL YOU WANT?       

1136
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:41,718
    YOU WANT EVERYTHING         
    TO BE ALL RIGHT.            

1137
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:44,121
    WELL, EVERYTHING            
    WON'T BE ALL RIGHT          

1138
00:52:44,188 --> 00:52:46,857
    BECAUSE ONCE                
    THE GANGS FIND OUT          

1139
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:49,459
    THAT THEY CAN RUN US OUT,   

1140
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:52,729
    YOUR LIFE IS GOING          
    TO BE A LIVING HELL.        

1141
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,231
            YOU SURE CAN        
            TALK THE TALK.      

1142
00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:00,704
            YOU MEAN YOU WANT US
            TO SHOOT IT OUT     
            WITH THE REBS?      

1143
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:04,440
    MRS. JONES, I'M PROBABLY    
    A VERY LUCKY PERSON         

1144
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:09,046
    BECAUSE I CAN AFFORD        
    TO TAKE MY FAMILY           
    OUT OF HERE.                

1145
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:12,382
    IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,    
    THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.        

1146
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:14,468
    BUT IT'S UP TO YOU          
        TO DECIDE               

1147
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:16,970
    WHETHER YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD'S 
        WORTH FIGHTING FOR.     

1148
00:53:17,038 --> 00:53:18,238
                    HOW WE GONNA
                    DO THAT?    

1149
00:53:18,306 --> 00:53:19,723
                YEAH, TELL US   
                SOMETHING.      

1150
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,458
        LOOK.                   

1151
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:24,461
    THEIR POWER LIES            
    IN THEIR UNITY.             

1152
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,664
    A GANG WORKS TOGETHER       
    AS A TEAM.                  

1153
00:53:27,732 --> 00:53:29,966
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.      

1154
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:32,469
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER        
LIKE A TEAM.                    

1155
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:34,471
IF THEY FIGHT ONE OF US,        

1156
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:36,506
THEY FIGHT ALL OF US.           

1157
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:39,493
    EVERY NOW AND THEN,         

1158
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:41,995
        GOD TESTS US.           

1159
00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:44,998
    NOT IN OUR FAITH IN HIM,    

1160
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:47,000
    BUT IN OUR INNER COURAGE,   

1161
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:50,504
    WHETHER WE'RE WILLING TO PUT
    OUR BODIES ON THE LINE.     

1162
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:53,006
        NOW, I THINK            
    MR. BOOKMAN IS RIGHT,       

1163
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:55,008
        SO I'M WILLING          
        TO FOLLOW HIM.          

1164
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:57,844
        AND I PRAY              
    THAT YOU WILL, TOO.         

1165
00:53:57,912 --> 00:53:59,512
     NOW THE WAR'S ON         

1166
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,949
     I'M TIRED OF WAITIN',     
        LET'S GET IT ON        

1167
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:04,451
         NOW OR LATER,         
    RIGHT NOW THE WAR'S ON     

1168
00:54:04,518 --> 00:54:06,937
     I'M TIRED OF WAITIN',     
        LET'S GET IT ON        

1169
00:54:07,004 --> 00:54:09,440
         NOW OR LATER,         
    RIGHT NOW THE WAR'S ON     

1170
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:12,526
     I'M TIRED OF WAITIN',     
    LET'S GET IT ON...         

1171
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:18,965
LET'S SEE                       
WHAT THESE BITCHES              
GOTTA SAY.                      

1172
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:20,967
        DIABLOS AND RANGERS     
        IN OUR HOUSE?           

1173
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:22,469
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.             

1174
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:24,971
         TO BE EXACT,          
    OR SO THE STORY GOES       

1175
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:26,473
     IF YOU LOOK CLOSER        
        ON THE MAP             

1176
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,475
     THE CHILEANS TAUGHT ME    
    HOW TO BUST MY GAT         

1177
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:29,976
     UNTIL WE FUCKED THE CAR  

1178
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:32,479
         THEY LEFT ME          
    TO TAKE MY EARTH BACK      

1179
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:35,482
     A REVOLUTIONARY ACT SHOULD
        HAVE A CERTAIN TRACK   

1180
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,916
     I'LL FIND THE FACTS      

1181
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:39,486
     NOW WE GOT ILLUMINATI     
    ALL ON OUR BACKS           

1182
00:54:39,553 --> 00:54:41,754
     CHECK TO SEE IF WE DUE    
    PROCESS AND PAY TAX...     

1183
00:54:41,822 --> 00:54:42,756
    SPYRO.                      

1184
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:43,757
                BLOOD.          

1185
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:44,991
HOW YOU DOIN',                  
BROTHER?

1189
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:49,996

1190
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:51,498
WHAT'S UP?                      

1191
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:52,666
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:53,650
        ALL RIGHT.

00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:55,152
HOW YOU DOIN', BRO?             

1194
00:54:58,056 --> 00:54:59,923
        HEARD YOU GOT TROUBLE.  

1195
00:54:59,991 --> 00:55:01,759
EVERYTHING'S COOL.              

1196
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:02,942
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?            

1197
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:05,445
                SHOOTING A KID  
                IN A PHONE BOOTH

1198
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,947
                FOR A FUCKIN'   
                $300 HUSTLE?    

1199
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:10,650
                WAS THAT GOOD   
                FOR BUSINESS?   

1200
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:13,937
    LOOK, THE MEDIA COVERAGE IS 
    SCARING OUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS.

1201
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:16,339
    THEY CUTTING BACK           
    ON THE HIGH-GRADE SHIT.     

1202
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,708
YOU LET THEM KNOW               
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.     

1203
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,711
            YOUR ACTIONS        
            ARE SCARING PEOPLE  
            ON MY STREETS.      

1204
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,281
            WE HAVE PEOPLE      
            WITH FAMILIES THERE.

1205
00:55:24,348 --> 00:55:26,466
WE'RE NOT BEHIND YOU            
ON THIS.                        

1206
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:29,469

ONTO BROADWAY

00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:31,238
AND YOUR ASS                    
WILL PAY.                       

1208
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:32,923
AIN'T NOBODY

1209
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:35,075
WE KNOW                         
WHAT'S GOIN' DOWN.              

1210
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:38,778
            WELL, I HOPE YOU DO,
            LITTLE BROTHER.     

1211
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:44,751

1213
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:53,560
            YOU BETTER          
            WATCH YOURSELF.     

1214
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:57,997
                HA HA HA!       

1215
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,733
                HA HA HA!       

1216
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:04,421
     I'M TIRED OF WAITIN',     
        LET'S GET IT ON        

1217
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,923
         NOW OR LATER,         
    RIGHT NOW THE WAR'S ON     

1218
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:09,793
     I'M TIRED OF WAITIN',     
        LET'S GET IT ON        

1219
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,012
         NOW OR LATER,         
    RIGHT NOW THE WAR'S ON     

1220
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:22,455
[JOHN]                          
O.K., REVEREND,                 
LAY IT OUT FOR US.              

1221
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:25,442
    THE RED IS THE EL DIABLOS,  
        THE REBS ARE GRAY,      

1222
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,944
        AND THE YELLOW          
    IS THE RANGERS' TERRITORY.  

1223
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:30,447
            WHAT'S TO STOP THEM 
            FROM JOINING FORCES?

1224
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:31,948
    THE RANGERS                 
    AND THE DIABLOS?            

1225
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:32,949
    I DON'T THINK SO.           

1226
00:56:33,017 --> 00:56:34,918
            WHAT IF THE REBS    
            THINK THEY ARE?     

1227
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:38,922
            WE GOT TO PIT       
            ALL THREE GANGS     
            AGAINST EACH OTHER. 

1228
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:40,424
            BREAK THE TRUCE.    

1229
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:42,992
            THEN THEY'LL        
            KNOCK EACH OTHER OFF
            FOR US.             

1230
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:44,994
        [REVEREND]              
    WHAT IF THEY CATCH ON?      

1231
00:56:45,063 --> 00:56:48,198
        WILL WE FIGHT           
        ALL THREE GANGS         
        TOGETHER ALONE?         

1232
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:49,966
WAIT A MINUTE.                  

1233
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:51,968
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.             

1234
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:54,971
WE GOT TO GET SOMEBODY          
ON THE INSIDE                   

1235
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,973
THAT CAN SET THEM UP.           

1236
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,375
                THAT'LL WORK.   

1237
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:01,411
AND, REVEREND...                

1238
00:57:01,479 --> 00:57:06,483
WE NEED SOMEBODY                
THAT THE GANGS TRUST.           

1239
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:10,787
            [CREAK]             

1240
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:22,932
                    WHO IS IT?  

1241
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,435
I DON'T KNOW,                   
BUT TAKE THE BACK WAY OUT.      

1242
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,003
            I THINK I BETTER.   

1243
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,961
WHERE DO YOU THINK              
YOU'RE GOING?                   

1244
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:36,462
            GET OFF ME!         

1245
00:57:40,034 --> 00:57:41,467
            NOW SIT DOWN.       

1246
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:43,970
        WHAT'LL WE DO           
        WITH THIS LITTLE PUNK?  

1247
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:45,972
MAYBE WE OUGHT                  
TO JUST KILL HIM.               

1248
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,975
            I WAS THINKING ABOUT
            SHOOTING HIM MYSELF.

1249
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:52,478
WE CAN'T SHOOT HIM              
IN A COMMUNITY REC CENTER.      

1250
00:57:52,547 --> 00:57:56,482
BESIDES, WE GOT TO              
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE               
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.               

1251
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:58,618
    YOU DON'T SCARE ME.         
        I'M A REB.              

1252
00:57:58,686 --> 00:58:00,486
            MAN,                
            YOU AIN'T NO REB.   

1253
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:02,989
            THEY WOULDN'T LET   
            SQUIRTS IN THE REBS.

1254
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:04,958
WE KNOW BECAUSE                 
WE STARTED THEM.                

1255
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:08,094
    YEAH, WHEN THERE WERE       
    STILL DINOSAURS.            

1256
00:58:08,162 --> 00:58:09,262
            YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH.

1257
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:11,264
YOU DON'T KNOW                  
NOTHING, MAN.                   

1258
00:58:11,331 --> 00:58:12,498
                    AND YOU KNOW
                    EVERYTHING. 

1259
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,901
        I KNOW YOU'LL DIE       
    WITH THAT DUMB-ASS PLAN.    

1260
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:17,503
DON'T YOU BE                    
TALKIN' ABOUT                   
NOBODY DYING.                   

1261
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:18,605
JUST TAKE IT EASY.              

1262
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:22,475
SO A LITTLE WAR                 
WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?            

1263
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,510
    I AIN'T GOT NO LOVE         
        FOR ANYONE.             

1264
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,012
    I'M A BUSINESSMAN.          

1265
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,814
    IT'S ALL FAIR.              

1266
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:30,450
            THEN WHY NOT HELP US
            BE MORE FAIR?       

1267
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:33,019
I MIGHT BE INTERESTED           
FOR A PRICE.                    

1268
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,022
        O.K., THEN.             
        HOW ABOUT SOME GUNS,    
        AMMUNITION, EXPLOSIVES, 

1269
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,523
        THAT KIND OF THING?     

1270
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:40,961
    A MAN WHO EARNS             
    WHAT YOU DO                 
    CAN AFFORD THE BEST.        

1271
00:58:41,028 --> 00:58:42,996
        I KNOW WHERE            
    TO GET YOU THE BEST.        

1272
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:44,097
YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM.            

1273
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:45,765
        YES, YOU CAN.           

1274
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,333
        SURE, YOU CAN.          

1275
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:49,469
HE'S GOING                      
TO SELL YOU OUT.                

1276
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,471
        WAIT. NOW JUST          
        HEAR ME OUT.            

1277
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:53,974
    I DID SOMETHING             
    I WISH I HADN'T HAVE.       

1278
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:55,475
    I HEARD THAT COP SAYING     

1279
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:58,812
    HE HAD A LICENSE NUMBER     
    HE GOT FROM YOUR FATHER.    

1280
00:58:58,879 --> 00:59:01,114
        I WAS THE ONE           
    WHO RATTED HIM TO SPYRO.    

1281
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:03,984
            A MINUTE            
    AFTER I OPENED MY MOUTH,    

1282
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:05,485
    I WISH I HADN'T HAVE.       

1283
00:59:05,552 --> 00:59:09,122
    I'M SORRY, MAN.             
    I WANT TO MAKE IT UP.       

1284
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:11,491
            ALL RIGHT. CHILL.   

1285
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:13,493
    STILL GONNA COST YOU,       
        THOUGH.                 

1286
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,496
            WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,
            I CAN AFFORD IT.    

1287
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:19,799
    IT'LL TAKE A FEW HOURS      
    TO SET UP THIS BUY,         

1288
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:22,869
    BUT I'M TALKING 12, 15 Gs,  

1289

        ALL IN HUNDREDS.        

1290
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:27,823
    10% OF THAT STICKS TO ME.   

1291
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:29,926
        MY COMMISSION.          

1292
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:32,428

            YOU GOT A CONTRACT, 

1293
00:59:32,496 --> 00:59:33,997
            AN ENFORCEABLE ONE. 

1294
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:36,532
    IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE.       

1295
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,434
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.             

1296
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:43,506

        WHAT YOU'RE DOING.      

1297
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:51,447
    HE'S GOING TO GO            
    STRAIGHT TO SPYRO.          

1298
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:52,949
                NO, NO.         

1299
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:54,951
            THAT 10% COMMISSION,

1300
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:56,953
            I DON'T THINK SO.   

1301
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,521
                ALL RIGHT?      

1302

    SEE WHERE I HIT             
    THE CHEST AREA?             

1304
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:08,981
        DON'T HIT               
    THE STOMACH AREA.           

1305
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:10,482
    HIT SOMETHING THAT BREAKS,  

1306
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,985
        LIKE THE FACE           
        OR THE RIBS             

1307
01:00:13,053 --> 01:00:15,121
        OR THE KNEECAPS.        

1308
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:17,489
    THIS IS JUST LIKE A GUN.    

1309
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:20,492
    DON'T PULL IT UNLESS        
    YOU'RE GONNA USE IT.        

1310
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,361
        ALL RIGHT.              
        YOU GOT THAT?

ALL THIS, HONEY?                

1316
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:37,443
        I USED TO BE A REBEL,   
        AND I LIKE BASEBALL.

01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:08,007
            YEAH, YOU GOT IT.   

1331
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:09,825
            ALL RIGHT,          
            MRS. HEYWOOD!

            ALL RIGHT!          

1333
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:17,983
I DID NOT KNOW                  
WHAT SPYRO WANTED,              

1334
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:21,120
SO I BROUGHT                    
A TASTE OF EVERYTHING.          

1335
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:30,429
    LOOKS GOOD TO ME.           
    WE'LL TAKE IT ALL.          

1336
01:01:30,497 --> 01:01:33,266
            SPYRO AND DAMIEN,   
            THEY GONNA LOVE

DO THE TALKING.

            YOU DONE GOOD.      

1360
01:02:39,983 --> 01:02:42,918
NOBODY'S GONNA KNOW             
WHO'S BUYING THOSE GUNS.        

1361
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:45,421
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA KNOW         
IT'S YOU KICKIN' THEIR ASS.     

1362
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:46,922
            YOU THINK           
            THEY BOUGHT THAT?   

1363
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,425

            YOU WOULD.

1368
01:02:57,534 --> 01:02:59,435

RAYMOND WANTS TO GO.            

1369
01:02:59,503 --> 01:03:00,936
HE SAID IT'S NICE THERE.

                WHO'S RAYMOND?  

1371
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:02,938
HE WAS MY BROTHER.              

1372
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:04,940
HE WAS A BANGER.                
HE GOT KILLED.                  

1373
01:03:05,008 --> 01:03:07,443
I MEANT WHAT I SAID             
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.              

1374
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:08,944
HE ALWAYS TREATED ME            
DECENT.

                    LITTLE MAN. 

1382
01:03:22,526 --> 01:03:23,959
     WHAT'S THE WORD, MAN?

    CLYDE, COME UP HERE.

    WHAT YOU CAN DO             

1386
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:35,587
    WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE           
    TO SOMEBODY.                

1387
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,907
        YOU CAN STEP            
        ON A FOOT.              

1388
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:39,676
    YOU CAN GOUGE AN EYE.       

1389
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:41,928
    GO FOR IT.                  
    DON'T PULL BACK.            

1390
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:44,931
    OR GO FOR THE TESTICLES     
        AND SQUEEZE.            

1391
01:03:44,998 --> 01:03:46,432
    OH, CLYDE, I'M SORRY.       

1392
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:49,001

    I'M TALKING ABOUT.          

1393
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:51,437
    I DIDN'T MEAN               
    TO HURT YOU, CLYDE.         

1394
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:53,439

        TOMORROW.               

1395
01:03:53,506 --> 01:03:55,241
        EVERYBODY,              
    JUST GO HOME, RELAX--       

1396
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:56,943

    SEE YOU LATER, O.K.?        

1398
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:00,012
    ALL RIGHT, GREAT.           

1399
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:12,441
HELLO, LAURIE.                  

1400
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:14,443
                    JAKE.       

1401
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:16,946
YOU LOOKED PRETTY GOOD          
OVER THERE.                     

1402
01:04:17,014 --> 01:04:19,448
        THANKS. IT'S EVERYTHING 
        YOU TAUGHT ME.          

1403
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:22,952
YOU GOT A LITTLE TIME           
FOR SOME CONVERSATION?          

1404
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:23,953
                YEAH.           

1405
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:25,955
            IT'S LONG OVERDUE.  

1406
01:04:26,023 --> 01:04:27,456
COME ON.                        

1407
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:41,404
        IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD   
        FOR ME,                 

1408
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,407
        ME COMING BACK THIS WAY 
        AND ALL,                

1409
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:45,974
        UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. 

1410
01:04:48,478 --> 01:04:49,412
    YEAH.                       

1411
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:52,415
YOU MISSED A LOT,               
NOT KNOWING KENNY.              

1412
01:04:52,482 --> 01:04:55,435
YOU KNOW, HE WAS                
A LOT LIKE YOU--                

1413
01:04:55,502 --> 01:04:56,436
HEADSTRONG,                     

1414
01:04:56,503 --> 01:04:59,505
FULL OF HIS OWN WAYS            
ABOUT THINGS.                   

1415
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:03,009
BASKETBALL WAS HIS LIFE.        

1416
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:05,445
HE WAS GOING TO BE              
A BIG STAR.                     

1417
01:05:05,512 --> 01:05:08,147
HE HAD A PLAN,                  
JUST LIKE YOU.                  

1418
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:10,450
            I WAS GOING TO BE   
            HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP.  

1419
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:12,751
AND I KNEW                      
YOU COULD DO IT.                

1420
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:15,154
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.            

1421
01:05:15,222 --> 01:05:16,922
        YOU NEVER LET ME KNOW.  

1422
01:05:19,926 --> 01:05:22,895
THAT'S WHY                      
I HAD TO LET YOU GO.            

1423
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:25,465
                LET ME GO?      
                LAURIE...       

1424
01:05:25,532 --> 01:05:26,899
                YOU LET ME GO?  

1425
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:28,334
                COME ON, LAURIE.

1426
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:31,404
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET            
IN THE WAY OF YOUR DREAMS.      

1427
01:05:31,472 --> 01:05:34,240
YOU WOULD'VE NEVER              
FORGIVEN ME FOR IT.             

1428
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:36,409
IT WOULD'VE KILLED              
WHATEVER WE HAD.                

1429
01:05:36,477 --> 01:05:38,411
            THAT'S JUST LIKE ME,
            KILLING THINGS.     

1430
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:41,414
I READ ABOUT THAT.              
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.           

1431
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:43,883
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN             
TO BOXERS.                      

1432
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:46,919
YOU TOOK A CHANCE.              
IT COULD'VE BEEN YOU.           

1433
01:05:46,987 --> 01:05:50,423
        IT WAS NEVER THE SAME   
        AFTER THAT.             

1434
01:05:50,491 --> 01:05:52,425
        I THOUGHT ABOUT         
        A COMEBACK,             

1435
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:54,494
        BUT COME BACK           
        FROM WHAT?              

1436
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:59,432
        I WAS A FAILURE,        
        ALL-AROUND FAILURE.     

1437
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,934
        I FAILED MYSELF,        
        I FAILED YOU.           

1438
01:06:02,002 --> 01:06:04,937
        I COULDN'T EVEN         
        FACE UP TO YOU.         

1439
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:07,673
        ESPECIALLY...           

1440
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:10,943
        AFTER HOW YOU           
        SENT ME AWAY.           

1441
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:12,945
    [SIGHS]                     

1442
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:14,947
KENNY KNEW                      
ALL ABOUT YOU,                  

1443
01:06:15,015 --> 01:06:18,451
AND HE HAD AN ALBUM             
OF ALL YOUR FIGHTS.             

1444
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:20,953
HE KNEW YOU HADN'T              
FORGOTTEN US                    

1445
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:25,458
AND THAT YOU TRIED              
TO SEND US SOME MONEY.          

1446
01:06:25,526 --> 01:06:27,893

STEEL MILL, FAST!               

1758
01:26:45,143 --> 01:26:46,911
THE FACT                        
THAT JOHN BOOKMAN               

1759
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:49,413

HEAVY WEAPONS ON US             

1760
01:26:49,482 --> 01:26:50,748
IS PROOF IN ITSELF              

1761
01:26:50,816 --> 01:26:53,918
THAT HE WAS THE ONE             
THAT RAIDED THE DIABLOS.        

1762
01:26:53,986 --> 01:26:55,252

ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?         

1764
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:03,194
            NOBODY HAD ROOM     
            FOR ME IN THE CAR.  

1765
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,997

01:27:06,064 --> 01:27:07,298
                I DON'T KNOW.   

1767
01:27:07,366 --> 01:27:10,234
    THEY YELLED SOMETHING ABOUT 
    GOING TO THE OLD STEEL MILL.

1768
01:27:10,302 --> 01:27:11,936

        FIVE YEARS.             

1771
01:27:14,673 --> 01:27:17,375

        MEET US AT THE MILL.    

1772

ALL OF HIS LIFE.                

1777
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,455
THERE SHOULD HAVE               
NEVER BEEN TROUBLE              
BETWEEN US.                     

1778
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:50,158
        THINGS AIN'T NEVER GOING
        TO BE LIKE THEY WERE.   

1779
01:27:50,226 --> 01:27:52,193
                WE GOT TO GET

I WAS THINKING ABOUT.
