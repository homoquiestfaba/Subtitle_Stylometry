1
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:12,728
Gentlemen, eyes to the front!

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,995
Pick your targets.

3
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:18,128
Private, my new tunic.

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,828
Gentlemen, prepare for war.

5
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,728
Stand at ready!

6
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:25,694
And...

7
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:26,195
Charge!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,128
Charge!

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,761
Oh, yeah. Give it to her. Yeah.

10
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,127
Oh, I love it.

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:36,094
Timeout. Reload!

12
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,861
All right, girls. Take 10.

13
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:28,993
Hmm.

14
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:33,058
Heh!

15
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,726
I did everything

16
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,559
back in the seventies.

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,392
And then I did it again
in the eighties,

18
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:41,525
just to make sure I still could.

19
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:43,826
I mean, after all
that coke, right?

20
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:46,692
What do you mean? Like, orgies?

21
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,458
You kidding me?

22
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,125
Back in the day,

23
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:56,059
I lived with five,
six models at a time.

24
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,858
And the sex.

25
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,000
What can I say?

26
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,558
What can I say?

27
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,025
I was born in the era
of free love.

28
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,992
Let freedom ring.

29
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,824
You know what Tony Curtis
once said to me?

30
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:18,957
He said, "I dove into the swimming
pool at the ambassador hotel.

31
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,924
When I got out,
it was 30 years later."

32
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:24,390
Live for today, my friend,

33
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,825
'cause tomorrow,
you're gonna get fucked.

Mr. ward.

44
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,923
What were you thinking?

45
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,555
Hello.

46
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,822
Hey. Is this
wade ward photography?

47
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:25,788
Yeah, that's me.

48
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,722
I want to hire you for a job.

49
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:28,788
Okay. Tomorrow.

50
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,656
Great.

51
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:00,000
Hello.

52
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,554
Hello.

53
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,921
Hello?

54
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,687
Photographer.

55
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,453
All right, I want--
Come on. Turn around.

56
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,720
Turn around again.

57
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,519
This time, you're running away.

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,999
Running away. It's cheesy.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,187
Running away. It's cheesy.

60
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,919
All right, that's it. That's it.

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Now come on. I need you in the light.
Move over here.

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,919
Attagirl. Hold it.

63
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,885
All right. Now slip
down ever so slowly.

64
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:41,785
Attagirl. Attagirl.

65
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,386
There you go. All right.

66
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:46,553
Give me some-- give me
some baby pink now.

67
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,752
Ah, beautiful.

68
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:52,919
All right, now.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,518
Both fingers, darling.

70
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,519
That's it. Hold it right there.

71
00:04:57,952 --> 00:04:59,186
Hold it.

72
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:01,819
All right, reload.

73
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:04,884
Socko, what the hell
are you looking at?

74
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,452
Reload my camera.

75
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,452
All right.

76
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:09,285
All right, girls, take 10.

77
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,785
Courtney, no smoking.

78
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,318
I don't want
to be cleaning the red

79
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,152
out of your eyes
for the next hour.

80
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,517
Are you the photographer?

81
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,451
Uh, yeah.

82
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:21,784
Wade ward.

83
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:22,784
What was that?

84
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:23,751
Wade ward.

85
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,451
Wade ward. I like that.

86
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,651
Kind of sounds like a superhero.

87
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:29,999
Wade ward.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,218
Wade ward.

89
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,351
Stewart fox.

90
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:33,651
Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:35,717
Nice to meet you, too.

92
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:36,717
What?

93
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,883
Oh.

94
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:42,783
You weren't expecting to see all
the tits and ass, were you?

95
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,817
Hmm? Hmm?

96
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,117
No.

97
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,883
All right, get out of here,

98
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,450
You harlots!

99
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,883
I want to speak to this
young man in private.

100
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,150
Great.

101
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,516
You like what you see, wade?

102
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,249
Make yourself at home, wade.

103
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,999
Would you care for a mai
tai or a glass of wine

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,283
would you care for a mai
tai or a glass of wine

105
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,417
or--or perhaps a snort of coke?

106
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,450
Let me over!

107
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,582
Asshole!

108
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,382
So what's your story, kid?

109
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,248
I'm a photographer from L.A.,

110
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,749
grew up in old Hollywood.

111
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,782
L.A., huh? Yeah.

112
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,182
Cool.

113
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,515
Me, I was born in a
shithole in Brooklyn,

114
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,682
got the fuck out and hitched
out here when I was 17,

115
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:30,000
you know? Sunset strip.

116
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,148
You know? Sunset strip.

117
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,582
Surf's up, baby.

118
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,349
Yeah.

119
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,648
You surf?

120
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:37,681
No. What?

121
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,349
An L.A. kid who doesn't surf?

122
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,315
Heh. What's the matter, kid?

123
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,282
You never got enraptured
by the beach boys?

124
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,082
'Cause I know
I sure as fuck did.

125
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,382
Hey.

126
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,614
Well, wade,

127
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,815
what I'm looking for
is a photographer

128
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,748
who can shoot some
behind-the-scene photographs

129
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,481
for me for my book,

130
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,999
"the world's greatest
erotic photographer ever."

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,514
"The world's greatest
erotic photographer ever."

132
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,414
Nice. Okay.

133
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,448
What?

134
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,348
Did you think you were gonna
be shooting a family portrait?

135
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,513
No. No. I just--yeah.

136
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,214
I don't know. I'm sorry, man.

137
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,147
My head's just
all over the place.

138
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,380
Um, I can do that.

139
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,047
You're a good
photographer, right?

140
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:18,313
Mm-hmm.

141
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,114
Well, if you're a photographer,

142
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,447
then I'm sure you're familiar
with both my name and my work.

143
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:25,246
Heh. Man, I'm sorry.
I gotta be honest.

144
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,481
Before I came in here,
I had no idea who you were.

145
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,999
Honest. I like that.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,180
Honest. I like that.

147
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,448
Let me show you something, kid.

148
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:41,147
Here you go.
Take a look at these.

149
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:43,213
Go on.

150
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:45,280
There's a lot of money
to be made

151
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,379
in erotic photography. Nice.

152
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,180
And I am the world's

153
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,512
most published
erotic photographer.

154
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,980
That's why Donna came up
with the idea for the book.

155
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:54,446
How old are you, wade?

156
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:55,412
Uh, 21.

157
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,746
21. Great age.

158
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:59,999
Echo, Courtney, this is wade.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,246
Echo, Courtney, this is wade.

160
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,245
He's gonna be working
with us for a few shoots.

161
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,379
Nice. He's cute. Hi.

162
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,546
Yeah, well, don't suck the life

163
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:06,245
out of him yet, darling.

164
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:07,346
We need him.

165
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:09,145
Well, if everybody's all right,

166
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,212
let's just get started.

167
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:12,379
All right.

168
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,244
Here you are, wade.

169
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,545
What's this?

170
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:23,645
It's some lube.

171
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:25,944
It makes it all
so much more inviting.

172
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:27,278
Well, why don't they do it? Eww.

173
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,111
Because they get
their hands sticky.

174
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:29,999
I thought that I was just
shooting pictures for your book.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,345
I thought that I was just
shooting pictures for your book.

176
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,144
You are shooting
pictures for my book,

177
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,610
but first you oil the harlot.

178
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:38,345
I'm a photographer.
I take pictures, okay?

179
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,544
I don't--that's it.

180
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,211
Come on, wade. It's easy.

181
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:44,111
You take a q-tip,
you dip it in the lube,

182
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:46,178
and you apply it to the cooze.

183
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,944
And we never
double-dip the cooze.

184
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,610
Heh. We never
double-dip the cooze.

185
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,011
I don't like "cooze." Why?

186
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,011
Call it a yammy.

187
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:53,577
Call it a yammy.

188
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:54,911
Yammy, yammy, yammy.

189
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,210
Ooh, yammy, yammy, yammy.

190
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:58,243
I tell you what.
Henceforth and forever,

191
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,999
I shall call it a yammy.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,011
I shall call it a yammy.

193
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:03,910
Wade, would you be so kind
as to apply the lube

194
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,943
to echo's yummy yammy?

195
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,943
Come on, lube monkey.
I need lube.

196
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:08,977
The lube monkey! Come on, wade.

197
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,243
I can't work like this.

198
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:13,676
I hereby dub you knight,
herr wade.

199
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,343
Just get in there,
and slap it on, buddy.

200
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:18,543
Well, why don't you have
your assistant do it?

201
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,509
Oh, you don't think he
would jump at the chance?

202
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,543
I'd rather be shooting pictures.

203
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:24,076
Do I have to do
everything myself?

204
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:25,176
Give me that.

205
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,609
All right. That's it, baby.

206
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,610
Mmm.

207
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,000
There. That ought to do it.

208
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,610
There. That ought to do it.

209
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,042
I'm the king. All right?

210
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,009
Now, whatever
the king says goes.

211
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,109
That's the price you pay
for the gig, you know?

212
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,209
Yeah.

213
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,475
So, how long do I
have to cooze yammies

214
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:48,076
before I can take some pictures?

215
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,108
Hmm.

216
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,909
You really are a trip, wade.

217
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,075
Listen, you don't
cooze yammies, okay?

218
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,475
Yammy is a cooze. Wh--

219
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,941
I want you to forget
all that shit, all right?

220
00:09:58,942 --> 00:09:59,999
You're gonna get
your chance to shoot,

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,309
you're gonna get
your chance to shoot,

222
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,276
but you're gonna
have to be patient.

223
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,575
I like that picture over there.

224
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,274
You know, I'm actually working
on a series of--of photos myself

225
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,574
with the precept of--of
godlessness versus illumination

226
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,975
and them coming together.

227
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,541
That's a great picture.

228
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:24,940
Who took that picture?

229
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,407
I did.

230
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,999
Wait a second.
You took that picture?

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,175
Wait a second.
You took that picture?

232
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,074
Screw you, kid,

233
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,907
and all your
artsy-fartsy bullshit.

234
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,307
Let me tell you something.

235
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,274
I earned my bones the hard way,

236
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,075
and so will you,
if you ever get 'em.

237
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:07,340
I worked for five years
for "wanker" magazine,

238
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:10,772
for that prick Saul goldspan.

239
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,339
All right? I did everything,

240
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,039
and I'm talking about
I drove his car,

241
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,906
I was a gofer, a bodyguard,

242
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,839
a drug absconder, you name it,

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,806
before I got to shoot
one fucking picture,

244
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,938
so I don't want to hear any of
your fucking complaints, kid.

245
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,005
What's this? Hmm?

246
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,772
This was in our bedroom.

247
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,999
This filthy, wet,
germ-ridden towel

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,173
this filthy, wet,
germ-ridden towel

249
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:34,005
was strewn across my
500-thread-count pillowcase.

250
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:36,038
Welcome to my world, wade.

251
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,305
Wade, this is Donna.

252
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,339
Donna, this is wade,
the photographer.

253
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,272
He thinks he's
Andy fucking warhol.

254
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:43,871
Well, that's great.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

255
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,138
Nice to meet you.

256
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,038
What do you think
of all of this?

257
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,137
Uh, it's, uh--
It's interesting.

258
00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:49,938
I've been
showing wade the ropes.

259
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,371
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you have.

260
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,071
Has he got you
cleaning toilets yet?

261
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,037
Not yet, but close.
You stand up to him.

262
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,005
He's a softy at heart
when he's not drinking.

263
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,999
Anyway, I'm gonna give
you my email address.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,004
Anyway, I'm gonna give
you my email address.

265
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,971
Send me everything
that you shoot.

266
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,770
I want you to shoot him
with all the models.

267
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:09,770
And, stew, you shoot in the
master bedroom again, babe,

268
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,737
and I'm gonna
cut off your balls.

269
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,705
Whiner, party of one,
your table is ready.

270
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,304
Welcome to showbiz, kid.

271
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,737
Ah, wade,
you don't lube yammies.

272
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:26,070
How do you feel
about answering doors?

273
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,403
Hmm?

274
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,999
Oh. Well, then, I'll go
answer the door, then.

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,438
Oh. Well, then, I'll go
answer the door, then.

276
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,237
At last a member of the kingdom.

277
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:42,003
Hi.

278
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,236
Um, I'm Heather.

279
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:46,736
I mean, uh, queenie.

280
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,402
Yeah, the seal must have broke.

281
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,003
I can see that.

282
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,136
Oh!

283
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,868
Um--
I'm sorry!

284
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:55,935
I'm wade.

285
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:59,669
Hi. Um, I'm here
for Stewart fox.

286
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah?

287
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:00,835
Yeah?

288
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,069
Um, um,

289
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,402
I'm shooting with him tomorrow.

290
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,235
I'm here for some test shots.

291
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:08,135
Follow me. Um...

292
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,902
I like your name, queenie.

293
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:12,935
Thanks, um, wade.

294
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,069
I love you, Courtney.

295
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,035
Heh. Thank you.

296
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:16,301
And, echo,

297
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:19,201
I couldn't even begin
to focus my camera

298
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,903
without those
blue eyes, darling.

299
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,635
Hi.

300
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,968
Ah, you must be queenie.

301
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,168
Look at you.
You're such an angel.

302
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:29,999
Queenie, this is
Courtney and echo,

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,201
queenie, this is
Courtney and echo,

304
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,634
major adult-film stars.

305
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:33,834
Hi. Hi. Hi.

306
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:36,901
Major. I see you've met wade.

307
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,001
What's this?

308
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,268
Somebody return their champagne?

309
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,001
It says, "no, thanks."

310
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,867
Ah, it must be that crazy
woman from across the street.

311
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,133
You know, she digs holes
all through the night.

312
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,667
Probably burying a body
or something.

313
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, and the seal was broke.
I didn't open it.

314
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,901
Well, waste not,
want not, I say.

315
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:52,900
Yeah, pass it.

316
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,267
Courtney, germs.

317
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,600
Socko!

318
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,800
Get us some champagne glasses!

319
00:13:58,801 --> 00:13:59,999
I believe I'll test it first.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,368
I believe I'll test it first.

321
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,000
Mmm. That's good. That's good.

322
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,600
This is the way to start a day.

323
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,133
Probably burying
a body or something.

324
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:27,567
"The world's greatest
erotic photographer..."

325
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:29,999
"Ever."

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,600
"Ever."

327
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,266
That stuff is disgusting.

328
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:40,832
All right, mount up,
you dirty bitches.

329
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,265
We're not done here yet.

330
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:45,131
We're gonna do a bunch
of blow-job shots

331
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:46,598
with Courtney and a strap-on.

332
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,799
Blow jobs, really? Again?

333
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,098
What's your problem, Courtney?

334
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,598
Nothing, but are we
taking photos,

335
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,065
or are we putting on
a fucking show?

336
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,732
What the hell's the difference?

337
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,165
What is this, "mutiny
on the fucking Booty?"

338
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,965
Get on the set. Hey, Stewart.

339
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,731
Why don't I take some test shots

340
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,898
of queenie in the other room?

341
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah, that's a good idea, wade.

342
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,698
Ah, that's a good idea, wade.

343
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,864
Why don't you take some test shots
of queenie in the other room?

344
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,065
Use the polaroid,
and shoot in the kitchen.

345
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,231
It's all right.
I got my digital.

346
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:12,131
Well, if everyone's done
bitching and moaning,

347
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:13,698
can we get started?

348
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,597
Echo, would you be so kind
as to get on your knees

349
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,031
and mystify the planet?

350
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,197
Oh.

351
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,863
I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

352
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,997
Who cares, right?

353
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,565
Go over to that window.

354
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,763
Yeah.

355
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,697
Are you nervous?

356
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,697
No, I'm ready.

357
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,664
All right.

358
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,229
Mm-hmm. There we go. Perfect.

359
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,229
No, I wasn't even
smiling for that one.

360
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,697
No, that was the best one.
Trust me.

361
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,730
And relax.

362
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:55,963
There you go.

363
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:58,563
Turn your face into the
light a little bit.

364
00:15:58,564 --> 00:15:59,629
Just a little bit.

365
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, right there.

366
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,562
Yeah, right there.

367
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,596
Okay.

368
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,462
Nice.

369
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:08,730
Now get on that bed right there.

370
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,195
And don't smile for this one.

371
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,562
Why? Am I messing it up?

372
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:25,463
No, you look gorgeous.

373
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,962
Wade!

374
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:29,999
I gotta go.

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,529
I gotta go.

376
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,962
Okay. Wade!

377
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,795
Um, you know what? It's
my first and last day,

378
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,761
so I don't know if I'm
gonna see you again.

379
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,028
Okay.

380
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,229
Uh, bye.

381
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,428
Um, it was nice
to meet you, though.

382
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:45,062
Good luck.

383
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:46,929
Thanks.

Wade, you want a beer?

388

Yeah.

389
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,827
So what's the deal
with the champagne?

390
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,794
Well, Donna and I throw a
party every now and then.

391
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:14,860
You know, it smoothes out
with the neighbors.

392
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,460
Oh, yeah? Cool party?

393
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,628
Cut the small talk, kid.

394
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,694
Wow. She looks good there.

395
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,926
Yeah, she's beautiful.

396
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,859
Yeah, we'll see
how she does tomorrow.

397
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,693
Hey, wade. Hmm?

398
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,999
You remember when Donna said not
to film in the master bedroom?

399
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,960
You remember when Donna said not
to film in the master bedroom?

400
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,659
You know? So when I say

401
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,926
film in the kitchen,
you do that, okay?

402
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:35,893
All right. Yeah?

403
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,126
Your work looks promising.

404
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,859
Thanks. Hey, socko!

405
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,726
Get the vacuum,

406
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,693
and clean out the master bedroom
before Donna gets home!

407
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:48,793
I trust no other cleanup
will be necessary.

408
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,426
No, no, no, no, no.
No. It's all good.

409
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,659
Really? Yeah? Yeah.

410
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,858
How you like being
in the porn business?

411
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,725
I'm not in the porn business.

412
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:59,925
I'm just taking pictures of
a guy in the porn business.

413
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah? I used to be you.

414
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,558
Yeah? I used to be you.

415
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,825
Oh, yeah?

416
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:05,491
Yeah. Heh.

417
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,726
You need some money?

418
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:08,959
Nah, I'm good.

419
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,125
Heh.

420
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,491
I'm gonna enjoy
corrupting you, wade.

421
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,592
We'll see.

422
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,925
Well...

423
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,658
Have a good night, maestro.

424
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,658
Maestro?

425
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:22,791
I like that.

426
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,325
That's a sign of respect.

427
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,492
All right, then.

428
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,791
Hey. It was nice to meet you.

429
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,757
Yeah. Hey...

430
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:43,791
You want to smoke some weed?

431
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,457
Sure.

432
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,525
Cool.

433
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,457
Yeah, I've only had

434
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,057
maybe three real boyfriends
in my whole life.

435
00:18:59,058 --> 00:18:59,999
I've only had a couple
serious girlfriends.

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
I've only had a couple
serious girlfriends.

437
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,456
But I've never even
really been out,

438
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:08,890
like, on a traditional,
like, date. Heh.

439
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:11,623
Dates are overrated.

440
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:12,589
Mm-hmm.

441
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,657
Traditional ones, anyway.

442
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,790
My ex-boyfriend and I...

443
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,922
We never even made out,
like, for real,

444
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:26,289
unless it was on film.

445
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,523
Heh.

446
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,523
Fuck.

447
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:30,000
I wonder how long
that guy's been there.

448
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,655
I wonder how long
that guy's been there.

449
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,755
Is he always around here?
I don't know.

450
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,588
Do something with that.
Yeah, he's around here a lot.

451
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,423
Relax. You relax.

452
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,355
Put that in there.

453
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,790
Just relax. I'll walk
you to your car.

454
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,455
How you doing?

455
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,888
Good. Hi. Good.

456
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:54,688
Is there a problem?

457
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:55,854
We're just heading home.

458
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,654
No. No, no problem.

459
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,255
Nice night, though, right?

460
00:19:59,256 --> 00:19:59,999
Yeah. Just got off work.
Just going home.

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,221
Yeah. Just got off work.
Just going home.

462
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,888
Oh, really? What do
you do for a living?

463
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,554
Model, like, actress.

464
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:07,754
Model-actress.

465
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:10,387
Yeah. I'm actually
kind of famous.

466
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,754
You're famous? Wow.

467
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:12,888
Really? Heh.

468
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,454
I'm wade, by the way.

469
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:15,421
Wade. Yeah.

470
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,754
Right. I'm Christian.

471
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,721
I mean, th's my name, not the...

472
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:21,387
Christian, the cop.

473
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,454
Ah. Pays to advertise, right?

474
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,421
I'm Courtney.

475
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,220
Courtney. Is that with a "c"?

476
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,820
C-o-u-r-t.

477
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,999
I like it. Thanks.

478
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,787
I like it. Thanks.

479
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:33,620
Mm. A model. Yeah.

480
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,753
Wow. Don't meet many models.

481
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,753
Yeah. What's up with that, eh?

482
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,253
I don't see very many cops.

483
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,853
Well, that's a good thing.

484
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:41,820
Yeah. Good girl.

485
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,453
Well, I'm gonna head home.

486
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:45,219
You guys have a--
Have good night.

487
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,219
It was nice to meet you.
Okay, wade.

488
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,286
Good to meet you. Bye, wade.

489
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,354
Take care.

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,750

and I don't do freebies.

498
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,249

Hey, wait a second.

502
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,282
I want to talk to you.

503
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:59,999
Because I'm not gonna work for
that kind of money, shylock!

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,615
Because I'm not gonna work for
that kind of money, shylock!

505
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:03,715
Why? Because that's the
money I made in 1978, dude.

506
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,581
Stew, I gotta go.

507
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:07,182
Where you going?

508
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,348
Just running some errands.

509
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,615
Oh, errands. Great.

510
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:13,381
Look, I've wasted enough time
on this phone call today.

511
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:15,181
You call me back when you have

512
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:16,142
the right-sized envelope.

513
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:20,315
Good morning, my liege.

514
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,448
So glad you could make it.

515
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:25,081
Hey, wade. I loved the
photos you emailed me.

516
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,714
You've got an amazing
eye for composition.

517
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:27,714
Oh, thank you.

518
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:29,447
You know what?

519
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:29,999
You could learn something
from this kid, big boy.

520
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,580
You could learn something
from this kid, big boy.

521
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,014
Ah, thank you, nut
grinder extraordinaire.

522
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,014
Hey, he's the maestro,

523
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,647
not me. Ah.

524
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,480
Brownnosing will
get you everywhere, wade.

525
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,781
So, um, listen, the other
day, you offered me

526
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:44,714
some cash up front for the
job I'm doing for you.

527
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,314
And I recall you turned me down.

528
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,414
Guilty.

529
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,414
But listen, um,
I kinda changed my mind,

530
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,480
so if that's cool with you...

531
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,180
That's good. Why don't you come
see me at the end of the day?

532
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:56,247
You ready to shoot today?

533
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,380
Absolutely.
All right. Get ready.

534
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,180
All right. I'll see you on set.

535
00:23:59,181 --> 00:23:59,999
All right.

536
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,147
All right.

537
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,714
Socko, get the fucking door!

538
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,680
Hi!

539
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,314
Hi. Heh.

540
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:15,479
Hello, my petite wonder.

541
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,046
I think I'm gonna go run
those errands later on.

542
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,279
Mm-hmm. Ria. Yes, sir?

543
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,513
Run queenie through the works.

544
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:24,546
I expect to be shooting
in 20 minutes.

545
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,679
What now?

546
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,012
Let's go, your majesty. Hello.

547
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:29,712
Heh. You gotta be kidding me.

548
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:30,000
I would never go to cabo
with you, asshole.

549
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,446
I would never go to cabo
with you, asshole.

550
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,413
Hey, socko!

551
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,344
Lovey?

552
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,678
Lovey? Here, kitty, kitty...

553
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,445
Kitty. Oh.

554
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,611
You're not lovey.

555
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:24,210
No.

556
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:25,910
It's your nephew, Chris.

557
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:29,010
I know that, silly.

558
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:29,999
I love it when you
come to see me.

559
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,077
I love it when you
come to see me.

560
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:35,443
Just stopped by to, uh--

561
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,977
To bring some groceries,
uh, aunt Gloria.

562
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,376
Thank you, sweetheart.

563
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:45,643
So you, uh, got your good
cologne on again today,

564
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,009
<i>eau de</i> vermouth.

565
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,043
Shucks.

566
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:51,276
You know, you gotta
be careful, Gloria.

567
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:53,009
You get in your car,

568
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,876
get in an accident or,
worse, kill somebody,

569
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:57,509
it's--it's just bad.

570
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,999
Well, that's just silly.

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,909
Well, that's just silly.

572
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,342
Yeah. I suppose it is,

573
00:26:03,343 --> 00:26:06,342
since you never
leave this house.

574
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:09,475
Hey, let me make you
some tea and cookies.

575
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:11,542
That's okay. Gloria, I--
No, no.

576
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:13,942
I--I made some sugar cookies

577
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,242
just for you. See--

578
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:18,543
Aw, shit.

579
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,042
Oh.

580
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:24,875
They're not sugar cookies.

581
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,042
They're brownies.

582
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,908
Hmm.

583
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:29,999
You like brownies, huh?

584
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,442
You like brownies, huh?

585
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:33,408
Yeah, I like brownies.

586
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,975
Okay. Let me just...

587
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:37,141
Let me help.

588
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,508
Pick these up and--
No, I'll do it.

589
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,274
It's all right. I--I really
do have to go, aunt Gloria.

590
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,541
No, don't go. Let me fix you

591
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:48,974
a cup of nice, hot tea
and brownies and--

592
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,840
Okay? Don't--don't go.

593
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:56,008
Okay. I'll--
I'll stay for one cup.

594
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:59,999
Shut that fucking dog up, socko!

595
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,240
Shut that fucking dog up, socko!

596
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:10,307
Oh, eat my crusty shorts,
faggot.

597
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:13,307
I am famous for my skin tones.

598
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:14,307
Nervous?

599
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:15,807
Why? 'Cause I'm smoking?

600
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:17,273
Hey, man, six months ago,

601
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:20,340
you asked for pissing!
It's urination, Ronnie!

602
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:22,373
Nah, 'cause you're
biting your lip.

603
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,940
Goddamn, scum-sucking,
fucking neanderthal!

604
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:27,206
Fun? Yeah.

605
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,140
Donna, I haven't had fun
since I snuck in

606
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:29,999
to Woodstock when I was 14.
Oh, god.

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,940
To Woodstock when I was 14.
Oh, god.

608
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,140
Somebody's gotta pay

609
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,873
for the house that porn built!

610
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:36,073
If I don't give 'em what
they want, I don't get paid.

611
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,272
How 'bout this one, wade, huh?

612
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:39,506
The fox family locked
in connubial bliss.

613
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:40,806
Stewart, you asshole!

614
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,873
I am the king of assholes!

615
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:44,939
You used to love what you did,
and so did everybody else.

616
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,506
Yeah, and what the hell
do you want from me?

617
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,139
This is my life
or what's left of it.

618
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,205
What? Oh. You want detachment.

619
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,139
Well, how's this for detachment,

620
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,972
you pretentious cocksucker?

621
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:58,072
Yes. All right.

622
00:27:58,073 --> 00:27:59,999
Now give me just
a little bit more.

623
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,206
Now give me just
a little bit more.

624
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:03,405
That's it, honey. That's it.

625
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:04,939
Yes. All right.

626
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,271
Now give me a little more.

627
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:09,905
You want more of this?

628
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:11,305
That's why I'm here, baby.

629
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:14,438
Gotta take care of you.
It's your virgin shoot.

630
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,039
Oh, I'm a virgin?

631
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,971
You know who you
remind me of, queenie?

632
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:22,204
Who?

633
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:23,872
You remind me
of my future ex-wife.

634
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:26,971
Ria. Yeah?

635
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,104
Could you get in there

636
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,772
and straighten out
her makeup, honey?

637
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,237
Okay. Done. Done.

638
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,270
All right, sweetheart.

639
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:39,170
I want you to concentrate, okay?

640
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:40,804
I'm trying.

641
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,804
Try harder, okay?

642
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,170
Roll over.

643
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:46,137
"Roll over."

644
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,004
Am I a model or a terrier?

645
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,137
Are you leaving?

646
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:52,170
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:54,103
I think I've, uh, seen enough.

648
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:55,670
You sure you don't
want to stick around?

649
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,670
Maybe we could have dinner
together for a change.

650
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,369
No. No, no, no.
I've got things to do,

651
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,999
and if I go,
you can concentrate.

652
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,103
And if I go,
you can concentrate.

653
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:03,137
All right.

654
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,270
I know.

655
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:17,002
I smell the blood...

656
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,436
Of a wirgin.

657
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,802
Heh heh.

658
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:21,969
There you go.

659
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,303
Am I doing good? Uh-huh.

660
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:26,403
That didn't sound
very convincing.

661
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,336
All right.

662
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,136
Just spread your legs

663
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:29,999
just a little bit. Huh.

664
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,369
Just a little bit. Huh.

665
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:37,269
Okay.

666
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,836
Wider.

667
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:44,336
Wider.

668
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,968
So, uh, where you staying?

669
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,202
In a hotel.

670
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,868
So, you ever do any films?

671
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,735
No. Heh.

672
00:29:59,236 --> 00:29:59,999
What hotel?

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,367
What hotel?

674
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:03,968
Look, I would never do a porno.

675
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,968
I'm not a whore. I--I know.

676
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:08,768
I'm just saying,
you know every photographer

677
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:10,901
is gonna try to get you
to do something different,

678
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:12,334
you know, something you
haven't done before.

679
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,634
Oh, really? Yeah.

680
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,167
You know, first it's fingers.

681
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:16,167
Then it's toys.

682
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:17,301
Then it's girls and boys.

683
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,100
Then, you know,
next thing you know,

684
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,867
you got a saddle on
and a harness,

685
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,967
and you're fucking a dog.

686
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,201
Whoa, bro. I didn't
sign a release for that.

687
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:29,999
That's it. That's it.

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's it. That's it.

689
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,566
Am I doing this thing right?

690
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,967
Absolutely, but I need
a little penetration.

691
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,967
Two fingers, all right?

692
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,966
I don't do two fingers.

693
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:41,801
Oh, come on. Just a little, hmm?

694
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,700
Come on.

695
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,799
All right. How much?

696
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,199
This much. Hmm?

697
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,267
I'm just kidding.

698
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:51,966
You know what I don't need?

699
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,233
I don't need your fat butt

700
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:54,966
telling me to stick
my fingers in my coochie!

701
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:55,966
I'm going to the bathroom.

702
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,133
Come on, come on, come on.

703
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:59,632
Where the hell are you going?

704
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:00,000
You're so photographable
like this. Heh.

705
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,134
You're so photographable
like this. Heh.

706
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,733
Oh, this is insane.

707
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,232
Socko, I need you to give
this girl a ride home.

708
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,932
I don't think things
are gonna work out.

709
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:20,898
Sure. Okay.

710
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:22,065
I can do it.

711
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,066
You sure? Yeah.

712
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:29,999
Sorry.

713
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,531
Sorry.

714
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,831
Uh...

715
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:35,831
Ah.

716
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:37,599
Thanks.

717
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:51,898
So do you want
to get some dinner?

718
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:56,231
Or maybe a drink?

719
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:57,531
I don't know.

720
00:31:59,498 --> 00:31:59,999
Yeah. Um, cool.

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,264
Yeah. Um, cool.

722
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,031
Okay.

What the fuck?

910
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,679
I know what you're doing,
you little fuck.

911
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,579
You've been jerking off while
everybody else is out here

912
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,999
trying to make something decent
out of this fucking shit.

913
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,712
Trying to make something decent
out of this fucking shit.

914
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:03,279
Stew! Stop with this crazy--

915
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,178
Get the fuck out
of here right now,

916
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,945
you little fucking shit!

917
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:10,345
Why are you doing this?

918
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:12,545
You are acting like a crazy man!

919
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:15,544
Look, I run my ship
the way I want to, Donna.

920
00:41:15,545 --> 00:41:17,412
Nobody touches one of my
girls inappropriately.

921
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:19,078
That is not the point.

922
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,411
You are scaring everybody
with these crazy tirades!

923
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,012
Who the fuck am
I scaring, Donna? Huh?

924
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,211
Wade, you scared? Huh?

925
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:27,111
Right. Like--
All right, that--

926
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:29,044
That's it! Shoot's canceled!

927
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:29,999
Right. Well, I am out of here!

928
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,344
Right. Well, I am out of here!

929
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:33,646
Fine. <i>Sayonara,</i> bitch.
What else is new?

930
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,378
Shoot's canceled,

931
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:49,245
but if you'd like, um,
you could stay for a swim.

932
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,644
Hey, it's wade.

933
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,176
Um, I wish that I could take
you away from all this stuff.

934
00:41:58,177 --> 00:41:59,977
He's a bit of a scumbag,

935
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:00,000
and, uh--and I'm definitely
not leaving this message,

936
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,443
and, uh--and I'm definitely
not leaving this message,

937
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:05,877
because that's
fucking god-awful.

938
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:12,111
Hey, it's wade. Give me a call.

Hi.

944
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:07,806
Um...

945
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,306
Oh, thanks.

946
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:13,039
Yeah, that's what
I was looking for.

947
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,172
Sorry. I was sleeping.

948
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,039
Yeah, I can tell.
Go back to bed.

949
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,172
No, um, you can come in. Yeah?

950
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:22,972
I was just gonna get up
and smoke a bowl anyway.

951
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:23,972
Okay. Come on.

952
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:25,239
You sure? Mm-hmm.

953
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:28,206
All right.

954
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:29,999
I can't believe that
you travel with a bong.

955
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,171
I can't believe that
you travel with a bong.

956
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,105
That's hilarious.

957
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:33,305
Now you gotta hit it. No.

958
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:34,472
It's going already.
You gotta go.

959
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:35,472
What? You can't let it stop.

960
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:37,704
Do it.

961
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:39,372
Go! Take it.

962
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,905
Go! Go! Go! Come on.

963
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:43,238
You're out of your mind.

964
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,471
You can do it.

965
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:45,339
Be strong.

966
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:55,705
Oh!

967
00:44:57,105 --> 00:44:59,404
So, what are you up to today?

968
00:44:59,405 --> 00:44:59,999
I'm supposed to be
working with Stewart.

969
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,137
I'm supposed to be
working with Stewart.

970
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:03,771
What, did you quit or something?

971
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:06,004
No. Oh, he got into, like, a
full-on brawl with socko.

972
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,070
Really? Well, it wasn't
like a full-on brawl.

973
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,070
But he definitely smacked him,

974
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:12,371
so I'm gonna have
to cancel the shoot.

975
00:45:12,372 --> 00:45:15,870
I think that guy, like, left
me a message on my phone.

976
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,037
He's the weird one
who licked me, right?

977
00:45:18,038 --> 00:45:19,436
Yeah. Oh, he smacked him.

978
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,970
Like double bitch-slapped him.

979
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,169
Shut up. He smacked
him one for real?

980
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,236
One? He smacked him,
like, four times.

981
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:26,203
No. Yeah.

982
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:27,937
He was, like, bam!

983
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:29,999
"I know what you're doing.
You're jerking off."

984
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,104
"I know what you're doing.
You're jerking off."

985
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,103
Bam!

986
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,103
Who broke it up? Donna?

987
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:33,969
Yeah.

988
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,670
Oh, my god. What did you do?

989
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:37,869
I was taking pictures.

990
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,203
Of course. Right.

991
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,236
You're funny.

992
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,836
You're funny.

993
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:44,069
No, you're funny. You're funny.

994
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,669
Your face is funnier than--

995
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,769
Stop!

996
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,803
Sorry.

997
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,736
I want to live in Hollywood.

998
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:00,000
You shouldn't smoke those.

999
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,336
You shouldn't smoke those.

1000
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:06,168
So, hey, how do you, um--

1001
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,835
How do you become an actor?

1002
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,835
Mm, I don't know.

1003
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:12,902
You, uh--
You get head shots

1004
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,068
and send them
to agents, I guess.

1005
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,002
But how do I get those?

1006
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:18,334
I could take 'em.

1007
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:19,334
Really? Mm-hmm.

1008
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,601
Seriously? Yeah.

1009
00:46:20,602 --> 00:46:22,035
Really? No, I'm lying to you.

1010
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:23,068
Oh, my god!

1011
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:25,601
I would totally
kiss you right now,

1012
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:28,134
but my tongue feels
like it has fur on it.

1013
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:29,102
Mmm.

1014
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:32,034
Where are you going?

1015
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:34,335
I'm going to get my camera.

1016
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:05,034
So Cleopatra's rolling over
in her grave right now.

1017
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,167
Drop your chin.

1018
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,201
Okay.

1019
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:16,599
Put your hair behind your ear,

1020
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,800
like that.

1021
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,934
Ahem. Okay.

1022
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,999
Shit.

1023
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,965
Shit.

1024
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:33,966
That's pathetic.

1025
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,231
Stupid.

1026
00:47:59,232 --> 00:47:59,999
Yeah.

1027
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,633
Yeah.

1028
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:04,232
Hey, you.

1029
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:09,797
Hey. Hi.

1030
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:12,065
Courtney, the famous model.

1031
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:15,931
Chris, the cop.

1032
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:17,597
You remembered. Yeah.

1033
00:48:17,598 --> 00:48:18,797
Yeah. Hi.

1034
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,098
Hi. I was, uh--

1035
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,764
I was hoping that I
would see you again.

1036
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:24,931
So what brings you
around here today? You--

1037
00:48:24,932 --> 00:48:26,963
I kind of work here. Duh.

1038
00:48:26,964 --> 00:48:28,097
Oh, you--
You work--

1039
00:48:28,098 --> 00:48:29,999
I work. Duh. You--yeah.

1040
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,631
I work. Duh. You--yeah.

1041
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:32,230
Heh. That was really shitty.

1042
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:33,930
I shouldn't have said that.

1043
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:35,530
I'm sorry. Um... That's okay.

1044
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,930
Do you want to--
I don't know--

1045
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:40,097
Do something sometime or not?

1046
00:48:40,098 --> 00:48:41,796
You mean like lunch? Yeah.

1047
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:42,997
Well, yeah. Yeah. Cool.

1048
00:48:42,998 --> 00:48:45,197
Well, let me ask you.
Do you, uh--

1049
00:48:45,198 --> 00:48:46,763
Do you like to bowl?

1050
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:47,963
Oh, my god.
I'm a really good bowler.

1051
00:48:47,964 --> 00:48:49,196
Really? Yeah.

1052
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:50,663
I used to be
on a league and stuff.

1053
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:52,162
I would like to see you bowl.

1054
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,797
I bet you'd look great bowling.

1055
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,129
Maybe we should do that.
Bowling's really--

1056
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,129
Excuse me.

1057
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,096
Yeah.

1058
00:48:59,097 --> 00:48:59,999
Detective Wagner.

1059
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,197
Detective Wagner.

1060
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:02,496
Bill?

1061
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:03,862
Yeah. Hold on one--

1062
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:05,662
Just--just one--
Sure.

1063
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:07,695
Yeah, did you see that?

1064
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:09,196
Fuck me running.

1065
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,162
I know. Right?

1066
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:13,029
Dude, more than words.

1067
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,495
More than words.

1068
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,729
I'm--I'm that--

1069
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,996
Hold on a second.

1070
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,896
I'm sorry, Courtney. I--I, um--

1071
00:49:19,897 --> 00:49:22,462
Yeah, yeah.
It's important. Sure.

1072
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,829
Listen, why don't
I call you, and...

1073
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,462
Okay. We can-- we can do that.

1074
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,495
I don't have a pen.
Do you have a--

1075
00:49:29,496 --> 00:49:29,999
You know what? I have--

1076
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,462
You know what? I have--

1077
00:49:32,463 --> 00:49:34,794
I have a card. There you go.

1078
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:35,961
I'm right there on that,

1079
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:37,861
and you call me... Cool.

1080
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:39,161
And we will bowl.

1081
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:40,395
Bowl.

1082
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:41,395
Right. Yeah.

1083
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,161
Okay. Cool.

1084
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:43,161
Yeah. All right.

1085
00:49:43,162 --> 00:49:44,795
Bye, Chris. Bye.

1086
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:48,461
So, uh, bill--

1087
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:49,828
Yeah.

1088
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:53,161
So those guys
were just freaked out.

1089
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,660
Um, so I have this friend.

1090
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:20,894
Yeah?

1091
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:24,960
And, um, her brother--

1092
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:28,593
My friend's brother did, um--

1093
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:29,999
He was really awful to her

1094
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,859
he was really awful to her

1095
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,026
and cruel

1096
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:35,859
and, like, hit her

1097
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,893
and was controlling
and stuff and--

1098
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:40,659
Where is this coming from?

1099
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,059
I don't know.

1100
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,893
I think stuff about stew
hitting that guy.

1101
00:50:44,894 --> 00:50:46,492
I don't--I don't know.

1102
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:47,659
Uh-huh.

1103
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,094
Well...

1104
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:52,325
Does she--

1105
00:50:52,326 --> 00:50:53,759
I mean your friend.

1106
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,425
Does she have a boyfriend

1107
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:58,626
that she'd be more
comfortable talking to?

1108
00:50:58,627 --> 00:50:59,999
Well, she always thinks--

1109
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,025
Well, she always thinks--

1110
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:04,092
I mean, I think that she--

1111
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:06,591
If he knows that she
has problems,

1112
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:08,859
then he maybe wouldn't
like her anymore.

1113
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:14,558
Well, I mean, I think

1114
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,458
that--that her boyfriend
would probably think

1115
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:20,458
that, uh, every good
relationship has problems

1116
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:22,458
and that's just part of it.

1117
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:25,358
That's just what I think.

1118
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,925
Will you lie down, please?

1119
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:34,458
I'll let her know what you said.

1120
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:35,824
Mm-hmm.

1121
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:39,924
Well, if she's as
pretty as you are,

1122
00:51:39,925 --> 00:51:42,457
would you mind introducing me?

1123
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,724
You idiot.

1124
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:47,491
Close your eyes.

1125
00:51:50,725 --> 00:51:52,358
Open them.

1126
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:57,023
You're totally into me.

1127
00:51:57,024 --> 00:51:59,457
Cool your jets.

1128
00:51:59,458 --> 00:51:59,999
I knew it. I could totally tell.

1129
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,023
I knew it. I could totally tell.

1130
00:52:01,024 --> 00:52:02,723
Look at you talking
like you knew.

1131
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:03,756

You know, I got married
in Paris once.

1150
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,589
You know, I got married
in Paris once.

1151
00:53:04,256 --> 00:53:06,554
In fact, queenie,
I learned to speak

1152
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:09,321
11 languages through the
eye of this camera.

1153
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:10,822
You look so beautiful.

1154
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,721
Do you shoot men, too?

1155
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:14,854
Of course,

1156
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:16,454
but exclusively with women.

1157
00:53:16,455 --> 00:53:17,487
Eww.

1158
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:19,888
What? Boy-girl shoots
are bestsellers.

1159
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:21,153
Yeah, but that's gross.

1160
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:23,387
What, do you powder their dicks?

1161
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:25,920
No. That's wade's job.
You're late.

1162
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:27,320
Sorry. Right.

1163
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:28,920
You know, I was just
talking about you.

1164
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:29,920
Yeah?

1165
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah.

1166
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:30,853
Yeah.

1167
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,421
How's the rash?

1168
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:36,620
We're gonna be shooting in here.

1169
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:37,754
All right.

1170
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,153
Yeah, this looks good.

1171
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:44,319
You like wine, queenie?

1172
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,687
I would love some wine.

1173
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,686
Stewie, can I have
these, please?

1174
00:53:54,687 --> 00:53:57,653
No, you most certainly may not.

1175
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:58,852
Here. Drink up.

1176
00:53:58,853 --> 00:53:59,999
Care for a glass, wade?

1177
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,819
Care for a glass, wade?

1178
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,685
No, thanks.

1179
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:05,186
I love that.

1180
00:54:05,187 --> 00:54:06,785
Bedroom eyes. Bedroom eyes.

1181
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,785
That's it.
Come on, give it to me.

1182
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:09,819
Give me a big smile.

1183
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,852
Hold that.

1184
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:14,285
Now don't giggle. Don't--
You're doing good.

1185
00:54:14,286 --> 00:54:15,652
Turn it to the right.

1186
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:18,218
Turn--there you go.
Now put your head up.

1187
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,719
Now look back at me real quick.

1188
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,518
All right.

1189
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,852
Come on, stop looking at wade.

1190
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:25,619
There you go.

1191
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,619
There you go.

1192
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,252
Uh, honey,

1193
00:54:28,253 --> 00:54:29,784
please stop giggling
like an inbred.

1194
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:30,000
Okay?

1195
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,684
Okay?

1196
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,618
All right?

1197
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,151
All right.

1198
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:38,185
Listen, you want
another shot of Tequila?

1199
00:54:38,186 --> 00:54:41,151
I'm sorry you think
I'm such an idiot.

1200
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,351
I'm just--I'm not used
to all this attention.

1201
00:54:43,352 --> 00:54:45,818
Nonsense. You're not
an idiot at all, okay?

1202
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:48,251
You are gonna be
a worldwide celebrity.

1203
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,317
Oh, please.

1204
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,184
Nah, this whole thing
is a dance.

1205
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:54,751
It's your personal dance,

1206
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:55,850
your sensual experience.

1207
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:57,251
Ahh. Yeah.

1208
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,184
I'm sure you tell that
to all the girls.

1209
00:54:59,185 --> 00:54:59,999
Bullshit.

1210
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,817
Bullshit.

1211
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:02,284
You're fantastic, all right?

1212
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:04,417
I know greatness when I see it.

1213
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:05,451
What the fuck do you know?

1214
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:07,184
What the fuck do I know?

1215
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:09,217
I'm the world's most-published
erotic photographer.

1216
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:11,084
I think I might know something.

1217
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:12,516
Please. Just relax, baby.

1218
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,817
Okay, okay.
You got it, all right?

1219
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:16,550
Come on, get on there.
Get on there,

1220
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,550
and do what god
made you to do, baby.

1221
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:20,283
Go on. Go on. Go on your knees.

1222
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,550
Give me the Jaguar, mama.

1223
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,416
Give me the Jaguar.
Come on, give it to me.

1224
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:26,816
Give it to me. Give it to me.

1225
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:28,683
Come on. Use it. Use it.

1226
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:29,999
You're gonna act like a little
pissed-off pissy ant, then come get it.

1227
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,149
You're gonna act like a little
pissed-off pissy ant, then come get it.

1228
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,250
Come on. Come, and get you some.

1229
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:36,682
All right? That's it.

1230
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:38,383
Now crawl.

1231
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:40,549
Crawl. Crawl. Crawl!

1232
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,150
Crawl. Crawl. Crawl.

1233
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,482
All right, let's try it again.

1234
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:57,748
Roll over, please.

1235
00:55:57,749 --> 00:55:58,781
Roll over.

1236
00:55:58,782 --> 00:55:59,999
Roll over. That's it.

1237
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,416
Roll over. That's it.

1238
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,748
Now put your butt up there,
just like that.

1239
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:05,548
That's it. Turn your butt
to me a little bit more.

1240
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:06,748
Come on. Just tilt it up.

1241
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:08,115
A little bit more.

1242
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:09,616
Right here. A little more.

1243
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:12,215
I feel like such a whore.

1244
00:56:12,216 --> 00:56:14,481
All right, just go
with the feeling, okay?

1245
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:16,147
Just go with the feeling.

1246
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:18,414
And tilt your butt more,
right at me.

1247
00:56:18,415 --> 00:56:21,014
Yeah, straight-up
asshole shots, huh?

1248
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:23,147
That's it. More. More.

1249
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:25,248
Is my face even in any of these?

1250
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:28,014
Look, it's what
the magazine wants, okay?

1251
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:29,999
All right, this isn't
for my personal collection.

1252
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,147
All right, this isn't
for my personal collection.

1253
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:33,114
Now give me some butt.
There you go.

1254
00:56:33,115 --> 00:56:35,680
I just--I don't want to be doing
this shit for no good reason.

1255
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:37,547
I mean, I have a real life.

1256
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:39,981
Look, queenie, okay,

1257
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:42,513
if you would just be
quiet and concentrate,

1258
00:56:42,514 --> 00:56:44,014
we'll finish with this.

1259
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:45,380
Is this gonna be a centerfold

1260
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:46,947
or something cool like that?

1261
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:48,213
I don't want to be just--

1262
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:49,380
Look, would you please shut up?

1263
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:52,213
Would it be a cover shot,
at least? Something--

1264
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:55,014
Would you please shut the
fuck up and let me work?

1265
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:02,713
Oh, look, wade, buddy,

1266
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:05,247
you obviously have
some influence over her.

1267
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:07,280
What do you recommend I do?

1268
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:09,646
I don't know.
You want my opinion?

1269
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:12,013
We should just cancel the shoot.

1270
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,246
Cancel the shoot?

1271
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:16,279
Oh, that is so fucking typical

1272
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,079
of your bullshit generation.

1273
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,979
Fuck this!

1274
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,113
Now, look, are we
gonna shoot or not?

1275
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:24,979
Hey.

1276
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,112
You don't have to do the shoot
if you don't want to, okay?

1277
00:57:28,113 --> 00:57:29,645
You're in control
of the situation.

1278
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:30,000
Look, I push you
for your own good.

1279
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,279
Look, I push you
for your own good.

1280
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,212
Do you want to be a pro or not?

1281
00:57:33,213 --> 00:57:35,145
Fine.

1282
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:36,246
Please, just--

1283
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:37,979
All right, get in the position.

1284
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,578
Tell me the pose.
We'll finish this.

1285
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,246
All right, here--
Here's the pose.

1286
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:44,113
Get on your ass,
and spread your legs. Okay?

1287
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:49,311
Just remember you're in
control of the situation.

1288
00:57:49,312 --> 00:57:52,345
What the fuck are you
saying to her, wade?

1289
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:54,111
Huh? What are you, her coach?

1290
00:57:54,112 --> 00:57:56,645
What are you, stanislavski?
Get the fuck off my set.

1291
00:57:56,646 --> 00:57:58,411
You know what, old man? I've had
enough of your fucking shit.

1292
00:57:58,412 --> 00:57:59,999
Ooh, them's fighting
words, ain't they, boy?

1293
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,145
Ooh, them's fighting
words, ain't they, boy?

1294
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:02,078
Hey, you know what? Go
fuck yourself, asshole.

1295
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,178
Come on. We're going.

1296
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,544
Yeah, go fuck yourself, asshole.

1297
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:06,111
W-we're not going anywhere.
We're not done yet.

1298
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:07,644
Oh, we're done, prick.

1299
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,344
And give me my fucking money.

1300
00:58:09,345 --> 00:58:10,510
Money?

1301
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,178
You're not getting
any fucking money.

1302
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:14,244
You were hired to do two sets.

1303
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:16,510
We've barely begun one.
What money?

1304
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:19,043
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1305
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:20,577
Give her her fucking money.

1306
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:23,010
She needs that money.
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.

1307
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:25,977
She needs the money, get down there
on the floor and earn it, okay?

1308
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:27,410
Pay the girl, Stewart.

1309
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:29,999
Hey, you, shut up. Powder asses.

1310
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,240
Hey, you, shut up. Powder asses.

1311
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,843
Come on. Let's go. We're going.

1312
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,043
Fuck this has-been.

1313
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,210
Oh, well, it's better than being

1314
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:41,844
a never-will-be,
spoiled, dilettante pussy.

1315
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,877
Give me my fucking
money, or else.

1316
00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:50,209
Or else what?

1317
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,509
Or else what?
Or else I call the cops

1318
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,510
and tell them you got an
18-year-old drunk, asshole.

1319
00:58:58,477 --> 00:58:59,999
All right.

1320
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,177
All right.

1321
00:59:00,178 --> 00:59:03,842
Let me see if I have
the exact change here.

1322
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:05,542
Yeah. Here's your money.

1323
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,142
Hmm?

1324
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,244
Pick it up, and get out.

1325
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,375
What are you waiting for?

1326
00:59:15,376 --> 00:59:17,809
You have another job,
don't you? Get out.

1327
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:18,843
Fine.

1328
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:27,309
Heh heh. You left a few.

1329
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:37,976
Does that make you feel better?

1330
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,109
Hi, honey.

1331
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:46,107
You give it to me!

1332
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:47,548
Drinking's not gonna
bring them back.

1333
00:59:50,842 --> 00:59:53,107
You give it back to me!

1334
00:59:53,108 --> 00:59:54,907
I need it.

1335
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:56,140
That's just it.

1336
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:58,207
There's a whole
goddamn life out there

1337
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,774
just waiting for you.

1338
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:04,474
You're the only life I got.

1339
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:09,307
I can't take this anymore.

1340
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,106
I can't.

1341
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:16,340
No, don't leave.

1342
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,174
Don't leave.

1343
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:28,341
Everybody leaves me.

1344
01:00:37,473 --> 01:00:39,473
So fuck it.

1345
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:43,339
So thanks for the ride.

1346
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,939
My car is gonna be ready <i>mañana.</i>

1347
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,473
Yeah, you don't
have to thank me.

1348
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:54,372
Fuck. That guy is
a fucking insane bastard.

1349
01:00:54,373 --> 01:00:57,205
Yeah. He's an insane douche.

1350
01:00:57,206 --> 01:00:59,805
Holy shit. Fucking douche bag.

1351
01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:00,000
Fucking douche baggery.

1352
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,305
Fucking douche baggery.

1353
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:03,872
I never want to end up
pushing it that hard.

1354
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:06,205
Oh, my god, me neither.
I totally agree.

1355
01:01:06,206 --> 01:01:08,404
I just want a little respect
for what I do.

1356
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:10,872
Show up to work,
do the day and that's it.

1357
01:01:10,873 --> 01:01:12,771
No, I-I totally know
what you mean.

1358
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,071
I mean, I want
to be a real model,

1359
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:16,872
a real actress, you know?

1360
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,671
You could do it.

1361
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:21,837
You could do it. You can.

1362
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:23,770
We could do it together.

1363
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:25,971
My prince.

1364
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,071
Nice sarcasm.

1365
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:29,804
Sarcasm?

1366
01:01:29,805 --> 01:01:30,000
No.

1367
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:31,972
No.

1368
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:37,071
What's wrong?

1369
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,304
Nothing.

1370
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:41,871
I know when
something's the matter.

1371
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,338
No, you don't know me.

1372
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,303
Wow.

1373
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,237
You know, you're kind of
full of yourself.

1374
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,770
Did anyone ever tell you that?

1375
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:53,903
All right.

1376
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:56,337
I mean, you think
that it's that easy?

1377
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,203
That you can just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it?

1378
01:01:59,204 --> 01:01:59,999
I never said that it was easy.
No.

1379
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,736
I never said that it was easy.
No.

1380
01:02:01,737 --> 01:02:03,136
When did I say that?

1381
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,003
I mean, what makes you
so certain?

1382
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:07,103
Nothing.

1383
01:02:07,104 --> 01:02:09,369
Right.

1384
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:10,769
Yeah. Whatever.

1385
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,936
Okay, don't be mad.

1386
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:12,936
I'm not mad.

1387
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,169
You are mad.

1388
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,803
You don't even know me.

1389
01:02:15,804 --> 01:02:18,269
No, you don't know me.

1390
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,035
I don't like being called cocky.

1391
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,703
I didn't say that. I'm--

1392
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,135
I'm just saying

1393
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:26,902
that it's not that easy.

1394
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:29,999
You can't just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it. Okay?

1395
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,337
You can't just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it. Okay?

1396
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:33,169
It takes a lot of work,
and you have to go out,

1397
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,970
and you have to have
life experiences.

1398
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:47,635
Okay, you know what?

1399
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:48,934
Thanks for the ride.

1400
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,336
Yeah, you're welcome. See ya.

1401
01:03:31,034 --> 01:03:33,666
If you don't like what you see,

1402
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:36,800
just know it'll only
look worse tomorrow.

1403
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:38,600
Jesus Christ, Stewart.

1404
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:41,100
You scared
the living shit out of me.

1405
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:42,900
That's funny.

1406
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:44,733
I always felt the same
way about you, Donna.

1407
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:46,566
Oh, god.

1408
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:49,701
Don't start with your
fucking bullshit tonight.

1409
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,932
You just don't give a shit

1410
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:57,699
about anyone
but yourself, do you?

1411
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,999
Who do you give
a shit about, Donna?

1412
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,400
Who do you give
a shit about, Donna?

1413
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,099
Is that that frigging gun?

1414
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,532
Jesus Christ, Stewart.
Stop being an idiot.

1415
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:09,132
Put the gun away, and go to bed.

1416
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:12,966
So who you been blowing
tonight, talented Donna?

1417
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:17,131
Oh, you fucking hypocrite.

1418
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:18,498
Good night.

1419
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,532
Was it your drummer friend?

1420
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,165
Kiss my ass, Stewart,

1421
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,764
you loser.

1422
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:25,031
Well, if I'm a loser,

1423
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:27,499
then what does that make you?

1424
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:30,000
God, I'm so tired of this.

1425
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,965
God, I'm so tired of this.

1426
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:33,165
You know what?

1427
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:35,965
If it makes you feel
any better, I, um--

1428
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:37,031
I didn't fuck anybody...

1429
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,031
Tonight.

1430
01:04:38,032 --> 01:04:39,031
Oh!

1431
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:41,164
And the award for abstinence

1432
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:44,831
in the face of endless
Hollywood cock and pussy

1433
01:04:44,832 --> 01:04:48,997
goes to Donna fox.

1434
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:51,065
Good night, asshole.

1435
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:55,897
Stop it.

1436
01:04:55,898 --> 01:04:57,531
Get your hands off me.

1437
01:04:57,532 --> 01:04:59,496
What's the matter?
All fucked out?

1438
01:04:59,497 --> 01:04:59,999
You got no jam left for papa?

1439
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,130
You got no jam left for papa?

1440
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,130
Oh, stop it!

1441
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,864
Get your hands off me.

1442
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:04,897
Oh, yeah?

1443
01:05:04,898 --> 01:05:06,097
Ahh!

1444
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:07,697
What are you,
down to blowing 'em

1445
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:09,463
on Mulholland drive,
you fucking cunt?

1446
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:11,563
Fuck off.
Just get off me, Stewart.

1447
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:12,997
I'll fucking kill you.

1448
01:05:12,998 --> 01:05:14,196
You're gonna kill me?

1449
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:15,864
Yeah, I'll fucking
kill you. I will.

1450
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:17,029
You're gonna kill me?

1451
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,630
I'll fucking kill you. Fuck you.

1452
01:05:18,631 --> 01:05:20,497
Fuck off!

1453
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,858
You live here?
That's so ridiculous.

1454
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:50,491
Yeah. No, no. I just--I own it.

1455
01:07:50,492 --> 01:07:53,592
I don't live here.
I just check in and--

1456
01:07:53,593 --> 01:07:55,525
Well, who lives here?

1457
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:56,924
Uh...

1458
01:07:56,925 --> 01:07:58,657
Is that a person over there?

1459
01:07:58,658 --> 01:07:59,999
Oh, it's--
It's all right.

1460
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,291
Oh, it's--
It's all right.

1461
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:03,724
It's, uh--
I'll call somebody.

1462
01:08:03,725 --> 01:08:04,958
It's all right. It's my aunt.

1463
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:06,958
She just gets a little confused.

1464
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,858
Come on, Gloria.

1465
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:10,824
Gloria. Let's go.

1466
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:11,791
Hi, honey.

1467
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,757
Come on, sweetie.

1468
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:15,257
She's just a little confused.

1469
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,357
Yeah. Do you need--

1470
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,823
Do you want help? I don't--

1471
01:08:17,824 --> 01:08:19,723
Hey, where are we going?

1472
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:21,257
We're going inside.

1473
01:08:21,258 --> 01:08:22,591
I'll see you around.

1474
01:08:22,592 --> 01:08:25,291
See you around.

1475
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:28,623
See ya.

1476
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:29,723
Come on.

1477
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:30,000
One step at a time. That's it.

1478
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,656
One step at a time. That's it.

1479
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:32,623
I'm fine.

1480
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:33,757

Oh, nothing.

1509
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:27,819
I was just--

1510
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,853
Wanted to apologize to you

1511
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:30,000
for being such a bastard to you.

1512
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:32,252
For being such a bastard to you.

1513
01:10:32,253 --> 01:10:35,786
And I wanted
to give you your money

1514
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:37,619
that you left.

1515
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,853
And also,

1516
01:10:38,854 --> 01:10:41,219
I wanted to give you these,

1517
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,752
because you deserve them,

1518
01:10:42,753 --> 01:10:46,720
and--and I wanted to wish you
all the luck in the world.

1519
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:51,485
Thank you.

1520
01:10:51,486 --> 01:10:54,386
That's really sweet.

1521
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,685
Are you okay?

1522
01:10:58,686 --> 01:10:59,999
Heh heh. I'm all right. Heh.

1523
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,552
Heh heh. I'm all right. Heh.

1524
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,352
Are you all right?

1525
01:11:12,252 --> 01:11:15,518
I want you to know something.

1526
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:17,351
You're an angel.

1527
01:11:17,352 --> 01:11:20,084
All right?

1528
01:11:20,085 --> 01:11:21,252
Whoa.

1529
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,784
Gotta go.

1530
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:28,751
Cool.

1531
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:33,817
Ooh. A-are you--
Are you okay?

1532
01:11:33,818 --> 01:11:35,483
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

1533
01:11:35,484 --> 01:11:37,550
Okay.

1534
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:38,718
I-I'm sorry.

1535
01:14:03,346 --> 01:14:05,312
Aah! Ow!

1536
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:07,111
Look, I'm your neighbor.

1537
01:14:07,112 --> 01:14:08,879
I--I live across the street.

1538
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,345
Liar.

1539
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:12,045
Did you come to kill me?

1540
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:14,345
No! I would never hurt you.

1541
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:16,545
Look, lady, please,

1542
01:14:16,546 --> 01:14:18,579
put the kettle down, all right?

1543
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,312
I-I'm sorry
I bothered you, miss.

1544
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:22,512
Gloria.

1545
01:14:24,012 --> 01:14:27,078
My name's Gloria.

1546
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:27,945
Nice to meet you, Gloria.

1547
01:14:27,946 --> 01:14:29,999
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

1548
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,578
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

1549
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:32,211
What?

1550
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:34,244
Could I, uh,

1551
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:37,377
offer you a cup
of nice, hot tea, mister?

1552
01:14:37,378 --> 01:14:39,444
Fox.

1553
01:14:39,445 --> 01:14:41,244
My name's Stewart fox.

1554
01:14:41,245 --> 01:14:44,077
And if you promise
not to scald me again,

1555
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,844
I would love a cup of tea.

1556
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:47,945
Come in.

1557
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:54,110
We were sisters together.

1558
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,476
Really? Your sister?

1559
01:14:56,477 --> 01:14:59,510
We were immaculate sisters.

1560
01:14:59,511 --> 01:15:00,000
We took our vows
at the same time.

1561
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,243
We took our vows
at the same time.

1562
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:03,810
You were a sister... Hmm.

1563
01:15:03,811 --> 01:15:05,343
In an order?

1564
01:15:05,344 --> 01:15:06,877
Wow.

1565
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,276
A nun.

1566
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:11,143
I want you to know
I went to catholic school,

1567
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:14,176
so I know what you ladies
are capable of.

1568
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,578
Don't you forget it, mister.

1569
01:15:17,944 --> 01:15:19,310
I'm impressed.

1570
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:20,909
I can't believe a nun,

1571
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,976
and all this time,
you've been living

1572
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,576
right across the street from me.

1573
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:27,243
Across the street?

1574
01:15:27,244 --> 01:15:29,442
Yeah. I mean,
it's kind of catty-corner.

1575
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:29,999
The house with the fountain.

1576
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,210
The house with the fountain.

1577
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:34,776
You've got an awful lot

1578
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:36,275
of pretty girlfriends
living there.

1579
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:38,475
Well, they're not
exactly girlfriends.

1580
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:40,776
I mean, they're models, mostly.

1581
01:15:40,777 --> 01:15:43,075
I take their pictures.
I'm a photographer.

1582
01:15:43,076 --> 01:15:44,909
Oh.

1583
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:50,076
My nephew's always watching.

1584
01:15:52,276 --> 01:15:56,209
I think that's the only
reason he drops by.

1585
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,441
Oh, you must mean the cop.

1586
01:15:58,442 --> 01:15:59,999
Yeah, he's had me
in a panic a few times.

1587
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,075
Yeah, he's had me
in a panic a few times.

1588
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:04,375
He drives
an unmarked car now, right?

1589
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:11,775
You want a topper?

1590
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,774
Um...

1591
01:16:13,775 --> 01:16:15,342
No, thank you, ma'am.

1592
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:28,407
He's a good boy, though.

1593
01:16:28,408 --> 01:16:29,999
He's always bringing
groceries to his old,

1594
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,074
he's always bringing
groceries to his old,

1595
01:16:32,075 --> 01:16:33,507
Awkward aunt.

1596
01:16:33,508 --> 01:16:34,807
Oh, come on.

1597
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,307
You're neither old nor awkward.

1598
01:16:36,308 --> 01:16:38,907
Please allow me.

1599
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:42,208
All right.

1600
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:48,739
Thank you.

1601
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,441
Oh, you're welcome.

1602
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:57,807
So a photographer living
across the street.

1603
01:16:58,974 --> 01:16:59,999
That's a creative profession.

1604
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,172
That's a creative profession.

1605
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:02,472
Mm, it can be,

1606
01:17:02,473 --> 01:17:04,707
when they let me.

1607
01:17:08,073 --> 01:17:11,373
It's a gift from god,
don't you think?

1608
01:17:13,873 --> 01:17:16,340
Absolutely.

1609
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,738
I don't know
as if I ever had a gift.

1610
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:25,005
I thought I did once.

1611
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:28,207
Well, I'm sure you still do.

1612
01:17:31,406 --> 01:17:35,739
I just got up one
morning, and it was gone.

1613
01:17:36,873 --> 01:17:38,772
Well, I know what you mean.

1614
01:17:38,773 --> 01:17:41,371
You know, back in the
seventies and eighties,

1615
01:17:41,372 --> 01:17:43,171
I was pretty famous.

1616
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:45,771
Not so much anymore.

1617
01:17:45,772 --> 01:17:47,205
You know, I feel like--

1618
01:17:47,206 --> 01:17:50,004
Sometimes I think the whole
world caught up to me

1619
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:52,139
and just passed me by, you know?

1620
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:57,771
I don't know where it went,

1621
01:17:57,772 --> 01:17:59,999
but I never got it back again.

1622
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,704
But I never got it back again.

1623
01:18:00,705 --> 01:18:05,404
Well, I suppose that

1624
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:10,803
we have to love and take
care of our gifts, Gloria,

1625
01:18:10,804 --> 01:18:12,904
or they leave us.

1626
01:18:19,038 --> 01:18:21,104
Goodness.

1627
01:18:22,938 --> 01:18:25,770
Goodness me, Stewart.

1628
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:27,270
Yes, ma'am?

1629
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:29,999
A friend.

1630
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,304
A friend.

1631
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:37,937
I am so grateful
you came to see me.

1632
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:49,636
Here's looking at you, sister.

1633
01:18:51,703 --> 01:18:54,304
Here's looking at you, sister.

1634
01:19:24,669 --> 01:19:26,002
Bye.

1635
01:19:52,035 --> 01:19:55,733
Hey. Do you mind if I crash?

1636
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:56,900
Uh, yeah.

1637
01:19:56,901 --> 01:19:58,667
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1638
01:19:58,668 --> 01:19:59,999
Oh, wait. There's one more.
Hang on.

1639
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Oh, wait. There's one more.
Hang on.

1640
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:02,999
Hey, wait. Wait.
Where you going?

1641
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,133
Ow. Ow!

1642
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:05,899
Help, help, help, help, help.

1643
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,899
Ow.

1644
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,134
Hey, my jacket.

1645
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:15,766
Oh, there's some rum in there.

1646
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:16,933
You want a shot?

1647
01:20:16,934 --> 01:20:18,532
Yeah.

1648
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:20,233
Yeah.

1649
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:21,700
Okay.

1650
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,866
Thank you.

1651
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:29,999
Mm.

1652
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,166
Mm.

1653
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,499
It's warm.

1654
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,465
Yeah.

1655
01:20:35,466 --> 01:20:37,699
Ah. Strong.

1656
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,065
Hi.

1657
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,732
Hi.

1658
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:48,731
Now crawl. Crawl. Crawl.

1659
01:20:48,732 --> 01:20:51,200
Crawl! Crawl! Crawl!

1660
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,132
Why are you doing this?

1661
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:57,032
You are acting like a crazy man.

1662
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:58,632
I'm out of here!

1663
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:19,464
Stew.

1664
01:22:17,629 --> 01:22:20,695
I love you, Donna.

1665
01:22:20,696 --> 01:22:22,996
I love you very much.

1666
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:26,562
Oh.

1667
01:22:26,563 --> 01:22:28,562
You wear it...

1668
01:22:28,563 --> 01:22:29,829
Like this,

1669
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:30,000
pointing to your heart

1670
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:32,562
pointing to your heart

1671
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:36,396
so that the one that you love
is always with you.

1672
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:40,595
I'll always be with you.

1673
01:22:40,596 --> 01:22:41,429

Hey, forget about stew,
okay, all his bullshit.

1690
01:25:51,589 --> 01:25:54,388
You two love each other
in your own way.

1691
01:25:54,389 --> 01:25:55,588
But you do.

1692
01:25:55,589 --> 01:25:57,388
You love each other.

1693
01:25:57,389 --> 01:25:59,454
Oh, and speak of the devil.

1694
01:25:59,455 --> 01:25:59,999
Wow. That's just how I got it.

1695
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,755
Wow. That's just how I got it.

1696
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:03,221
Uh, okay.

1697
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:06,254
"In waves," did you love it?

1698
01:26:06,255 --> 01:26:08,221
You don't have to apologize.

1699
01:26:08,222 --> 01:26:11,354
I'm just glad you're back.

1700
01:26:11,355 --> 01:26:13,654
Oh, I'm back...

1701
01:26:13,655 --> 01:26:16,121
For good.

1702
01:26:16,122 --> 01:26:18,353
Would Mrs. fox like to make love

1703
01:26:18,354 --> 01:26:20,420
to her husband tonight?

1704
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:22,888
Oh, Mr. fox.

1705
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,320
You look absolutely beautiful.

1706
01:26:26,321 --> 01:26:28,153
You do, Courtney. Look.

1707
01:26:28,154 --> 01:26:29,687
I do, huh?

1708
01:26:29,688 --> 01:26:30,000
Yeah, and where'd you get
that twinkle in your eye,

1709
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:32,687
yeah, and where'd you get
that twinkle in your eye,

1710
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:33,720
you little slut? Shut up.

1711
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,153
Ah, good morning, ladies.

1712
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:38,320
Everybody, folks,
gather round, please.

1713
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:39,653
All right, people,

1714
01:26:39,654 --> 01:26:40,753
gather round, please.

1715
01:26:40,754 --> 01:26:42,320
Here we go, everybody.

1716
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:44,853
All right,
today is the beginning

1717
01:26:44,854 --> 01:26:47,120
of a new and exciting adventure,

1718
01:26:47,121 --> 01:26:51,853
an adventure into our special
world of Eros and fantasy.

1719
01:26:51,854 --> 01:26:53,653
Now I do realize, in the past,

1720
01:26:53,654 --> 01:26:55,252
I've been curt and
slightly overbearing.

1721
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:56,786
Just slightly. Yeah.

1722
01:26:56,787 --> 01:26:59,286
Well, perhaps that is an
understatement, Courtney.

1723
01:26:59,287 --> 01:26:59,999
Touché, darling.

1724
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,519
Touché, darling.

1725
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,753
Love and kisses.

1726
01:27:01,754 --> 01:27:03,719
All I'm trying to say
is, from now on,

1727
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,785
there'll be no more
screaming, temper tantrums,

1728
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:09,586
the use of derogatory
language and slurs.

1729
01:27:09,587 --> 01:27:10,852
Okay.

1730
01:27:10,853 --> 01:27:12,119
Let's have ourselves
a wonderful shoot today

1731
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,085
and every day to follow.

1732
01:27:13,086 --> 01:27:14,052
Oh! Places!

1733
01:27:14,053 --> 01:27:18,752
Maybe I can stay for, um...

1734
01:27:18,753 --> 01:27:20,319
Just a few more days?

1735
01:27:34,653 --> 01:27:37,285
Oh, my god.

1736
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:39,118
Wade!

1737
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,252
Oh, my god!

1738
01:27:43,219 --> 01:27:44,450
Look at them!

1739
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:46,186
It's amazing.

1740
01:27:49,685 --> 01:27:51,551
Do you like 'em?

1741
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,051
They're incredible.

1742
01:27:53,052 --> 01:27:54,084
There's, like, 200 of 'em.

1743
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:55,684
One for you. One for me.

1744
01:27:55,685 --> 01:27:57,484
I'm gonna put this
in the bathroom.

1745
01:27:57,485 --> 01:27:59,218
Eww. Gross.

1746
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,184
Hello!

1747
01:28:03,185 --> 01:28:06,083
Oh, hello, Stewart. Oh, my god.

1748
01:28:06,084 --> 01:28:07,650
How are you? Hi.

1749
01:28:07,651 --> 01:28:09,650
I made you some crispy treats.

1750
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,350
Ah, you're such a dear.

1751
01:28:11,351 --> 01:28:12,716
Everybody, this is Gloria,

1752
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:15,117
the very inspiration
of our shoot today.

1753
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:16,783
Oh, Stewart.

1754
01:28:16,784 --> 01:28:19,184
And, Gloria,
this is my wife Donna,

1755
01:28:19,185 --> 01:28:21,083
the love of my life. Hi.

1756
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:22,550
Oh. Hi.

1757
01:28:22,551 --> 01:28:23,716
So sweet of you.

1758
01:28:23,717 --> 01:28:25,449
Oh, my.

1759
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,750
It's great, huh?

1760
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:29,583
Oh. I used to look like that.

1761
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:30,000
Yeah?

1762
01:28:30,001 --> 01:28:30,550
Yeah?

1763
01:28:30,551 --> 01:28:31,684
I mean, not like--

1764
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:34,082
Stewart, I should be going.

1765
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:36,016
I don't want to be in the way.

1766
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:37,483
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1767
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:40,650
Today you sit upon the
throne of honor, my dear.

1768
01:28:42,683 --> 01:28:44,082
And that one?

1769
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,049
Mm-hmm.

1770
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,082
Oh, that's great.

1771
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:49,183
Now this one.

1772
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:50,982
Oh, that is good.

1773
01:28:50,983 --> 01:28:53,183
That's so me.

1774
01:28:54,216 --> 01:28:55,649
Thank you.

1775
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:57,449
You're welcome.

1776
01:29:02,449 --> 01:29:05,048
Ooh. A comedy
about rock 'n' roll.

1777
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,215
That's so perfect.

1778
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:07,348
Why?

1779
01:29:07,349 --> 01:29:09,015
I think it's gonna be good.

1780
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,248
You're no rock 'n' roller.

1781
01:29:10,249 --> 01:29:11,981
I'm a total rock 'n' roller.

1782
01:29:11,982 --> 01:29:14,349
Don't tell me I'm
not a rock 'n' roller.

1783
01:29:15,715 --> 01:29:17,582
Remember you're
amongst friends, dear.

1784
01:29:20,215 --> 01:29:22,614
All right, everybody, places!

1785
01:29:22,615 --> 01:29:24,215
Hi, baby.

1786
01:29:27,048 --> 01:29:28,214
Oh?

1787
01:29:28,215 --> 01:29:29,947
Off you go. Go.

1788
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:30,000
Go.

1789
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:31,181
Go.

1790
01:29:31,182 --> 01:29:34,047
All right, Courtney, baby.

1791
01:29:34,048 --> 01:29:35,582
Shower me with Grace, honey.

1792
01:29:38,348 --> 01:29:40,281
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1793
01:29:40,282 --> 01:29:43,647
That's it. Feel the love, honey.
Feel the love.

1794
01:29:43,648 --> 01:29:45,947
Spread 'em. Wider.

1795
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:47,980
Wider.

1796
01:29:47,981 --> 01:29:50,182
Oh!

1797
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,014
Hi.

1798
01:29:53,015 --> 01:29:54,247
Hi.

1799
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,013
