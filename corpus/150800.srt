1
01:57:47,627 --> 01:57:51,222
When'd you buy these? They're beautiful.

2
01:57:51,907 --> 01:57:53,898
Bed sheets.

3
01:57:53,987 --> 01:57:58,538
- So where are the drapes? On your bed?
- Gotta try to find the second life in things.

4
01:57:58,627 --> 01:58:02,415
- How's your school?
- Good. Hard.

5
01:58:02,507 --> 01:58:05,340
- I would love to go back.
- So go!

6
01:58:05,427 --> 01:58:08,225
I think it's a little late in the game, no?

7
01:58:08,867 --> 01:58:13,065
School would be a piece of cake
compared to what you've been through.

8
01:58:13,147 --> 01:58:16,025
Thank God for this one, huh?

9
01:58:16,107 --> 01:58:19,497
She saved our lives, this little girl.
She really did.

10
01:58:20,147 --> 01:58:21,785
- How you doin', Rosie?
- Hi, Jimmy.

11
01:58:21,867 --> 01:58:24,301
Hey, little girl.

12
01:58:24,387 --> 01:58:26,537
Hey, little girl. Big girl.

13
01:58:27,667 --> 01:58:31,421
- What's up?
- Rosie's gonna sit for Corinna, study here.

14
01:58:32,147 --> 01:58:35,184
- Tonight?
- YYYeah, we got the meeting.

15
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:39,579
I caught the one by work. The nooner.

16
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:41,737
We were supposed to go tonight.

17
01:58:41,827 --> 01:58:45,740
YYYeah, but I gotta go to Albany tomorrow.
I gotta check out that body shop.

18
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:49,103
I think it's better when we go together,
don't you?

19
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:50,896
Huh...

20
01:58:50,987 --> 01:58:53,023
Jimmy fucked up?

21
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:56,577
How much I owe?

22
01:58:56,667 --> 01:58:59,056
Gimme a dollar.

23
01:58:59,147 --> 01:59:01,138
OK.

24
01:59:01,827 --> 01:59:04,819
YYYou go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby.

25
01:59:04,907 --> 01:59:08,058
- Sorry, Rosie. OK?
- No big thing.

26
01:59:08,147 --> 01:59:10,980
We'll pay you halffor comin' downstairs.

27
01:59:11,987 --> 01:59:13,978
(sirens)

28
01:59:16,547 --> 01:59:18,777
(knocking at door)

29
01:59:23,787 --> 01:59:25,743
- (knocking)
- Come on.

30
01:59:25,827 --> 01:59:28,261
- Come on.
- (man) Jimmy!

31
01:59:29,267 --> 01:59:31,258
- Jimmy!
- Here you go.

32
01:59:33,427 --> 01:59:35,418
- Jimmy!
- (knocking)

33
01:59:36,347 --> 01:59:37,826
Shh!

34
01:59:37,947 --> 01:59:41,462
- Jimmy, I'm a fuckin' dead man!
- What are you doin' here, Ronnie?

35
01:59:41,547 --> 01:59:47,065
I got eight cars on a carrier. Boat's leavin'
in 90 minutes and no driver. I need your help.

36
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:52,499
YYYou are not listening to me, OK?
I can go back to jail just for talkin' to you.

37
01:59:52,587 --> 01:59:55,021
I know. I know. I know, Jimmy.

38
01:59:55,107 --> 01:59:57,496
I know. I went to three guys before you.

39
01:59:57,587 --> 02:00:01,626
I know you don't want to be involved
with this shit - and I respect that, Jimmy -

40
02:00:01,707 --> 02:00:05,382
but I don't know what else to do.
YYYou know who I have to answer to?

41
02:00:05,467 --> 02:00:07,583
Little Junior Brown.

42
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:11,262
Ronnie, this is your problem.
I don't give a shit.

43
02:00:11,347 --> 02:00:14,737
Look what he did to my hand last week.
He thought I shorted him $50.

44
02:00:14,827 --> 02:00:19,662
Now I got $350,000 worth ofthis guy's cars
and no driver! I need your help here.

45
02:00:19,747 --> 02:00:21,977
Ronnie, I have a baby inside.

46
02:00:22,067 --> 02:00:24,137
Everybody respects this but you.

47
02:00:24,227 --> 02:00:26,377
(neighbour) Jimmy, you havin' a party?

48
02:00:26,467 --> 02:00:29,220
Jimmy, I know that.
But you gotta help me out.

49
02:00:29,307 --> 02:00:32,458
YYYou cannot come to me
with this shit any more.

50
02:00:32,547 --> 02:00:33,946
- YYYou gotta help me.
- Out.

51
02:00:34,027 --> 02:00:36,825
YYYou know I love you, man. I respect you, man.

52
02:00:36,907 --> 02:00:39,580
I'll give you $1500. We'll be back in two hours.

53
02:00:39,667 --> 02:00:43,376
Ronnie, I don't want your fuckin' money.
Get outta here.

54
02:00:46,147 --> 02:00:49,264
YYYou don't want my fuckin' money? Huh?

55
02:00:49,347 --> 02:00:51,907
I remember aer your mom died.
YYYou remember?

56
02:00:51,987 --> 02:00:56,538
And your father used to go on his benders.
Whose people came to get you, man?

57
02:00:56,627 --> 02:00:59,221
Whose people came to get you?
Where'd you live?

58
02:00:59,307 --> 02:01:01,775
When you had no place to live,
where'd you live?

59
02:01:01,867 --> 02:01:06,065
- That was a long time ago.
- My family's never asked you for nothin'.

60
02:01:08,107 --> 02:01:11,144
Jimmy, I never asked you for nothin', man.

61
02:01:18,067 --> 02:01:22,936
Jimmy, this guy's gonna cripple me, man.
He's gonna cripple me.

62
02:01:23,027 --> 02:01:26,178
I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy.
I'm your blood cousin.

63
02:01:26,267 --> 02:01:28,258
It'll take two hours, man.

64
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:33,899
Please don't let this happen. Please don't let
this fuckin' guy hurt me. He's gonna kill me!

65
02:01:33,987 --> 02:01:38,378
The babysitter from upstairs, get her down.
It'll take two hours. Pay her double.

66
02:01:38,467 --> 02:01:40,458
Please, Jimmy. Please...

67
02:01:42,827 --> 02:01:44,818
Please.

68
02:01:51,427 --> 02:01:54,624
- Hey. I wake your parents up?
- Don't worry about it.

69
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:57,096
- OK. I should be back in two hours.
- OK.

70
02:01:57,187 --> 02:01:59,178
- Thanks.
- Sure.

71
02:02:26,387 --> 02:02:30,619
Since you went away, man, we got big, man.
No more smash-and-grab bullshit.

72
02:02:30,707 --> 02:02:35,497
YYYou know I got a half-size difference in my
shoes and gotta put three insoles in the le?

73
02:02:38,747 --> 02:02:42,740
- I'm talkin' $300, $400 kicks.
- I don't give a fuck about your shoes.

74
02:02:42,827 --> 02:02:44,306
Mr Jimmy!

75
02:02:44,387 --> 02:02:48,016
I'm talkin' $200, $300 kicks.
When you want back in, you let me...

76
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:55,023
You playin' time games with me?

77
02:02:55,107 --> 02:02:59,339
Whoa. Junior, I'm your man.
It's gonna happen.

78
02:03:00,747 --> 02:03:02,738
Remove the fucking hand.

79
02:03:06,067 --> 02:03:10,902
I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here.
There's no problem. Let's just do it.

80
02:03:10,987 --> 02:03:13,137
You're here, huh?

81
02:03:15,747 --> 02:03:17,738
He's here!

82
02:03:18,747 --> 02:03:20,738
We're saved(!)

83
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:25,500
Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault.

84
02:03:26,347 --> 02:03:28,338
What the fuck, man?

85
02:03:29,307 --> 02:03:31,298
He's a drunk, man!

86
02:03:32,187 --> 02:03:35,623
Look who showed up to drive.
He's fuckin' socked.

87
02:04:01,387 --> 02:04:04,185
Half now. He'll throw you the rest aer.

88
02:04:04,267 --> 02:04:06,656
No stagger. Just haul ass!

89
02:04:09,347 --> 02:04:12,305
(Ronnie) No stagger?
We'll look like a circus train!

90
02:04:15,507 --> 02:04:17,737
Fuckin' gorilla.

91
02:04:17,827 --> 02:04:21,183
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Jim, what are you doin'?

92
02:04:21,267 --> 02:04:25,385
We can't leave a guy like this.
They'll cut his throat around here.

93
02:04:25,987 --> 02:04:27,978
So? Good.

94
02:04:29,747 --> 02:04:32,819
You know what your problem is?
You're a liberal.

95
02:04:34,907 --> 02:04:36,898
Ready? Let's go. Let's go!

96
02:04:37,067 --> 02:04:39,058
I got a boat waitin'!

97
02:04:43,347 --> 02:04:45,338
(engine starts)

98
02:05:23,947 --> 02:05:25,665
(groans)

99
02:05:26,867 --> 02:05:28,858
Where... Where's my money?

100
02:05:28,947 --> 02:05:30,938
Shut up.

101
02:05:50,067 --> 02:05:51,580
(drunk groans)

102
02:05:51,667 --> 02:05:53,976
What happened? What happened?

103
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:57,386
- Who took my goddamn money?
- I said shut up!

104
02:06:03,547 --> 02:06:05,538
(horn)

105
02:06:35,387 --> 02:06:36,536
Shit!

106
02:06:41,867 --> 02:06:44,745
- Step out ofthe truck.
- (Ronnie) What's the problem?

107
02:06:44,827 --> 02:06:47,739
No problem. Just step out ofthe truck, please.

108
02:06:48,507 --> 02:06:51,419
- Slowly. Slowly.
- OK, I'm slow. Watch my hand.

109
02:06:51,507 --> 02:06:53,498
Keep your hands up.

110
02:06:54,067 --> 02:06:56,422
(drunk) What's goin' on? Hey!

111
02:06:56,507 --> 02:06:59,226
Somebody think I'm stupid or somethin'?

112
02:07:02,587 --> 02:07:06,102
- Hey, fellas. How you doin'?
- Hey. What's up?

113
02:07:06,187 --> 02:07:08,223
Mind if I see your manifest?

114
02:07:18,387 --> 02:07:20,537
Who took my goddamn money?

115
02:07:21,707 --> 02:07:24,858
You wanna step down outta the cab, please?

116
02:07:29,307 --> 02:07:31,104
No!

117
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:33,942
- Get him!
- Shit!

118
02:07:42,667 --> 02:07:44,783
- Run! Run!
- Go!

119
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,095
Go!

120
02:07:49,507 --> 02:07:51,498
- Move your hand.
- No, no!

121
02:07:53,267 --> 02:07:55,223
(groans)

122
02:08:03,387 --> 02:08:05,378
Bev...

123
02:08:05,867 --> 02:08:09,462
- There was no need for a medevac on this.
- My man is down!

124
02:08:09,547 --> 02:08:12,107
- You had no authority.
- Kiss my fuckin' ass!

125
02:08:13,587 --> 02:08:15,737
(man) You watch Calvin, all right?

126
02:08:20,307 --> 02:08:22,867
Let me handle this.

127
02:08:29,387 --> 02:08:31,378
Wow!

128
02:08:33,467 --> 02:08:35,458
Does that hurt?

129
02:08:35,547 --> 02:08:39,096
- (doctor) What are you doing?
- Who are the mutts that took off?

130
02:08:39,187 --> 02:08:41,496
No, no, no. You calm down, OK?

131
02:08:41,587 --> 02:08:44,181
Hey, chill out. The DA.

132
02:08:46,307 --> 02:08:48,298
That's him.

133
02:08:50,187 --> 02:08:51,461
Hey.

134
02:08:51,547 --> 02:08:53,538
I want the others.

135
02:08:55,867 --> 02:08:58,825
- I don't know 'em.
- What d'you think this is, huh?

136
02:08:58,907 --> 02:09:01,137
A possession of stolen property rap?

137
02:09:01,227 --> 02:09:04,617
Your partner's dead
and you're getting charged with murder.

138
02:09:04,707 --> 02:09:09,258
The shot cop - you're getting charged with
aggravated assault. You want air on this?

139
02:09:09,347 --> 02:09:11,622
Right now, give me some names.

140
02:09:11,707 --> 02:09:15,825
A guy called me, woke me up,
said he had a carrier for me to drive.

141
02:09:15,907 --> 02:09:17,898
He's gonna give me $1500.

142
02:09:17,987 --> 02:09:20,865
- Who called you?
- I don't know. Some guy.

143
02:09:20,947 --> 02:09:22,938
Some guy, huh?

144
02:09:24,147 --> 02:09:27,298
You know you're being charged
with felony murders?

145
02:09:27,387 --> 02:09:29,821
That's 30 for the body, 10 more for the felony.

146
02:09:30,067 --> 02:09:34,379
Do you think that the guy who called you,
if we had him here,...

147
02:09:34,467 --> 02:09:37,265
..do you think he'd do 40 years for you?

148
02:09:44,827 --> 02:09:47,261
Got a family?

149
02:09:55,027 --> 02:09:57,416
I don't know the guy.

150
02:09:57,547 --> 02:09:59,538
You did good, Jimmy.

151
02:09:59,627 --> 02:10:03,506
- Well, what else could you do?
- What else could I have done, Jack?

152
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:08,581
I coulda done plenty. So they're talkin'
felony murder plus ten. That's bullshit, right?

153
02:10:08,667 --> 02:10:11,386
They'll be happy with
a class two grand larceny.

154
02:10:11,467 --> 02:10:14,982
All that other shit, come on!
It's thunder without lightning.

155
02:10:15,067 --> 02:10:18,423
- Class two?
- Stolen property in excess of $75,000.

156
02:10:18,507 --> 02:10:21,419
You'll draw five years.
Serve three, maybe two.

157
02:10:25,267 --> 02:10:28,384
- Serve two?
- Look, you gotta take the hit.

158
02:10:28,467 --> 02:10:32,824
I mean, what can I tell you
that you don't already know?

159
02:10:32,907 --> 02:10:38,459
You did it, right? And they know that.
It's gonna be easy inside. It'll go like a dream.

160
02:10:38,547 --> 02:10:41,061
What happens to my family?

161
02:10:41,147 --> 02:10:44,344
Do you have any idea what
my wife and I have been through?

162
02:10:44,427 --> 02:10:46,418
Relax.

163
02:10:46,507 --> 02:10:48,975
We take care of our own.

164
02:10:54,507 --> 02:10:57,624
- $150?
- Yeah, every week, outta my own pocket.

165
02:10:57,707 --> 02:10:59,937
What the hell can I do with $150?

166
02:11:00,027 --> 02:11:04,305
Bev, it wasn't like he was pullin' down
weekly G's out there, you know?

167
02:11:04,387 --> 02:11:10,303
Let's be realistic. I'm not made of money
either. I'm just tryin' to help out a little bit.

168
02:11:10,387 --> 02:11:12,537
I can't believe this.

169
02:11:15,987 --> 02:11:20,378
You know, Bev, there is another way
you could get it up a little bit.

170
02:11:22,187 --> 02:11:26,658
You know, ifyou worked for me
at the garage - you know what I'm sayin' -

171
02:11:26,747 --> 02:11:31,582
and, you know, like, run credit cards
and make appointments and stuff like that...

172
02:11:31,667 --> 02:11:34,545
It'd be... you know, a strictly kosher gig.

173
02:11:35,507 --> 02:11:39,341
Come on, Bev. I mean, I owe him.
I owe him big time, all right?

174
02:11:39,427 --> 02:11:42,624
- Let me do this.
- What'd he do it for, Ronnie?

175
02:11:45,307 --> 02:11:47,537
Bev, I swear, I don't know.

176
02:11:47,627 --> 02:11:50,346
I mean, ifthat could be me in there...

177
02:11:56,307 --> 02:11:58,298
- Where's the baby?
- With Rosie.

178
02:11:58,387 --> 02:12:01,140
- How's she doin'?
- You know, she misses you.

179
02:12:11,467 --> 02:12:13,458
(guard) Number five!

180
02:12:20,067 --> 02:12:25,539
How could you do this? I can't make it
out there without you. I don't understand.

181
02:12:27,507 --> 02:12:30,704
Well, I felt I had... no choice.

182
02:12:30,787 --> 02:12:33,176
They were gonna kill Ronnie.

183
02:12:34,867 --> 02:12:37,176
We were doing OK.

184
02:12:37,267 --> 02:12:39,622
Didn't you think we were doing OK?

185
02:12:42,787 --> 02:12:45,062
They doin' right by you?

186
02:12:45,907 --> 02:12:48,705
Doin' right by me? You're in jail, Jimmy.

187
02:12:51,987 --> 02:12:53,978
(guard) Number five!

188
02:12:58,627 --> 02:13:02,859
- Bobby, what's the deal with this?
- It needs an 80-amp alternator, 8417 belts.

189
02:13:02,947 --> 02:13:06,986
- Fuckin' thing snapped.
- We ain't got no more? OK, I'll buy some.

190
02:13:08,907 --> 02:13:11,467
- John, you cut the drums?
- Yeah, both of 'em.

191
02:13:11,547 --> 02:13:13,538
Good work.

192
02:13:27,027 --> 02:13:30,781
- Did the kid Terry call about the Chevys yet?
- Not yet.

193
02:13:30,867 --> 02:13:33,062
Let me know, all right?

194
02:13:34,067 --> 02:13:36,376
It's fuckin' hot.

195
02:13:38,587 --> 02:13:40,942
It's like Tijuana out here.

196
02:13:43,067 --> 02:13:45,342
Thanks. I don't drink.

197
02:13:46,747 --> 02:13:49,739
- Not no more, huh?
- Not no more.

198
02:13:50,587 --> 02:13:52,976
- There was a time, though, right?
- Right.

199
02:13:53,067 --> 02:13:58,619
Yeah, I remember. You andJimmy.
Used to be, like, partyin' every night, right?

200
02:13:59,747 --> 02:14:02,102
Well, it wasn't that long ago.

201
02:14:04,707 --> 02:14:07,426
- Whaddaya want from me?
- (John) Ronnie!

202
02:14:07,507 --> 02:14:09,498
Ronnie!

203
02:14:10,867 --> 02:14:12,858
Yo, Ronnie!

204
02:14:13,707 --> 02:14:15,345
Hey, come on!

205
02:14:18,507 --> 02:14:21,499
- What's the deal?
- Go ahead and ask him.

206
02:14:23,147 --> 02:14:26,776
- Ask him!
- Yo. I got a '93 lnfinity.

207
02:14:26,867 --> 02:14:29,142
It's fully loaded. Fully loaded.

208
02:14:29,227 --> 02:14:32,060
- Oh, yeah? ls it yours?
- Yeah. Well, it is now.

209
02:14:32,627 --> 02:14:35,585
- Oh, yeah? ls that right?
- I heard you...

210
02:14:35,667 --> 02:14:39,421
You heard what?
I ain't got nothin' to do with hot cars.

211
02:14:39,507 --> 02:14:41,543
What the fuck you heard?

212
02:14:41,627 --> 02:14:44,460
I was in the joint with Vinny Passo.
He told me that...

213
02:14:44,547 --> 02:14:46,981
Who the fuck is Vinny Passo?

214
02:14:47,067 --> 02:14:50,537
And who the fuck are you?
I don't know you. Where you from?

215
02:14:50,627 --> 02:14:53,187
You know Vinny, right?

216
02:14:53,267 --> 02:14:55,701
- You a cop?
- No, man. I ain't no cop.

217
02:14:55,787 --> 02:14:57,982
I was... I was in the joint with...

218
02:14:58,067 --> 02:15:00,900
We don't do that shit over here. Motherfucker!

219
02:15:05,147 --> 02:15:07,138
Hold him, Johnny! Hold him.

220
02:15:08,587 --> 02:15:11,021
Come here! Where you goin'? Come here!

221
02:15:20,107 --> 02:15:22,177
What the fuck d'ya think this is?

222
02:15:22,267 --> 02:15:25,464
Get that car outta here! That one too.

223
02:15:30,827 --> 02:15:33,057
(Ronnie) Closin' up! Out! Out!

224
02:15:35,947 --> 02:15:39,735
I'm fuckin' upset! So fuckin' upset!
I can't take this bullshit.

225
02:15:39,827 --> 02:15:42,705
Come on, I'm gonna
drive you home. Let's go.

226
02:15:42,787 --> 02:15:45,062
Let's go. Let me get this.

227
02:15:59,267 --> 02:16:02,623
- Where are we goin'?
- Come on. I gotta go see somebody.

228
02:16:03,507 --> 02:16:05,498
I'll buy you a soda pop, all right?

229
02:16:05,587 --> 02:16:07,578
24.

230
02:16:09,387 --> 02:16:11,617
25.

231
02:16:11,707 --> 02:16:13,857
Nice and easy.

232
02:16:13,947 --> 02:16:16,984
- 26.
- Jesus, what you been eatin'?

233
02:16:17,067 --> 02:16:19,456
Come on, you faggot. 27.

234
02:16:20,187 --> 02:16:22,417
- 28.
- Come on, Junior.

235
02:16:22,507 --> 02:16:24,498
29.

236
02:16:24,827 --> 02:16:26,658
- 30.
- Oh, fuck.

237
02:16:26,747 --> 02:16:28,738
31.

238
02:16:32,027 --> 02:16:34,382
A vodka straight. For her, whatever.

239
02:16:34,467 --> 02:16:36,935
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

240
02:16:39,827 --> 02:16:41,818
37.

241
02:16:42,387 --> 02:16:45,185
Pop! Pop! I'm goin' for forty.

242
02:16:45,267 --> 02:16:47,337
Watch!

243
02:16:47,427 --> 02:16:50,339
- 38.
- You got it. You got it. Come on!

244
02:16:50,427 --> 02:16:52,418
- 39.
- Come on!

245
02:16:52,507 --> 02:16:54,498
And...

246
02:16:54,587 --> 02:16:56,578
..40!

247
02:16:57,187 --> 02:17:00,782
- (girl) He did it.
- That was great! I knew you had it in you.

248
02:17:08,867 --> 02:17:11,859
- What's due?
- It's all there.

249
02:17:14,907 --> 02:17:17,899
- Who's she?
- That's my cousin's wife.

250
02:17:20,107 --> 02:17:23,577
- You givin' her the money?
- Yeah. $400 a week like you said.

251
02:17:23,667 --> 02:17:26,943
Plus, I'm giving her ajob.
You know, that was my idea.

252
02:17:30,587 --> 02:17:32,976
- Throw her a car too.
- (Ronnie) A car?

253
02:17:33,067 --> 02:17:35,183
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

254
02:17:35,667 --> 02:17:37,658
Is that it?

255
02:17:38,347 --> 02:17:40,338
All right.

256
02:17:50,547 --> 02:17:52,538
Hey, what's the what?

257
02:17:52,627 --> 02:17:55,460
What kinda car you like to drive?

258
02:17:55,547 --> 02:17:57,663
- What kind?
- Yeah.

259
02:17:58,387 --> 02:18:00,184
Listen...

260
02:18:03,667 --> 02:18:05,419
I wanna give you a car.

261
02:18:05,507 --> 02:18:08,180
I wanna do somethin' nice for you.

262
02:18:10,347 --> 02:18:13,464
- You wanna do something nice for me?
- Yeah.

263
02:18:15,827 --> 02:18:18,500
- Feel good?
- My father says to take her home.

264
02:18:21,467 --> 02:18:24,903
- Why don't you let her finish her drink first?
- Now, fucko!

265
02:18:27,227 --> 02:18:31,584
- Why you gotta talk to me like that, man?
- To her house.

266
02:18:31,667 --> 02:18:33,783
Come on, let's go.

267
02:18:43,667 --> 02:18:46,500
(Ronnie in shower)
Love's more comfortable

268
02:18:47,187 --> 02:18:49,178
The second time you fall

269
02:18:50,507 --> 02:18:52,498
Like a friendly home

270
02:18:53,067 --> 02:18:55,058
The second time you call

271
02:18:56,747 --> 02:19:01,457
Who can say what led to this miracle?

272
02:19:04,827 --> 02:19:07,739
Rosie, I'm sorry. I fell asleep. Is Corinna OK?

273
02:19:09,267 --> 02:19:12,179
No, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home right now.

274
02:19:12,267 --> 02:19:14,258
OK.

275
02:19:19,907 --> 02:19:22,102
- (Bevgasps)
- Oh, look who's up.

276
02:19:22,187 --> 02:19:24,178
Fuck off!

277
02:19:28,547 --> 02:19:30,538
(alarm)

278
02:19:33,867 --> 02:19:35,858
(alarm off)

279
02:19:41,867 --> 02:19:43,858
(seat-belt warning beeps)

280
02:19:51,707 --> 02:19:53,345
- (horn)
- Jimmy!

281
02:20:00,347 --> 02:20:02,338
Kilmartin.

282
02:20:19,107 --> 02:20:21,496
Come in. I'll be off in a minute.

283
02:20:24,587 --> 02:20:27,181
(Jimmy) Oh, Bev, no! Oh, no...

284
02:20:30,907 --> 02:20:33,899
(Ronnie) She was a beautiful person, man.

285
02:20:35,147 --> 02:20:37,138
I did everything I could for her.

286
02:20:38,587 --> 02:20:40,578
I'm sorry.

287
02:20:41,387 --> 02:20:45,585
What was she doin' in your car
at eight in the morning, Ronnie?

288
02:20:46,587 --> 02:20:50,182
I sent her from the shop
to get somethin' from my house.

289
02:20:51,187 --> 02:20:54,179
- We were workin'...
- To get what?

290
02:20:58,307 --> 02:21:00,502
To get my wallet.

291
02:21:02,347 --> 02:21:04,622
To get your wallet?

292
02:21:09,227 --> 02:21:13,698
Jimmy, I swear, ifthat could be me in there...
I wouldn't have done it, man, cos l...

293
02:21:13,787 --> 02:21:15,778
- (guard) Let's go.
- We were workin'.

294
02:21:15,867 --> 02:21:18,904
- Wait a second. Wait.
- Let's go.

295
02:21:18,987 --> 02:21:21,217
Could Rosie bring Corinna to see me?

296
02:21:21,387 --> 02:21:24,857
- You know, it was you, drivin' that truck.
- Don't say that.

297
02:21:24,947 --> 02:21:27,541
Now I got nobody.

298
02:21:27,627 --> 02:21:30,095
(guard) Come on. Time to go.

299
02:21:33,187 --> 02:21:36,145
On the morning she died,
what time did Bev go to work?

300
02:21:36,227 --> 02:21:39,856
- I'm... not sure.
- Rosie, let me put it to you another way.

301
02:21:39,947 --> 02:21:43,860
What time did you come downstairs
so she could go to work? Six am, seven am?

302
02:21:43,947 --> 02:21:45,938
Ah, Jimmy...

303
02:21:51,507 --> 02:21:54,738
She never even made it home
from the night before.

304
02:21:56,747 --> 02:22:01,696
She called me from work, says
Ronnie's drivin' her, but she never made it.

305
02:22:01,787 --> 02:22:04,176
Jimmy, she never made it.

306
02:22:04,267 --> 02:22:07,862
- Ronnie.
- I was there all night. All night long.

307
02:22:07,947 --> 02:22:10,336
- Ronnie.
- Let's go.

308
02:22:12,947 --> 02:22:14,426
OK.

309
02:22:16,787 --> 02:22:20,700
- Your wallet, Ronnie? Your wallet?
- Come on!

310
02:22:21,587 --> 02:22:22,576
Come on!

311
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:26,216
- Nowyou're giving me names?
- You want 'em or not?

312
02:22:26,307 --> 02:22:28,343
What do youwant? Early parole?

313
02:22:28,427 --> 02:22:32,864
If I give people up to you and you turn me
loose early, I won't last day one out there.

314
02:22:32,947 --> 02:22:36,417
- So what do you want?
- I wanna visit my daughter.

315
02:22:39,467 --> 02:22:43,699
She's livin' upstate with my mother-in-law,
who won't let her come and see me.

316
02:22:43,787 --> 02:22:47,666
And I want a one-day trip
to go up there and see her. One day.

317
02:22:53,387 --> 02:22:56,185
- No.
- Whaddaya want from me?

318
02:22:57,627 --> 02:23:00,266
What do you mean? Like, in addition?

319
02:23:01,227 --> 02:23:03,616
Tell me something. Surprise me.

320
02:23:07,987 --> 02:23:10,342
Astro Jewellers. Remember that?

321
02:23:11,107 --> 02:23:13,826
- (colleague) Four years ago.
- (Jimmy) Mm-hm.

322
02:23:14,267 --> 02:23:16,906
I give you those people, I get my day.

323
02:23:19,467 --> 02:23:21,697
We'll see.

324
02:23:23,867 --> 02:23:25,983
John Amato. Call him Johnny A.

325
02:23:26,067 --> 02:23:28,786
And Bobby Bannion: Bobby B.

326
02:23:28,867 --> 02:23:31,381
They work at L&M Automotive
near Shea Stadium.

327
02:23:31,467 --> 02:23:34,345
- Zioli) Anybody else?
- You should pick me up too.

328
02:23:34,427 --> 02:23:37,260
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- Well, ifyou don't,...

329
02:23:37,347 --> 02:23:39,577
..they'll know who did the talking.

330
02:23:40,587 --> 02:23:43,340
So, throw me in a line-up.
I'll take my chances.

331
02:23:43,867 --> 02:23:46,335
That's all I have to say about this.

332
02:23:49,907 --> 02:23:52,979
Tell me about the navy yard.

333
02:23:54,267 --> 02:23:57,976
Same guys: Johnny A, Bobby B and me.

334
02:23:58,067 --> 02:24:01,537
That's three. There were four transporters.

335
02:24:05,667 --> 02:24:09,546
I didn't know the fourth driver.
I never saw him before.

336
02:24:09,627 --> 02:24:11,822
Zioli) Who called you?

337
02:24:15,547 --> 02:24:18,664
Yo... Mr Money.

338
02:24:20,827 --> 02:24:25,981
There is no way that you can tell me that you
did not know the guy who got you into this.

339
02:24:28,707 --> 02:24:31,141
Look me in the eye and try it.

340
02:24:34,827 --> 02:24:37,785
I've got no reason to lie.

341
02:24:40,187 --> 02:24:42,781
Everybody's got a reason to lie.

342
02:24:44,667 --> 02:24:47,386
Astro Jewellers? That was four years ago.

343
02:24:47,467 --> 02:24:49,776
Who ratted us out?

344
02:24:49,867 --> 02:24:52,700
Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear.

345
02:24:52,787 --> 02:24:57,144
I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes
on me. Did they pick Ronnie up too?

346
02:24:58,627 --> 02:25:01,858
- Ronnie Gannon?
- Yeah. The whole job was his idea.

347
02:25:01,947 --> 02:25:04,859
No, his name didn't even come up.

348
02:25:04,947 --> 02:25:08,098
Did the prosecutor's office
contact you about this?

349
02:25:08,187 --> 02:25:12,021
No. How stupid do ya think I am?
I wouldn't talk to anybody without you.

350
02:25:14,547 --> 02:25:18,745
Yeah. Well, they also got picked up
on the navy yard thing.

351
02:25:18,827 --> 02:25:21,625
- Who did?
- Bobby and Johnny.

352
02:25:22,307 --> 02:25:24,502
Ronnie too?

353
02:25:27,307 --> 02:25:31,016
- Ronnie Gannon...
- I never liked that kid.

354
02:25:31,107 --> 02:25:33,940
He's a fuckin' rat, is what you're sayin'.

355
02:25:34,027 --> 02:25:38,862
(sidekick) You gonna take care ofthis,
Junior, or are you goin' outta house?

356
02:25:39,587 --> 02:25:42,055
(Big Junior) I clean up my own mess.

357
02:26:13,067 --> 02:26:15,820
- You ever see a Rolls get chopped?
- No.

358
02:26:15,907 --> 02:26:18,660
Why don't you stay and check it out?

359
02:26:20,627 --> 02:26:23,903
(Ronnie) Come on, man.
I'm dyin' over here. Let's go!

360
02:26:27,027 --> 02:26:32,818
We ain't got all day, man. Let's go, man.
It ain't rocket science. Let's get outta here!

361
02:26:36,707 --> 02:26:40,825
(Ronnie) Let's go to work. Let's get it up!

362
02:26:42,707 --> 02:26:44,698
Yo, Ronnie!

363
02:26:44,787 --> 02:26:47,506
Ronnie! Come here!

364
02:27:05,747 --> 02:27:09,740
What the fuck?
You guys look like the Gorton's fishermen.

365
02:27:12,507 --> 02:27:14,737
Ronnie, I want you to listen to this.

366
02:27:14,827 --> 02:27:17,580
An oldie but goodie.

367
02:27:17,667 --> 02:27:20,420
Concentrate on the words.

368
02:27:20,507 --> 02:27:22,498
Your time has come

369
02:27:22,587 --> 02:27:25,340
For everyone to clean up
their own backyard

370
02:27:26,427 --> 02:27:29,624
Before theygo knockin' on
their neighbour's door

371
02:27:30,387 --> 02:27:32,617
Did ya hear that?

372
02:27:32,707 --> 02:27:35,426
Yeah. The bass was too heavy, though.

373
02:27:38,307 --> 02:27:42,698
"The time has come for everyone
to clean up their own back yard."

374
02:27:46,187 --> 02:27:49,497
"Clean up their own back yard."

375
02:27:50,107 --> 02:27:51,699
Did you hear that?

376
02:27:51,787 --> 02:27:54,824
- Wait! What'd I do?
- (  "Jump Around" byHouse ofPain)

377
02:27:54,907 --> 02:27:56,898
I didn't do nothin'! What'd I do?

378
02:27:59,307 --> 02:28:02,902
You got somethin' to say?
You like to talk to the cops, huh?

379
02:28:02,987 --> 02:28:04,978
Huh?

380
02:28:05,587 --> 02:28:08,818
You like to fuckin' talk, you fuck? You fuck!

381
02:28:25,827 --> 02:28:27,624
Shit, Junior.

382
02:28:27,707 --> 02:28:29,743
- Shit.
- Ow.

383
02:28:32,187 --> 02:28:34,178
I like this. I really do.

384
02:28:42,227 --> 02:28:45,139
Ah, man, look at this. I just bought this thing.

385
02:28:58,667 --> 02:29:00,897
Let's get him outta here.

386
02:29:19,427 --> 02:29:23,022
- Kilmartin. On a day pass.
- Change your clothes in the cage.

387
02:29:31,147 --> 02:29:34,184
Mr Kilmartin. We meet again.

388
02:29:35,347 --> 02:29:38,339
You remember old Calvin Hart here, don't ya?

389
02:29:42,827 --> 02:29:44,818
He sure as shit remembers you.

390
02:30:21,587 --> 02:30:23,782
Take the cuffs off him.

391
02:30:30,547 --> 02:30:32,538
Took the same bullet as you.

392
02:31:06,387 --> 02:31:08,776
Can I see my daughter now?

393
02:31:33,747 --> 02:31:35,817
- Hi.
- What happened to your face?

394
02:31:35,907 --> 02:31:39,616
Nothin'. Listen,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

395
02:31:39,707 --> 02:31:41,937
I don't want her to see me like this.

396
02:31:42,507 --> 02:31:44,816
Oh, Jimmy, she's a baby. She don't...

397
02:31:53,787 --> 02:31:56,824
- She ask for Bev a lot?
- In and out.

398
02:31:56,907 --> 02:32:00,422
Between me and Bev's mom,
she's doin' better than you think.

399
02:32:00,507 --> 02:32:04,739
I've been takin' her to classes with me.
She likes psych and economics.

400
02:32:04,827 --> 02:32:06,818
Math...

401
02:32:07,347 --> 02:32:11,420
That's great. I don't know
what I'd do without you, Rosie.

402
02:32:23,187 --> 02:32:25,178
Corinna.

403
02:32:34,227 --> 02:32:35,501
Hey.

404
02:32:35,587 --> 02:32:38,101
Hey, you! Hey.

405
02:32:40,307 --> 02:32:43,344
Hey, you, come here.
Corinna, do you know who I am?

406
02:32:43,427 --> 02:32:45,622
- (Corinna cries)
- Just for one minute.

407
02:32:47,907 --> 02:32:49,898
I know.

408
02:32:51,347 --> 02:32:53,338
Ma-ma-ma...

409
02:32:55,827 --> 02:32:57,818
OK. All right.

410
02:33:04,907 --> 02:33:07,182
Don't take her away from me.

411
02:33:09,667 --> 02:33:11,544
(ticking)

412
02:33:26,627 --> 02:33:29,187
Daddy, it stinks in here.

413
02:33:30,067 --> 02:33:32,342
It smells like soup!

414
02:33:34,867 --> 02:33:37,222
Soup, huh?

415
02:33:37,307 --> 02:33:39,298
Three more weeks.

416
02:33:39,387 --> 02:33:42,060
Hang in there, kiddo.

417
02:33:42,147 --> 02:33:43,899
Yeah...

418
02:33:43,987 --> 02:33:46,979
Comin' out to what? No job, no money...

419
02:33:48,467 --> 02:33:51,220
Least I got you, Juicy, right? Yeah.

420
02:33:51,747 --> 02:33:54,659
I wanna get your parents somethin'
for getting my apartment back.

421
02:33:54,747 --> 02:33:57,898
- And you got me.
- Whaddaya mean, I got you?

422
02:34:12,707 --> 02:34:14,186
Give it up!

423
02:34:14,267 --> 02:34:17,816
Kilmartin, report to the five building bypass.

424
02:34:17,907 --> 02:34:19,659
Kilmartin!

425
02:34:21,947 --> 02:34:23,938
(buzzer)

426
02:34:41,347 --> 02:34:43,338
Come on in.

427
02:34:53,467 --> 02:34:55,219
(sighs)

428
02:34:56,267 --> 02:35:00,055
I hear you're comin' up
for parole review next week.

429
02:35:00,147 --> 02:35:03,105
I also hear you've been a pretty good guy.
That's great.

430
02:35:03,187 --> 02:35:05,178
Whaddaya want?

431
02:35:06,947 --> 02:35:11,737
Did you ever hear of an asshole
by the name of Little Junior Brown?

432
02:35:17,307 --> 02:35:19,298
Think.

433
02:35:19,987 --> 02:35:21,545
What about him?

434
02:35:24,987 --> 02:35:26,579
Little Junior...

435
02:35:26,667 --> 02:35:29,579
His old man, Big Junior?

436
02:35:29,667 --> 02:35:32,261
He's in the hospital. He ain't comin' out.

437
02:35:32,987 --> 02:35:36,423
So it looks like Little Junior's
movin' up in the world.

438
02:35:38,467 --> 02:35:40,458
Big Junior.

439
02:35:40,547 --> 02:35:44,381
That's one ofthose expressions like...
jumbo shrimp.

440
02:35:45,147 --> 02:35:47,138
Huh?

441
02:35:50,187 --> 02:35:52,337
(Jimmy) Listen to me.

442
02:35:52,427 --> 02:35:56,420
I am not goin' back to that.
I am not rattin' on anybody else.

443
02:35:56,507 --> 02:35:59,146
What's done is done.
You can't make me do shit.

444
02:35:59,227 --> 02:36:02,185
We never swung the hammer on you
for the Astro job.

445
02:36:02,267 --> 02:36:05,418
Get the indictment on me.
Look, all I got to say to you...

446
02:36:05,507 --> 02:36:09,386
..is how you already cooperated with us
ratting out the others,...

447
02:36:09,467 --> 02:36:13,426
..and here we are droppin' it on you anyhow
because you won't do any more ratting.

448
02:36:13,507 --> 02:36:15,896
You know what? You're right.

449
02:36:15,987 --> 02:36:19,423
Forget it.
We probably won't get the indictment.

450
02:36:20,947 --> 02:36:23,381
And you'll be out on the street.

451
02:36:24,827 --> 02:36:27,295
A free man.

452
02:36:27,387 --> 02:36:31,380
How long do you think you're gonna
last out there once the word gets out?

453
02:36:37,427 --> 02:36:39,418
Are you a man of honour?

454
02:36:40,867 --> 02:36:42,858
Sure.

455
02:36:43,507 --> 02:36:45,498
See, let me tell you.

456
02:36:46,347 --> 02:36:53,059
All I want now is what I had in my life
before all the fuckers came through the door -

457
02:36:53,147 --> 02:36:55,138
you and them.

458
02:36:55,947 --> 02:37:00,304
I wanna be le alone with my family,
and I want ajob that feels good to me.

459
02:37:00,387 --> 02:37:04,062
So ifthat means I need to deliver up
this Junior Brown, I'll do that.

460
02:37:04,147 --> 02:37:07,583
If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there,
I will.

461
02:37:07,667 --> 02:37:10,022
But all I've got on you is your word.

462
02:37:10,107 --> 02:37:12,905
So I'm asking you: if I serve him up,...

463
02:37:14,267 --> 02:37:20,422
..as a man of honour, will you say to me now
that you will cut me loose once and for all?

464
02:37:21,707 --> 02:37:23,698
Absolutely.

465
02:37:24,747 --> 02:37:27,420
D'you want my hand on it or something?

466
02:37:41,227 --> 02:37:43,218
(guard) OK, let him pass.

467
02:37:57,427 --> 02:37:59,418
James Kilmartin.

468
02:37:59,507 --> 02:38:01,782
- Rose D'Amico.
- Here.

469
02:38:02,387 --> 02:38:04,617
That's my daddy!

470
02:38:06,427 --> 02:38:08,418
Let's go.

471
02:38:22,507 --> 02:38:24,498
- Daddy, look!
- Hey, Corinna!

472
02:38:26,107 --> 02:38:29,383
- (horn)
- What the hell's the matter with you?!

473
02:38:31,827 --> 02:38:34,466
The car almost hit me, Daddy.

474
02:38:34,547 --> 02:38:36,538
I know.

475
02:38:40,307 --> 02:38:42,298
(wails)

476
02:38:43,467 --> 02:38:45,458
(grunts)

477
02:38:46,467 --> 02:38:49,903
- What the fuck is your problem, man?
- My father's dead!

478
02:38:50,227 --> 02:38:52,218
My father's dead!

479
02:38:53,667 --> 02:38:56,022
(man) Come on, get it out. Come on.

480
02:38:59,827 --> 02:39:01,021
Argh!

481
02:39:34,587 --> 02:39:36,976
See the brother here with Junior?

482
02:39:37,067 --> 02:39:41,538
His name's Omar. Now, Omar's down
with some posse outta Philadelphia.

483
02:39:41,627 --> 02:39:46,018
Must got cash as long as train smoke
cos he's Junior's biggest customer.

484
02:39:46,107 --> 02:39:50,658
Cars, drugs, guns. He's buyin'
everything he can get his hands on.

485
02:39:51,267 --> 02:39:55,977
So when you hook up with your scumbag
pals, I want you to get 'em talkin' about Omar.

486
02:39:56,067 --> 02:39:59,503
He must be new. The Philadelphia PD
ain't got no jacket on him yet.

487
02:39:59,587 --> 02:40:01,578
Wait.

488
02:40:02,267 --> 02:40:05,020
Fuck this guy Omar. You said Little Junior.

489
02:40:05,107 --> 02:40:07,302
This is about Little Junior.

490
02:40:08,387 --> 02:40:13,700
Look, like ifyou get in some conversations,
just relax. Don't push for nothin', all right?

491
02:40:13,787 --> 02:40:18,577
Guy starts talkin', just ask for more details,
but nice and natural.

492
02:40:18,667 --> 02:40:20,658
Two assholes talkin' shop.

493
02:40:20,747 --> 02:40:25,775
But don't push, all right?
And don't initiate nothin', all right?

494
02:40:27,307 --> 02:40:28,979
(Calvin laughs)

495
02:40:29,067 --> 02:40:32,059
Yeah, you gonna be fine. Just fine.

496
02:40:33,107 --> 02:40:35,667
Look, we in this together, man.

497
02:40:35,747 --> 02:40:38,022
One for all, all for one, right?

498
02:40:46,467 --> 02:40:48,742
OK, slow down. Slow.

499
02:40:51,947 --> 02:40:54,780
There it is. There. The Lexus, right there.

500
02:41:14,107 --> 02:41:15,699
(alarm)

501
02:41:16,507 --> 02:41:18,179
(alarm off)

502
02:41:18,267 --> 02:41:20,258
(engine starts)

503
02:42:00,587 --> 02:42:02,464
(laughter)

504
02:42:02,547 --> 02:42:06,142
I hate dogs! Little dogs, big dogs...

505
02:42:06,227 --> 02:42:08,218
Let's get outta here.

506
02:42:10,587 --> 02:42:12,578
(laughter)

507
02:42:31,187 --> 02:42:33,496
See that guy in the red shirt over there?

508
02:42:34,707 --> 02:42:38,222
- This guy right over here?
- That's our connect in the DMV.

509
02:42:38,747 --> 02:42:43,343
Alls we gotta do is throw him a licence
number, throws us back anything we need.

510
02:42:43,427 --> 02:42:47,102
Sometimes we got more shit
than the real owners. It's beautiful.

511
02:42:47,187 --> 02:42:49,064
No kiddin'.

512
02:42:49,267 --> 02:42:51,258
No kiddin'.

513
02:43:03,227 --> 02:43:06,458
Now, you see her? The lndian? I just love her.

514
02:43:06,547 --> 02:43:09,983
- (Jimmy) She's nice.
- No, I love her. We're engaged.

515
02:43:10,987 --> 02:43:15,185
I wanna grow old with her and shit.
You know what I'm tryin' to say?

516
02:43:22,227 --> 02:43:25,185
You remember me?

517
02:43:25,267 --> 02:43:27,258
Yeah.

518
02:43:33,427 --> 02:43:36,100
I heard you lost your wife.

519
02:43:36,467 --> 02:43:38,822
I lost my father last week.

520
02:43:42,667 --> 02:43:45,135
Whaddaya think is worse?

521
02:43:45,227 --> 02:43:47,616
Losin' a wife or losin' a father?

522
02:43:50,507 --> 02:43:52,498
I don't know.

523
02:43:53,547 --> 02:43:57,665
I guess it depends on the individual,
the relationship, whatnot.

524
02:44:00,427 --> 02:44:03,305
You know what an asthma attack feels like?

525
02:44:05,347 --> 02:44:09,181
Feels like you're tryin' to breathe air
through a flattened straw.

526
02:44:09,267 --> 02:44:13,704
But if I take a hit ofthis, most times I'm OK.

527
02:44:14,027 --> 02:44:16,018
Like that.

528
02:44:16,987 --> 02:44:19,547
But my old man?

529
02:44:19,627 --> 02:44:21,618
In the end?

530
02:44:24,987 --> 02:44:28,457
He had less than five per cent
of his lung capacity.

531
02:44:32,347 --> 02:44:35,145
I mean... he went out hard.

532
02:44:37,747 --> 02:44:40,136
I'm sorry to hear that.

533
02:44:40,307 --> 02:44:44,619
If that starts happenin' with me -
with genetics and shit - it's silver-bullet time.

534
02:44:44,707 --> 02:44:46,777
I'll do it myself.

535
02:44:51,947 --> 02:44:54,700
At least your wife, she went out fast, right?

536
02:44:56,067 --> 02:44:59,742
I'm tellin' ya, man,
you gotta be grateful for that.

537
02:45:01,227 --> 02:45:03,821
So, Sing Sing... You got through that.

538
02:45:07,347 --> 02:45:10,578
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

539
02:45:10,667 --> 02:45:11,656
Whatever...?

540
02:45:11,747 --> 02:45:14,056
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

541
02:45:14,307 --> 02:45:16,821
Whatever don't kill you makes...

542
02:45:16,907 --> 02:45:18,898
I like that.

543
02:45:22,107 --> 02:45:24,905
- You're OK.
- (dancer) Joey, get this guy!

544
02:45:24,987 --> 02:45:28,184
- You're all right.
- (dancer) Hey!

545
02:45:28,267 --> 02:45:31,145
- What are you doin'? Come here.
- Hey, man. Come on!

546
02:45:31,227 --> 02:45:33,422
Bring him here.

547
02:45:39,227 --> 02:45:42,537
Junior, I'm drunk. I was drunk. I'm sorry.

548
02:45:42,627 --> 02:45:45,016
Which hand did you grab her with?

549
02:45:46,027 --> 02:45:49,463
Put it on the table.
I'm only gonna say that once.

550
02:45:56,587 --> 02:46:00,023
Would you mind lightin'
one ofthose for me, please?

551
02:46:19,867 --> 02:46:21,664
- Thank you.
- Junior...

552
02:46:21,747 --> 02:46:24,739
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

553
02:46:25,547 --> 02:46:28,380
You think that's an easyjob,
dancin' up there?

554
02:46:28,467 --> 02:46:31,777
It's hard, what they do. Are you kiddin' me?

555
02:46:31,867 --> 02:46:35,257
- Junior...
- Don't you move that fuckin' hand.

556
02:46:36,227 --> 02:46:39,185
When someone steps over the line,...

557
02:46:39,267 --> 02:46:43,499
..the difficult becomes
the repulsively impossible.

558
02:46:44,307 --> 02:46:47,743
I think you should have more respect
for what they put up with.

559
02:46:47,827 --> 02:46:50,216
So what can ldo...

560
02:46:51,227 --> 02:46:53,695
..to make you remember...

561
02:46:53,787 --> 02:46:57,177
..and appreciate...

562
02:46:57,987 --> 02:47:01,218
..what that's like, bein' up there?

563
02:47:05,187 --> 02:47:07,178
Please...

564
02:47:09,387 --> 02:47:11,378
(cheering)

565
02:47:12,067 --> 02:47:14,058
(whistling)

566
02:47:17,147 --> 02:47:19,138
Come here.

567
02:47:19,307 --> 02:47:21,298
Come on, come on.

568
02:47:22,347 --> 02:47:24,338
Get over here!

569
02:47:41,067 --> 02:47:45,743
Tonight, I'll tell you, you have
really got this thing down to a science.

570
02:47:45,827 --> 02:47:47,818
Yeah? What thing?

571
02:47:47,907 --> 02:47:50,899
Well, look at him.
Who would know? Am I right?

572
02:47:54,187 --> 02:47:56,576
Who would know what?

573
02:47:58,067 --> 02:48:01,662
No, I'm just... I'm just saying. You know.

574
02:48:01,747 --> 02:48:03,897
Admirin'.

575
02:48:03,987 --> 02:48:05,705
Admirin'?

576
02:48:24,907 --> 02:48:27,421
Get him the fuck offthere.

577
02:48:42,667 --> 02:48:46,660
I am so fuckin' stupid.
I should have my fuckin' head examined.

578
02:48:47,667 --> 02:48:50,420
What is the matter with me?

579
02:49:01,747 --> 02:49:04,056
Hey! Hey! What are you fuckin' doin'?

580
02:49:04,147 --> 02:49:07,264
What are you worrying
about the guy for, huh?!

581
02:49:08,147 --> 02:49:10,422
What guy? What fucking guy?

582
02:49:11,627 --> 02:49:13,618
Whaddaya wanna know for?

583
02:49:13,707 --> 02:49:16,380
That's fucking great.
I did three years for you.

584
02:49:16,467 --> 02:49:18,458
Hey, hey, hey.

585
02:49:18,907 --> 02:49:22,183
I did three years for you,
you paranoid motherfucker, OK?

586
02:49:22,267 --> 02:49:25,145
Full time, not a day less, for you.

587
02:49:25,227 --> 02:49:27,218
OK?

588
02:49:27,827 --> 02:49:30,341
What do you wanna know about the guy for?

589
02:49:33,707 --> 02:49:37,382
JJ pointed him out to me,
like two minutes before you sat down.

590
02:49:37,467 --> 02:49:42,780
If he's got a big fuckin' mouth, take it up
with him. I was tryin' to make conversation.

591
02:49:51,347 --> 02:49:53,656
It's been a hard week.

592
02:49:56,307 --> 02:49:59,219
I'm sorry. I just lost control, you know, so...

593
02:50:00,547 --> 02:50:02,185
Wanna go for a ride?

594
02:50:02,267 --> 02:50:04,223
Let's go for a ride. Come on.

595
02:50:04,307 --> 02:50:06,298
No problem.

596
02:50:10,267 --> 02:50:12,258
Know what an acronym is?

597
02:50:16,067 --> 02:50:21,778
It's like letters that stand for things.
You know, like FBl, TGIF. You understand?

598
02:50:22,667 --> 02:50:24,658
Yeah.

599
02:50:26,027 --> 02:50:29,497
I have an acronym for myself.
Know what it is?

600
02:50:32,187 --> 02:50:35,418
B-A-D.

601
02:50:36,467 --> 02:50:42,736
B-A-D. Balls, attitude, direction.

602
02:50:45,347 --> 02:50:50,057
You should give yourself an acronym.
Cos it helps you visualise your goals.

603
02:50:53,147 --> 02:50:56,742
How about F-A-B? Fucked at birth.

604
02:51:01,067 --> 02:51:02,944
No good. Too negative.

605
02:51:12,907 --> 02:51:16,183
There's a bag in the trunk.
Why don't ya get it?

606
02:51:30,467 --> 02:51:32,458
(metallic chinking)

607
02:51:34,827 --> 02:51:36,738
Whoa! Omar.

608
02:51:36,827 --> 02:51:39,580
Don't you be fuckin'
sneakin' up on me like that.

609
02:51:39,667 --> 02:51:43,262
Shit! Maybe you oughta
lighten up on the yeyo some.

610
02:51:44,347 --> 02:51:46,019
And you think I'm paranoid...

611
02:51:46,107 --> 02:51:48,940
- Who the fuck is this?
- He's cool. He's my people.

612
02:51:49,027 --> 02:51:51,780
Your people?
Turn the fuck around, motherfucker.

613
02:51:51,867 --> 02:51:53,858
Omar, the cars.

614
02:51:58,187 --> 02:52:01,020
Yeah, man. You got the titles and shit?

615
02:52:01,107 --> 02:52:03,098
Always do.

616
02:52:04,907 --> 02:52:08,343
All right, I'll take 'em all. Except that Explorer.

617
02:52:09,067 --> 02:52:11,376
What's the matter with the Explorer?

618
02:52:12,267 --> 02:52:14,258
It's...

619
02:52:15,707 --> 02:52:17,698
It's red.

620
02:52:18,467 --> 02:52:21,106
- So have 'em paint it.
- No. No, man.

621
02:52:21,187 --> 02:52:24,338
No, it'd still be red under the paint.

622
02:52:24,907 --> 02:52:28,422
Red's my bad luck colour.
I ain't got nothin' to do with red.

623
02:52:28,507 --> 02:52:30,498
(Junior laughs)

624
02:52:31,267 --> 02:52:33,701
You're some funny people, my man.

625
02:52:34,787 --> 02:52:35,617
(Omar laughs)

626
02:52:35,707 --> 02:52:38,460
- You got them nines for me?
- Right here.

627
02:52:42,907 --> 02:52:45,375
Are you interested in Macs?
I'll get you a dozen.

628
02:52:45,467 --> 02:52:48,027
Macs? Yeah, man. I'll take Macs. Yeah.

629
02:52:48,107 --> 02:52:50,098
You got 'em.

630
02:52:55,707 --> 02:52:58,699
This motherfucker smells scared, Junior.

631
02:52:59,067 --> 02:53:00,944
I don't like that.

632
02:53:01,027 --> 02:53:03,416
You wanna dance with me?

633
02:53:07,427 --> 02:53:10,146
Cos I love to dance.

634
02:53:10,227 --> 02:53:12,422
You hear what I'm sayin'?

635
02:53:13,307 --> 02:53:15,616
No more new fuckin' faces, all right?

636
02:53:21,667 --> 02:53:23,658
Whatever.

637
02:53:41,667 --> 02:53:45,023
How about you? You afraid of red?

638
02:53:45,547 --> 02:53:48,345
What am l, an interior decorator?
I don't give a shit.

639
02:53:48,427 --> 02:53:50,622
Good. The Explorer's yours.

640
02:54:26,147 --> 02:54:28,422
(Calvin) Jimmy. Over here.

641
02:54:36,027 --> 02:54:38,382
These are the cars we took.

642
02:54:38,467 --> 02:54:41,345
Where'd they go? Terminator Body Parts?

643
02:54:41,427 --> 02:54:42,576
Got anything else?

644
02:54:42,667 --> 02:54:45,340
There was a guy from the DMV there.
I couldn't get his name.

645
02:54:45,427 --> 02:54:48,100
Yeah, we onto him.
So you hook up with Junior?

646
02:54:48,187 --> 02:54:49,176
Oh, yeah.

647
02:54:49,267 --> 02:54:52,259
- And how about Omar? You cut in Omar?
- Him too.

648
02:54:52,347 --> 02:54:57,501
Bought everything on the sheet, bag of nines,
goin' for a dozen Macs over the weekend.

649
02:54:57,587 --> 02:54:59,339
All right.

650
02:54:59,427 --> 02:55:02,419
- So I'll get that wire offyou.
- I threw it away.

651
02:55:03,187 --> 02:55:04,540
What?

652
02:55:04,627 --> 02:55:07,937
I threw it away.
I got patted down twice tonight.

653
02:55:10,067 --> 02:55:12,786
So you're all right with him.
That'll make it easier.

654
02:55:12,867 --> 02:55:16,337
- Easier for what?
- Easier to wear a fuckin' wire.

655
02:55:18,827 --> 02:55:21,864
Let me ask you a question. Why you?

656
02:55:22,427 --> 02:55:25,339
Why did they put you on me? Revenge?

657
02:55:26,147 --> 02:55:28,183
You see this eye here?

658
02:55:28,267 --> 02:55:31,339
Runs all the time. I can't make it stop.

659
02:55:31,427 --> 02:55:34,146
I got a third of my hearin' in this ear.

660
02:55:34,227 --> 02:55:38,584
When I wanna go to the beach - take my kids
to the beach and play with 'em and shit -

661
02:55:38,667 --> 02:55:42,626
strong, direct sun gives me a migraine
so bad, I cry like a baby.

662
02:55:42,707 --> 02:55:45,426
They don't know why. Itjust does.

663
02:55:46,067 --> 02:55:48,376
So I asked for you.

664
02:55:49,267 --> 02:55:54,785
And ifyou take that wire off one more time,
I'm personally gonna beat you to death.

665
02:55:56,587 --> 02:56:01,058
Maybe the next time you lay a hand on me
it won't be such a one-way beatin'.

666
02:56:04,507 --> 02:56:06,384
(door slams)

667
02:56:10,027 --> 02:56:11,983
Hi.

668
02:56:16,027 --> 02:56:18,222
What you got, a test?

669
02:56:20,347 --> 02:56:22,941
Are you gonna get locked up again?

670
02:56:24,387 --> 02:56:26,184
No.

671
02:56:26,267 --> 02:56:29,339
- You would never do that to me.
- No.

672
02:56:29,427 --> 02:56:32,021
Cos I'm not Bev. I can't live with that.

673
02:56:36,947 --> 02:56:39,256
She couldn't live with it either.

674
02:57:01,427 --> 02:57:04,464
You got something you need to tell me?

675
02:57:10,947 --> 02:57:13,541
I'm under the rock.
They got me wearin' a wire.

676
02:57:13,627 --> 02:57:15,618
(gasps)

677
02:57:19,884 --> 02:57:22,478
Funny thing is,
I liked boostin' cars, you know?

678
02:57:22,564 --> 02:57:25,954
There wasn't any make or model
I couldn't pop the lock.

679
02:57:26,324 --> 02:57:30,033
Kill the alarm,
get it on the road in 90 seconds.

680
02:57:31,884 --> 02:57:35,160
And it felt good.
It felt good to be good at somethin'.

681
02:57:35,244 --> 02:57:39,396
I had money in my pocket,
nice clothes, flash ride...

682
02:57:43,484 --> 02:57:46,760
Buy things for Bev, you know?
Take her places.

683
02:57:49,684 --> 02:57:51,675
Felt good.

684
02:57:54,484 --> 02:57:56,679
But it was bullshit.

685
02:57:58,004 --> 02:58:02,043
And when I finally got caught... goin' to jail...

686
02:58:03,684 --> 02:58:05,834
That's for real.

687
02:58:07,764 --> 02:58:10,881
DA's office, Wednesday, 8pm.

688
02:58:10,964 --> 02:58:13,478
Mrs Wang's restaurant, wiring subject.

689
02:58:19,164 --> 02:58:21,962
Switch the ID plate with the junker's.
Torch the junker.

690
02:58:22,044 --> 02:58:24,035
Cops'll think it's the new car.

691
02:58:56,804 --> 02:58:58,237
Let's go.

692
02:58:58,324 --> 02:58:59,916
Wait.

693
02:59:04,124 --> 02:59:05,273
Ooh!

694
02:59:05,364 --> 02:59:09,039
I always get such a kick outta that.
It's the kid in me.

695
02:59:25,364 --> 02:59:27,275
- Hi.
- Hey.

696
02:59:27,364 --> 02:59:29,958
Ugh! You smell like gasoline.

697
02:59:30,044 --> 02:59:32,638
He's a workin' man, babe. Give him a break.

698
02:59:36,964 --> 02:59:38,363
- I gotta go.
- Where?

699
02:59:38,444 --> 02:59:40,958
Gotta get home. She'll have my ass. So...

700
02:59:47,404 --> 02:59:49,395
Let's go.

701
02:59:54,124 --> 02:59:55,352
What's up?

702
02:59:55,444 --> 02:59:59,676
You don't know who to fucking trust
these days. Know what I mean?

703
03:00:04,804 --> 03:00:06,681
Junior, what?

704
03:00:06,764 --> 03:00:09,039
What's up? I do somethin'?

705
03:00:23,884 --> 03:00:27,718
Walk over there
and ask him if he wants a Rolls.

706
03:00:27,804 --> 03:00:29,601
Tell him it's red.

707
03:00:29,924 --> 03:00:32,438
Oh, come on, Junior. Don't make me do that.

708
03:00:37,964 --> 03:00:40,432
And come up on the passenger side.

709
03:01:05,764 --> 03:01:08,073
Hey. How you doin'?

710
03:01:10,204 --> 03:01:11,603
What the fuck y'all want?

711
03:01:11,684 --> 03:01:13,675
(gunshot)

712
03:01:16,604 --> 03:01:18,595
(Jimmy) Oh, my God.

713
03:01:19,084 --> 03:01:21,393
Oh, my God!

714
03:01:21,484 --> 03:01:23,475
You killed him.

715
03:01:24,844 --> 03:01:27,916
- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

716
03:01:28,924 --> 03:01:31,040
Jesus.

717
03:01:31,244 --> 03:01:33,804
What did you do? What did you do?

718
03:01:37,164 --> 03:01:39,519
What the fuck did you do?

719
03:01:46,284 --> 03:01:48,639
What did I do?

720
03:01:48,724 --> 03:01:52,797
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.

721
03:01:58,284 --> 03:02:01,993
Come up with a more positive
acronym for yourselfyet?

722
03:02:03,004 --> 03:02:04,437
A what?

723
03:02:07,044 --> 03:02:12,323
You know what I hate more than anything?
I hate the taste of metal in my mouth.

724
03:02:12,404 --> 03:02:18,001
Silverware makes me gag. I've gotta use
plastic forks and spoons all the time.

725
03:02:33,324 --> 03:02:35,315
You know, l...

726
03:02:35,964 --> 03:02:39,798
..l never told anybody about
me and the metal taste thing before.

727
03:02:43,844 --> 03:02:46,836
Tomorrow... fuck the cars.

728
03:02:47,284 --> 03:02:49,514
Just come by the bar.

729
03:02:50,724 --> 03:02:52,635
I want you to... We...

730
03:02:53,844 --> 03:02:57,393
We should have a conversation
about life and shit.

731
03:03:16,684 --> 03:03:18,959
Yeah, get me Calvin Hart.

732
03:03:23,204 --> 03:03:27,402
- I didn't do nothin'.
- I'd like to blow your fuckin' head off.

733
03:03:39,484 --> 03:03:41,440
(Jimmy cries out)

734
03:03:41,524 --> 03:03:43,515
I didn't do it!

735
03:04:28,884 --> 03:04:30,875
(raised voices)

736
03:04:59,764 --> 03:05:01,994
(man) Bullshit!

737
03:05:03,684 --> 03:05:06,278
No, I am not gonna talk to you!

738
03:05:07,484 --> 03:05:10,556
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut, all right?

739
03:05:12,604 --> 03:05:15,721
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
Omar was a federal agent?

740
03:05:15,804 --> 03:05:17,396
(Jimmy) He was a what?

741
03:05:17,884 --> 03:05:21,001
We couldn't compromise our investigation.

742
03:05:21,404 --> 03:05:24,077
- He was a what?!
- Your investigation?

743
03:05:24,164 --> 03:05:27,759
It's called common courtesy.
It's called professionalism!

744
03:05:27,844 --> 03:05:29,994
You arrogant prick!

745
03:05:30,084 --> 03:05:33,474
- What a fucking waste oftime!
- What?! Our man was killed...

746
03:05:33,564 --> 03:05:35,475
..and your confidential
informant's a witness!

747
03:05:35,564 --> 03:05:39,443
Well, maybe your man would still be alive
if you'd bothered to let us in on it.

748
03:05:39,524 --> 03:05:42,482
- Yeah, it's your own damn fault.
- Our fault?! Let me tell you...

749
03:05:42,564 --> 03:05:44,156
(others calm him down)

750
03:05:44,244 --> 03:05:47,441
- Your CI is ours.
- The fuck he is!

751
03:05:48,124 --> 03:05:51,241
Oh, yeah?
Then I'm chargin' him with homicide.

752
03:05:51,324 --> 03:05:53,201
Fuck you!

753
03:05:53,804 --> 03:05:56,523
You're not doin' shit.
I'll go to the US attorney.

754
03:05:56,604 --> 03:06:00,313
Once they find out that the guy
you're tryin' to indict is a state-run Cl...

755
03:06:00,404 --> 03:06:02,599
..that you knew about from day one,...

756
03:06:02,684 --> 03:06:05,642
..holy shit, what happens to you?!

757
03:06:05,724 --> 03:06:07,999
You ever read about yourself in the paper?

758
03:06:08,084 --> 03:06:10,837
Your balls shrivel to the size of chickpeas.

759
03:06:12,324 --> 03:06:13,916
So whaddaya want?

760
03:06:14,244 --> 03:06:16,997
- Stop. Talk to me. I'm right here.
- Shut up.

761
03:06:17,084 --> 03:06:20,201
I want in. I want ajoint prosecution,
state and federal,...

762
03:06:20,284 --> 03:06:22,002
..and I want this in state court.

763
03:06:22,084 --> 03:06:24,473
- Federal.
- State!

764
03:06:24,564 --> 03:06:27,522
Federal's what I'll give you,
federal's what you'll get.

765
03:06:27,604 --> 03:06:29,401
- State court!
- Federal.

766
03:06:29,484 --> 03:06:31,475
(repeated blasts ofhorn)

767
03:06:34,124 --> 03:06:36,718
I am right here. Talk to me.

768
03:06:36,804 --> 03:06:39,523
- (Omar) What the fucky'all want?
- (gunshot)

769
03:06:40,364 --> 03:06:42,355
(Jimmy) Oh, my God.

770
03:06:42,804 --> 03:06:45,113
Oh, my God!

771
03:06:45,204 --> 03:06:46,637
You killedhim.

772
03:06:46,724 --> 03:06:48,680
- (Junior) Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

773
03:06:48,764 --> 03:06:50,834
Jesus.

774
03:06:50,924 --> 03:06:53,563
What didyou do? What didyou do?

775
03:06:54,044 --> 03:06:56,239
What the fuck didyou do?

776
03:06:57,044 --> 03:07:00,673
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's whatl did.

777
03:07:02,524 --> 03:07:05,880
- You finished with me now?
- You gotta be dreaming.

778
03:07:33,724 --> 03:07:35,954
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

779
03:07:37,684 --> 03:07:39,914
State or federal?

780
03:07:40,684 --> 03:07:42,675
Both.

781
03:07:45,084 --> 03:07:47,075
Come on, scumbag.

782
03:07:48,324 --> 03:07:50,315
You got nothin'.

783
03:08:04,484 --> 03:08:09,114
- (Corinna) I wanna go to the beach.
- (Rosie) We have to wait, sweetheart.

784
03:08:09,204 --> 03:08:12,480
- I forgot Buttercup.
- Shh, honey. We'll get him.

785
03:08:12,564 --> 03:08:14,316
Can I take her on the beach at least?

786
03:08:14,404 --> 03:08:18,238
- I'm tellin' ya, there ain't gonna be no trial.
- They're gonna cop a plea.

787
03:08:18,324 --> 03:08:22,875
- Cop a plea? He killed a fed.
- He didn't know John was a fed. OK?

788
03:08:22,964 --> 03:08:26,593
- He can't chance a trial.
- I don't like this cereal.

789
03:08:26,684 --> 03:08:31,155
- We'll do all we can to keep you offthe stand.
- You really think I'm that stupid?

790
03:08:31,244 --> 03:08:34,077
Fellas, am I tellin' it the way it is or what?

791
03:08:52,364 --> 03:08:56,198
- You're a fuckin' maniac, you know that?
- So where they hidin' him?

792
03:08:56,284 --> 03:08:58,400
Atlantic City?

793
03:08:59,204 --> 03:09:01,513
How many times you gonna move us?

794
03:09:01,604 --> 03:09:04,994
We can't stay in one place too long.
It's not smart.

795
03:09:29,044 --> 03:09:32,480
Can't you even play with her a little,
goddamn you?

796
03:09:33,564 --> 03:09:35,156
You hangin' on, honey?

797
03:09:35,244 --> 03:09:37,519
Juicy? Hang on.

798
03:09:37,604 --> 03:09:39,435
Hang on. Whoo!

799
03:09:39,524 --> 03:09:42,721
There you go. Hang on.

800
03:09:43,844 --> 03:09:45,835
Oooh!

801
03:09:47,124 --> 03:09:48,876
Hey, sweetie.

802
03:09:48,964 --> 03:09:52,559
Looky here what I got.
Your wife's final exams.

803
03:09:52,644 --> 03:09:57,718
- Think we need to monitor her for cheating?
- She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin.

804
03:09:58,644 --> 03:10:01,920
We're all goin' fuckin' nuts.
I'm losin' my mind.

805
03:10:02,004 --> 03:10:04,199
Ready, honey? Here we go.

806
03:10:07,644 --> 03:10:09,635
Look.

807
03:10:10,804 --> 03:10:13,318
I gotta go into the city tonight.

808
03:10:13,404 --> 03:10:16,043
My youngest daughter, Coral?

809
03:10:16,124 --> 03:10:20,515
Maybe tomorrow when I come back
I can bring her with me. You know.

810
03:10:20,604 --> 03:10:23,721
They're about the same age an' all.
Her and Corinna.

811
03:10:28,804 --> 03:10:31,398
That would be really good ofyou, man.

812
03:10:39,324 --> 03:10:40,837
Hey. Hey!

813
03:10:40,924 --> 03:10:42,835
Ready? Here we go.

814
03:10:43,644 --> 03:10:45,794
Whoa, a space ride!

815
03:10:47,884 --> 03:10:50,876
My guy was in fear of his life,
and he fired in self-defence.

816
03:10:50,964 --> 03:10:53,876
Dover's gun was holstered
when they pulled him outta the car.

817
03:10:53,964 --> 03:10:59,436
My guy claims that Agent Dover - Omar -
made a move for it without provocation.

818
03:10:59,524 --> 03:11:03,358
I can produce witnesses to testify that
Agent Dover had drawn a gun on my client...

819
03:11:03,444 --> 03:11:05,321
..at least three times in the past,...

820
03:11:05,404 --> 03:11:10,797
..who can testify that they had seen
Agent Dover taking cocaine, repeatedly,...

821
03:11:10,884 --> 03:11:14,763
..and that his behaviour in the last few
months was bizarre and paranoid.

822
03:11:14,844 --> 03:11:18,154
Mafia shrinks!
The autopsy came up negative on drugs.

823
03:11:18,244 --> 03:11:21,361
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No.

824
03:11:22,484 --> 03:11:24,475
No, huh?

825
03:11:26,604 --> 03:11:29,801
I wanna know ifAgent Dover
had assassination clearance.

826
03:11:29,884 --> 03:11:32,398
- Had what?
- All right, let me rephrase.

827
03:11:32,484 --> 03:11:37,114
Had clearance to shoot first if he perceived
that his cover had been blown.

828
03:11:38,364 --> 03:11:40,924
- You goin' fishin' here, Jack?
- Not at all.

829
03:11:41,004 --> 03:11:44,280
I wanna find out ifwe got
a drug-taking federal agent, strung out,...

830
03:11:44,364 --> 03:11:46,355
..with shoot-first clearance.

831
03:11:46,444 --> 03:11:48,674
In all due respect, ifthat's what we got...

832
03:11:48,764 --> 03:11:51,642
What a bunch of slanderous horseshit!

833
03:11:54,844 --> 03:11:56,835
(car horn)

834
03:11:58,364 --> 03:12:00,400
(loud music on carradio)

835
03:12:00,484 --> 03:12:04,841
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hotel called Tesselers.

836
03:12:04,924 --> 03:12:06,755
I'm sorry. You got me.

837
03:12:06,844 --> 03:12:10,632
- It's near Allenville.
- Allenville? You just drove through it.

838
03:12:10,724 --> 03:12:13,921
- Why don't you backtrack and ask there?
- OK, thank you.

839
03:12:14,564 --> 03:12:16,759
You're welcome.

840
03:12:22,124 --> 03:12:24,115
Corinna...

841
03:12:25,284 --> 03:12:27,275
Corinna!

842
03:12:30,644 --> 03:12:32,714
Number three to base. I don't have Corinna.

843
03:12:32,804 --> 03:12:36,353
I want an inventory of all guns,
drugs and cars acquired in New York.

844
03:12:36,444 --> 03:12:39,277
I wanna know how they were
disposed of in Philadelphia.

845
03:12:39,364 --> 03:12:44,836
Was this stuff put back into the community
to establish Dover's street credibility?

846
03:12:44,924 --> 03:12:48,041
I wanna know how many
other agents were involved.

847
03:12:48,804 --> 03:12:50,954
Judge, this is an ongoing operation.

848
03:12:51,044 --> 03:12:53,035
We'd jeopardise agents still in the field.

849
03:12:53,124 --> 03:12:54,762
How can I prove self-defence...

850
03:12:54,844 --> 03:12:59,281
..if I can't show the pressures on the guy or
find out ifthe guy had shoot-first clearance?

851
03:12:59,364 --> 03:13:04,040
OK. Why don't you bring me all the files?
I'll read them in chambers,...

852
03:13:04,124 --> 03:13:08,914
..try to sort out what's privileged
and what's appropriate for discovery.

853
03:13:13,084 --> 03:13:16,872
- I can't do that, Judge.
- What d'you mean? I'm ordering you to.

854
03:13:25,044 --> 03:13:29,242
Either you produce the files
or I dismiss the indictment.

855
03:13:34,724 --> 03:13:36,442
Corinna!

856
03:13:36,524 --> 03:13:38,913
- (agent) Corinna!
- (Rosie) Corinna!

857
03:13:39,244 --> 03:13:40,836
Corinna!

858
03:13:41,604 --> 03:13:43,595
(Rosie) Corinna!

859
03:13:44,284 --> 03:13:46,275
(Jimmy) Corinna!

860
03:13:47,004 --> 03:13:48,995
Corinna!!

861
03:13:53,684 --> 03:13:55,675
Co...

862
03:14:07,124 --> 03:14:09,115
Corinna!

863
03:14:11,684 --> 03:14:13,117
Corinna!

864
03:14:13,204 --> 03:14:16,879
I wanna be with my mommy.

865
03:14:20,964 --> 03:14:23,398
What did...? Honey!

866
03:14:26,644 --> 03:14:31,274
You guys really weren't putting guns back
on the streetjust for credibility, were you?

867
03:14:31,364 --> 03:14:34,720
I mean... that was just
an educated guess on my part.

868
03:14:39,764 --> 03:14:43,996
If you try to indict him on anything else
I'll still wanna know where the goodies went.

869
03:14:44,204 --> 03:14:47,321
And you can tell the state prosecutor
the same thing!

870
03:14:48,124 --> 03:14:50,115
You're dropping it?

871
03:14:50,724 --> 03:14:51,952
(laughs)

872
03:14:52,044 --> 03:14:54,683
I don't believe this shit.

873
03:14:54,764 --> 03:14:57,232
Well, hell. All right.

874
03:14:57,964 --> 03:15:01,161
- I guess it's up to me.
- You can't be serious.

875
03:15:01,244 --> 03:15:06,079
Why? Cos you don't wanna
jeopardise national security? Huh?

876
03:15:06,164 --> 03:15:09,361
Come on! Whose chain
you think you're yankin' here?

877
03:15:10,244 --> 03:15:13,998
If you guys been doin' shit you shouldn't
have been doin', hey, you know,...

878
03:15:14,084 --> 03:15:17,042
- ..that's your problem.
- We're not givin' up any files.

879
03:15:17,124 --> 03:15:20,753
Oh, yeah? Well... we'll see about that.

880
03:15:25,404 --> 03:15:27,395
Come here.

881
03:15:34,684 --> 03:15:36,834
Whaddaya want?

882
03:15:36,924 --> 03:15:38,915
What do I want?

883
03:15:39,564 --> 03:15:42,158
I want ajudgeship.

884
03:15:42,244 --> 03:15:43,882
Federal.

885
03:15:44,404 --> 03:15:46,395
(cheering)

886
03:15:50,524 --> 03:15:52,515
(triumphant laughter)

887
03:15:54,324 --> 03:15:56,713
Where they got Kilmartin?
Witness protection?

888
03:15:56,804 --> 03:16:00,956
- No. I hear he's still on the street.
- No shit?

889
03:16:01,044 --> 03:16:02,796
Live free or die, huh?

890
03:16:07,284 --> 03:16:09,195
OK. Go to Grandma.

891
03:16:09,284 --> 03:16:11,275
I gotcha! I gotcha!

892
03:16:15,724 --> 03:16:17,282
I'll talk to you later.

893
03:16:17,364 --> 03:16:19,958
- Talk to you later too.
- Call Calvin at least.

894
03:16:21,924 --> 03:16:23,835
Why? It's gonna be OK.

895
03:16:24,724 --> 03:16:26,203
Bye-bye.

896
03:16:27,604 --> 03:16:29,595
Where you goin', Daddy?

897
03:16:30,524 --> 03:16:32,879
- Love you.
- (Rosie) OK.

898
03:17:50,764 --> 03:17:55,121
It's me - Calvin. Come on, gimme the gun.
Turn it loose! Gimme the gun.

899
03:18:01,364 --> 03:18:04,162
Politics? What does that mean?

900
03:18:04,804 --> 03:18:07,398
- What does that mean?
- Jimmy, look...

901
03:18:07,484 --> 03:18:10,396
Why... why are you here?

902
03:18:10,484 --> 03:18:13,078
Why are you here?
What'd you come to my house for?

903
03:18:13,164 --> 03:18:15,473
To tell me I got the sha?

904
03:18:16,564 --> 03:18:18,759
To take my gun away from me?

905
03:18:20,844 --> 03:18:22,436
Hmm. Yeah.

906
03:18:22,524 --> 03:18:26,403
People come to me, say "Jimmy,
we need your help. Please help us." And I do.

907
03:18:26,484 --> 03:18:29,157
But whatever I do, I end up gettin' fucked.

908
03:18:30,164 --> 03:18:33,554
My family... hangin' by a thread.

909
03:18:37,564 --> 03:18:40,601
What's not gonna happen...
that I'm goin' down.

910
03:18:45,164 --> 03:18:47,519
Gimme somethin', Calvin.

911
03:18:48,804 --> 03:18:50,954
Calvin, gimme somethin', please.

912
03:18:52,764 --> 03:18:54,755
Please.

913
03:18:55,124 --> 03:18:56,796
Help me.

914
03:19:02,324 --> 03:19:04,315
- You wanna get a dog?
- Yeah.

915
03:19:12,604 --> 03:19:16,199
- Gimme two hot dogs. Mustard? Relish?
- Zioli) Mustard.

916
03:19:20,724 --> 03:19:23,318
I thought you said you were a man of honour.

917
03:19:29,244 --> 03:19:31,678
Shouldn't you be in witness protection?

918
03:19:31,764 --> 03:19:36,235
What's Junior Brown doin' out on the street?
He killed a federal agent.

919
03:19:36,324 --> 03:19:38,315
Shit happens.

920
03:19:38,924 --> 03:19:40,835
I don't understand.

921
03:19:40,924 --> 03:19:43,279
You had the murder tape, you had me.

922
03:19:47,044 --> 03:19:49,035
Come here.

923
03:19:57,284 --> 03:19:58,956
What tape?

924
03:19:59,044 --> 03:20:01,035
And who the fuck are you?

925
03:20:02,244 --> 03:20:04,075
You know the worst part about this job?

926
03:20:04,164 --> 03:20:07,952
Dealing with one lowlife CI aer another.
It's enough to make you sick.

927
03:20:08,044 --> 03:20:12,560
Well, I guess you won't have to bother
with that any more, huh, Judge?

928
03:20:14,404 --> 03:20:16,838
Where'd you hear that?

929
03:20:16,924 --> 03:20:22,635
Let Junior Brown walk, win yourself a federal
judgeship. At least you don't come cheap.

930
03:20:27,324 --> 03:20:29,315
You know,...

931
03:20:30,364 --> 03:20:34,118
..the Junior Browns ofthe world
will always be with us.

932
03:20:35,124 --> 03:20:37,035
What's one Junior Brown more or less,...

933
03:20:37,124 --> 03:20:40,480
..compared to the work that I can do
as a federal judge?

934
03:20:41,644 --> 03:20:45,796
I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a greatjudge.

935
03:20:46,564 --> 03:20:48,794
Let's see what happens
when I go to the papers.

936
03:20:48,884 --> 03:20:53,958
With what? "Fuck with the bull,
you get the horns"? What is he, a matador?

937
03:20:54,484 --> 03:20:58,716
Besides, the last I heard that tape
got ate by the garbage monster.

938
03:21:08,844 --> 03:21:11,438
(footsteps)

939
03:21:14,684 --> 03:21:16,675
Jimmy?

940
03:21:19,684 --> 03:21:22,278
You got a phone call.

941
03:21:23,964 --> 03:21:26,956
- Hello?
- How soon can you get to Baby Cakes?

942
03:21:27,044 --> 03:21:28,762
- Whatyou doin' there?
- How long?

943
03:21:28,844 --> 03:21:30,596
I don'tknow... 20 minutes.

944
03:21:30,684 --> 03:21:33,835
- 20 minutes. Don't be late.
- Jimmy...

945
03:21:35,644 --> 03:21:37,441
Shit!

946
03:21:52,924 --> 03:21:54,323
Hey!

947
03:21:58,684 --> 03:22:00,675
Hey! Junior.

948
03:22:04,404 --> 03:22:05,883
What's shakin'?

949
03:22:05,964 --> 03:22:10,037
- What are you doin' here?
- I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

950
03:22:10,124 --> 03:22:12,115
You killed a fed.

951
03:22:12,964 --> 03:22:16,036
- How the hell did you walk on that?
- Shit happens.

952
03:22:16,124 --> 03:22:19,082
You blew his brains all over me,
his people know that...

953
03:22:19,164 --> 03:22:22,600
How did they even let you live?
"Shit happens."

954
03:22:22,684 --> 03:22:24,197
"Shit happens." I guess so.

955
03:22:24,284 --> 03:22:27,913
Did you tell the cops
how metal in my mouth makes me gag?

956
03:22:29,724 --> 03:22:31,715
Cos it was a funny thing.

957
03:22:32,644 --> 03:22:34,953
I couldn't get plastic forks in jail.

958
03:22:36,804 --> 03:22:39,364
I had to eat everything with my fingers.

959
03:22:41,804 --> 03:22:43,795
What the hell...?

960
03:22:50,404 --> 03:22:52,872
How did you swing it, Junior?

961
03:22:52,964 --> 03:22:54,761
I'm dyin' to know.

962
03:22:54,844 --> 03:22:59,440
Now is not the time, my man,
but I'm gonna see you real soon.

963
03:23:00,884 --> 03:23:02,363
Let's go.

964
03:23:02,444 --> 03:23:04,355
Get back. Easy. Easy...

965
03:23:04,764 --> 03:23:06,755
(screaming)

966
03:23:10,884 --> 03:23:12,875
Get over there.

967
03:23:17,804 --> 03:23:19,874
See me now.

968
03:23:19,964 --> 03:23:24,003
Jimmy, answer me this. Who do I visit first?

969
03:23:24,604 --> 03:23:28,722
You at your house,
or your wife and kid up at Grandma's?

970
03:23:32,844 --> 03:23:36,041
You don't like the taste of metal
in your mouth, huh?

971
03:23:37,044 --> 03:23:38,955
Open up.

972
03:23:39,044 --> 03:23:41,239
Come on, Junior.

973
03:23:41,324 --> 03:23:43,315
Say "ah".

974
03:23:44,404 --> 03:23:45,553
(wheezes asthmatically)

975
03:23:45,644 --> 03:23:47,999
You saw what I did to Omar?

976
03:23:49,564 --> 03:23:51,555
Guess who's next.

977
03:23:52,204 --> 03:23:53,796
No!

978
03:24:00,084 --> 03:24:02,075
Don't touch him!

979
03:24:02,804 --> 03:24:04,556
(roars)

980
03:24:11,924 --> 03:24:14,358
You know this don't end with you, right?

981
03:24:17,564 --> 03:24:23,082
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take your baby girl
for another walk in the woods.

982
03:24:24,324 --> 03:24:25,677
No!

983
03:24:33,044 --> 03:24:35,035
(wheezes)

984
03:25:29,524 --> 03:25:31,515
Hold on. Whoa!

985
03:25:32,044 --> 03:25:34,035
Now you did it.

986
03:25:38,004 --> 03:25:42,998
Don't you know you can't go around
hittin' the police. Huh?

987
03:25:43,084 --> 03:25:45,359
What's wrong with you?!

988
03:25:48,444 --> 03:25:50,594
Come on. Get up. Get up!

989
03:25:52,004 --> 03:25:53,642
Don't move. Huh?

990
03:25:53,724 --> 03:25:55,715
(siren)

991
03:25:59,164 --> 03:26:01,519
- What do we got?
- Assaulting an officer.

992
03:26:01,604 --> 03:26:03,595
(Junior) Nobody can touch me!

993
03:26:04,204 --> 03:26:06,195
Nobody.

994
03:26:09,244 --> 03:26:11,235
Jesus, I'm sorry.

995
03:26:15,124 --> 03:26:20,482
You got anything you wanna explain to me,
you suicidal son of a bitch?

996
03:26:23,204 --> 03:26:25,479
- (Junior) Fuck.
- I ain't suicidal.

997
03:26:25,564 --> 03:26:29,796
With this tape, you can drop Junior
down the hole for 30 years.

998
03:26:30,524 --> 03:26:33,755
You still gotta get Zioli to prosecute.

999
03:26:36,484 --> 03:26:38,634
(Junior) You saw whatl did to Omar?

1000
03:26:40,404 --> 03:26:42,395
Guess who's next.

1001
03:26:43,284 --> 03:26:44,797
So what?

1002
03:26:44,884 --> 03:26:47,352
What'd he do to Omar? He didn't specify.

1003
03:26:47,444 --> 03:26:49,321
You don't like that tape?

1004
03:26:49,404 --> 03:26:51,395
Well...

1005
03:26:56,564 --> 03:27:00,273
How about this one?
They would love it on TV.

1006
03:27:00,364 --> 03:27:02,320
What's one JuniorBrown more orless,...

1007
03:27:02,404 --> 03:27:06,238
..compared to the work
that I can do as a federaljudge?

1008
03:27:06,324 --> 03:27:11,239
I'm a goodgoddamn prosecutor,
but I willmake a greatjudge.

1009
03:27:13,564 --> 03:27:15,839
You like that one better?

1010
03:27:19,084 --> 03:27:22,599
I reindict Junior, you gotta take the stand,
start all over again.

1011
03:27:22,684 --> 03:27:24,800
Nah. I think I'm gonna get lost.

1012
03:27:24,884 --> 03:27:29,275
My family's health is in your best interest,
so you better do a good job.

1013
