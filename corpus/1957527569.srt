00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,852
So what do you wanna do?

3
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,690
Thought so.

4
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,273
What's the matter?

5
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,208
Nothing,
just slow down a little bit.

6
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:51,844
Yeah, right.

7
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,179
Perry, I'm serious.

8
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,955
I really like your car.

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,892
Yeah, it was Ricky's.

10
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,628
Oh right, sorry.

11
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:13,598
He was killed by that bastard
son of a bitch.

12
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,570
I swear to God it was,
worst night of my life.

13
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:22,942
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,947
Yeah, this car is all I have to
remember him by.

15
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:34,519
Well, maybe, this will make you
feel better.

16
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,029
What was that?

17
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,263
No stop, stop.

18
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:46,498
I definitely heard something.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,501
It came from over there.

20
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:53,639
What are you doing?

21
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,275
Hello?

Hey Tyler, is that you, bro?

00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,784

Oh, you know what?

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,632
This really isn't funny now.

27

You bastard.

47

Your hand shakes,
'cause you have doubt.

You ain't gonna pull
that trigger.

49

Fuck you.

50
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,719
I don't have any doubt,
you killed my friends.

51
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:01,087
Your friends got in my way.

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,222
And you'd kill me too,
if given the chance.

[Damon chuckles]

54
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,765
If I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be having this

55
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:15,968
conversation with each other
right now, would we?

56
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,304
You liked killing them.

57
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,839
Well, that should make
no difference

58
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:24,977
because killing comes easier
for some people,

59
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,212
somebody like me.

60
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,546
It was never supposed
to be like this.

61
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,183
You promised you never
would have done that.

62
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,753
The ring had to be secured

63
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,889
and your fucking friends
stood in the way.

64
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:37,823
Fuck you!

65
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,925
Stop saying that!

66
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,761
I needed the ring.

67
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:44,562
And I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

68
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,866
You will be compensated.

69
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,667
You son of a bitch!

70
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,704
Drop the gun
or I'll throw this

71
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:54,240
fucking butcher knife
right into your head.

72
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:55,674
I'm not afraid of you.

73
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,809
Not anymore.

74
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,881
The Chief put a bounty
on your head.

75
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,282
I kill you and bring him
the mask

76
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,251
and I'll have all the money
I ever need.

77
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:08,287
You really think the Chief is
gonna let you live?

78
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,990
First the ring,
and now the mask.

79
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:13,859
An evil wind blows through him.

80
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,298
The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

81
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,903
I'll take my chances.

82
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,344
Adrianna,
the curse is alive.

83
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,947
DAMON: An evil wind blows
through you, too.

84
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,718
The weakness of the enemy
creates our strength.

85
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,788
From this strength,
we can thrive.

86
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:45,357
We can thrive in life,
and in death.

87
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:51,163
After all, all those before us
are not really dead.

88
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,032
Their hearts can beat
in the souls

89
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,733
that they leave behind.

90
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,903
There is dignity in passing from
this world

92
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:05,711
After all, the tragedy of life
is not death.

93
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,314
The tragedy of life is what we
let die inside of us

00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:37,616
- Oh, fine.
- Come on.

182
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:43,622
Look at it.

183
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,024
Look at this shit.

184
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,493
Try to make an honest way
out there.

185
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,962
Without gambling other people's
money, handouts

186
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,230
sucking people dry, you know.

187
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:54,366
Good luck.

188
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,104
Now look.

189
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:01,974
Even if he did survive,

190
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,678
Tocho's thugs
would have finished him off.

191
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:09,081
They don't like leaving things
on unfinished.

192
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,650
Right?

193
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:14,052
And neither do I, okay.

194
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,554
As a matter of fact, Kevin,

195
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,055
go arrest that
son of a bitch.

196
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,425
Oh, from your lip, Sheriff.

197
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,059
I've been waiting for
those words all day.

198
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,594
As a matter of fact,
me and the Chief in a room

199
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,596
for about, I don't know,
10 minutes,

200
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:26,298
you're not even gonna need
an arraignment from this guy.

201
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:28,000
WALSH:
Hey!

202
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,601
Just pick him up,
like I said.

203
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,236
Okay, Kevin?

204
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,271
I've been... that's what
I've been trying to do

205
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:33,640
the whole time with pleasure.

206
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:41,714
So um,
you got any friends

207
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:44,283
you can talk about this with?

208
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:47,386
Nobody really understands it.

209
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,255
WALSH:
What um... what about um...

210
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,758
- Javon?
- WALSH: Yeah.

211
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,358
Yeah, he just likes
to make jokes

212
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,494
and never really wants to
talk about anything.

213
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,529
Give it time.

214
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:58,698
It'll pass.

215
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,433
Okay.

216
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,438
Hey, thanks for staying
so late, okay, Adrianna.

217
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,140
- Sure.
- WALSH: Appreciate it.

218
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,241
You need a lift home?

219
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:10,542
No, um, I think I'm good.

220
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:11,477
You good?

221
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:12,745
- Yeah, have a goodnight.
- Goodnight.

222
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah, you too.

223
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:14,714
This fucking guy.

224
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,048
WALSH:
I know.

225
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:16,716
JOHNNY:
Hey, how you doing?

226
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,016
Hi.

227
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,520
PRICE:
Wow.

228
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,324
- Evening, officers.
- WALSH: What are you doing?

229
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,426
JOHNNY:
Fucking gorgeous out, right?

230
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,460
What are you doing here, Johnny?

231
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,495
JOHNNY:
I'm loitering.

232
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:30,496
You're gonna bust me for it?

233
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:31,764
[Walsh chuckles]

234
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:34,199
- PRICE: You know her?
- Phew, I wish.

235
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,168
Not a lot of real life heroes
in this town.

236
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,070
Present company excluded,
of course.

237
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,171
You're fucking funny, Johnny.

238
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:40,539
Stay away from her, okay.

239
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,474
What are you her dad?

240
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,376
It's a free country,
Deputy Price.

241
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,645
Johnny, you want me
up your ass again,

242
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,513
'cause if you do,
just say the word.

243
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:51,416
Oh, you know,
as tempting as that sounds,

244
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,720
sounds like you want it
a lot more than I do.

245
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,487
But don't worry.

246
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,556
I won't tell your girlfriend
about it.

247
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,590
No stop!

248
00:14:58,624 --> 00:14:59,458
Ah fuck!

249
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,126
Deputy Price!

250
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,363
Your hands are so firm
but soft.

251
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,231
I can't imagine
why your wife left you.

252
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:07,332
WALSH:
Deputy Price back up.

253
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,467
You might be hurting him.

254
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,301
Oh yeah,
am I might hurting him?

255
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,269
[Grunts]

256
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,270
And the hair pulling, too.

257
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:13,272
You know just how I like it.

258
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:14,373
JOHNNY: I'm usually
on the other side though

259
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,307
I'll make an exception
for you.

260
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,375
PRICE:
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,744
Shut up!

262
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:19,244
I could end you whenever
I want, you know that.

263
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,146
And no one would know anything.

264
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,514
I beg to differ.

265
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,850
Your boss is right there.

266
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,251
He doesn't always see
everything Johnny.

267
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,553
So watch your fucking step,
greaseball.

268
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,453
[Grunts]

269
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,388
I'm watching you.

270
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,323
All right, dad.

271
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:32,825
Anybody got a body cam?

272
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:33,793
- Hey.
- Shut the fuck up.

273
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:35,127
[Groans]

274
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,563
I was just about
to leave anyway.

275
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:38,631
WALSH: We're watching you,
we're watching you.

276
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:39,666
And I'm watching you, too.

277
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,833
WALSH:
Get out of here.

278
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,267
Get the fuck out of here,
Johnny.

279
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,101
What, you lost some speed, you
asshole.

280
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:43,803
Fucking pigs.

281
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:45,404
[Mimics pig squealing]

282
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:51,811
I really think
you're getting there

283
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:52,845
with the crow pose.

284
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,379
I don't know.

285
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,614
I felt like a baby
learning how to walk.

286
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:56,783
You've been to like
five classes.

287
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:58,483
Give it time.

288
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,218
I don't know, when am I gonna
stop being so sore?

289
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,754
Depends on the person, but
that's why we're here now.

290
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:03,488
Put in the work
and then numb the pain.

291
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,525
You think if I flash
the bartender,

292
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:07,459
he'll give us free drinks?

293
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,161
[Chuckles]

294
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:09,896
I don't know, maybe you should
ask your boyfriend.

295
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:12,865
Ooh hmm, you're sneaky.

296
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,467
Baby, this is my friend
Adrianna from yoga.

297
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,336
Yeah,
she's been talking about you.

298
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,671
She's not as bendy as me yet,

299
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:20,572
but she's a hot shot
wedding planner.

300
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,573
Yeah.

301
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,141
What do you say baby?

302
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,409
You wanna get married?

303
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,712
[Chuckles]

304
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,312
I don't know
if I can commit to someone

305
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,815
who goes around flashing
bartenders for alcohol.

306
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:29,716
Oh no, baby.

307
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:31,283
It's all top shelf.

308
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,205
Adrianna?

309
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,374
Adrianna!

310
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,909
Damn, how many have you had?

311
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,243
Sorry.

312
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,681
Don't even think about it.

313
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,181
That guy's a fucking creep.

314
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,218
Yeah, he's giving me
weird vibes.

315
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,420
Skins fish at the docks.

316
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:10,657
ZACK: Just like they say
he did to his ex-wife.

317
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,492
To be fair,
she was a royal bitch.

318
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:14,827
Hmm, emphasis on "was".

319
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,795
[Tina chuckles]

320
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,229
What?

321
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,831
Yeah, I haven't seen her
in months.

322
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,667
It's probably all bullshit,
but...

323
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,968
Cum-wad!

324
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,770
Why don't you go
take a shower, yeah,

325
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:25,370
and get the fuck out of here.

326
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:30,442
Anyways so, do you wanna do
a girl's trip this weekend?

327
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:32,712
Zack has family plans
and well, drinking alone

328
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:33,578
makes me feel like
an alcoholic.

329
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,313
[Chuckling]

330
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,214
Come on, let's be honest,
you kind of are an alcoholic.

331
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:37,449
I said feel like one.

332
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,451
Ah, I think that could be
lot of fun.

333
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:40,452
Uh, vacation rental?

334
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,821
Uncle's lake house actually.

335
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,290
He died last month
and well, I scored a key.

336
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:46,224
Oh, I'm so sorry.

337
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:47,627
Oh, don't be.

338
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,728
He was a total prick,
but it was the best thing

339
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,830
he ever did for me.

340
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,965
Okay, so well where's
the place?

341
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:54,332
Black Raven.

342
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,637
Uh, yeah, um...

343
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,805
Don't worry.

344
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,605
It's not near Liberty Manor.

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,541
You won't even have to see
it on your way up.

346
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,477
Yeah, um, I don't know.

347
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,379
It'll be totally chill.

348
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,581
Think of it as a work trip.

349
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:10,950
What do you mean?

350
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,585
It's great for outdoor weddings.

351
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:15,587
And it's totally gorg during
the spring.

352
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,523
Come, check it out,
take some photos.

353
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,760
Your clients would love it.

354
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:23,629
[Indistinct chatter
in background]

355
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,667
Oh, my car just got here
actually.

356
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,401
Um, but I'll... I'll text you.

357
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,536
Hey, think about it.

358
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,805
ADRIANNA:

<i>Chief Matty Tocho of the
Wampanoag Indian Tribe</i>

409
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,259
was arraigned in federal court
today

410
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,227
on 20 counts of federal
racketeering,

411
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:17,797
money laundering
and embezzlement.

412
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,865
He is also facing eight counts
of murder

413

to commit murder.

If convicted of all crimes,

Chief Tocho could be facing
multiple life sentences

with no chance of parole.

417
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:30,977
However, it is thought that
the prosecution will move

418
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,145
to seek the death penalty.

Uh, you know, I'm...
I'm going away with Tina

540
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:15,194
for the weekend actually.

541
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:16,462
She invited me upstate.

542
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:18,264
Tina...

543
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,300
Ooh, the one that puts those
booty videos on her socials.

544
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,901
Yeah, I know her.

545
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,537
Right, uh anyway um,

546
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,439
she asked me to go to her
uncle's house upstate

547
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:28,407
for the weekend.

548
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,475
Wait, what?

549
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,243
Uncle's house?

550
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:33,012
Another mansion
owned by rich white guy

00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:34,413

for a second.

553
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:36,815
Come on, Javon.

554
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,250
How well do you even
know her?

555
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:39,885
Not as well as you do
apparently

556
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:40,919
with you following
her page like that.

557
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:41,887

Look, I'm an ass guy.

That's beside the point, okay.

561
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,892
I'm worried this is gonna
trigger you.

562
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:48,560
You just said it best yourself.

563
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:50,529
Personify your fears
and then trivialize it.

564
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:51,497
Right?

565
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,599
Hmmm.

fucking smelly basement.

You're really messed up,
you know that, right?

Huh?

Hey.

You don't wanna talk, huh?

I kind of like the quiet myself.

These guys here though,

582

they don't like quiet
so much.

So when you're ready, uh,

00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,576
feel free to make as much noise
as you need to.

hear too much down here.

No.

Why am I not surprised?

I'm not taking his side.

about what your mom

Well now, technically
I haven't left the store yet,

00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,354
That's incredible.

904
00:43:48,387 --> 00:43:50,022
A couple of drinks out here
will put your mind

905
00:43:50,055 --> 00:43:51,257
at ease, girlfriend.

906

TINA: It's so nice here
in the summer.

909
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,864
Too bad it's too cold
to go swimming.

910
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,366
Yeah, but I didn't bring
a bathing suit.

911
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,968
You could have skinny dipped.

912
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,038
Wanna see my favorite room?

913
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:12,311
Okay, keep your eyes closed.

914
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:14,079
Eyes closed,
we're almost there.

915
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:14,947
Okay, ready?

916
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,315
Mhmm.

917

What the fuck, Tina?

919

It's sick, right?

920

This is everything that came
from Liberty Manor.

Where did you get this?

922

Well, Larsens closed up shop,
and well,

off their hands.

924

Some of this stuff is really
fucking valuable,

to do with it.

Yeah, no shit.

Listen to me carefully,

All of this stuff is cursed.

and you don't want

00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:04,930
Yeah but you haven't even seen
the best item here yet.

940
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:10,302
My uh, prized possession.

941
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:19,211
Where did you get that?

942
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,547
I saw you.

943
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,182
What?

944
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:27,119
On the beach, burying it.

945
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:29,421
No, no, no, Tina you should not
have taken that.

946
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:30,589
You should not have
done that.

947
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:32,925
It's just a mask.

948
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,126
You killed the creep.

949
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:35,027
He was the threat.

950
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,428
Not that thing.

951
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:37,296
Don't tell me what I know
and what I don't know.

952
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:38,130
That mask is cursed.

953
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:39,264
Bullshit.

954
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,299
Are you kidding me?

955
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:41,533
Everything in here is cursed,

956
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:42,635
and it all started
with that ring.

957
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:45,904
Tell me what happened.

958
00:45:45,938 --> 00:45:47,272
Let go of me.

Where were you the first time
you saw him?

The first time
you saw Damon?

- What?
- Who did he kill first?

962
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,045
Stop it.

963
00:45:53,078 --> 00:45:54,213
It wasn't all about the ring.

964
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:56,014
He enjoyed the killings, right?

965
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:56,949
Why are you doing this?

966
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:58,050
Because I need to know.

What are you talking about?

You just sent me a text
on your burner phone

said you met with Tocho.

988

What's going on?

989
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:58,444
I still don't know what you're
talking about

990
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:00,112
and I ain't got
no burner phone.

No, well I do.

in here, no.

Oh no, I don't want that.

You're right.

You have no fucking clue

1100
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:28,513

leaving your corpse

for your family,

1102

this up, Chief?

1106
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:42,995

1107

00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:00,646
I hope that creepy Mr. Greene
didn't try to make

1114
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,514
a move on you.

1115
00:52:02,547 --> 00:52:05,417

tits since 2003.

1116
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,719
No, he was fine.

1117
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:08,353
I know he's a little eccentric,

1118
00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:09,956
but I think he was really sorry
at the end of it.

1119
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:11,758
Too little too late
for that.

I wasn't expecting this.

They're so chill, I promise.

1124

I just felt like you needed
a little party.

1125
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:25,537
I know you would have said
no if I asked.

1126

It's not just that.

1127
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:28,607
What do you mean?

1128

Tina, that room,
with all of that stuff.

1129
00:52:31,644 --> 00:52:33,612
I get intense, I know.

1130
00:52:33,646 --> 00:52:34,881
Intense?

1131
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:36,414
You had me pinned up
against a wall.

1132
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,617
But I really love curses
and legends,

1133
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:40,519
and haunted houses,
and all that shit.

1134
00:52:40,552 --> 00:52:41,988
Yeah, and I get that,
but I almost died

1135
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:43,689
at Liberty Manor.

1136
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:45,925
So I get why Mr. Greene's
weirded out by all of this.

1137
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,760
I'm sorry I didn't mean
to trigger you.

1138
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:51,097
I just, I felt like maybe
it would help you, you know.

1139
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,832
It would help you get over
your fear.

1140
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:55,467
Yeah.

1141
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,003
You're right.

1142
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,105
Maybe I should just loosen up
and have a good time.

1143
00:52:59,138 --> 00:53:01,506
Plus, you can write
a tell-all book

1144
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,975
and make a shit ton of money.

1145
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,678
And I'll only ask
for 10 percent,

1146

to everyone else.

to freaking do it, okay.

is ever necessary.

you freaking buy it, okay.

great-ass time.

00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:48,721

at the house

1262
00:58:48,754 --> 00:58:50,356
at the party, yeah.

1263
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:52,691
I locked myself out,
they're in there

1264
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:54,827
blasting the music partying
and I'm banging on the door,

00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,061
nobody can hear me.

1266
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:57,296
Do you have like a spare key

1267
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,831
or anyway I can get
in the house?

1268
00:58:58,864 --> 00:59:00,366

and I'm off duty.

from me again,

on the door louder,

He murdered a cop,

01:26:46,799 --> 01:26:47,700
to conform...

1800
01:26:48,935 --> 01:26:50,502
to capitulate.

1801
01:26:57,677 --> 01:27:00,146
But there is no honor in that.

1803
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:13,458
And for the weak

1804
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:15,761
even death

1805
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:17,864
could not bring
a peaceful sleep.

But death...

1810
01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:05,443
is waiting for all of us.
