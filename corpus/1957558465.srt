Hey, I know, why don't we give them a month of cable?

00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,750
I mean, we don't have cable anymore,

14
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,190
so give it to somebody else.

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,320

How about we have a night where we're not talking about bills or

27
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:58,705
Thinking of starting a business.

28
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:01,940
>> David: [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: What?

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,480

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,950

Okay, you played football.

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,980
>> David: I did. >> Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,338
All right, just do me a favor tonight.

63
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,187

I just love to meet our neighbors right away.

83
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,800
You know, it's such a shame when neighbors go years without even

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,570
knowing each other's names.

85
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,360
Don't you agree?

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,917

87
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:21,370

88
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,400

>> Speaker 3: We're still getting settled, but

104
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,210
I wanted to put up Trent's art.

105
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,960
It really feeds him.

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
Being a mortgage broker feeds his mind,

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,440
but his art really feeds his sole.

108
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,990
>> David: So, he's a mortgage broker.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,230
>> Speaker 1: Wow. It's so I know isn't it amazing?

110
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,385
>> Speaker 3: Trent created this on our wedding night.

111
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,545
Didn't you honey?

112
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,440
>> Trent: You know, when I was studying with the sacred Hopi

113
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,680
tribes of Peru, they taught me that

114
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,430
you give your beloved a gift on your wedding night.

115
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,250
So I gave her my blood.

116
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,960
>> David: You painted this with blood?

117
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,720
>> Trent: Well, blood is life!

118
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,025
And life is all about the sensual.

119
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,756
Am I right?

120
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:47,620
>> David: Sure.

121
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,023
[LAUGH] >> Trent: So naturally I painted

122
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:55,340
this piece with the most sensual instrument the Goddess endowed.

123
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,421
>> David: You painted this with blood on your dick?

124
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:04,641
>> Speaker 3: So pure isn't it?

125
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,361
>> David: Sure.

126
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:09,497
[LAUGH] >> Speaker 5: So

127
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:12,724
just [INAUDIBLE] much ado about nothing, I feel black and

128
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:16,510
white was the only artistic choice he had with that movie.

129
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,370

130

kill himself before ever making it.

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,740

There seems to be a misunderstanding here.

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,250
Do we really seem like we're out of sorts here?

263
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,940

I'm going to say no.

You ever woken up with a strange feeling that you have

276
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,550
no idea what happened last night but it's probably pretty bad.

00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:55,360
now you need to go.

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,820
My pool man is coming.

286
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,510
It needs to be drained.
