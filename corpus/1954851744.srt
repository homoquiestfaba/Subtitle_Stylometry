1
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,735
- [heart beating]
- [sirens wailing]

2
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,841
Dad?

3
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:56,516
- [woman] Zachary!
- [dog barks]

4
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:02,520
- [continues barking]
- [heart continues beating]

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,045
[creaking]

6
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,718
[heartbeat speeds up]

7
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,462
[gasps]

8
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,899
- [crickets chirping]
- [dog barking in distance]

9
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:07,715
<i>[man] For those of you who do not know.</i>
<i>this is how it began.</i>

10
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,256
<i>Zachary Small</i>
<i>was an ordinary little boy.</i>

11
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,825
<i>He lived with his ordinary father</i>

12
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:22,739
<i>in an ordinary house</i>
<i>in an ordinary town.</i>

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:28,145
<i>What Zachary did not know.</i>
<i>could not know.</i>

14
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:33,174
<i>was just how unordinary he was.</i>

15
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,254
<i>I had heard the stories</i>
<i>of young Zachary and his fearlessness.</i>

16
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:46,424
<i>I had seen. with my own eyes. his</i>
<i>selfless acts of bravery and courage.</i>

17
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,731
<i>And I knew. deep in my heart.</i>
<i>that he would return to rescue me</i>

18
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:55,433
<i>when I was imprisoned</i>
<i>in the dungeon that last time.</i>

19
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,942
<i>Just as the prophecy decreed.</i>

20
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,478
<i>he would restore me</i>
<i>to my rightful place</i>

21
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:05,882
<i>to the kingdom</i>
<i>he had long since abandoned.</i>

22
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,250
<i>But days turned into months.</i>

23
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,084
<i>and months into years.</i>

24
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:15,059
<i>And my certainty faded.</i>
<i>until all that was left was despair.</i>

25
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:20,622
<i>Then again.</i>
<i>stories are living things.</i>

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,636
<i>Given to turns unpredictable.</i>

27
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:41,248
<i>Nothing could prepare Zachary</i>
<i>for what was to come.</i>

28
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,686
<i>for what he would become.</i>

29
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,502
<i>Like all boys. he had grown older.</i>

30
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,063
<i>But had he forgotten his purpose.</i>
<i>had he forgotten the prophecy?</i>

31
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,974
<i>His destiny?</i>

32
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,208
<i>What follows is all I know to be true.</i>

33
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,945
<i>If there was a road</i>
<i>leading Zachary back to himself.</i>

34
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,386
<i>it could only move in one direction:</i>

35
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,050
<i>Through the very heart of Neverwas.</i>

36
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,676
This place will kill me.

37
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,952
It never ends.

38
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,152
Dr. Reed?

39
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,620
It's really nice to meet you.

40
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,563
Would you hand me that...
that whatchamacallit,

41
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,602
- that bucket of, um, patching stuff?
- Oh, sure.

42
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,432
I'm at war with the ceiling.

43
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:11,340
And losing, by the looks of it.
[chuckling]

44
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,074
Yeah, the whole building
is conspiring to fall down around me.

45
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,489
- Did I get your name?
- Sorry. I'm Zach Riley.

46
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,558
We spoke on the phone a few weeks back.

47
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,287
I speak to a lot of people.

48
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,693
I'm here about
the psychiatrist position.

49
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,732
Oh, right. You're the... You're...

50
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,357
Dr. Riley.

51
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,994
- You were on staff at Cornell.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,264
Oh, thank you.

53
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,034
- Sit down. Move those files.
- All right.

54
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,339
I love your clinic, doctor.

55
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,744
It's got a certain amount of character

56
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:52,443
that you don't, uh,
you don't find everywhere.

57
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,682
Can I, uh, speak honestly
with you, Dr. Riley?

58
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,156
Yeah, call me Zach.
And yes, absolutely.

59
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,788
This is not really the kind of opening
that you're looking for, Zach.

60
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,799
I read your proposal.
It's very impressive.

61
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,734
M.D. at Yale,
your clinical work at Cornell.

62
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,363
I just don't think you
would make a good match here.

63
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,738
The AMA's declared
that we're not even worthy of funding.

64
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,902
I'm surprised you even heard about us.

65
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,503
I'm sorry that you made
a trip for no reason.

66
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,107
And if you'll excuse me,
I have group in a few minutes.

67
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,914
[laughs] That's it.
We're not even gonna talk?

68
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,252
On your way out of town,
stop at the pub on Main.

69
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:35,589
They have a great Irish stew.
Massive chunks of lamb.

70
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,926
You don't understand.
I'm counting on a position at Millwood.

71
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,898
No one counts on a position here.

72
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:45,130
Dr. Reed, I'm really not
gonna take no for an answer. So...

73
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,102
Please. Hear me out.

74
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,507
I had an acquaintance who was a patient
at Millwood a long time ago.

75
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,410
Whatever treatment he received,
it didn't do him good.

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,713
For me, coming back here is about giving
the patients what my friend never got.

77
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,015
I'm serious about this.

78
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,751
I mean, I've already
rented a place in town.

79
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,690
Pretty confident.

80
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,524
What can I say? I want the job.

81
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:15,898
- One month.
- I'll take it.

82
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,937
- On trial. No benefits.
- Fine.

83
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,767
Deal.

84
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,033
Come with me.

85
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,376
Down here we have the doctors' offices
and intake rooms.

86
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,008
Most all our patients
are low or non-functioning.

87
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,848
Sad to say, we no longer
have an out-patient program.

88
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,479
All but one of my wards
have been shut down.

89
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,217
Funding cuts, of course.

90
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,192
- [door buzzing]
- Development is what we're all about.

91
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,161
I've got an insurance claim for you.

92
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,857
I look forward to it, Michael.

93
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,234
- [Reed] Hello, Bernadette.
- [woman] Would you sign this?

94
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:58,242
- Yeah. Just give me a second.
- Sure.

95
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,509
Just sign right there.

96
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,356
[woman] Are you Zachary Pierson?
He's right down the hall.

97
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,162
[Reed] ...I'd like you
to handle group C.

98
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,895
- You can introduce yourself.
- I'm sorry?

99
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,029
I'd like to introduce you
to the group you'll be running.

100
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,674
- [indistinct chatter]
- [door opens]

101
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,802
I'm sorry I'm late, everybody.

102
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,278
Terrence. Group.

103
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,657
[man] Come on, everybody.
Join the group.

104
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,990
- Dick. Dick?
- Yeah?

105
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,499
I'd like you to meet Dr. Riley.

106
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,057
- Hello.
- Gonna be taking the place of Karen.

107
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,433
I know you all miss Karen,

108
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:37,134
but I think we can
give Dr. Riley a chance.

109
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,938
[Zach] It's nice to meet you all.

110
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,946
As Dr. Reed said,
my name's Dr. Riley,

111
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,141
but you can call me Zach if you'd like.

112
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,185
I'm looking forward to getting
to know and talking to you.

113
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,222
This is Martin,
he's one of our interns.

114
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,554
- Welcome to the Mill.
- [Zach] Thank you. Good to meet you.

115
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,323
Maybe we should go around
and introduce ourselves.

116
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:03,128
Gabriel, my man.
Feel like joining us today?

117
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,167
Well, Gabriel,
if you do ever change your mind,

118
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,606
we would love to have you join us.

119
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,200
[Zach] Hi, Gabriel.

120
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,112
My name's Zach.
I'm gonna be here from now on.

121
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,652
I'm Eleanna.

122
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,345
[Zach] Eleanna?

123
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,391
- Nice name.
- Do you mind if I smoke?

124
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,791
Jake, you know you
can't smoke in group.

125
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,626
[Jake] Dr. Riley
doesn't mind if I smoke.

126
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,065
Dr. Riley doesn't know the rules.

127
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,068
I can't stand his looking at me.

128
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,571
I can't.
He's on every layer of my fourth.

129
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,608
On the first layer of my fifth.
Communication, survival.

130
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,644
Protection shield, flame.

131
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,646
I'm not keeping anything in it
not conducive to free will.

132
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,807
[Reed] Leave her alone.

133
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,647
- [mumbling]
- Sally. Don't think about it!

134
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,778
Too much for even you!

135
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,541
Can I get you something to eat?

136
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:29,075
Yeah. I hear you guys have
the Holy Grail of lamb stews.

137
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,644
You got it.

138
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,019
[woman] I don't believe it.

139
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,023
This is crazy.

140
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,131
- You Zach Pierson?
- I could be.

142
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,069
It's me!

143
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,697
Hello, you.

144
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:52,573
Oh, come on, man.
Maggie. Maggie Page.

145
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,908
- Maggie?
- From when we were little.

146
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,141
I was a tomboy. Freckles. Jack...

147
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,218
Jack Page's sister.
You lived at the Thompson house.

148
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,753
- Yeah. My grandma's.
- Oh, my God!

149
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,083
What happened to you?

150
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,717
After that summer, we moved to Vermont,
with my aunt, where we stayed.

151
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,251
- Right. Your parents. I forgot.
- Yeah, no.

152
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,298
But I've been back here for a while.

153
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,426
Staying at my grandmother's and I was
up in this area doing some research.

154
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,405
I'm just over there.
You wanna come sit with me for a minute?

155
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,566
All right.

156
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,409
The thing I remember most about you

157
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,039
is you used to stand
outside our front gates.

158
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:33,243
Just stand there. Right?

159
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:37,152
Not exactly my proudest moment.

160
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,555
But, hey, what little kid
didn't love your dad's books?

161
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,957
So what do you do now?

162
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,858
- I'm in grad school.
- Really?

163
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,624
Yeah, I'm working on my thesis.

164
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:48,188
It's good to see you, Maggie.

165
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,704
- Yeah. You too.
- So, um...

166
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,331
Do you wanna order something?

167
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,706
Actually, I gotta go.
I'm running a little bit late.

168
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:03,214
But, um, like I said, I'll be down
at my grandma's for a while.

169
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,944
Well, I'm at Millwood now.

170
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,384
- As a therapist, of course.
- Oh.

171
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:13,019
- What?
- Very interesting.

172
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,389
I got decorated by a schizophrenic.

173
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,021
She was having a bad day.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,764
- You have to go.
- Right.

175
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:33,467
So I'll be up in the area tomorrow
doing some research.

176
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,241
I'll be here around the same time.

177
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,731
[phone ringing]

178
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,774
- Hello.
- <i>[woman] Honey! Oh!</i>

179
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,612
Do you know I've
left you four messages.

180
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,345
Seriously. Where've you been?

181
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,511
<i>Ah... Yeah. Mom.</i>

182
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:16,747
Sorry, I just...

183
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,154
I've been busy.
Sorry I haven't called.

184
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:20,782
You're not the only one.

185
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,487
I tell you, this has
been the week from hell.

186
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,053
[laughs] Why?
What've you been doing?

187
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,826
<i>[mother laughs] Nothing.</i>

188
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,564
Which, to my constant amazement,
is absolutely exhausting.

189
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,606
<i>You need to get out of that house.</i>

190
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,071
<i>Take a vacation.</i>

191
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:41,078
So, tell me, darling,
how's your new place?

192
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,841
I took a job today,

193
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,078
<i>and don't get all dramatic</i>
<i>when I say this. Mom. but...</i>

194
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,517
<i>I'm working at Millwood.</i>

195
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,079
What? Why would you go back
to that terrible place?

196
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,455
Well, maybe to make it not so terrible.

197
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,689
You gave up your position
at Cornell for Millwood.

198
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,354
<i>Is this some kind ofjoke?</i>

199
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,524
It's not a joke. It's a job.

200
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,728
Zachary, you know what day is coming up.

201
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:09,968
And you know how hard
this time of year is for me. Always.

202
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,272
You know all this,

203
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:16,713
which makes your choice
all the more cruel.

204
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,047
<i>Of course. you're no stranger</i>
<i>to cruelty when it comes to me.</i>

205
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:22,279
You know what, Mom? I've got to go.

206
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,049
<i>[phone beeps off. dial tone]</i>

207
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:36,023
[sighs] OK.
Before our group sessions,

208
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,535
I wanted to meet
with each of you individually.

209
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,629
[man] I come from this real small town.

210
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,266
It's the kind of place where people...

211
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,036
...never talk a whole lot.

212
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,475
I play the piano.

213
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,571
I mean, um, I used to.

214
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,513
Hi.

215
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,654
They were exposed.
And he was too blind.

216
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,820
I never ever hurt those children.

217
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:08,730
I know that the CIA
is sometimes watching me.

218
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,961
And the thing is I have this fiancée.

219
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,164
And she wants to see me here.

220
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,208
And I don't know if she'll understand.

221
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,905
[laughs]
I don't even understand.

222
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,452
Hello, Gabriel.

223
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,684
Would you like to talk?

224
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,192
[whispering]
I know it's you.

225
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,010
<i>[Reed] Gabriel Finch</i>
<i>will be your first patient.</i>

226
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,952
<i>He's been in and out of hospitals</i>
<i>for nearly 40 years.</i>

227
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,184
<i>Three months ago.</i>
<i>the county brought him in.</i>

228
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,625
<i>He dismantled a few bulldozers</i>
<i>on a construction site</i>

229
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,424
<i>in the mountains north of here.</i>

230
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:15,023
<i>Gabriel has never uttered</i>
<i>a word to any therapist.</i>

231
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,661
<i>until today... to you.</i>

232
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,552
[gasps]

233
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,350
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

234
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,119
Gabriel. I didn't
see you standing there.

235
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,192
All right, thank you for coming.

236
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:49,722
Messy office. Why don't you
sit down. We can get started.

237
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,736
[sighs]

238
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,610
So is there anything...

239
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,172
...in particular
that you'd like to begin with?

240
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,411
Anything in particular?

241
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,488
You. Here.

242
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:13,080
Your cool indifference.
Let's begin with that.

243
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,059
- OK.
- You've changed, boy.

244
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,029
I've changed? We've just met.

245
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,031
There's something gone missing.

246
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,158
Something not right behind the eyes.

247
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,204
You think I'm hiding something.
What would I be hiding?

248
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,000
Don't get me wrong.
I understand the need for secrecy

249
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,735
in this dungeon we're in.

250
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,369
I mean, you are talking
to someone who understands

251
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:37,778
the vital need for discretion in my...
Our predicament.

252
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,478
But there hasn't even been
the slightest sign or signal from you,

253
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,923
and I look for signs and signals,
given my position, my responsibility!

254
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,721
- You know that!
- OK. Gabriel?

255
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,762
[shuddering]

256
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:55,231
You seem to be getting a little upset,
so let's slow down for a little bit.

257
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,768
And I haven't gone
by Zachary for a long time.

258
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,862
- You can call me Zach.
- That's impossible!

259
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,238
- You're taking this charade too far.
- Help me understand.

260
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,750
Are you feeling calmer?

261
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,187
Are you feeling anything at all?

262
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,780
Why don't we start over.

263
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,088
We should talk
about what brought you here.

264
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,096
What bought you here
is a far more interesting question.

265
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,691
OK, well, I came here to help you.

266
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,531
I...

267
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,699
...don't believe it.
Of course! [laughing]

268
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,538
- Go on.
- Yes.

269
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,372
It makes sense now. Clear as day!

270
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,970
Clear as day. Tell me about that.

271
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,778
Something's been done to you.
It's a dark spell

272
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,150
to erase your thoughts
and the memory of your youth.

273
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,587
To make you forget.

274
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,621
Hmm?

275
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,665
Good, good, good.
What does that mean to you?

276
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,706
We'll stop here.

277
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,909
Statues made of snow, Zachary.

278
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,086
We don't have much time.

279
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,492
[woman] I'm almost off, hon.

280
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,535
All right.

281
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,137
Hi.

282
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,792
<i>[Maggie] "It wasn't until Friday morning</i>
<i>that Zachary would find the map.</i>

283
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,837
<i>leading him to the rock</i>
<i>on the other side of the mountain</i>

284
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,101
<i>that was the entrance to Neverwas.</i>

285
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:20,871
The monstrously hideous wizard,
Ghastly Lapeer,

286
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,073
had kidnapped Zachary's father

287
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,241
to keep him from restoring the land

288
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,683
to its former beauty and bright spirit.

289
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,517
It fell upon Zachary
to journey into Neverwas,

290
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,753
and rescue the king
from Ghastly's dungeon.

291
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,625
Only then could the king
fight Ghastly's minions

292
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,561
that were attacking his castle,

293
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,331
bent on destroying
the last bright thing in Neverwas."

294
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,702
- I love this book.
- Me too.

295
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,580
- [whispering] Wanna know a secret?
- What?

296
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,985
[whispering]

297
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,858
Funny you should say that.
I was thinking about that time

298
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:12,624
there was a bunch of kids playing
in the woods. You were there. We...

299
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,790
We got totally lost! I was there.

300
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,300
I was tagging along,
to everyone's annoyance.

301
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,269
We were lost out there for hours.

302
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:23,831
But the thing I remember
most about that day was that it was you.

303
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:27,275
You found our way back to the road.
Remember?

304
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,439
- I guess I did get us out of there.
- Yeah.

305
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,144
Isn't that amazing,
how one summer so long ago

306
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,916
can just stand out
amongst all the others.

307
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,549
So what are you doing your thesis on?

308
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,857
The contrast between deciduous
trees of the upper Hudson.

309
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,864
I'm a botanist.

310
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:49,058
Before I forget...

311
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,696
I told you how much
I love your dad's book.

312
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,772
- Yeah.
- Well...

313
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,968
I use it as a purse sometimes.

314
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,442
- You've got to be kidding me.
- No.

315
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,979
- You're a collector.
- Since I was a kid.

316
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,606
And look at this.

317
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,388
My parents gave this to me
the Christmas before they passed away.

318
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,020
This... is the
most important thing I own.

319
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,991
[girl] Excuse me?

320
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,560
Are you Zachary Small?

321
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,573
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

322
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,611
Come on, honey.

323
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,347
- All right, I spilled the beans.
- I go by Riley now.

324
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,477
My mother's maiden name. I don't, uh...

325
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,579
...like to talk about my father's book.

326
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,715
- Sorry.
- Not a big deal. It's just,

327
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,918
it really has
nothing to do with me. So...

328
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:53,521
- He wrote it for you.
- Yeah, well... Um...

329
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,123
- It's not great literature.
- It's a classic!

330
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,465
It's just a silly fairy tale.

331
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,060
Have you ever read it?

332
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,705
- You've never read it.
- Of course I've read it.

333
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,306
Why don't you skim through this.

334
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,348
I think it'll do you good.

335
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,777
Wait. You're just gonna...?

336
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,379
Don't think I can talk to you
until you've read it.

337
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,425
- You're gonna leave?
- I'm gonna call you.

338
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,985
- I'll expect a book report.
- Maggie!

339
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,865
Maggie!

340
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,097
Come on!

341
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,418
[man] "Zachary Small took off
through the forest

342
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,621
lain waste by Ghastly,

343
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,529
the once-good wizard

344
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,625
turned ugly and diabolical

345
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:07,762
by the use of black magic.

346
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,366
Zach's best friend would be a flying pig

347
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,501
named Bastion,

348
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,344
whose first language was,

349
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:21,146
of course, Pig Latin."

350
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,777
[chuckling]

351
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,719
Come here, come here.

352
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,222
Ah, yeah.

353
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,727
Oh, my boy. My boy.

354
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,963
[Zach] Jake and I have just
had a conversation.

355
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,563
And I think there's something that Jake
would like to say to the group.

356
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,576
Jake.

357
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,442
I wanted to say... [laughs]

358
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,077
I have a fiancée.

359
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,251
She's coming up
this weekend for a visit.

360
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,492
[sobbing] I don't want her
to see me like this.

361
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,293
Maybe if you plan out what
you're going to say to her,

362
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,631
- you would feel less frustrated.
- I'm not frustrated!

363
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,636
I'm just tired.

364
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,972
Tired.

365
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,945
<i>A truth that's told with bad intent</i>

366
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,983
<i>Beats all the lies you can invent</i>

367
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,314
<i>It is right</i>
<i>It should be so</i>

368
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,617
<i>Man was made forjoy and woe</i>

369
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,055
<i>And when this we rightly know</i>

370
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,184
<i>Through the world we safely go</i>

371
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,957
<i>Joy and woe are woven fine</i>

372
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:17,161
<i>A clothing for the soul divine</i>

373
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,328
<i>[man] Man was made forjoy and woe</i>

374
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:23,932
<i>Joy and woe are woven fine</i>
<i>A clothing for the soul divine</i>

375
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:26,169
[mother] Thomas,
don't let Zach hear.

376
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,337
[Thomas] Where's my joy, Katherine?

377
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,506
That's what the hell
I wanna know. Huh?

378
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,014
Don't let Zachary hear you.

379
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,313
He's just a little boy!

380
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:36,148
Doesn't matter!
He knows I'm numb!

381
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:40,020
Zach doesn't judge me, Kate.
He doesn't judge me at all!

382
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:44,050
- There's no judgment!
- [sobbing]

383
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:34,304
Oh, Dad!

384
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,926
<i>[man talking over intercom]</i>

385
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,971
- Gabriel.
- Ah!

386
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:57,654
I mean, don't ever creep up on me
when I'm making an entry.

387
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,988
Sorry. I thought you saw me come in.

388
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:03,822
Did others see you?

389
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,964
I don't know. Would that
be a problem if they did?

390
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,796
You sound like a complete fool.

391
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,065
I was wondering where you heard
that poem you recited earlier.

392
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,903
- You can't have disappeared.
- Focus on the poem, not about me.

393
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:19,840
It has always been about you.

394
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:24,075
Especially now, in this moment
of crisis, with just four days left.

395
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,015
Your bravery.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

396
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,383
- Let's save this for our session.
- Oh! It's such a shame.

397
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:33,981
Everything you ever were
has been replaced by total fear.

398
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,755
And your skin! You wear your skin
as if it's three sizes too small

399
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,887
and barely stretched over your bones.

400
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,124
Gabriel, please!

401
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,564
We have to find what you lost, Zachary.

402
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,102
For both our sakes!

403
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,393
Zachary, look who's here. [laughs]

404
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,526
- [Maggie] Hi.
- [Katherine laughs]

405
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,233
Don't just stand there
like a bump on a log. Come in!

406
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,936
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, hello, hello.

407
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,444
Maggie stopped by earlier.
It... She wanted your phone number.

408
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,416
- It seems...
- I said I was gonna call,

409
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,919
and I realized
I didn't have your number. So...

410
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:14,151
I just told her to come
back and ask you herself.

411
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,388
Um...

412
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,326
Well, you two catch up.

413
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,163
And I'll go make sure
that everything is perfect.

414
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,235
[Maggie] Thank you.

415
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,371
[Maggie] I have always wished
that they made a movie of <i>Neverwas.</i>

416
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:36,607
[laughs] Thomas would
never give up the rights, ever.

417
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:42,550
No. He hated himself for approving that
merchandising that they did for a while.

418
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,554
I used to collect that. All of it.

419
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,783
Maggie is Dad's biggest fan, Mom.

420
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:51,089
Isn't that nice.
And what about a boyfriend?

421
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,495
No, I'm too busy for that.
I'm a bit of a workaholic.

422
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,055
Oh.

423
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,102
Do you know that when I met Thomas,

424
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,966
I was studying to be an actress?

425
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,303
Mom has a flair for the dramatic.

426
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,334
And then, of course,
Zachary was born.

427
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,506
- Maggie doesn't want to hear this.
- Sure, I do.

428
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,709
Sure, she does.

429
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:17,242
I'd never seen Thomas so happy.

430
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,484
I do believe, from that moment on,

431
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,424
Zachary was his only reason for living.

432
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,327
This torture can
stop any time you want.

433
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,228
Why does that story upset you?

434
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:32,065
Because it's not true.
And lies upset me.

435
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:36,868
Zachary has conveniently blocked out
all happy childhood memories,

436
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:41,002
which make it almost
impossible to reminisce.

437
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,239
Reminisce about what, Mom?

438
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,748
About the good times we had.

439
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,376
Oh, OK, the good times. Let's see. Um...

440
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,649
You, after Dad died, I remember that.

441
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,657
I did the best I could, Zachary.

442
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,193
With what I had. I did the best.

443
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,752
- Why don't you have some more wine?
- Stop it!

444
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,826
It's working at Millwood
that's doing this to you.

445
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,096
We can't possibly
be having this much fun.

446
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:18,574
Honey, why don't you
help me with dessert.

447
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:29,217
I haven't seen you like this
since before you left for college.

448
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:32,295
Let's just stop. I was out of line.

449
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,489
I assume you haven't been sleeping.

450
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,226
I can deal with it.

451
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,860
But you were doing so well for so long.

452
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,064
Don't jeopardize everything
that you've accomplished.

453
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,233
Just tell me how
you want me to act, and I will.

454
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,473
I want whatever...

455
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,845
...this is,

456
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,648
whatever we are... to be all right.

457
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:07,357
Well, [laughs]
let's have our cake.

458
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:20,209
<i>[man] Mr. T.L. Pierson. what an honor</i>
<i>this is to have you as my guest.</i>

459
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,643
- <i>[Thomas] Thank you.</i>
- <i>[audience claps]</i>

460
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:26,580
<i>[man] First. why don't you tell</i>
<i>my audience at home about</i> Neverwas.

461
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,982
Neverwas.

462
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:33,183
Neverwas, <i>on the surface.</i>
<i>is really quite simple.</i>

463
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:38,217
<i>In essence. it's the story</i>
<i>of a little boy whose mother died.</i>

464
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,629
<i>and who lives with his father.</i>
<i>Daniel. a janitor.</i>

465
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,364
<i>Although Zachary feels</i>
<i>embarrassed about his father.</i>

466
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,340
<i>he thinks he's embarrassingly average.</i>

467
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:54,172
<i>it turns out that Daniel</i>

468
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,738
<i>is the king of a once great land...</i>

469
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,546
<i>...called Neverwas.</i>

470
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,783
<i>which lies on the other side of a</i>
<i>mountain not far from where they live.</i>

471
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,154
<i>And... [sighs]</i>

472
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,252
<i>Well. you should read the book.</i>

473
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,432
<i>[man] Mr. Pierson.</i>
<i>critics have speculated</i>

474
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,369
<i>on the symbolism held</i>
<i>within your often bleak images.</i>

475
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:23,463
<i>Do you care to comment?</i>

476
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,443
<i>No.</i>

477
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,748
<i>As far as I'm concerned.</i>

478
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:38,311
<i>the work speaks for itself. That's it.</i>

479
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,405
I don't believe it.

480
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,313
I'd like to talk about this
in today's session, if you don't mind.

481
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:05,282
I'd like to talk about this
in today's session, if you don't mind.

482
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:15,484
<i>Neverwas.</i> Does that mean
anything to you, Gabriel?

483
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,084
- You remember?
- I figured it out.

484
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:21,726
- I noticed the symbol you drew...
- Yes.

485
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,131
...is the reverse image
of the royal crest...

486
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,668
Yes, well, that's it!

487
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,830
So it was my little clue
that triggered your memory.

488
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,373
I knew it would.

489
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:34,605
Amazingly simple,
but it removed Ghastly's spell.

490
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:39,615
I can see your strength returning.
You've come so far, Zachary.

491
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:42,243
But there's no time for celebration.

492
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,321
We need to discuss our plan.

493
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,981
Let's begin with what
<i>Neverwas</i> means to you.

494
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,423
Have you lost your...?

495
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,626
Then again,
it could be an elaborate trick.

496
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,428
Can't be too careful.

497
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:02,268
- You say you know about Neverwas.
- Right.

498
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,433
What does the fruit
of the Dribblebush taste like?

499
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,602
I wouldn't know, they're poisonous.

500
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,704
How long is the Twisted Neck River?

501
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,875
From the Tourmaline Mountains
to the Sea of Simplicity.

502
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:18,081
- And what's a Gralloch?
- A lazy giant.

503
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,454
Ghastly Lapeer, how did he
come to look as he does?

504
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,688
He cast a spell on Zachary
which backfired, blowing him up.

505
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,161
He was pieced together
by Snarling Minions.

506
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,562
Oh, my God, you remember!

507

[laughs] The spell is lifted. Ah.

508
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,999
- We've got to act quickly.
- Let me explain.

509
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,509
Gabriel, please, I need you to listen.

510
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:43,137
Just listen. Right. Absolutely correct.

511
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:49,985
A good plan needs
a thoughtful discourse. Proceed.

512
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,991
This might be hard for you to hear.

513
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,996
Could there have been,
is it a possibility,

514
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,090
that there was a book called <i>Neverwas?</i>

515
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,691
You have to stop this.

516
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:06,531
You are refusing to understand me.

517
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:10,801
I have so little patience left.

518
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:12,239
I need help.

519
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:15,607
- And I really want to help you.
- No, you don't!

520
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,807
I'm the only one taking the action.
Taking the risk.

521
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:22,818
It was me who blew up the Razor Sharps
on the edge of the Nightmare Bog!

522
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:27,152
But it was a trap.
Ghastly and his Minions were waiting.

523
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,058
- They brought me back to this dungeon.
- Why would they bring you?

524
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,655
Because they wanted me gone.
Away from the castle,

525
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,566
so that I wouldn't be there to defend it
when they attack, in three days.

526
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,603
That's what the order has pronounced.

527
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,572
So, you see, we have to act quickly.

528
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,335
I can't do it on my own.

529
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,173
Help me understand
why they want your castle.

530
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,772
Isn't that obvious by now?

531
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,883
I am the king!

532
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,946
I am the king of Neverwas.

533
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,657
[Zach] Doctor, I'm running into
some unexpected issues

534
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,528
with, um, with Gabriel's case.

535
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,328
What kind of issues?

536
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,961
I mean, for starters...

537
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,601
...he's completely delusional,

538
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:21,007
the subject of his delusion
being a fairy tale.

539
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,444
One my father wrote.

540
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,516
- Your father?
- T.L. Pierson.

541
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,347
It's funny you didn't mention that.

542
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:32,183
I did say that I had an acquaintance.

543
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,615
Oh.

544
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,821
Go on.

545
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:44,868
The point is Gabriel believes
that he lives in Neverwas.

546
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,459
That he's actually the king.

547
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,700
And I assume... [laughs]

548
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,071
...that he believes that I'm...

549
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,406
...the boy sent to rescue him.

550
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,244
There's always some counter-transference

551
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:02,012
with patients with delusional
or schizophrenic psychosis.

552
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,553
I don't know how to help him.

553
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,723
I'll leave it up to you.

554
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,859
How long has it been
since you've slept? Tell me.

555
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,558

Look, Maggie,
let me ask you a question.

600

This is hypothetically speaking.
But... [sighs]

601

What would you say if somebody,
a delusional person,

Talk to me.

I probably should have never
gone back to Millwood.

611
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,563

Do you?

682
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,123
<i>[beeper beeping]</i>

683
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,259
I gotta go, Jake.

684
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:17,107
You left this outside in your bag.

685
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,240
Gabriel looked through it
and had a complete meltdown.

686
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,581
He broke away from the orderlies.
He's barricaded in his room.

687
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,747
- [Reed] I don't wanna...
- Destiny!

688
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,291
Gabriel, you OK in there?

689
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,827
- Who is that?
- Gabriel, it's me, Zach Riley.

690
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:33,156
Zachary.

691
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,934
Let me go in first. Please.

692
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,036
I don't know what you are waiting for.

693
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,869
Gabriel, I am so sorry
that you saw this.

694
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,768
What is...?

695
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,939
The prophecy is about to be fulfilled

696
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,678
and you still haven't completed your
task: That which was promised.

697
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,014
[Reed] We'll take it.

698
00:55:57,086 --> 00:56:00,715
Oh, yes, you and your guards
can lock me up in this cage,

699
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,248
you can torture me with your
poison pills and electric shocks,

700
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,558
it's been done before.
But I will not give in to you!

701
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,035
Hide that!
Keep it close, you hear me?

702
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:14,831
To the death! You!

703
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,967
To the death!

704
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,141
Who I am! Where I'm from!

705
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,145
[Zach] Where did you get this?

706
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,647
Zachary knows, don't you? Zachary!

707
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,410
Don't let the guards take the journal!

708
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:33,455
- Where did you get it?
- [Reed] You've done enough!

709
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,219
- Stop now!
- Who gave it to you?

710
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,358
<i>[Thomas] Dear Gabriel.</i>

711
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,294
<i>Of all the things one says and does.</i>

712
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:45,494
<i>I look back on what never was.</i>

713
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,401
<i>Then think of all that life could be</i>

714
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,905
<i>if I could capture what I see.</i>

715
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:53,669
<i>Gabriel. I hope life finds you well</i>

716
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,576
<i>and that your kingdom remains at peace.</i>

717
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,707
<i>Your trusted friend. Thomas.</i>

718
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:04,048
1965.

719
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,850
"This journal is a historical document

720
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,654
particularizing the details
of the land of Neverwas,

721
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,823
its history, inhabitants and
geographical points of interest."

722
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,818
Martin told me you
were coming down here.

723
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,286
Gabriel's back in his room.

724
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,991
- We had to sedate him.
- Look at this.

725
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,193
This is Gabriel Finch's journal,

726
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,362
which gives detailed descriptions
of the land of Neverwas,

727
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,668
years before my father
thought of his book.

728
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,265
Almost a decade before!

729
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,277
And this letter,

730
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,471
he sent to Gabriel,

731
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,673
I wasn't even born yet.

732
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,774
Gabriel's been in and out
of hospitals for 40 years.

733
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:10,409
He was at Millwood.

734
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:14,047
- That was before my time.
- It's right here.

735
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,125
They were here together. Listen.

736
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,752
It says my father "seems to be fixated

737
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:23,821
on the world of a young
patient, Gabriel Finch."

738
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:29,867
Doesn't make sense. Gabriel came up
with Neverwas, before he met my father.

739
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,271
No, he didn't come up with it,
he lived it.

740
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:34,104
It's all very real to him.

741
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,735
Part of his elaborate delusion.

742
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,508
It's right here.

743
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,015
Gabriel's admissions intake,
30 years ago,

744
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:44,780
detailed that he had "a paranoid
delusion that one day people will come

745
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:48,551
and take the land he is living on."
He said a wizard named Ghastly

746
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:50,717
was sending an army for his castle.

747
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,318
That's basically the plot
of your father's book.

748
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,660
He based his book on Gabriel's fantasy.

749
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:59,428
- It's an A.A. Milne sort of thing.
- What?

750
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,266
He wrote <i>Winnie-the-Pooh.</i>

751
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:06,535
He based the character of Christopher
Robin on his own son, Christopher.

752
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:09,805
Yet the Hundred Acre Wood
was a real forest.

753
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:12,813
Or Lewis Carroll
who wrote <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

754
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,909
He created the elaborate
fantasy of Wonderland,

755
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,318
yet Alice was based
on a little girl he knew.

756
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,447
Your father might have done the same.

757
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,584
Put me into Gabriel's delusion.

758
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,220
One man's insanity

759
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,491
is another man's children's book.

760
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,123
It's a fine line.

761
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:36,103
- I have to talk to Gabriel about this.
- No, that's impossible.

762
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,141
You have your own agenda for being here,

763
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,541
and it has nothing
to do with my patients.

764
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:46,070
So not only am I taking you
off Gabriel's case,

765
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:50,448
but I'm forbidding you
to ever speak to him again.

766
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,077
Did you hear what I was saying?

767
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:55,590
To be honest, I'm more concerned
about your own mental state.

768
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,359
I'm well aware
of my mental state, doctor.

769
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,192
I have everything under control.

770
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,233
Then you can come up
to my office tomorrow morning.

771
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,825
We'll discuss what we can do.

772
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,201
For right now,
I'm asking you to leave.

773
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,241
Get out of my clinic, Dr. Riley.

774
01:00:21,817 --> 01:00:23,978
[brakes squeal]

775
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:28,849
[doorbell rings]

776
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,499
Maggie?

777
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,504
Hello?

778
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,502
Maggie?

779
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,781
[whispering] Maggie?

780
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,856
Maggie.

781
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,246
<i>[man] Today the world mourns the loss</i>
<i>of children's book author T.L. Pierson.</i>

782
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:02,216
<i>Pierson gained national attention</i>
<i>with his children's book.</i> Neverwas.

783
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:05,412
<i>He is survived</i>

<i>[Maggie on tape]...a piece</i>
<i>commemorating the life of Pierson.</i>

785
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:16,556
<i>on the 25th anniversary of his death.</i>

786
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,328
<i>T.L. Pierson sold</i>
<i>over 50 million copies of</i> Neverwas.

787
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,636
<i>His son Zachary has never</i>
<i>touched any of the royalty money.</i>

788
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,874
I wanted to tell you.

789
01:02:34,216 --> 01:02:37,583
Don't freak out on me.
I'm just a friend.

790
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:39,415
- You're my friend?
- Yes.

791
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:42,924
I wanted to tell you, I couldn't.
I got scared of you telling me

792
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:46,553
- you couldn't see me anymore.
- A reporter! Are you kidding me?

793
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,597
I just wanted to know who
the real T.L. Pierson was.

794
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,599
I have nothing to do with my father.

795
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,363
Listen. Zach, wait. Please.

796
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,268
Zach! Can you stop?

797
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:58,431
Please wait. Please.

798
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:00,873
Everything that happened
between us was real.

799
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,809
Do you think I want this
complication, this confusion?

800
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:08,509
Well, I don't. I like things
to be nice and clean and this isn't.

801
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,644
I'm sorry if <i>Neverwas</i>
meant nothing to you.

802
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,348
Sorry if it represents
something dark and painful.

803
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:17,950
But for me,
and for millions of people,

804
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,460
that's all we had.

805
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:23,692
Zach, I needed something
better than my life.

806
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,257
And your father, he gave that me,

807
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:30,101
he gave me something hopeful.

808
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:34,506
I wanted to write about that,
about the hope.

809
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,279
But there isn't any here, is there?

810
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,849
Get out of my way, Maggie.

811
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:12,539
[siren wailing]

812
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,619
Dad?

01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,534
<i>[police radio chatter]</i>

814
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,772
[Zach] This keeps
getting weirder and weirder.

815
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,229
[Katherine] Zachary!

816
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:07,915
[door shuts]

817
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:24,963
I didn't know where else to go.

818
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,040
You knew my father.

819
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,672
Yes, of course.
Thomas was my friend.

820
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:38,018
- He wrote to you.
- Yes, we wrote.

821
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,749
That letter you found is one of many.

822
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,787
We was a worthy counselor.
He listened...

823
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,422
...and he believed.

824
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:51,089
Believed in what?

825
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:54,135
What lies through the Mossy Rock.

826
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,865
Gabriel, please.
What are you talking about?

827
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,497
Neverwas.

828
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,468
And he more than believed in it.

829
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:05,809
He often used to come
and visit me there...

830
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,250
...on the other side of the mountain.

831
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:16,015
My kingdom, boy, there.

832
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,030
That mountain,
that's where he used to go?

833
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,224
For days, weeks.

834
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:28,201
I was beginning to doubt
the truth of your coming.

835
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,633
Then I read the oracle.

836
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,001
I kept it hid from the guards.

837
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,545
I don't understand.

838
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,549
Thomas, in these pages,
wrote of your coming for me.

839
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,781
It's the secret oracle of Neverwas.

840
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:51,919
You talked about me coming to
rescue you from our first session on.

841
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:55,953
I hoped, and remembered.

842
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:00,532
<i>[Gabriel] You would rescue him.</i>

843
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,662
<i>I hid and watched.</i>

844
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,401
<i>I saw you take him by the hand</i>
<i>and lead him out of this dungeon</i>

845
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,639
<i>as if you were cloaked in invisibility.</i>

846
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:16,248
<i>Ghastly's guards</i>
<i>wouldn't dare stop you.</i>

847
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:24,852
I was just picking him up
after his stay.

848
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,622
That's all. He was sick.

849
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,993
Oh. Poor Thomas.

850
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:32,033
At the end, yes, he couldn't fight.

851
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,592
Ghastly's spell, it destroyed him.

852
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,229
There was no spell.

853
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,908
I wish there was, but there wasn't.

854
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:44,309
- You couldn't have stopped it.
- Yes, I could have.

855
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:48,543
That night, Gabriel,
he was outside my room.

856
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:52,713
I wouldn't open the door. I guess
he just wanted to hear my voice,

857
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,018
to know I loved him,
I needed him a little.

858
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:02,419
[sobbing] Maybe that
would've been enough,

859
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,058
but I let him die.

860
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:08,102
Those are nightmares, dreams.

861
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,071
I had them once. Terrifying.

862
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:13,801
The bottom of a dark hole.

863
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:17,642
Kept quiet. Voice banned. No light.

864
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,407
Never seen.

865
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,382
But that wasn't real.

866
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,955
It was just a dream I once had.

867
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,252
Neverwas is real.

868
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:36,695
You are real.

869
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,700
Saving me is real.

870
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,841
Read this.

871
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,880
You are innocent.

872
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,381
Now you must leave.

873
01:10:59,454 --> 01:11:01,513
Before the guards find you.

874
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,661
Tomorrow, at the day's end,
you must meet me at the Mossy Rock

875
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:19,104
at the edge of the kingdom.
And come alone.

876
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:22,938
Don't be late, or I'll be forced
to battle the Minions on my own.

877
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:25,138
They're not gonna let you out of here.

878
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:27,977
I promise you'll get help.

879
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,517
That's all I ever wanted from you.

880
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,591
Your help, Zachary.

881
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,169
It's inhuman that they don't
let you outside at night.

882
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:54,538
Well, come on, then!

883
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,270
Out of this dungeon!

884
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,847
Come on! [laughs]

885
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,415
All of you!

886
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,617
Feel the night air again!

887
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,310
It begins.

888
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,019
<i>[Thomas] Dear Gabriel.</i>

889
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:44,422
<i>I write to you in hopes</i>
<i>that you are in good health</i>

890
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:48,259
<i>and your kingdom is in safe hands.</i>

891
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,298
<i>This. regrettably.</i>

892
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:53,459
<i>might be my last letter I write to you.</i>

893
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,971
<i>I feel ashamed of who I have become.</i>

894
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,408
<i>Ashamed that I can no longer</i>
<i>fight this battle.</i>

895
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,375
<i>I have been emptied.</i>

896
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,710
<i>This black hole</i>
<i>I have lived in for so long</i>

897
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,943
<i>is growing darker.</i>

898
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,953
<i>even as the love</i>
<i>for my son grows deeper.</i>

899
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,783
I missed you.

900
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,791
I missed you.

901
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:20,521
A lot.

902
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:24,861
<i>[Thomas] How can this</i>
<i>impossible human paradox exist?</i>

903
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,637
[tires screeching]

904
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:41,672
<i>The wizard. Gabriel. he has won.</i>

905
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:46,278
<i>He has banned me</i>
<i>from your world and mine.</i>

906
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:50,814
<i>I existed because I dreamed.</i>

907
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,122
<i>I dream no more.</i>

908
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:10,235
<i>I just wanted...</i>

909
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,042
<i>I want to explain it to him.</i>

910
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,481
<i>[woman] What do you want to explain?</i>

911
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,415
<i>That I love him.</i>

912
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:24,089
<i>Sometimes...</i>

913
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,821
<i>...[sobbing] I just wanna hold him.</i>

914
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,728
[indistinct, sobbing]

915
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:34,565
<i>I walk around and tell him</i>
<i>everything's gonna be all right.</i>

916
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,729
<i>[sniffs] And that...</i>

917
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,638
<i>That I'll be there for him.</i>

918
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,802
<i>And I'll always be.</i>

919
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:46,972
<i>It's in the pages.</i>

920
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:49,812
<i>In the forest.</i>

921
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,179
<i>It's waiting for him.</i>

922
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,992
[phone rings]

923
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,095
<i>[answering machine beeps]</i>

924
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,730
<i>[Zach] Mom. it's me.</i>

925
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,296
<i>Pick up.</i>

926
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:15,909
<i>Mom.</i>

927
01:15:15,977 --> 01:15:18,343
<i>I wanna talk to you about Dad.</i>

928
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:20,539
<i>About that morning.</i>

929
01:15:20,615 --> 01:15:23,311
<i>I know this day is always hard for you.</i>

930
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,277
<i>Are you there?</i>

931
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,957
<i>I love you. Mom.</i>

932
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,196
"Zachary's father screamed..."

933
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,201
[Maggie] "Neverwas was real."

934
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,432
That's my favorite sentence
in the book.

935
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,239
Zach, could I please come in?

936
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:07,445
I wanted to show you the article

937
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,184
that the magazine is going to print.

938
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:15,490
Would you please take a look at it?

939
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,656
Why don't you read it to me?

940
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:19,256
OK.

941
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,666
"Fall leaves on the Hudson.

942
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:29,074
Where to go to see the best
changing leaves in New England."

943
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,045
- Should I go on?
- No.

944
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:35,173
- No, that's pretty good.
- Thanks.

945
01:17:37,385 --> 01:17:40,354
I think the world knows enough
about T.L. Pierson.

946
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,017
The rest...

947
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:49,257
The rest belongs to you, Zach.

948
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,390
I miss him, Maggie.

949
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,168
[phone rings]

950
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,570
- Hello?
- <i>[Martin] Dr. Riley?</i>

951
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,137
- <i>It's Martin.</i>
- Hey, Martin.

952
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:10,673
Look, the cops are here.
Gabriel escaped last night.

953
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:15,121
They're saying he jumped in the back of
a truck heading up the mountain north.

954
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,317
OK. He's going back to the forest.

955
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:20,520
<i>There's a warrant.</i>
<i>They're sending sheriffs to look for him</i>

956
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,620
<i>around that site he messed with.</i>

957
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:26,656
- What's going on?
- What is the name of the company?

958
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,201
Dominion.

959
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:45,014
[Maggie] Did your dad
write down anything to look for?

960
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:48,988
[Zach] Nothing. Signs, turnoffs.
Penciled in this road.

961
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,559
This is impossible.

962
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,689
No, it's not going to be impossible.

963
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,827
[Zach] He told me to meet him
at the Mossy Rock.

964
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,464
The entrance to Neverwas.
It's just forest out here.

965
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:11,811
Wait a minute. Look!

966
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,387
[Maggie] This is unbelievable.

967
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,359
[Zach] Where are you going? Maggie.

968
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,796
- [Maggie] The book. Pumpkin Pine.
- [Zach] What is it?

969
01:19:30,865 --> 01:19:32,594
[Maggie laughs]

970
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,732
Come on!

971
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,644
The Pumpkin Pine! Look!

972
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:47,272
[laughs]

973
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,585
OK. Come on.

974
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:52,779
- Where?
- Come on.

975
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,321
I think I know which way to go.

976
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,084
- For what?
- Don't ask questions.

977
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,127
Just follow me!

978
01:20:03,364 --> 01:20:05,229
It's this way!

979
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,861
Ouch.

980
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,403
[Maggie] You just gotta trust me.

981
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,244
Right through here.

982
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:25,846
I'm telling you, this map
is the key to finding Neverwas.

983
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,459
The Twisted Neck River's
just up ahead.

984
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,658
Here. Thanks.

985
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,744
No way.

986
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:02,048
[Maggie] The River Knight.

987
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,550
- It's incredible.
- It's real.

988
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,232
The Mossy Rock
is just beyond this tree.

989
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,534
- He wants me to come alone.
- Forget it.

990
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:20,471
No. You have
to do something for me.

991
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,702
- No.
- Yes...

992
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,243
- I've come this far...
- Go.

993
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,779
I set something into motion.
I need your help.

994
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,577
Call my lawyer.
He'll tell you what to do.

995
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,617
Thank you.

996
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,448
Wait.

997
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,630
I don't believe it.

998
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:26,333
- I knew you would come.
- [gasps]

999
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:29,899
- You scared me!
- You scare easily.

1000
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:32,742
We have to talk, Gabriel, right now.

1001
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:36,113
About the minions. What I know
you're thinking of doing to...

1002
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:37,947
I've been to the castle and back.

1003
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,988
Reinforcements have been made.
All precautions taken.

1004
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,949
Why are you waiting?

1005
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:50,897
Neverwas lies here
on the other side.

1006
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:59,200
You want to talk?
You must come through the rock.

1007
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,197
Gabriel! [grunts]

1008
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,844
The first step is a tricky one.

1009
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:39,310
Thanks for the heads up.

1010
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,177
Can you see them?

1011
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:46,118
- What?
- The Grace Fairies.

1012
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,712
They're flying all around, you see?

1013
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:51,953
There! And there!

1014
01:23:56,597 --> 01:23:59,225
They've missed you, Zachary.

1015
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:04,830
Gabriel, listen to me.

1016
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:07,466
I need you to come back with me.

1017
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,511
Back? There is
only forward from here!

1018
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,876
That is if you're going
to see what your father saw.

1019
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,974
This air, you breathe it in, boy.
That will bring you back.

1020
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:18,916
Gabriel!

1021
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,190
[Gabriel] Still with me?

1022
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,800
Only forwards from now!

1023
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,199
Come on, boy! Keep up.

1024
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,248
- It's here.
- Oh, yes.

1025
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,416
Go and have a look, boy.

1026
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:06,365
Zachary, my boy! [laughs]

1027
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,636
Home.

1028
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:29,616
You must be famished.

1029
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,854
Come on!

1030
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,528
Good boy.

1031
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,273
[Gabriel] You just look around.

1032
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,239
Home.

1033
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,351
Safe.

1034
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,360
Make yourself at home.
I'll get you something to eat.

1035
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:27,036
That's right.

1036
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,677
Makings of a feast.

1037
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:47,225
The moments before a battle
always seem quieter than usual.

1038
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,354
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

1039
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:53,457
- You mustn't worry about details.
- No. I wanna apologize to you.

1040
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,695
What for?

1041
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,328
Well, because you were under my care

1042
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:02,240
and I let my own issues
cloud my judgment.

1043
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,801
I never meant to help you escape.

1044
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,246
It was your destiny.

1045
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,613
I'm afraid if they come,
when they come,

1046
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,653
you or somebody else will get hurt.

1047
01:28:12,753 --> 01:28:14,914
The Minions?
You're worried about them?

1048
01:28:15,022 --> 01:28:17,923
- You talk as if they're human!
- They are!

1049
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,892
They're not! They're evil, Zachary.

1050
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,792
I need you to listen to me.

1051
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:24,194
Go snatch your beans.

1052
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:25,960
[siren blares]

1053
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:28,363
They're here.

1054
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,302
<i>[radio chatter]</i>

1055
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:40,509
They've crept in
like snakes in the grass.

1056
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,708
[man] You guys, come with me!

1057
01:28:50,057 --> 01:28:51,388
[man] Gabriel Finch!

1058
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:54,121
This is Sheriff Williams
of Saranac County.

1059
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,857
I'm serving you with your
court-ordered eviction!

1060
01:28:56,931 --> 01:29:00,298
I will never give you my kingdom!

1061
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,666
You will never have it!

1062
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,762
You have to vacate the premises.

1063
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:08,002
- I will never leave!
- Stop it!

1064
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:10,043
Don't be afraid, Zachary.

1065
01:29:11,812 --> 01:29:13,302
The castle is reinforced.

1066
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:16,043
Those are sheriffs.
If you don't let me go out there

1067
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:18,347
and talk, they'll break in.
They have guns.

1068
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:21,650
I would rather die where I stand,

1069
01:29:21,722 --> 01:29:24,987
than give the kingdom to you,
do you hear me?

1070
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,956
I want you to think
about what you're doing, Finch.

1071
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:34,566
It'll end for you and your kind!
That's for certain.

1072
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,195
Gabriel, let me handle this.

1073
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:40,297
Zachary, you come
and stand here out front.

1074
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:43,002
You keep watch.
Warn me when they charge.

1075
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,708
- Get the ram.
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:52,176
You need to let me out of here.

1077
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:54,551
- Let me speak to them.
- [Williams] Gabriel.

1078
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,250
I'm asking you to come out on your own.

1079
01:29:57,324 --> 01:30:00,350
You keep watch!
Almost time for my plan.

1080
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,793
What plan, Gabriel?

1081
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,626
Finally, boy, a question worth asking.

1082
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:10,094
What have you done, Gabriel?

1083
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:14,198
I've been reinforcing
my castle for three decades.

1084
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:16,140
Waiting for this moment.

1085
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,768
Bombs are set and waiting.

1086
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:29,214
Stay back! Stay away!
Get away, everyone! Get away!

1087
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,121
Please! Stay back!

1088
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:34,424
Can you hear me?
Stay back! Get back!

1089
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:35,860
Get out!

1090
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,398
[Williams] I want you
to come out the front door.

1091
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,491
Don't make us break the door down.

1092
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,799
- Get ready to go in.
- Yes, sir.

1093
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:45,395
If you blow these bombs,

1094
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,101
I promise you they'll
put you back in the dungeon

1095
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:49,301
and never let you out!

1096
01:30:49,376 --> 01:30:50,809
- [sirens wail]
- You can't!

1097
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,479
[Maggie] Sheriff!

1098
01:30:53,547 --> 01:30:55,276
- Sheriff!
- Maggie.

1099
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:57,681
Sheriff! Zach!

1100
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,880
Zach!

1101
01:31:01,288 --> 01:31:03,119
Maggie, stay away. Get back!

1102
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:06,455
- [man] You need to wait, ma'am.
- Maggie, get back! Maggie!

1103
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:09,655
Statues made of snow.
When will you understand this?

1104
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,163
You can't do this!

1105
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,599
I want you to get on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

1106
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:17,432
Your death is assured.
That you can count on.

1107
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,599
There are people out there.
I have a friend out there.

1108
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:22,801
Do you understand?
Someone I care about.

1109
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,402
You should want to protect this
as much as I do.

1110
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:29,848
Because Neverwas is yours
as much as it's mine.

1111
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:32,181
[banging]

1112
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:37,620
Is that the best you monsters can do?

1113
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,695
You don't need to do this.

1114
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,589
Hold on.

1115
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,835
- Time, boy.
- Gabriel, please.

1116
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:52,372
You were born under a land
of brightness.

1117
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:55,374
No matter what Ghastly
does to try and take it,

1118
01:31:55,442 --> 01:31:57,000
here's where we belong.

1119
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,272
- Listen to me.
- Some things...

1120
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,348
...are worth dying for, boy.

1121
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,151
I've been here!

1122
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,187
- Many times.
- [banging]

1123
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,486
- Why did you come here, boy?
- I needed some hope.

1124
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:16,796
[Williams] Gabriel!

1125
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:18,764
[Zach] You told me
you were in a hole,

1126
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,267
your voice was banned,
nothing made sense.

1127
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:24,168
- Gabriel!
- [Zach] You said that was a dream.

1128
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,799
- Gabriel!
- Where will you hide from them?

1129
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,137
No more hiding.

1130
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,268
[sheriff] Gabriel!

1131
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:31,504
[Zach] Listen to me.

1132
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:32,909
That wasn't real.

1133
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,208
This is real. I'm real.

1134
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:35,805
Do you understand?

1135
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:38,044
You don't have to be scared anymore.

1136
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:40,348
You can stop hiding now.

1137
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,479
Let me help you.

1138
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:45,024
Hold it, hold it.

1139
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:50,089
Gabriel!

1140
01:32:57,338 --> 01:33:00,796
[panting]

1141
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,147
I've nowhere to go.

1142
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:22,194
I can't survive anywhere else, Zachary,

1143
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,288
only here.

1144
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,733
It's the only home...

1145
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,774
...that I've ever known.

1146
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:44,778
Don't let them take it from me.

1147
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:49,182
I won't.

1148
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:54,888
Oh, that's a good boy.

1149
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,543
- Thank you, sir.
- Billy.

1150
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:17,175
Go in the court,
check on a stay of eviction

1151
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,218
for Gabriel Finch.

1152
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:25,792
What use has this world got

1153
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:28,123
for a king without a kingdom.

1154
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:33,530
It needs him.

1155
01:34:35,035 --> 01:34:38,527
- I'm afraid.
- You don't need to be anymore.

1156
01:34:38,605 --> 01:34:42,041
I'm here. And we're gonna go out there,

1157
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:45,169
you and me, into the light.

1158
01:34:45,245 --> 01:34:47,270
Like I did with my father, remember?

1159
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,873
Me first, then you,

1160
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,612
the way it's always been, Gabriel.

1161
01:34:52,686 --> 01:34:56,213
The way it's always been.

1162
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:07,961
"You can always avoid a Minion slaughter
by dousing the beasts with sugar water."

1163
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:11,163
Gabriel, the bombs.

1164
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,604
They were nothing but sugar water.

1165
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,231
Of course, boy.

1166
01:35:17,277 --> 01:35:19,177
Zach!

1167
01:35:19,246 --> 01:35:21,737
Be careful.

1168
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:37,386
My name... is Zachary Small.

1169
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,763
I came through the Mossy Rock

1170
01:35:41,835 --> 01:35:45,202
to rescue the king from his dungeon.

1171
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:48,435
To help defend his castle.

1172
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,935
To stop you!

1173
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,775
All of you.

1174
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:58,679
The time for you all to leave is now.

1175
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,012
And this land.

1176
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:06,451
And this castle...

1177
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:10,826
...is the king's!

1178
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:16,192
It has always been the king's!

1179
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,034
Stand down, boys. Stand down.

1180
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:26,874
You see, Zachary.

1181
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:29,711
Nothing to fear.

1182
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,580
Nothing at all.

1183
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,763
Will you come and visit me?

1184
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:54,797
It can be lonely from time to time.

1185
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,843
Of course I'll come, Gabriel.

1186
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,474
You're a good boy, Zachary,

1187
01:37:01,548 --> 01:37:05,609
as unordinary as they come.

1188
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:29,735
Hi.

1189
01:37:31,044 --> 01:37:32,705
Hi.

1190
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:41,154
- Thought you were gonna go back.
- I am.

1191
01:37:41,221 --> 01:37:43,985
I just wanted to drop something off.

1192
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:46,855
Oh, yeah?
I heard this is a pretty good book.

1193
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,589
It's not bad for a trite fairy tale.

1194
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,895
I thought this was the most
important thing in the world to you.

1195
01:37:53,967 --> 01:37:55,730
It was.

1196
01:38:04,878 --> 01:38:07,938
- You can wait for me, huh?
- Of course.

1197
01:38:09,816 --> 01:38:12,842
I'll see you real soon.

1198
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:34,406
Fantastic job, everyone.

1199
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:50,515
<i>[Gabriel] And so it ends as it began.</i>

1200
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:55,756
<i>with the promise of freedom</i>
