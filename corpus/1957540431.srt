00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,667
I love you.

3
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,208
I love you, Charlie.

4
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,125
I love you.

5
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,458
Are you scared?

6
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm scared, too.

7
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:39,293
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
I love you, Charlie.

8
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
Charlie, I love you.

9
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,750
I love you, Charlie.

10
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,583
Charlie girl, that
shoot was insane,

11
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,750
but I'm finally on a flight.

12
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:31,375
I'm gonna need a drink
when I get home, or 17.

13
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,251
Oh shit, we're taking off.

14
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,458
Happy anniversary, baby.

15
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,791
I love you.

16
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,293
See you tonight.

17
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,833
Oh!

18
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,750
God.

19
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,417
Simone?

20
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,500
Babe?

21
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,917
Hey Barker.

22
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,750
Your mom will be home soon.

23
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,876
Oh.

24
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:20,834
Hey, it's Simone
and you are apparently

25
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,625
someone who still
leaves voicemails.

26
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,042
Kind of weird.

27
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,876
No one does that anymore.

28
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:28,083
How retro.

29
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,792
Hey, it's me.

30
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,208
I can't wait till you
get home. Can you tell?

31
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,083
Sorry, I just, uh, want to
make sure you're on your way.

32
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,208
I thought I heard you come in

33
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,166
and I got really
excited, but, anyway,

34
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,666
I tracked your flight and
it said you got in on time,

35
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,125
so I hope Philly was
good, and the shoot.

36
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,959
Maybe I can be on the next one.

37
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,541
You know, I've been
working on my airbrushing

38
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,583
while you've been
gone, so anyway...

39
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:00,959
Happy anniversary, babe.

40
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,167
I'll see you soon. Okay, bye.

41
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,083
Oh, god.

42
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Barker! God.

43
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,793
Uh Simone, could you...

44
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:39,666
Oh.

45
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,959
For the photo shoot.

46
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,083
I mean, come on,
right? It's good.

47
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,250
It's really good.

48
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,917
Oh, look, it's so fucked up.

49
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,000
Can you imagine being
done here at dark?

50
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,666
It's gonna scare
the shit out of me.

51
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,042
I can't wait, I'm so stoked.

52
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,542
Girl.

53
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,125
Get to the bar and make
bad decisions with me.

54
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,876
Right meow.

55
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,000
Right now, do it now.

56
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,542
Right now, okay?

57
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:27,917
You know what? Fuck this.

58
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,250
I'm calling you.

59
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,625
- Hello?
- Uh, hello.

60
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:40,792
Yo!

61
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,876
The Trap. First round's on me.

62
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,208
Get yo shit, girl.

63
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,667
Are you sure it's
the first round?

64
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,333
Whatever,
your first round.

65
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,333
Don't fucking judge me.

66
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,250
I would never.

67
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,709
- But I can't tonight.
- Why?

68
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,751
I'm waiting for
Simone. Tonight's our-

69
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,041
- Oh, god!

70
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,041
Why am I not surprised?

71
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,208
Oh, yeah. That's right.

72
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,000
It's because you wait on her

73
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,916
like it's your full
time fucking job.

74
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,125
It's all you do
these days, dude.

75
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,208
Come on. You used to be fun.

76
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,375
Remember? Fun.

77
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,292
Hm.

78
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:18,751
Hello?

79
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,416
Yeah, I'm still here.

80
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,083
Oh.

81
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,208
I'm sorry.

82
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,375
I didn't mean to hurt your
feelings, but like low key,

83
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,041
you know that I'm fucking right.

84
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,916
Like, all you do is like cry

85
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,166
and complain about that bitch.

86
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,709
Don't call her that.

87
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,166
I can call her
whatever the fuck I want.

88
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,375
I've known her longer.

89
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,000
Remember?

90
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,792
Thea, it's our
anniversary tonight, okay?

91
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,375
Which you would know if
you ever listened to me.

92
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,041
- Hey, I-
- And I don't wanna

93
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,458
hear anything negative
about the woman I love.

94
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,125
I don't think that's
too much to ask, do you?

95
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,041
Oh, okay. All right.

96
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,083
So where is the woman that
you love right now, huh?

97
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,916
She is on her way home.

98
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,375
There was a shoot
she couldn't pass up

99
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,416
and it was a great
opportunity so she did it

100
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,626
and she's on her
way home right now.

101
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, see, that's exactly
what I'm fucking talking about.

102
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,333
She's never home.

103
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,208
She's always somewhere else.

104
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,416
You're always alone.

105
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,125
And wait, why didn't she ask you

106
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,375
to come with her on this shoot?

107
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,751
If it's such a good
fucking opportunity,

108
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:24,291
why is she hiring some
fucking hack makeup artist

109
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,875
- out of fucking Pittsburgh?
- Philly.

110
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,458
Whatever. It's all gross.

111
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,166
Listen, I know that I introduced
you two, and quite frankly,

112
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,083
I kick myself for that on
like a regular fucking basis.

113
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,792
Thea, cut it out.

114
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,000
I, dude, like,
I'm glad you're having fun.

115
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,166
Oh my
god, mom, really?

116
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,041
You're becoming
a little butterfly

117
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,500
and spreading your wings.

118
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,208
I just wish that you hadn't
moved in with that bitch.

119
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,792
Am I not being clear?

120
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,041
I don't want to hear this.

121
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,709
I'm just saying.
Watch your back, girl.

122
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,041
I know the shit that she
fucking puts people through.

123
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, fucking Simone.

124
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,375
Her reputation precedes her.

125
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,041
I don't even have
to say her name

126
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,166
and people already know who
I'm talking about, yeah.

127
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,833
You know who I'm talking about.

128
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,083
Davey, you definitely know
who I'm fucking talking about.

129
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,958
She's sadistic.

130
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,875
Yeah, I know.

131
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,375
You have told me like
20 goddamn times.

132
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,250
Okay.

133
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,125
Sorry.

134
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,791
Truce.

135
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,291
I'm not trying to hurt your
fucking feelings, I just,

136
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,291
I have your back.

137
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,458
I'm always gonna have your back.

138
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,208
And I don't really think
telling you the fucking truth

139
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,501
and telling you
to open your eyes

140
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:34,208
- makes me a bad friend.
- Simone and I are fine.

141
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,083
She's on her way home
right now and now my...

142
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,208
Charlie don't do this.

143
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,166
Don't get all pissed
off and hang up.

144
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,958
Come on. Don't be lame.

145
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,083
Look, I will talk
to you tomorrow, okay?

146
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,208
Have fun.

147
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,125
Fine, bitch.

148
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:51,917
Bye.

149
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,250
Bye.

150
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,792
Shit.

151
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,875
Hi mom.

152
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:45,833
Oh.

153
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,501
Mom.

154
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:47,833
I can't hear...

155
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,958
Yeah, I ca...

156
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,291
I can't hear you.

157
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,833
Yeah, mom, just
click, click on the...

158
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,291
Oh my god.

159
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,208
Yeah, mom.

160
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,916
Down.

161
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,459
Uh huh.

162
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,584
- And to the le-
- That's it.

163
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,833
Can you hear me now?

164
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,292
Yes, I can hear you.

165
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,125
Hi Char.

166
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,459
Hi.

167
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,584
I never used
this thing, but um,

168
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,958
I thought it would be
nice to see one another.

169
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,042
It's been so long.

170
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,333
Yeah. Hi.

171
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,958
So how is everything?

172
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,375
Must be so many
distractions up there.

173
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,250
Are you still doing your
little makeup projects?

174
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:31,543
Uh, yep.

175
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,041
I'm working as a
professional makeup artist

176
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,083
and things are going
really well, actually.

177
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,166
Oh Charlene, I didn't mean
anything by that, really.

178
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,166
- No, it's fine.
- I mean...

179
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,625
No, no, no, no, no. No.

180
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,291
You were always so good at that

181
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,542
and I'm glad that people are
appreciating what you can do.

182
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,250
And you're doing what you love.

183
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,584
Well, thank you.

184
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,376
I remember when
you were little,

185
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:59,000
you used to put
makeup on every doll

186
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,000
and stuffed animal
that we ever gave you.

187
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,542
Do you remember that?

188
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:05,041
I'd come into your room
and there'd be magic marker

189
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,459
all over them and
blue eyeshadow and,

190
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,666
and rosy red cheeks
and red lipstick.

191
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,542
You had the fanciest
dolls in town.

192
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,958
Yeah, I guess I did.

193
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,542
I totally forgot about
that until right now.

194
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,459
Yeah.

195
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,208
I...

196
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,376
It's good to see you.

197
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,292
It's good to see
you, too, Charlene.

198
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,376
I like that lipstick
color you're wearing.

199
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,292
What's that?

200
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,916
Oh no.

201
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,125
I'm drinking red wine.
They're just stained.

202
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
Oh.

203
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,958
Oh, well what you
look very pretty.

204
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,958
Um hey mom,

205
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,292
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

206
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,250
You said there was an emergency?

207
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,666
Everything's fine.

208
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,750
I just wanted to see you
face-to-face because, um,

209
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,292
because your memaw passed
away last night and-

210
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,501
- Oh, god.
- Just thought

211
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,583
- I should tell you so.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, mom.

212
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,459
Yeah. It's okay.

213
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,583
It was her time, you know?

214
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,208
She was ready to go
back to the Lord.

215
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,417
I'm glad she's not hurting
anymore, really, just,

216
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,583
you know, it was kind
of bad at the end.

217
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,958
God, I wish I could
have talked to her.

218
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,376
Yeah.

219
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:22,750
I mean, we could have called
you I guess, but Charlene,

220
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,000
I just want you to know
she loved you very much.

221
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,000
- She did.
- Oh.

222
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,541
Well, when, when's the funeral?

223
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,083
We're just gonna
have a small thing

224
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,041
so it's really nothing
to fly back for.

225
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,791
Don't worry about it.

226
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,208
No.

227
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,417
No I, I mean, I, I
want to be there.

228
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,625
No, no, no, it's okay.

229
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,583
You don't have to.

230
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,625
I did want to ask you, um,

231
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,251
can you send back that
necklace that she gave you?

232
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,083
I'd like to have
her buried with it.

233
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,708
It was her favorite.

234
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,791
Um, what necklace?

235
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,500
It was the cross, remember?

236
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,292
The gold cross she gave you.

237
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,083
You took it with
you when you moved.

238
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,791
Yeah, um, yeah, I, I
think I have it somewhere.

239
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,791
You think? You didn't
lose it, did you?

240
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,166
No, no, no.

241
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,376
I'm sure it's in my...

242
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,209
Look, I will be able
to find it, okay?

243
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,166
Well, can you go
and look for it?

244
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,666
I'm kind of in the
middle of something, mom.

245
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,292
What do you mean you're
in the middle of something?

246
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,251
I called you and you're
just, you're drinking wine

247
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,750
in that cave of yours.

248
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,666
You can't be that
busy, Charlene.

249
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,251
Come on.

250
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,417
Jesus Christ.

251
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,166
Please don't take the
Lord's name in vain.

252
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,458
Mom, it's not a cave, okay?

253
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,708
I live in a pretty nice
apartment, actually.

254
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,292
Yeah, and I've never seen it
really, so, how would I know?

255
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,708
When you showed
me pictures of it,

256
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,417
it had all those Satanist
things all over the walls.

257
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,625
Satan...

258
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,376
We don't have Satanist
stuff on the walls, mom.

259
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,376
They're antiques. Some
of them are crosses.

260
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,750
Antiques?

261
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,167
Yeah, okay.

262
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,666
Well who put those
in your apartment?

263
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,125
Was that you or was that
your, your roommate?

264
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,334
What's her name? Simone?

265
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,458
Yes.

266
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,167
My roommate's name is Simone,

267
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,417
and she's not a Satanist, mom.

268
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,125
- That's not even-
- Is that you?

269
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,833
On the wall there?

270
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,167
- Who took that?
- No.

271
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,167
- Mom, no, that's not-
- Who took that?

272
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:08,167
I...

273
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,625
Simone did.

274
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,708
Okay?

275
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,292
Mom, she's a
photographer. It's art.

276
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,500
Okay? It's not-

277
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,416
- Can you just please
go find my necklace?

278
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,251
Just please. I really need it.

279
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,293
Do you ever even
think about me?

280
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,750
How I'm doing or
think to call me

281
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,251
when you don't need something?

282
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,750
Your grandmother just died.

283
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:33,334
My mother is dead.

284
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:36,209
All I'm asking you
for is to go and look

285
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,209
for the necklace that she
shouldn't have given you

286
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,750
in the first place
and send it to me

287
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,292
so I can bury her with it.

288
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,125
What is the problem?

289
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,376
I will look when I have time.

290
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,293
- Anything else?
- You know something?

291
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:58,375
I'm just glad that she
can't see you right now

292
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,209
and what you turned into.

293
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,875
I haven't turned
into anything, mom.

294
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,750
You just never figured
out how to accept that I-

295
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,334
- I don't have anything
more to say to you.

296
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,416
Great.

297
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,251
- Great seeing you.
- So just go find my necklace.

298
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:08,875
Okay.

299
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:09,791
I will talk...

300
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,875
Wait, mom.

301
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:11,791
Hold on.

302
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
What time is it there?

303
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,583
What do you mean? It's
the same time as you?

304
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,375
Is it, is it daytime still?

305
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,791
Are you trunk?

306
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,750
It is 2:15 in the
afternoon on Friday

307
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,251
and you're drunk and alone.

308
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,458
What has happened
to you, Charlene?

309
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,791
Where's the time?

310
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,416
You know what? Nevermind mom.

311
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,666
- Thank you so much for-
- Just go find my...

312
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,167
- Would you please?
- Okay.

313
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,375
Thank you so much
for the phone call.

314
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,791
- I will find your necklace-
- Oh my-

315
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,167
- And send it to you

316
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,251
and then you never have
to talk to me again.

317
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:38,375
- Oh my goodness.
- Okay?

318
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,541
Thanks for the invite
to the funeral.

319
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,791
I will never
talk to you again.

320
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,458
- I just want my necklace.
- Bye, mom, yeah, great.

321
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,209
Oh, god.

322
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,291
Oh, god. Hello?

323
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,958
Is anyone in the hall?
Our door is stuck again.

324
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:19,667
Hello?

325
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,916
God, god.

326
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,666
Fucking...

327
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,375
Really?

328
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,333
Where's the fucking time?

329
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,417
What the fuck?

330
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,416
You're not here.

331
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,750
You're never here.

332
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:58,416
Why are you never here?

333
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,791
Where are you, Charlie?

334
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:01,708
Charlie.

335
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,583
Charlie!

336
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,583
Girl, put some
motherfucking pants on

337
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:11,416
and get to the bar, now,
right now, right now.

338
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,333
Love you.

339
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,001
You enjoying this?

340
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,667
We have got to move.

341
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey, Vito.

342
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:43,126
It's Charlie Crane
from apartment 1-R.

343
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:46,166
Listen, our front
door is stuck again.

344
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,126
I can't seem to open
it from the inside

345
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,833
and I think someone
covered all the windows

346
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,458
with some kind of tarp.

347
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,043
Is there work being done on
the building or something?

348
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,917
Please call me as
soon as you get this,

349
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,959
I'd really appreciate it.

350
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,834
Okay.

351
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,917
Thank you.

352
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,833
Bye.

353
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,084
Ugh.

354
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,500
Simone?

355
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,708
Simone?

356
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:03,959
Oh.

357
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,876
Jesus.

358
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,083
Please pick up.

359
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,333
Pick up, pick up-

360
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,541
- Hey, it's Simone

361
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:04,625
and you are apparently someone
who still uses voicemails.

362
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:08,000
Kinda weird. No one
does that anymore.

363
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,166
How retro.

364
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,875
Hey, it's me again.

365
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,917
Um, I'm sorry to call so much,
but are you here?

366
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,834
Um, I heard someone like
walking around in here

367
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,375
and I think our
bedroom door is real-

368
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,792
Oh, call me when
you got this, okay?

369
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:24,709
Love you. Bye.

370
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,667
Hey, hello?

371
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,125
Can you hear me? Please, please.

372
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,916
My door is stuck and
I'm locked in my apar...

373
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,125
Hello?

374
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,333
Hello?

375
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:21,875
Hey, can you hear me?

376
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,500
I think we live next
door to each other.

377
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:28,291
I'm so sorry, but my
front door is stuck.

378
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,375
Would you be able
to help me open it?

379
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:37,917
Ma'am, hello?

380
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:42,751
All right.

381
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,208
That woman next door
is crying again.

382
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,375
Oh, the girl is
always crying about something.

383
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:57,250
- Yeah, geez.
- No wonder he's

384
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:57,917
gone all the time.

385
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,041
Oh shit, I forgot to tell you,

386
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,083
the Latz Gallery is showing
some of my work next month.

387
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,875
You're going to be hanging
on some walls in the Village.

388
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,333
How fucking dope is that?

389
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,208
Oh my god, that's great.

390
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,833
What?

391
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:13,916
I said that's great.

392
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:14,791
Which ones?

393
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,833
Some nudes.

394
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,958
You're cool with that, right?

395
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,083
I mean, it's an
incredible gallery.

396
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,125
Whatever you want, babe.

397
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,292
- I'm so happy for you.
- Right?

398
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,375
Hoping someone rich wants
to buy you, you know?

399
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,750
Then I'll try to sell
them a picture, too.

400
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,208
I'm kidding, duh.

401
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,958
Yeah.

402
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,041
Oh hey, I got some
plans with some friends later.

403
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,542
I haven't seen Marcy in a while.

404
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,208
Hope it's okay.

405
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,125
Charlie?

406
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,125
Is that cool?

407
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:50,958
Char?

408
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,458
Hello?

409
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,458
Marcy? Yeah, of course.

410
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,501
But you'll be home later, right?

411
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:04,042
Of course, silly.

412
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,958
Hope you have a great time.

413
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,208
I love you.

414
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,041
She's still
not there yet, is she?

415
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,417
She is stuck in traffic.

416
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:33,501
Hey, what time is it?

417
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,916
Five o'clock
somewhere. Ha.

418
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,958
Is that why you're calling me?

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Partially.

420
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,166
I don't know.

421
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,501
Why don't you look
at your phone?

422
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,041
- No, seriously, can-
- Why don't you call Simone

423
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,542
and ask her what time it is?

424
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,542
Hey yo, can I get two more
and the check, please?

425
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,000
Where'd you get those pants?

426
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,376
Ooh.

427
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:53,291
Turn around.

428
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,501
Walk away.

429
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:55,459
Thea.

430
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:56,958
What?

431
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,166
There's some really nice
butts in here, girl.

432
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,333
Just, is it dark outside?

433
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,543
- Tell me that.
- Are you fucking high?

434
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,333
'Cause if you are, I'm
gonna be really be pissed-

435
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,333
- No, I just-

436
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,417
- That's you're high without me.

437
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:10,166
Like, there is
something on my windows.

438
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,333
I can't see outside.

439
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,626
Hey, do
you have a charger?

440
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,208
- For a phone?
- Oh my god.

441
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,083
- A phone charger.
- Thea.

442
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,083
What?

443
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,166
What?

444
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,625
- Did you hear me?
- What, it's on your windows?

445
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,376
Yeah, it's like a
tarp or something.

446
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,625
Ugh.

447
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,376
I can't reach it
from the inside.

448
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,666
Actually,
can I get another one?

449
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,208
Maybe they tented your place.

450
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,875
They did that to mine like
a couple of weeks ago.

451
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,208
It's really annoying.

452
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,459
Yeah, maybe.

453
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,291
Fucking go
outside and check.

454
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,417
Like, why are you

455
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,625
- calling me?
- Because I can't

456
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,250
- go outside, my front door is-
- Oh, fuck.

457
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,376
Hey, um, do you-

458
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:48,041
- What?
- Have a charger?

459
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,542
Dude, my phone's about to die.

460
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,666
Hey, do you have a charger?

461
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,041
For a phone?

462
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,334
You're still at
the Trap, right?

463
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:56,000
Uh, yeah.

464
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:58,083
Can I call you right back?

465
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,708
- Yeah, but-
- What?

466
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,376
Oh for fuck's sake.

467
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:02,666
- Get fucked, motherfucker-
- Can you just come-

468
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,666
- I'll fucking
smile when you die.

469
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,125
That wasn't for you, it was
just some fucking creepy-

470
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,334
- Thea.
- Fuck you!

471
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,459
Oh my god.

472
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:13,583
Dude, listen, my
phone's going to fucking die.

473
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,417
Can I just, like,
call you right back?

474
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:16,583
Just let me charge
up real quick.

475
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,041
Yeah, but do you
know when that'll be?

476
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,958
I'll call
you right back.

477
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,292
Bye, bye.

478
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:22,208
Thea?

479
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,417
H...

480
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,334
Dammit.

481
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,459
Oh.

482
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,791
Thank you for the wild flowers.

483
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,625
You're
the wild flower.

484
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:17,791
I love that.

485
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,292
Turn over.

486
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,250
No, the other way.

487
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,459
What, like this?

488
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,625
Mm-hm.

489
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,750
I never thought of
myself as a wild anything.

490
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:38,083
Wallflower, maybe.

491
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:41,334
Everyone's different.

492
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:42,334
Head and profile.

493
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,208
You're my wildflower.

494
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,542
I wish I could be...

495
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:59,417
I don't know, more like you.

496
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,042
- Silly.
- I do.

497
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:02,708
You're...

498
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:08,376
I want to be enough for you.

499
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,708
Stop it. You are.

500
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,376
Arch your neck a little.

501
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,666
Hey.

502
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:25,750
Come here.

503
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,334
You're
distracting me.

504
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,292
- Come here.
- Stop it, stop it,

505
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:31,334
you're distracting me.

506
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:32,541
You're distracting me!

507
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,875
Stop it!

508
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,583
People are fascinating.

509
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,292
And strange, they're so strange.

510
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:48,334
I love figuring out what
makes each one tick.

511
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,209
The pieces of them.

512
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,500
Literally, pieces.

513
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,334
Their skulls...

514
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,750
Bones...

515
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,542
And heart.

516
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:05,334
Their beliefs.

517
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,583
Love.

518
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,209
Okay.

519
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,625
Hey Vito.

520
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,625
It's Charlie Crane again
from apartment 1-R.

521
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,251
Listen, I'm, I'm getting
kind of freaked out

522
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:55,458
and since you're not picking up,

523
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,416
I may have to call somebody
else about this door.

524
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,833
Um...

525
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:04,458
Yeah. Sorry, um, but I just
wanted to let you know, so.

526
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,833
Have a good weekend. Okay.

527
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,750
Sorry. Bye.

528
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,625
911.
What's your emergency?

529
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,625
Hi, I'm, uh, this
is really silly

530
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,375
and I'm so sorry
to call you guys,

531
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,417
but I'm not sure
what else to do.

532
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,251
Sorry, I'm...

533
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,416
I'm locked in my apartment.

534
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,958
My front door gets stuck
sometimes and I tried my super,

535
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,209
but of course he's not answering

536
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:33,375
and my girlfriend should
be home soon, but I just-

537
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:36,333
- Ma'am,
is this an emergency?

538
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,833
I mean...

539
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:38,708
Yes.

540
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,209
Can you help me?

541
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,625
Yes,
ma'am. What's your address?

542
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,333
107 Forsyth
Street in Brooklyn.

543
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,500
Apartment number?

544
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:51,458
Uh, apartment
1-R, as in retro.

545
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,833
Okay,
ma'am. Help is on the way.

546
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,875
Thank you. Thank you so much.

547
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:57,667
I really appreciate it-

548
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:00,708
Thanks.

549
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:52,875
Hello?

550
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,583
God, are you, are you okay?

551
00:40:56,625 --> 00:41:01,583
There's
just no way.

552
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,042
There's no way.

553
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:05,541
There's no way.

554
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,876
No way?

555
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:09,959
No way out?

556
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,416
Are you stuck, too?

557
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:16,625
I, my um, my door jams
and it has before,

558
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,542
so I'm stuck too.

559
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,042
Are you locked in
your apartment?

560
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:28,043
Hello?

561
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:33,166
Please, please.

562
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,375
I'm hurting.

563
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:37,666
Will you, will you pray with me?

564
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,708
Um...

565
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,750
I don't...

566
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,834
I mean I, I haven't in a while.

567
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:47,918
- I just-
- Please.

568
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,959
- Please pray with me.
- Oh, yeah, no.

569
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,708
I'm sorry. Yeah, of course.

570
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,458
Um, I'll pray with you.

571
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,625
Sorry. Did you want me to-

572
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,625
- We need the necklace.

573
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,791
What did you say?

574
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,541
To pray.

575
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,876
We need the necklace.

576
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,918
Go find your grandmother's
necklace, Charlene.

577
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,500
Sorry. How do
you know my name?

578
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,667
Have you been listening to me?

579
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,500
Who are you?

580
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,708
Huh?

581
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,876
You know what? Mind your
own fucking business.

582
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,625
Hey Thea.

583
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,208
Hey Thea.

584
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,708
Hey babe.

585
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,166
- Listen-
- Hold on a sec.

586
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,083
Sorry.

587
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,583
Hold on a sec. Sorry.

588
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,001
- Yeah.
- Sorry, just one second.

589
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:53,666
Sorry,
just one second.

590
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,042
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

591
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,208
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

592
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,750
What is wrong with you?

593
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,959
Charlie, who
are you yelling at?

594
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:02,666
Sorry, Thea, just two seconds.

595
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:03,917
- This bitch.
- Bitch.

596
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:06,500
Stop it. Fucking
stop it, fuck off!

597
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,001
Fuck off!

598
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:11,166
Sorry, Thea, I just-

599
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,792
- Dude, is that fucking Simone?

600
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,166
What's wrong?

601
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,041
There's this, this woman
in the other apartment

602
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,083
and I can hear her
through the wall.

603
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,751
Yeah, I mean, it is Brooklyn.

604
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:21,291
No, this is different.

605
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,041
She can clearly hear me, too,

606
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,792
because she won't stop repeating

607
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:27,708
every goddamn word I say.

608
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,876
Okay, that's creepy.

609
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:33,250
And I've already called my
super twice about the door.

610
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:37,125
Of course he's not
picking up, but

611
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,666
it doesn't matter.

612
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,751
It doesn't matter because
someone's on their way

613
00:43:40,793 --> 00:43:42,751
and I can get this
fixed before Simone-

614
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:45,583
- Charlie, can you just
like stop for a second?

615
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,792
Stop.

616
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:49,125
Like, I really hate
to tell you this,

617
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,834
but I don't think Simone's

618
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:52,751
going to be coming
home anytime soon.

619
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:54,792
Thea, I really don't
need this right now.

620
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,291
Holden just posted a pic.

621
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,709
The two of them are
like out at a bar.

622
00:43:58,751 --> 00:43:59,959
Simone is in the city.

623
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,166
She's fucking living
it up right now.

624
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,876
Go look for yourself.

625
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:07,000
- That's an old photo.
- No, babe, it's not.

626
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,250
It's on her story.
Go check, I'll wait.

627
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,834
Charlie, I fucking
hate this, dude.

628
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:45,166
I fucking hate this,
but like, I told you.

629
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:48,208
- I tried to tell you.
- I um...

630
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,751
- God.
- I gotta go.

631
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,083
I have to wait for someone
to open my door so I'm gonna,

632
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,333
I'm gonna sit here
and wait for that.

633
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,041
No Charlie,
fuck that, don't do that.

634
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:01,917
- I gotta go.
- Come on.

635
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:02,834
No, Charlie-

636
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:26,000
911,
what's your emergency?

637
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,958
Hi. I called
a little while ago.

638
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,291
I'm locked inside my apartment

639
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,000
and I think someone
should be here by now-

640
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:34,751
- 911,
what's your emergency?

641
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:37,083
My emergency
is that I am locked

642
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:40,250
inside my apartment
and I need help, okay?

643
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:44,166
Again, my address is 107
Forsyth Street in Brooklyn.

644
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,166
Ma'am,
is this an emergency?

645
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,250
Yes, it is.

646
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:54,292
I am locked inside my apartment
and I want to get out.

647
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:56,709
Yes,
ma'am. What's your address?

648
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:58,083
Oh my god. I just told you.

649
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:02,667
107 Forsyth Street in
Brooklyn, apartment 1-R.

650
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:03,333
Apartment number?

651
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,250
What the fu...

652
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,166
Are you even listening to me?

653
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,751
- I just said apartment 1-
- Okay ma'am.

654
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:09,793
Help is on the way.

655
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,792
What apartment number
did I just tell you?

656
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,709
- Hello?
- Okay ma'am.

657
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:23,792
Help is on the way.

658
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,333
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

659
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,291
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

660
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,375
Okay ma'am...

661
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,751
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

662
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,833
She doesn't care.

663
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,916
She's never coming back for you.

664
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:40,292
No one's going to
save you, Charlene.

665
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,751
Hey, hello?

666
00:46:49,793 --> 00:46:50,751
Hello? Please turn around.

667
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:52,958
I'm in apartment 1-R,
I'm right behind you.

668
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,458
Please help me open this door.

669
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,333
Please help
me open this door.

670
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:56,709
Please.

671
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:57,916
- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?

672
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:58,875
- Please help me.
- Please help me!

673
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,958
Shut up and leave me alone!

674
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,792
Please.

675
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,000
Please.

676
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,208
Charlie, what the fuck?

677
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,751
What, are you fucking
following me now?

678
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,041
Are you fucking kidding me?

679
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,833
You're just sitting in
my own fucking house

680
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,250
not letting me in?

681
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,416
Are you kidding?

682
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,083
This is my goddamn home.

683
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:23,751
I don't ever want
to see you again

684
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:26,042
unless you're moving your
shit out of my house.

685
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,875
Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

686
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,501
Please. I just want to
be with you right now.

687
00:47:31,543 --> 00:47:32,375
No, no, Charlie.

688
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:34,375
You want to be me.

689
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,375
I cannot take a fucking breath

690
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:38,083
without you inhaling, too.

691
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,000
You're always right behind me,

692
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:41,375
following me like
a fucking shadow!

693
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,458
I just want to make
sure you're safe.

694
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,375
What the fuck are you
even talking about safe?

695
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:46,875
I was out with my friends.

696
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,208
I know, they're
they're my friends t-

697
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,000
- No, they are not your friends.

698
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,291
This is exactly what
I am talking about.

699
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:55,083
They're not your friends.
This is not your house.

700
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,958
This is not your life.
They are my friends.

701
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,333
This is my house.

702
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:02,125
This is my life, and I
will not let you continue

703
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:04,250
to fucking hijack everything!

704
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:05,501
I know, I know, I know!

705
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,291
I'm sorry, all right?

706
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,501
I'm sorry.

707
00:48:08,543 --> 00:48:10,041
Please. Please, just
come back inside.

708
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:12,375
I just, you're just
gone all the time.

709
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:13,875
Why aren't you ever here?

710
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:16,250
Why aren't you ever here?

711
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:17,167
Huh?

712
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,584
I don't care if you're out.

713
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:54,291
Just answer your goddamn-

714
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:04,501
Simone?

715
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,208
Simone?

716
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:41,000
Simone?

717
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,208
Simone?

718
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,500
Fuck.

719
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,166
Please turn around.

720
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,209
Please, please, help me!

721
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,209
Come on.

722
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,500
911, what's your...

723
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,209
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

724
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:21,334
None of this is real.

725
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,251
What do you want?

726
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:23,833
I need help, please.

727
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:29,542
Please.

728
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,583
Please, please,
please pick up, pick-

729
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:58,916
Thea. Oh, thank God.

730
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,583
Where, where are you right now?

731
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,500
I'm at the bar still.

732
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:06,666
The bartender let
me use her charger.

733
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,292
Is, uh, Simone not there yet?

734
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,500
No, she's not.

735
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,916
And there's so much
happening right now.

736
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:14,416
I found someone's
phone in the basement.

737
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,666
I called 911
because I can't get,

738
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,666
I can't get anyone to help
me right now, including you.

739
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,000
I said I'd be
there when I'm done.

740
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,583
Yeah, but you're not here.

741
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,875
I need you, Thea. I need help.

742
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:27,791
And 911 isn't working.

743
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,458
It's like a recording
or something.

744
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,750
It sounds like, I don't...

745
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,000
I need...

746
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,708
No one will come
here and help me.

747
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,625
And I...

748
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,875
Goddamn.

749
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,583
I...

750
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:42,916
I found the necklace,
but my mom fucking,

751
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:47,291
god, she hates me and
Simone isn't coming home

752
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,042
because I'm boring and I
can't do anything right.

753
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:51,791
I ruin fucking
everything I touch.

754
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't know what to do.

755
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,666
Thea?

756
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:08,251
Thea, where are you right now?

757
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:11,375
You're not here.

758
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:14,042
Thea, I need you to come here

759
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,375
and let me out of here, okay?

760
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:17,792
I need that as a friend.

761
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,750
- I can't help you, Charlie.
- Why?

762
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:23,333
Why can't you
come and help me?

763
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:26,375
Thea.

764
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:27,333
What is that...

765
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:32,625
What is that sound? Are
you, are you at the beach?

766
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:35,583
- You're not here.
- Thea.

767
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,666
What are you talking about?

768
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,583
- I...
- You're not here.

769
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,917
You're not here.

770
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,458
- You're never here.
- Thea.

771
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,375
You're never here.

772
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:49,708
Thea, don't.

773
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,292
I can't hear you.
Don't walk away.

774
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,375
Thea, come back. I, I am scared.

775
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:58,917
I am your friend and I am
fucking scared right now.

776
00:56:58,959 --> 00:56:59,792
I need you.

777
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,750
Thea?

778
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,084
God.

779
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:13,792
I love you.

780
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:16,084
I need you.

781
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:19,375
You're not here.

782
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,333
Hello?

783
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,791
Ma'am, are you okay?

784
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,708
No way out?

785
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:34,458
Are you stuck, too?

786
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:37,541
You're not here.

787
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,833
You're not here.

788
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,001
You're not here.

789
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,583
You're not here.

790
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,416
You're not here.

791
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,625
You're not here.

792
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,126
You're not here.

793
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,126
You're not here,
you're not here.

794
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:55,333
You're not here.

795
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:26,042
Where does it all come from?

796
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:31,084
Because in reality, we're
all just animals in a pit,

797
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:38,001
fucking and fighting
and trying to make...

798
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,001
Make everything seem
like it matters.

799
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:47,750
You put two people in the
room long enough together,

800
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:53,001
they're either gonna end up
fucking or killing each other.

801
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:57,542
Or both.

802
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,125
And you scared?

803
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,792
I'm scared, too.

804
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,876
You're not here.

805
00:59:16,918 --> 00:59:18,417
You're not here.

806
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:21,167
You're not here.

807
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,792
You're not here.

808
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:27,959
You're not here.

809
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:32,583
You're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

810
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:35,500
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

811
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:39,667
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here.

812
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,750
You're not here.

813
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,793
You're not here.

814
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,708
You're not here.

815
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,793
You're not here.

816
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:57,666
You're not here,
you're not here.

817
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:00,959
You're not here,
you are not here.

818
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:01,917
You're not here.

819
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:02,917
You're not here.

820
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:05,917
You're not here,
you're not here.

821
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,583
You're not here.

822
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:09,125
You are not here.

823
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,959
You are not here.

824
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:12,583
You are not here.

825
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,959
- Huh?
- You're not here,

826
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:17,166
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

827
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,125
you're not here.

828
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:20,792
I'm here.

829
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:22,751
You're not here.

830
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:24,041
You're not here.

831
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,792
You're not here.

832
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:27,792
You're not here.

833
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,834
You're not here.

834
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,125
- You're not-
- If I'm not here,

835
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:32,625
you're not here.

836
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,500
You're not fucking here!

837
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,166
You hear me?

838
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,166
You're not fucking here!

839
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,291
Shut up.

840
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,876
Shut up, goddammit!

841
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:48,250
Shut up!

842
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,541
Shut up!

843
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:50,333
Shut up.

844
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,876
Shut up. Shut up.

845
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:59,000
It's never gonna stop.

846
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:02,625
It's never gonna stop.

847
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:03,793
I need my mom.

848
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,709
I need my mom, I
just, I need my mom.

849
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,667
I need my mom.

850
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:16,583
I need my mom, I
need my mom. Mom.

851
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:24,583
Come on.

852
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:27,709
Come on.

853
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,876
Mom?

854
01:01:41,793 --> 01:01:43,333
Oh my God, mom.

855
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,917
Charlene?

856
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:46,916
Mom, mom, oh my god.
Oh thank god you're here.

857
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,876
Please help me. I need
your help right now.

858
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,125
Look at you.

859
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,041
Of course you need help.

860
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,208
No, no, no, no.

861
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,916
Mom, I am stuck in
my apartment, okay?

862
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,709
I can't get out and I need you-

863
01:01:57,751 --> 01:01:59,876
- This was your choice, Charlie.

864
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,125
It was your choice,
Charlene, to leave.

865
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:05,751
No, no, no, no. Mom,
I need your help, okay?

866
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:07,876
I need your help right
now because I, I-

867
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:09,709
- You need God's help, Charlene.

868
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:10,916
Look at you.

869
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:13,125
Drunk or high with
that wicked woman.

870
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:15,751
No, look, I have,
I have the necklace

871
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:16,709
and I can bring it home,

872
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:18,834
but you just have to help me.

873
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:21,250
No, no, no.

874
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:22,125
No.

875
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:24,083
No, she loves me.

876
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,709
She loves me.

877
01:02:25,751 --> 01:02:27,751
She told me she loves me.

878
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:31,125
I love her so much and
she, she won't come home.

879
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,375
She won't...

880
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:33,916
There's no love
in you, Charlene.

881
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,292
Charlene, Charlene, Charlene.

882
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:40,416
God's help, there's
something we can...

883
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,834
Breathe for you,
breathe for you.

884
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,125
You are alone, Charlene.

885
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:48,792
You are alone, Charlene.

886
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,416
You will forever be alone.

887
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:52,083
Your choice.

888
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,000
God.

889
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,083
Pray. Your grandmother.

890
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,250
Your grandmother-

891
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,416
Stop.

892
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:02,291
I need you to help me.

893
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,917
My mother!

894
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,125
Stop.

895
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:13,125
Mom.

896
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:16,333
I just need you need to stop it!

897
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,501
Stop.

898
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,375
Please.

899
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,833
No, no, no, no, no.

900
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,208
No, no, no.

901
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,333
Barker.

902

Please. What's happening?

903
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,125
Why are you doing this?

904
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:17,291
Are you doing this?

905
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,833
She's not coming back.

906
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,167
She doesn't care.

907
01:05:26,459 --> 01:05:27,292
Who?

She doesn't care, she's
never coming back.

01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,375
She's never coming back.

No.

01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,375
She loves me.

916
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,000
Where is she?

I'm so sorry. Please,
I need your help.

Are you still there?

01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,376
Charlie?

942
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:05,500
Please, Charlie!

943
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:09,417
Baby?

Please, Charlie.

01:10:41,168 --> 01:10:42,209
Just stop.

Her.

947
01:10:45,376 --> 01:10:46,708
It's not you.

948
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,792
It's not you.

949
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,583
