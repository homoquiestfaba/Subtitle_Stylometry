1
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,994
- Are you sure we should go in
there

2
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:19,870
with just the three of us?

3
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,496
- You worry too much.

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,331
It's a business call.

5
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,541
This guy's always professional.

6
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,375
- Yeah, but-

7
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,459
- Eh, don't worry about it,
Junior.

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,172
Anything goes down in
there, I'm gonna gut 'em.

9
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,006
- Gut 'em?

10
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:31,840
- Yeah, gut them.

11
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,549
- Is that what all you Brits are
like?

12
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,634
- What's that supposed to mean?

13
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,677
- Well can't you just
say like a normal person?

14
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,512
- Like what?

15
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,262
- Take care of it.
- Take care of it?

16
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,389
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

17
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,016
That's really fuckin' vague,
Grant.

18
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,934
My Auntie Belinda takes care of
her cat.

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,520
My mum takes care of my laundry.

20
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,812
If they say I'm taking
care, what does that mean?

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,522
Nobody knows.

22
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,188
But I say I'm gonna gut someone,

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,398
you know exactly what it means.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,527
- Enough, gentlemen.

25
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,027
Enough.
- Yeah, sorry, boss.

26
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,737
- Yeah, Grant's sorry, boss.

27
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,865
- Oh, those are nice looking
knives you get there, huh?

28
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,577
- All right. Enough.

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,537
Now we're doing this.

30
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,250
And if things go south, I
trust both of you to handle it.

31
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,292
Understood?

32
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:07,959
- Yes.

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,794
- Capish?

34
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,420
- Yeah, capish, understood.
Gotcha.

35
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,713
- All right, let's go. Let's do
it.

36
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,591
Go in.

37
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,434
- Good evening, Mr. Schiavone.

38
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,435
Your guests are already here.

39
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,937
- Thank you my friend.

40
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,941
Hey, do me a favor.

41
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,944
Buy those beautiful
grandchildren
of yours something nice.

42
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,612
- Oh, oh no, Mr. Schiavone,

43
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm sorry, I can't accept this.

44
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,740
- Of course you can.

45
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,409
It's my pleasure to
take care of my friends.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,664
Otherwise you'd offend me, Gino.

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,039
You don't wanna do that, do you?

48
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,667
- No, I can assure you
I don't want to do that.

49
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,880
Just gimme a minute.
- You got it.

50
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,507
- Hey, why are you giving
that guy all that money, huh?

51
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,759
He owns this fucking
restaurant for Christ's sake.

52
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,635
- Hey.

53
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,597
Watch your mouth.

54
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,013
As long as I'm still breathing,

55
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,891
I make the decisions
and you follow my lead

56
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,144
and look imposing, not
the other way around.

57
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,479
Are we clear?

58
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,524
- Yeah, got it.

59
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,032
- Kid has a birthday coming
up soon, doesn't she?

60
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:20,993
- Jada?

61
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,578
- Yeah, in a couple months.

62
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,079
You remember?

63
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,247
- Sure I do.

64
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,833
We should talk about throwing
a party or something.

65
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,085
You know, 12 is a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

66
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,045
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought
these guys

67
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,921
were waiting for us.

68
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,841
What's the hold up?

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,676
- Okay.

70
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,899
- Good to see you, my old
friend.

71
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,652
- Good to see you, too.
It's been too long.

72
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,987
- So your mind, is it okay?

73
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,113
- Did I forget something?

74
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,574
- Well, I thought we had decided

75
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,244
that there would only be one
other person as a bodyguard.

76
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,329
- Well, forgive me.

77
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,833
One's just a driver.

78
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,169
Go wait in the car.

79
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,505
- Are you sure?

80
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,177
I'll be right outside. Don't
fuck it up.

81
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,845
- I won't.

82
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,728
- So, not to be rude, but
we're not young men anymore.

83
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,980
So why are we here, Rooker?

84
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,191
- 48 hours ago, I had a shipment
coming

85
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,569
to these docks from Vera Cruz.

86
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,863
Now that shipment by now
should be in my hands

87
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,117
making money for me, but it's
not.

88
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,661
The ship that that shipment was
on

89
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:51,748
was refused access to these
docks.

90
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,878
The captain had to leave before
he could unload my goods.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,089
- So you can keep trafficking
in our fucking city?

92
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,050
- Your city?

93
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,260
- You know the rules, Rooker.

94
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,139
We don't traffic that
in this city. My city.

95
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,350
- I think the agreement that we
had

96
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,312
is not very equitable the way I
see it.

97
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,396
- Well, that's your fuckin'
problem

98
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,940
'cause we ain't changin' shit.

99
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:17,858
- Grant!

100
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,778
- I see your son still
hasn't learned his place.

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,071
- What did you say, old man?

102
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,365
Hey! Put it down!

103
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,575
I'll put a fucking bullet in
your head.

104
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,119
- Is this how you thought
you were gonna get your way?

105
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,204
- Yukio is very sensitive.

106
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,874
He doesn't take well to
aggression.

107
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,710
- Well how does he respond to
bullets?

108
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,880
- Put it down, son.

109
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,758
You were never good at
playing nice with others.

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,344
Put it down.

111
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,911
Now, this is how it's gonna be.

112
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,009
- Dad, dad.

113
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,263
- What the fuck happened?

114
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,099
Fuck.

115
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,062
- I need an ambulance.

116
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:37,979
My father's been shot.

117
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,064
- What are you doing?

118
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,231
Hey, hey stop, stop that.

119
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,399
- Please hurry up, please-
- Hey, stop!

120
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,400
- Hey, what are you doing, man?

121
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,485
- Stop. We can't call anyone.

122
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,361
Grant.

123
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,279
Grant, we gotta go.

124
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,156
Grant, they could be back. We
gotta go.

125
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,616
- Fuck you, man, I'm not
going there anywhere.

126
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,617
- There's nothing we
can do for him, Grant.

127
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,952
We gotta go, okay?

128
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,994
Come on, we gotta get outta-

129
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,162
- Ow!

130
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:54,996
- Fuck, you're hit, too.

131
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,372
Grant, we really gotta fucking
go!

132
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,959
- No, I'm not leaving him here!

133
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,211
- We gotta go, we gotta-
- Stop!

134
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,420
Stop it.

135
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm not leaving him.

136
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,675
- Okay, Grant, it's okay.

137
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,345
Look, G, he's gone.

138
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,348
He's gone.

139
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,349
You'll do your father no favors

140
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,185
by staying here and
getting arrested, okay?

141
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,019
He told me to look after you

142
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,522
and I'm not doing that if we're
in jail.

143
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,191
If you want to avenge your
father...

144
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,572
Come on.

145
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,447
We gotta go.

146
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,699
Sorry buddy. We gotta go.

147
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,203
Come on, man.
- No.

148
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,624
- What is going on here?

149
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,332
- Hey, what the fuck, man?

150
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,626
- We gotta make a clean getaway.

151
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,585
Come on. Out, out.

152
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,420
Go on.

153
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,421
We gotta go. Go, go, go.

154
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,925
Come on, come on!

155
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,386
All right, here, get in.

156
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,395
- Sombra doesn't have friends.

157
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,190
- Yeah, you can keep
bullshitting me all night,

158
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,107
but I don't think Sombra

159
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:46,983
will appreciate knowing you're
the reason

160
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,029
his special delivery has been
delayed.

161
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,578
This is quite a selection you've
got here.

162
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,870
Oh, shit, you got Maker's.

163
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,330
It's one of my favorites.

164
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,290
A lot of people back
home say it's too light,

165
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,417
but they don't really know
what's good.

166
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,588
Alcohol's just so connected
to culture and environment.

167
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,505
You can't really criticize

168
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,340
until you've experienced it for
yourself.

169
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,341
It's the same with business.

170
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,342
You wanna understand someone,

171
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,721
if you wanna truly know them,

172
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,721
you have to meet them in person.

173
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,475
Otherwise, how do you really
know who's good or bad?

174
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,610
Sombra running late?

175
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,777
- Sombra's not coming.

176
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,278
- Shit, shit, he's blown.

177
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,196
Pull him out now.

178
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:33,864
- Get out of
there, Ray.

179
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,823
You're blown. Get out, now.

180
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,618
- At least he could
have told me to my face.

181
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,660
- Ray?

182
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,035
- I came a very
long way to deliver this.

183
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,036
- Dammit!

184
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,788
He isn't going to abort.
- How far is back up?

185
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,248
- Too far.

186
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,507
- Get in there, get
in there!

187
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,331
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, come on, Ray.

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,166
She just saved your life.

189
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,584
- They would've taken me to
Sombra.

190
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,752
- Jesus, Ray.

191
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,671
They would've taken you after
beating you half to death.

192
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,005
- But they would've taken me.

193
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,757
- You deal with him.

194
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,718
- Yeah, thanks to you two
my cover's actually blown.

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,596
- You're welcome.

196
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
- Can someone please explain to
me

197
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,768
how the hell this happened?

198
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,727
- We're working on that.

199
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,853
- It's not good enough, Al.

200
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,396
All right, I spent six months of
my life

201
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,106
developing this lead, six
months.

202
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,775
And now it's down to drain
because what?

203
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,068
'Cause this place is full of
holes?

204
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,944
- Is he fucking serious?

205
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,486
- I know you're not talking
about me.

206
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,613
- We don't have a lead.

207
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,781
- Then what happened, Al?

208
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,575
- Look, you think I'm happy
about this?

209
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,952
I could be home with my wife
having a home cooked meal.

210
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,370
Instead I'm stuck in Bogota
with your stupid white ass

211
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,997
and two of the Three Stooges.

212
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,500
This mission is as important
to me as it is to you.

213
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,376
So I need you to sit down and
calm down

214
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,628
and we'll figure this out.

215
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,421
- How?
- He's too close to this.

216
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,506
- Fuck you.

217
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,674
- Hey!

218
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,509
We'll figure this out.

219
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,887
You two, go cool off.

220
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,813
Hey.

221
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,482
I'll get you another shot.

222
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,200
- Hey, Ray?

223
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,660
Ray, are you in there?

224
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,538
- No.

225
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,580
- You got a phone
call.

226
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,206
- Take a message.

227
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,000
- It's from the
states.

228
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,086
He said he's your dad.

229
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,983
- Really?

230
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,070
A printed newspaper?

231
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,197
I can't remember the last time I
saw one.

232
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,078
- I can't remember the last
time I saw my son.

233
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,296
You all settled in there?

234
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,048
- Yeah. My room looks like a 90s
museum.

235
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,925
You know it's okay if you
wanna repurpose it, Pops.

236
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,761
You know, get yourself
home gym or a media room.

237
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,640
- That will always be your room,
Ray.

238
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,226
- Wow, look at these
two knuckleheads, huh?

239
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,186
- Inseparable knuckleheads.

240
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,187
You hungry?

241
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,940
No, I'm actually going
over to the hospital.

242
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,108
- You still gotta eat, Ray.

243
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,860
- Dad, I'm good.

244
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,238
- Do an old man a favor, huh?

245
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,323
- All right.

246
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,790
- He knows who did this, Ray.

247
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,793
- So when did he get started
working with his father?

248
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,671
- I'm not sure.

249
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,134
- Everyone knows Carmine
Schiavone, right?

250
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:03,884
You know, Grant was supposed to
be

251
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,968
the good one of the family.

252
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,096
How, how the hell did he
get sucked into this life?

253
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,264
- I don't know.

254
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,391
- Okay well what do you know,
Dad?

255
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,434
- He's not gonna risk anything

256
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,522
that the police could get
to them before he does,

257
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,898
that's what I know.

258
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,525
- Yeah, we both know that.

259
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:22,029
- How long has it been
since you spoke with him?

260
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,989
- It's been a while, Dad.

261
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,159
- He went through some tough
times when Beth got cancer.

262
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,288
Turned his life upside down
and...

263
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,166
- And what?

264
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,875
- Ray, you were his rock, you
know that.

265
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,126
You guys were like brothers.

266
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,586
- No, don't. Don't do that.

267
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,420
Come on.

268
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,296
- No, do what?

269
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,758
- Make me the bad guy.

270
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,052
- You had to go.

271
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,011
But he stayed.

272
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,095
He felt left behind.

273
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:49,930
- Yeah, I know.

274
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,515
And I wasn't there for him. I
know.

275
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,307
- It's not your fault.

276
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,436
He needed someone, something
and,

277
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,562
and he turned to Carmine.

278
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,855
- Yeah, and there's always
a catch with Carmine.

279
00:14:58,857 --> 00:14:59,817
Fuckin' always.

280
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,859
- He's his father.

281
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,322
He wanted Grant to come
work with him and so he did.

282
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,865
The first order of business
is to find the people

283
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,993
that killed his father.

284
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,536
- Well you know if this
escalates,

285
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,080
it's gonna end bad for everyone
involved.

286
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,040
- He's gotta hear that, Ray.

287
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,418
Beth wouldn't want it.
- No.

288
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,005
No, but Carmine would.

289
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,133
- We have to go make him choose.

290
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,182
- Come on.

291
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,226
Give me my water, you bastard.

292
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:36,935
- Is that what they teach you to
talk like

293
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,438
at that fancy private school?

294
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:41,648
- Ray-Ray!

295
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,524
- Ooh!

296
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,734
Hey Jay-Bird.

297
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,237
Oh, wow, you got so big and
that is some attitude you got.

298
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,531
- I mean, it has been
forever since you've seen me.

299
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,242
And daddy.

300
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,284
- I know.

301
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:53,994
I'll do better, all right?

302
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,955
I'm sorry.
- You better.

303
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,582
Daddy said that he chose
you to be my godfather

304
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,167
because, "He was the most
responsible man I know

305
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,670
and he would protect you with
his life."

306
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,547
- He said all that, huh?
- Yep.

307
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,257
Although he was on a lot of
medication,

308
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,425
so he might have been high.

309
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,426
- Jada.

310
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,678
- Pops.

311
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,429
- Princess.

312
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,723
How is your father?

313
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,017
- Um, yeah, I don't know.

314
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,393
I mean every time that
we try to go in there,

315
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,395
Mr. Vincent makes us leave.

316
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,271
- Who?

317
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,272
- Mr. Vincent.

318
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,192
He says that Daddy
doesn't want any company.

319
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,110
- Hey, why don't you take
us to your daddy's room?

320
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:27,986
- Okay.
- All right?

321
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:28,614
- Come on.

322
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,748
- Jada, look, it's Ms. Carucci.

323
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,207
Nice to see you, Ms. Carucci.

324
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,626
Look who I bumped into
committing

325
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,588
misdemeanor assault on a water
fountain.

326
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,507
- No, no.

327
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,384
- I'll let that go since we
haven't officially met yet.

328
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,052
- Oh yeah?

329
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,179
You gonna let that go, too?

330
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,346
- You're a funny guy.

331
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,811
- Are they okay?

332
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,230
- Yeah, Uncle Ray-Ray's
giving them jujitsu lesson.

333
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,315
- Oh.

334
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,114
- What the fuck is going on?

335
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,199
Who the fuck are you?

336
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:14,783
- I'm the guy who's
wondering why his goddaughter

337
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,367
can't see her father?

338
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,368
Who are you?

339
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,411
- Are you a cop?

340
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,747
'Cause you're giving me
all kind of police vibes.

341
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,998
- Not exactly.

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,167
- Not exactly. That's exactly
what a fucking cop would say.

343
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,211
Would you do me a favor and
take a long fuck off walk

344
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,420
down that corridor?

345
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,130
- Why don't you tell him it's
Ray.

346
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:29,800
- Oh.

347
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,134
The infamous Ray Rose, is it?

348
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,428
- The one and only.

349
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,640
Get the fuck outta the way.

350
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,267
- Come on in.

351
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,895
- And you, you pathetic bunch of
cunts.

352
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,855
Honestly, I may as well have had

353
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,607
the fucking nurses do it!

354
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:47,649
I hope you don't think you're
getting paid

355
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,318
after that pathetic display.

356
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,196
Fuck's sake!

357
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,955
- Tellin' me all I had to do
is get shot to bring you home?

358
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:02,833
- Funny guy.

359
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,501
What'd the doctor say?

360
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:06,712
- I'm shot.
- No, shit.

361
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,838
Well, at least you still
got your sense of humor.

362
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,964
- Yeah, well they didn't take
that.

363
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,340
- The sooner, the better.

364
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,800
We've got a score to settle

365
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,302
and it isn't gonna settle
itself.

366
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,180
- Hey...

367
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,807
Look, I'm sorry about, about
Carmine.

368
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,434
Pops said the two of you
were getting close again.

369
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,521
- Yeah. Thanks.

370
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:26,980
- He also said you're
ready to burn the city down

371
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,023
looking for the guys who did
this.

372
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,735
- Let me guess, the cop
disapproves.

373
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,319
- Yeah, you'll know
when I'm talking to you.

374
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,696
- I'm fucking talking to you.

375
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,406
Are you serious with this guy?

376
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,867
Listen, TJ Hooker, we're
on the same fucking side.

377
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:39,826
- Well yeah, whose side is that?

378
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:40,702
- His side.

379
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,539
- Ray.

380
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,831
Look, he was my father's right
hand,

381
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,542
protect him with his life.

382
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,043
So he's my right hand now.

383
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,085
I'm gonna need both of you

384
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,879
if I'm gonna take this son
of a bitch Booker down.

385
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:51,757
- What?

386
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,424
You can't be serious.

387
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,052
Grant, let the cops handle this.
Come on.

388
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,554
- Is that a joke?

389
00:18:58,556 --> 00:18:59,513
The cops?

390
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,306
The cops are another gang out
here, mate,

391
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,849
like they are everywhere in the
world.

392
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,518
Grant, they're not gonna
want to get involved

393
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,436
in a war unless there's
something in it for them,

394
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,896
you know that.
- Do you hear this shit?

395
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,606
War?

396
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,316
Is that what you want?

397
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,984
Look, think about Jada.

398
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,903
She's sitting out there
concerned for you

399
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,072
because Mary Poppins here
won't let her in to see you.

400
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,949
- Yeah, well, I didn't let her
in.

401
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:19,825
Okay? That was me.

402
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,535
- Why?

403
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,911
I don't want her to see
me like this, you know?

404
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,538
- So what, you let her
sit out there in the dark

405
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,622
wondering what's going on?

406
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,165
You don't think she had
enough of that with Beth?

407
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,668
- How would you know, huh?

408
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,672
You were nowhere to be
found when Beth died.

409
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:46,810
Let her in.

410
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,355
- You sure?
- You heard him.

411
00:19:58,824 --> 00:19:59,700
- Hey, baby.

412
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,784
- What happened?

413
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,706
- This? Oh this is a couple
of scratches, couple bumps.

414
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:07,914
I'll be fine.

415
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,457
- You're lying.

416
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,125
- Hey.

417
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,545
- Well you are.

418
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,213
- Hey, Vincent. Why don't you go
home?

419
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,214
Huh?

420
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,298
Come back in the morning,
we'll get to work.

421
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,467
- Well, I'm not gonna
leave you here am I, right?

422
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,429
- Get the fuck outta here.

423
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,267
- What you looking at, old man?

424
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,855
- I'm not too old.
- He ain't worth it, Pops.

425
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:34,943
- Fuck that lot of ya's.

426
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,575
- Hey, baby, I'll be all right.

427
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,002
Especially now that you and Pops

428
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,550
and Uncle Ray-Ray's here, huh?

429
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:03,180
But listen, I think you should
go home with Ms. Carucci.

430
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,973
I need to talk to Ray-Ray.

431
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:07,851
- But...

432
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,228
- Jada, Jada, why don't you
come back home with me, huh?

433
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,105
We'll watch some movies,
have some ice cream.

434
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,025
It'll be nice.

435
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,110
- But I just got here.

436
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,612
- How about, how about you just
do

437
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,156
what the grown ups ask you to
do, hm?

438
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,034
I'll see you soon.

439
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:25,994
- Fine.

440
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,247
- Oh.

441
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,165
Don't hurt me, now.

442
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,042
I'll see you later, okay?

443
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,210
All right.

444
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:45,178
Ouch.

445
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,056
- Yeah.

446
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,602
You know, I don't want to hear
it.

447
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,310
- I haven't even said anything
yet.

448
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,230
- Yeah, I can feel the Ray
Rose judgment all on your face.

449
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:56,439
Now save it for somebody
who didn't just see

450
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,611
their father gunned down in
front of him.

451
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,738
He killed my father, Ray.

452
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,115
And now they'll try to kill me.

453
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,867
And they're trying to take
me away from my daughter.

454
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,368
Should I let that go?

455
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,370
- You go down this road, a lot
of people are gonna get hurt.

456
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,872
- Yeah, no, that's their
problem.

457
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:12,956
- No.

458
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,375
Goddammit, no, it's your
problem.

459
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,795
It's Jada's problem.

460
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,380
Is this the kind of man you
wanna be?

461
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,840
What are you teaching her?

462
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,425
- Teach her how to defend this
family.

463
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,845
How to stand up for herself
and the ones she loves.

464
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,183
- You have got to relax.

465
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,819
- You know, when my father
told me to come work for him,

466
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,863
I thought it was just so we
could protect his business,

467
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,032
make sure his legacy could live
on.

468
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,534
But now I, I don't know, maybe
it's-

469
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,202
- We gotta go.

470
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,996
A car load of Rooker's men
just pulled up outside.

471
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:53,914
- Well how do you know they're
Rooker's?

472
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,165
- Because I'm really good at
what I do.

473
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,208
Look, your old man trusted me
and now you've gotta trust me.

474
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,459
We gotta go, but right now.

475
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,253
- Fine.
- No, what are you doing?

476
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,254
- Did you hear what I just said?

477
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,130
There's a car load of
these days coming here.

478
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,089
What do you think, they're
coming in

479
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,007
and giving them get well soon
balloons?

480
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,134
- How do they know what hospital
we're at?

481
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,177
- Jesus Christ, it doesn't
matter

482
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,512
how they know, they're here.

483
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,931
I gotta get him out the back.

484
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,434
- Hey, go home. Go home and
play with your goddaughter.

485
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,854
- Go.

486
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:27,531
- Hey.

487
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,009
- Excuse me, is there
a stairwell near here?

488
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:53,016
Fuck.

489
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,078
- Shit.

490
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,448
- I'm out.

491
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,485
- Come on. Let's go.

492
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,529
Come on, up.

493
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,446
We gotta go.

494
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,324
Come on.

495
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:48,797
- Hey, that's him.

496
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,675
That's the guy.

497
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,383
Hey, watch out, Ray!

498
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,638
- Come on, get into
the car.

499
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,368
- Hey, what are you doing?

500
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,494
Stop!

501
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,165
Get in, get in!

502
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,667
Are you good?
- Yeah, I think I'm good.

503
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,761
Your wound is open.
- I'm fine.

504
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,430
- Grant.
- I said I'll be fine!

505
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,515
What are you doing?

506
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:40,557
- I'm rallying the troops.

507
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,517
- Hang up the phone.

508
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,018
- Rooker's gonna keep sending
more men.

509
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,227
You know that, right?

510
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,730
He's gonna keep sending people
until you're in the ground.

511
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,314
We need every man we can get
right now.

512
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,359
- I said hang up the fucking
phone.

513
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,278
How did Rooker's men know where
we were?

514
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,031
I mean they didn't just
know what hospital I was in.

515
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,742
They knew the exact room I was
in

516
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,619
and they came directly at us.

517
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,789
So, who'd you tell I was at
Mercer?

518
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:04,665
- Me?

519
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,373
- Yeah, fuckin' you.

520
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:05,999
- Who the fuck's talking to you?

521
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,458
- Hey, don't look at him.

522
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,669
Answer my question.

523
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,755
- Nobody. I didn't tell fucking
anybody.

524
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,089
Are you fucking serious?

525
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,090
- Grant.

526
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,801
You need to calm down.
- Stay out of this, Ray.

527
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:16,677
- You need to chill out, all
right?

528
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,637
I'm a fucking law enforcement
officer.

529
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:19,846
I let way too much shit slide,

530
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,431
I can't let you kill this
asshole.

531
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,308
- I'm not gonna kill him.

532
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,560
No.

533
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,564
Not while we're driving.

534
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm gonna shoot his fucking
balls off.

535
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,816
Who'd you tell?

536
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,358
- Come on. No.

537
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,026
- Who?

538
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:33,902
- I told some of the...

539
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:34,778
Nobody, okay? Nobody.

540
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,321
Did you forget that they were
fucking

541
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,739
shooting at me, too?

542
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,532
Fuck's sake.

543
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,452
Take it easy, Grant, okay,
please?

544
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,995
- You better not lying to me.

545
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:49,002
- I'm not lying.

546
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,590
- Ms. Carucci, I remember.

547
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,591
Yes.

548
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,676
No gluten, no peanuts.

549
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,552
Almond milk.

550
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:02,806
Um, I think I, I'm out.

551
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,183
I tell you what, I'll go
pick some up, all right?

552
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,644
You know, I have another call
coming in.

553
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,773
I'll call you right back. I
promise.

554
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,902
- She's just gonna call right
back.

555
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,201
- Hey, is there anything that
you can eat?

556
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,662
- I can eat anything in
moderation.

557
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:26,663
- Moderation, huh?

558
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,915
- Yeah, too much of
anything is bad for you.

559
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,834
Surgeon general told us that.

560
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,002
- Really?

561
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,756
- Is there anything that you can
eat?

562
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:35,674
You are pretty old.

563
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:22,678
- What the hell is this
place?

564
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,638
- Rooker operates out of here
sometimes.

565
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,681
- All right, so what's your
plan?

566
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:26,640
- Well what's yours?

567
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,641
- Same as before.

568
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,810
You know, call the cops
and let them handle it?

569
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:30,686
- Fuckin' hell, has anyone ever
told you

570
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,771
you're like a dog with a fucking
bone?

571
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,355
Doesn't loyalty or honor or
respect,

572
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,941
doesn't any of that mean
anything to you?

573
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:36,900
- Yeah, you should know the
difference

574
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,944
between defending honor
and getting revenge.

575
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,613
- Shut up.
- Ray, I told ya.

576
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,951
If we're not down for this, then
go home.

577
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,578
Stop wasting your breath
trying to get us to stand down

578
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,746
because it's not happening,
okay?

579
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,665
My father's killer, he's gonna
be dead

580
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,249
before the sun goes down.

581
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:53,917
Understand?

582
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,295
- Okay, so what's your plan?

583
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,379
- You know my plan.

584
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm gonna go in there and
I'm gonna ask a question

585
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,883
and then I'm gonna shoot
somebody.

586
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,677
And then I'm gonna ask the same
question,

587
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,137
if nobody answers it, I'm
gonna shoot somebody else.

588
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,765
And then again, if nobody
answers that question,

589
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,059
the same question, I'm
gonna shoot somebody else.

590
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,854
Okay, 'cause I'm gonna keep
shootin' until I get my answers.

591
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:14,938
- That works for me.

592
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,669
- Get down.

593
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,845
- Come on, get out
here.

594
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,971
Come on, come on.

595
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:48,764
- Come on.

596
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:50,350
Where you going, where you
going?

597
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,102
Get over there!

598
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,938
Keep going, get in there.

599
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,356
- Son of a bitch!

600
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,902
- Is that what I think it is?

601
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,361
- He's been sex trafficking
this whole fucking time.

602
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,321
That meeting was a fucking smoke
screen.

603
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,865
- My father forbid this.

604
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,199
- And they killed him for it.

605
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,993
- But this is what you
need to put an end to them.

606
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:10,994
All right, you got proof right
here.

607
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,996
Sex trafficking puts the
whole organization away-

608
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,289
- He's not still talking about
calling

609
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,373
the fucking cops, is he?

610
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,959
- No, I'm gonna handle him.

611
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,296
Then you can call your cops.

612
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,380
- So you're gonna get revenge
no matter what, right?

613
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,298
No matter what the cost,

614
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,174
no matter who gets
caught in the crossfire?

615
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,304
- Nobody in that house is
innocent.

616
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:29,848
Let's go.

617
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,934
- You're wrong.

618
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,979
Those girls are innocent.

619
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,450
- Get in there, shut up!

620
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,537
Get comfy, ladies.

621
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,539
This is your home now.

622
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,259
♪ Oh man I got a lot of gold ♪

623
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,969
♪ Stack that bread like dominoes♪

624
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,263
♪ Anything is possible ♪

625
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,765
- Don't move!

626
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,688
What part of don't move
did he not understand?

627
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:05,068
♪ Oh man I got a lot of gold ♪

628
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,854
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

629
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,648
- Hey, if you keep shooting
everybody,

630
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,649
who's gonna answer my questions?

631
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,111
- He fucking moved. What
did you want me to do?

632
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,660
- Come on, we're gonna
get you out of here.

633
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:57,538
Let's go.

634
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,207
Shh.

635
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:02,916
- Be quiet?

636
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,250
There's a firefight going on.

637
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,460
- Once you get to the road,

638
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,254
find the nearest person, house,
car and call for help, okay?

639
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,091
Go, go, go, go.

640
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:21,810
- Hey, ah, ah, ah, sit your
fucking ass in that chair.

641
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:22,771
- Sit down.

642
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,897
- Do not be a stupid cunt.

643
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,442
- Dammit, Vince, is he dead?

644
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:32,779
- All right, all right that
was partially my fault.

645
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,531
Only partially, though,
because you know what?

646
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,241
If I hadn't of shot him, G,

647
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,368
he would've come in and shot
you.

648
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,621
But you should take partial
responsibility for it.

649
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:42,539
- Me? For what?

650
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,333
- I don't like to criticize
you in front of...

651
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,334
Look, mate, honestly?

652
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,670
I don't think you said
don't move loud enough

653
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,755
when you came in.

654
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,635
The people in other rooms,
I don't think heard you.

655
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:55,301
I've said it now.

656
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:55,969
Look.

657
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,847
- Okay.

658
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,723
Are you listening?

659
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,559
Don't move or you're gonna die.

660
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,936
Did you hear me? Did they hear
me?

661
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,354
- I think you're doing it too
loud now.

662
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,525
There's only two of them.

663
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:30,756
- Where's your boss?

664
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:35,302
Where's Rooker?

665
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,974
- Wait, wait.

666
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:55,612
- No!

667
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:57,781
- What the fuck did you do that
for?

668
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,782
- He's down!

669
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,702
- He's down when I fucking
say he's down, okay?

670
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:02,786
- What are you gonna do
with that?

671
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,621
- Whatever the fuck I like.

672
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:05,622
Listen, you're either here to
help us

673
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,373
or you can fuck off,

674
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,167
and that's the last time
I'm saying that to you.

675
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:17,634
- Grant.

676
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,469
- What the fuck did you do that
for?

677
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,763
- I told you what was gonna
happen.

678
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,517
Nobody answered my questions.

679
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,104
Fuck 'em. They can all die.

680
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:31,940
Why don't you look for
something we can find?

681
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:34,361
Something's gotta tell us where
Rooker is.

682
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:41,535
- Hey.

683
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,745
How many people am I
supposed to let you kill

684
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:45,579
before I take you in?

685
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,539
- What's that supposed to mean,
huh?

686
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,373
You're gonna take me in?

687
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,374
- Yeah, I'll do whatever I have
to do

688
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,375
because you're not gonna listen
to reason.

689
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,919
- Well what happened to
I don't wanna be the one

690
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,046
to tell Jada daddy's not coming
home

691
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:58,759
to telling Jada daddy's not
coming home because of me?

692
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:00,468
- I'm serious, Grant.

693
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,469
Cut this shit out.

694
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:05,599
- I agree, and it will
end when I kill Rooker.

695
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,476
Understand?

696
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,436
What'd you find?

697
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,106
- Yeah, rather surprisingly,
I found fuck all

698
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:13,940
because you killed everybody

699
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,651
we were about to ask questions
to.

700
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:18,030
Like honestly mate, what
the fuck you playing at?

701
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,705
- What's the matter, you wanna
watch

702
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,666
something different, Jada?

703
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:33,251
- No, I mean, that's the
point? It's all fake anyway.

704
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,878
- Fake?

705
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,963
You never heard of a talking
fish?

706
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,882
Who has a friend who
can't remember anything?

707
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:39,591
Come on.

708
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,720
- I'm 11, you know. Not a baby.

709
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,056
- Excuse me.

710
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:48,811
Okay.

711
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,610
You wanna talk about somethin'?

712
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,862
- He never wants to
spend any time with me.

713
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,699
- Sweetie, there's no one
in the world your father

714
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:06,367
would rather spend time
with than you, believe me.

715
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,036
- Yeah, right.

716
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,163
- I know it may not
seem that way sometimes

717
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,373
because he's always working,

718
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,587
but everything he does, he does
for you,

719
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:16,964
like all good fathers do.

720
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:19,341
- Yeah, right.

721
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,595
- Can I ask you something?

722
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,223
Have you ever seen your father
cry?

723
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:30,603
I have.

724
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:33,687
- When?

725
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,732
- 11 years ago.

726
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:36,900
The day you were born.

727
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:39,860
- Was he sad?

728
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:40,738
- No.

729
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,281
He was happy, sweetie.

730
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,952
Probably happier than
he's been his whole life.

731
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,538
- Really?

732
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,749
- I saw him cry with my own
eyes.

733
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,009
- What was that?

734
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,885
- Well, that was probably just a
raccoon

735
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,764
trying to get into my garbage
cans.

736
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,849
I'm gonna check it out.

737
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,892
You finish watching the movie

738
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,852
and I'll get a refill on this?

739
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:14,688
- Sure.

740
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,964
What the fuck are you doing in
my house?

741
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:01,068
Jada?

742
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,238
Let her go.

743
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,282
- Pops!

744
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,868
No, no, stop, you're hurting
him!

745
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,036
Pops!

746
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,539
No, no, stop, stop, you're
hurting him!

747
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,332
Pops, please!

748
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:31,346
- So we think this is a good
idea?

749
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,347
Just sitting out here in the
open

750
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,390
when someone's out there
trying to kill him?

751
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:35,519
- Yeah, let 'em come.

752
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:39,229
Where the hell's the waitress
at?

753
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,105
I need a straw.

754
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,107
- Fuckin' same old Grant
Schiavone, man.

755
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,984
You know, your bullheadedness
is gonna get you killed

756
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,527
if your ego doesn't first.

757
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:46,363
- So be it.

758
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,030
Hey, waitress?

759
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,490
Yo, hello? I need a straw.

760
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,992
Hello?
- Dude, relax.

761
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,660
I'll get you a straw.

762
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:03,461
- I don't need you to get me a
straw, Ray.

763
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,590
- What is going on?

764
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,591
- Stop trying to fix everything.

765
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:08,426
Stop.

766
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,013
- I think he wants you to
stop pretending to be his mum.

767
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:14,472
- Yeah, we're all set.
- Eat your waffles.

768
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,266
- Told you you wouldn't like it.

769
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,475
- I'm just trying to help, okay?

770
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:20,771
- Yeah, well, I don't need your
help.

771
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:22,773
We're not kids anymore.

772
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:25,193
I don't need you to swoop
in and save the day.

773
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,320
- So, what am I doing here?

774
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,617
- Yeah, I was kind of
wondering the same thing.

775
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:40,292
Look, besides Jada,

776
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,963
you and Pops are the
only family I have left.

777
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,297
And if anything was to happen to
you, too,

778
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,424
because of the Schiavone
business?

779
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,177
No, that's not gonna happen

780
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,640
if you keep on insisting
being my protector.

781
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,727
So why don't you let me help you
for once?

782
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:02,565
Go home, Ray.

783
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,026
- Amen to that.

784
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,402
Do you need me to call you an
Uber?

785
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:12,616
Hm?

786
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,078
- Yeah?

787
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,706
Who is this?

788
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,541
- You've cost Mr.
Rooker a lot of money tonight

789
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:23,416
and took something from him.

790
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,544
- Oh, tell your boss to fuck
off.

791
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,420
We didn't take anything
from his geriatric ass.

792
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,380
We've been in the city all
fucking day.

793
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:30,924
- You should not have
interfered

794
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,425
with Mr. Rooker's business.

795
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,845
He valued those girls very much.

796
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,138
And since you took that away
from him,

797
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,103
he will now take something
away from you that you value.

798
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,271
- Where's Jada?

799
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:44,896
- Call Pops.

800
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:45,816
- I'll get the car.

801
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:53,782
- We gotta go.

802
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:07,170
Dammit!

803
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:09,462
All right, come on let's go.

804
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,756
- I'm fucking going, am I?

805
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:12,716
What use is it if we speed
and we get pulled over,

806
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,177
then we're not gonna get there.

807
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:30,567
- Hold up.
- Hey, get back in the car.

808
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,902
- I'm on a job, this is my
father's house!

809
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,111
- Hey.
- Get back in the car!

810
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,321
- Hey fuck you, man,
my daughter's in that house.

811
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,447
Hey, Ray.

812
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:37,866
- Hey.

813
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:39,951
What the fuck?
- Get the fuck.

814
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,747
- Hey, get back in the car.
- My daughter's in there!

815
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:46,332
- Hey, hey, hey, don't
you fucking touch him!

816
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,417
Hey.

817
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,877
Don't I know you?
- No, I don't think you do.

818
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,754
- Yeah, I think-
- Get back in the car,

819
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:52,923
take it around, the street's
closed.

820
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,049
Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey!

821
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,425
Hey, listen, it's his daughter,
okay?

822
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,427
It's his daughter, hey, relax!

823
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,263
Relax.

824
00:43:58,931 --> 00:43:59,805
- Hey, shh, shh.

825
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,599
- You need me to move the car,
right?

826
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,936
- Get the car outta here!

827
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:09,692
- Dad?

828
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,318
Dad.

829
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,655
Jesus Christ, what happened?

830
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,615
- We don't know. He
hasn't been able to say much.

831
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:19,950
Looks like a home invasion.

832
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:20,784
- Dad.

833
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:21,785
- They beat him up pretty
bad.

834
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,954
- They're gonna take
care of you, all right?

835
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:24,832
- Where's Jada?

836
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,584
- They took her.

837
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,046
Masks. Devil masks.

838
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,006
I tried.

839
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:35,507
I'm sorry, Grant.

840
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,801
- Hey Pops, hey Pops, I know you
did.

841
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:38,679
I know you did.

842
00:44:40,598 --> 00:44:41,555
- Ray?

843
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:43,389
- Yeah, Dad?

844
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,435
- Family, no matter what.

845
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:50,856
Family, right?

846
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,901
No matter what?

847
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:56,987
- Dad, Dad?

848
00:44:57,823 --> 00:44:58,697
- What's happening?
- We gotta go.

849
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,536
Please, just let us go.

850
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,623
- Fuck, things are getting out
of hand.

851
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,874
Where's Jada?

852
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,000
- Rooker has her.

853
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:10,878
- Shit.

854
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,920
Do you remember when your
father was getting annoyed

855
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,881
because cops were kept
flipping over to Rooker

856
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,593
because he was paying them more?

857
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,136
- Yeah.

858
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:21,512
- You see that guy?

859
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:22,929
He's one of them.

860
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,931
- Are you sure?
- I'm fucking positive.

861
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,100
I told you I recognized him.

862
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,102
We went around to all of
their homes one by one

863
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,980
and trust me, he's got a fucking
hot wife.

864
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:32,856
If you wanna find Rooker,

865
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:34,151
I say we stop following bread
crumbs.

866
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,614
- Let's go.

867
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,948
- Hey, where you going?

868
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,617
- Stay with Pops.

869
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:44,452
He needs you.

870
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:46,830
I don't.

871
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,180
- So what do you wanna do?

872
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:05,808
- Follow him.

873
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,190
- Yes, boss.

874
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,288
- Needs you.

875
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,998
- Dad, he's a grown man. You
need me.

876
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,876
- No.

877
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,212
Not he, she.

878
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:38,757
Jada.

879
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,091
Find her.

880
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:43,093
- Dad, cut it out, all
right? Take it easy.

881
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:43,971
- Find...

882
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:51,770
- Can we hurry up, please?

883
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,048
- Could this guy be more of a
cliche?

884
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,217
I mean he's a cop in a donut
shop.

885
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,095
Fucking hell.

886
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,223
- All right, let's go.

887
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,309
- We can't pick him up here,
mate.

888
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:34,396
- Yeah, let's go.

889
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,833
Hey.

890
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:57,711
Get in.

891
00:47:59,087 --> 00:47:59,922
Now.

892
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:04,174
- Shit.

893
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:10,265
- Good boy.

894
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:30,452
Come on.

895
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,999
- I know you know who we are.

896
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:41,628
And we know who you are.

897
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,006
And more importantly, we
know who you work for.

898
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,132
- I work for the city of Los-

899
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,053
- Oh!

900
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,513
- I'm a fucking police officer.

901
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,139
Are you crazy?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

902
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,309
Mind your manners.

903
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,107
- Where's my daughter?

904
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,191
- Daughter? Who the-

905
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:04,903
- Ah!

906
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,195
- Are you all right?

907
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,031
- He's hurt.

908
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,406
Clearly needs to go to a
hospital.

909
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,661
- Hey, do not talk unless you're
answering

910
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:17,372
some of his questions, you
stupid cunt.

911
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,877
Now stay down, for fuck's sake.

912
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,008
- You know, you're right.

913
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:29,342
I should be in the hospital

914
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,931
'cause I was shot, the same
day my father was killed.

915
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,684
And now my daughter's been
kidnapped.

916
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,353
Good friend's house of mine.

917
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:43,108
So I need you to listen to
me very closely, huh, huh?

918
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,110
Closely, 'cause there's no
scenario

919
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,486
where you get back into your
squad car

920
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,490
without telling me where my
daughter is.

921
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:53,659
And I know who you work for.

922
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:56,119
And guess what? You used to work
for us.

923
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:59,540
So, imagine all the ungodly shit

924
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,126
that we could pull up on you.

925
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,669
You're entangled with both
families.

926
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,211
- Why go through the trouble,
boss?

927
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:07,548
I say we just fucking pop him
right here

928
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,675
and then we drive to that house
of his

929
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:12,427
and we cap his kid and we
murder his fucking wife.

930
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,595
That's after of course I've got
her

931
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:15,346
to do some unspeakable things to
me.

932
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:16,014
- You motherfucker!

933
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,766
- Hey, don't fucking look at me.

934
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,228
Answer his fucking questions,
hm?

935
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,438
- Where's my daughter?

936
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,307
- Stand up.

937
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,143
Come here!

938
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:04,732
- Come!

939
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:28,296
- Smile.

940
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:39,933
- I want to go home.

941
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:20,388
- I wanna go home!

942
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,892
Let me go!

943
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,936
Let me go home!

944
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:26,939
Please.

945
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,454
Stop it, Jada.

946
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:45,371
Stop it.

947
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:48,544
If you're crying, you're not
thinking.

948
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,592
What would Grandpa do?

949
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:57,928
What would Dad do?

950
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,009
Thanks for that, too, Grandpa
Carmine.

951
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,144
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey.

952
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:51,813
I need you to run a trace
on a call, all right?

953
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:53,776
Let know as soon as you have
location.

954
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:58,820
Number is 973-415-9604.

955
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,073
- Okay, no worries.

956
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:04,119
Hey, Ray, is everything okay?

957
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,287
- Hey, I gotta go, all right?

958
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:08,622
Call me back when have
something.

959
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:09,457
- All right.

960
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,507
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Pops.

961
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:19,007
Take it easy, all right?

962
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,511
Take it easy. You want some
water?

963
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,014
Take it easy, all right?

964
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:26,892
- J...

965
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:28,727
Jada.

966
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,102
Okay?

967
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:31,980
- No.

968
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,525
I don't know.

969
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,358
Grant is out there looking
for her, all right?

970
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,110
What, hey, hey, what is it?

971
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,737
What is it?

972
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,781
Stop, stop.

973
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:43,865
You're gonna hurt
yourself, all right? Stop.

974
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,033
- No.

975
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,618
You...

976
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,287
You go.

977
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:50,956
Help your brother.

978
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,373
- No, what?

979
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,960
No, no. Grant will find her.

980
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:55,879
- You, you!

981
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:04,847
- What?

982
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:12,270
- I'm so proud of you, Ray.

983
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:16,147
- I know you are.

984
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:17,943
I know you are, Dad.
I'm proud of you, too.

985
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:21,822
Pops?

986
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:23,616
Pops!

987
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:28,076
No, no, no.

988
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:29,285
Pops.

989
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:31,039
No, come on, please don't do
this.

990
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,456
Pops!

991
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:34,290
- We need you to leave now.

992
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,167
- What is happening?
- Outside, now.

993
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:37,836
- But I'm his son.

994
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,839
- We're gonna do everything we
can, sir.

995
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:01,484
Ah!

996
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:02,362
- Hey!

997
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,993
- Hey, let me go! My dad's gonna
kill you!

998
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:11,369
- Don't make me hurt
you, kid.

999
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,955
My boss will kill me
if I damage the goods.

1000
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:18,962
Or we find a supplier.

1001
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:23,008
If you try to leave again,
you're gonna get hurt.

1002
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,133
Don't push your luck.

1003
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,469
- Don't push yours.
- Stay!

1004
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:28,764
Or...

1005
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:04,733
- You got something for me?

1006
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:06,403
- Something you need to tell me?

1007
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,571
- Just taking care of
some family business.

1008
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,197
- What kind of family
business requires you

1009
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,491
to use agency resources to trace
a phone?

1010
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,537
- The important kind.

1011
00:58:15,663 --> 00:58:18,290
- You think I don't
already know what's going on?

1012
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:21,332
- Then you know what I have to
do.

1013
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,376
- I know what you think you have
to do,

1014
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,128
but this is not the way, Ray.

1015
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,171
I need you to stand down.

1016
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,255
- Not gonna happen.

1017
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:30,717
The last thing we need is for
your face

1018
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,678
to be plastered all over the
news

1019
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,387
being associated with a local
turf war

1020
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,682
between two crime families.
- Turf?

1021
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:37,849
You think this is about turf?

1022
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:40,519
You think I would be involved
if this is about turf?

1023
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,313
- Ray, listen.
- I gotta go.

1024
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,065
- This is not a request.

1025
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,442
I'm ordering you to stand down.

1026
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,528
I can't stop you from here.

1027
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,363
I'm ordering you to steer
clear of your friend's drama.

1028
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:53,281
That's all I can do.

1029
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,617
What you do next is completely
up to you

1030
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,369
and the consequences are
yours and yours alone.

1031
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:00,121
Do you understand what I'm
saying?

1032
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:01,372
- Yeah.

1033
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:03,792
You're telling me to choose
between my job and my family.

1034
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:07,420
- I'm asking you to decide
where your loyalty lies

1035
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,382
and proceed accordingly.

1036
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:19,101
- Message received.

1037
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:25,107
- Ray?

1038
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,190
- Yes?

1039
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:27,860
- Get in.

1040
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,873
- Okay, Ray.

1041
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,792
We're headed to the storage
place on Roosevelt, right?

1042
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:46,668
- That's right.

1043
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,878
- Got it.

1044
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,796
Oh, I'm Candy by the way.

1045
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:50,674
- Got it.

1046
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,425
- All righty.

1047
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,762
- Did you run a trace on
that number he gave you?

1048
00:59:56,764 --> 00:59:57,765
- No, sir. Not yet.

1049
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:59,725
- Don't.

1050
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:10,861
- Where's my daughter?

1051
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,862
- Fuck...

1052
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:16,740
You!

1053
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:21,703
- Boss, are you sure you
don't want me to take over?

1054
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,454
Or do you at least want a donut?

1055
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:24,665
It'll give you like a sugar
boost.

1056
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:27,834
- No, it's my daughter, it's my
pain.

1057
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:28,710
- All right, they're good,
though.

1058
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:29,838
- I can do this all night.

1059
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:33,592
This one?

1060
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:35,926
This one's for Pops.

1061
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:42,599
Ah!

1062
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:43,435
Where is she?

1063
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,408
- If she's lucky,

1064
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:02,996
she's on her way...

1065
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,337
To a cartel leader's house in
Mexico.

1066
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:17,052
Some big mansion where she can
be really well taken care of.

1067
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,060
If she plays nice.

1068
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,026
- You gonna stick to that story?

1069
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,444
You stickin' to that story?

1070
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,863
- Where's my daughter?

1071
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,573
- Fuck you!

1072
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,038
- Are you done?

1073
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,040
Yeah?

1074
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:51,752
- You sure?

1075
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:57,510
Tell him, tell him.

1076
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:00,761
- Rooker keeps all this girls

1077
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:05,140
in the old Westfield Warehouse
while he waits for buyers.

1078
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,476
That's, that's where they'll
have her,

1079
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:11,187
if they haven't sold her
already.

1080
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:13,940
If they haven't sold her
already.

1081
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,109
- You better pray to
God that they haven't.

1082
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:18,779
- Please. Please, I
have a family too, man.

1083
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:20,238
- You think I give a fuck about
that?

1084
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,159
- I have a family, too.

1085
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,916
- Leave him.

1086
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,293
- Boss, what do you mean leave
him?

1087
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:35,130
We gotta fucking do him, haven't
we?

1088
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,673
- What's he gonna do? Tell the
truth?

1089
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:38,551
Hm?

1090
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:40,717
Yeah.

1091
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,680
He's not gonna see in
the inside of a prison.

1092
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,055
- You hear that, buddy boy?

1093
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,976
You might not believe this,
but this was your lucky day.

1094
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,063
Good luck explaining all this
shit.

1095
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:08,680
How do you wanna do this?

1096
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,473
- Well we can't go in there guns
blazing

1097
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:11,977
until we know Jada is safe.

1098
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,061
- All right, then we go in
quietly.

1099
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:16,813
Get the lay of the land.

1100
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:18,398
And then we go guns blazing.

1101
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,068
- When Jada's safe, you
can shoot anybody you want.

1102
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,779
Kill everybody if you want.

1103
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,323
As long as we secure Jada first.

1104
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:28,742
- Yeah, I know.

1105
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:29,535
Come on, let's do this.

1106
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,337
- Shit.

1107
01:04:46,344 --> 01:04:48,219
- Are you okay, Ray?

1108
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:51,139
'Cause you look like...

1109
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,891
I mean I can smell the
negativity

1110
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:54,893
coming up off you like cheap
cologne,

1111
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:58,063
which is funny because your
actual cologne is nice.

1112
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,147
I'm fine.

1113
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,441
- Are you sure? Because
I'm a really good listener.

1114
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,610
You know, dropping people
around is just my side gig.

1115
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,278
I'm actually a licensed
therapist.

1116
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,446
- Thank you.

1117
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:07,322
I'm fine.

1118
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:08,534
- If you say so.

1119
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,117
But that negative energy
needs to be dealt with,

1120
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,953
'cause I don't have any sage in
my car-

1121
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:13,831
- Ma'am.

1122
01:05:14,957 --> 01:05:16,333
I heard you the first time.

1123
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:23,129
- Hey.

1124
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:23,966
It's me.

1125
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,010
I tracked down that number for
you.

1126
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:28,969
- But Doss.

1127
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:31,306
- Doss was a great agent a long
time ago,

1128
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:33,974
but now he sits behind a desk

1129
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:35,391
and he's forgotten what it feels
like.

1130
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:36,392
- What what feels like?

1131
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:37,644
- The need to right a wrong,

1132
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:39,229
to fix what needs to be fixed.

1133
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:41,272
And you, you're the best I've
ever seen

1134
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:42,400
up close at doing that.

1135
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:48,406
So, if you ask for help, I
know it's for a good reason.

1136
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,577
The phone is at 2315 Lansing
Drive.

1137
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:54,454
- You got it.

1138
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:57,455
I owe you a beer when I get
back.

1139
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,167
- And an apology.

1140
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,128
- That, too.

1141
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,962
- Hey Ray?

1142
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:04,965
Do me a favor, yeah?

1143
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,175
Try not to get killed.

1144
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,596
I don't want to be the one
to explain that to Doss.

1145
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:14,598
- I got it, buddy.

1146
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,433
Thanks.

1147
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:21,064
Change of plans.

1148
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:24,234
Take me to 2315 Lansing Drive.

1149
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:34,662
- He's coming.

1150
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:44,963
- All right, I'm going.

1151
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,013
- Take it easy.

1152
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,682
- I'd like to apologize for what
I-

1153
01:06:56,684 --> 01:06:58,183
- Don't say it!

1154
01:06:58,185 --> 01:06:59,601
If you say my father's name,

1155
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:03,855
I'm gonna come over this table
and I'll fucking kill you.

1156
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,193
- I had great respect for your
father.

1157
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,610
It's just a shame that his
stubbornness

1158
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:11,446
and lack of foresight would not
allow us

1159
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:12,698
to come to an arrangement.

1160
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,574
- For what?

1161
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:16,409
For your sex trafficking in our
city?

1162
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,410
Yeah, we told you not to do
that.

1163
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,831
We don't do that in our
city. You did it anyway.

1164
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,415
So don't sit there and
act like you didn't know

1165
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:24,626
this would come to a head, hm?

1166
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:27,337
You knew and you knew when we
found out

1167
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:28,296
that there would be blood.

1168
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:29,380
- But not ours.

1169
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:30,340
- Well that can be arranged,
mate.

1170
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:31,633
Why don't we talk-

1171
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,259
Take your fucking hands off me

1172
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,386
or you're never gonna get them
back.

1173
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:37,222
Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, what are you doing?

1174
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:38,807
Hey, where are you taking him?

1175
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:39,685
Answer me!

1176
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:43,854
- Carmine Schiavone was a good
man.

1177
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:45,396
- I told you not to say his
fucking name.

1178
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,440
- He's gone.

1179
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:51,321
His demise has created
a void in leadership.

1180
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,954
I'd like to propose a more
friendlier way

1181
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:03,416
of solving our problems.

1182
01:08:04,752 --> 01:08:06,670
It would be beneficial for all
of us.

1183
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:08,672
- Fuck you!

1184
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:11,717
- Think about your daughter.

1185
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:17,222
Is this a good place
to be raising a child?

1186
01:08:18,516 --> 01:08:22,350
You hand over your father's
business to me

1187
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:25,020
and I personally will make sure
that you

1188
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,564
and your daughter are well taken
care of.

1189
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:32,569
- You think 'cause you got us in
here

1190
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,239
and you took away our guns,

1191
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,490
you think I'm gonna give
you my father's legacy?

1192
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:38,869
- Yes, I do.

1193
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:49,713
- Are you sure this is where you
wanna be?

1194
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:52,883
- This is exactly where I want
to be.

1195
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:55,717
- If you say so.

1196
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,512
But you don't have nobody
tied up in there, do you?

1197
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,641
Nevermind. Don't answer that.

1198
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:06,770
Uh, we don't take cash.

1199
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:07,856
- Well you do tonight.

1200
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,026
- Take it easy, Ray.

1201
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,717
- You jumped board and killed my
father.

1202
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,802
I'm looking forward to killing
you.

1203
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:23,597
- There is an old Japanese
proverb.

1204
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:31,189
It means he who seeks only
vengeance finds only suffering.

1205
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,106
- That's nice.

1206
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:34,107
I'm gonna have to remember that.

1207
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:35,233
You know what?

1208
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:38,111
There was an old Italian
saying on my block growing up.

1209
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,905
It means fuck you.

1210
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:14,230
- Hey, you wanna stop whispering
like fucking school girls

1211
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:16,692
and tell me when I'm gonna get
outta here,

1212
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:17,778
otherwise I'm gonna have
to kick somebody's ass.

1213
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,864
And you don't want that, believe
me.

1214
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:28,704
All right.

1215
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:30,038
That's it?

1216
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,930
What the fuck too you so long?

1217
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:47,931
- You're welcome.

1218
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:48,932
- You had a gun the whole time?

1219
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:49,933
- I had two.

1220
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:52,686
- You had two guns this
whole fucking time?

1221
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:54,104
You didn't feel that'd
be useful at any point?

1222
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,230
- Where's Grant?

1223
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:57,148
- He's in a packaging area,
okay?

1224
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,067
Which is Rooker's weird ass
office.

1225
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:00,777
There's a lot of people
between here and there.

1226
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,653
- Okay.

1227
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,320
Well what about Jada?

1228
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,196
- I don't know.

1229
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:04,072
They jumped us before we got too
far in,

1230
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,407
but she's in the building
somewhere.

1231
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:07,951
- Okay.

1232
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:09,995
I'm gonna get Grant, you find
Jada,

1233
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:11,830
bring her to the packaging area.

1234
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:13,164
Think you can handle it?

1235
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,457
- What's that supposed to mean?

1236
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:15,291
Yeah, I can handle it.

1237
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:16,793
I handled this, didn't I?

1238
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:17,753
And why don't you go and get
Jada?

1239
01:12:17,755 --> 01:12:19,838
Wouldn't she much rather see
uncle Ray-Ray

1240
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,714
before she sees me?

1241
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,466
- We're doing this my way, all
right?

1242
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,260
Get Jada, bring her here.

1243
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,302
Got it?

1244
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:27,846
- Listen, you're not in charge.

1245
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:30,056
I happen to agree with the plan,
but...

1246
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:31,725
He's gone. All right, he's gone.

1247
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,268
All right, use your stealth.

1248
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,358
Fuck, that's loud.

1249
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,407
- Is that your cavalry I hear?

1250
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:31,952
Whoever it is, they better
be bringing in a lot of ammo.

1251
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,328
- There isn't anyone else.

1252
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:37,040
- We know you have bad cop Ray
Rose.

1253
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,374
We know all about him.

1254
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:39,252
Look.

1255
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:41,920
He's even on time.

1256
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:23,211
Just say what we asked
you to say on the camera

1257
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,548
then we can all go home.

1258
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,635
Look, I know you didn't
like your father's business.

1259
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:33,429
You only went to work for
him after your wife died,

1260
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,056
and you were looking for
something

1261
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:37,768
to fill your empty, useless
life.

1262
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,144
Am I right?

1263
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:41,688
- Don't you talk about my wife.

1264
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,527
- You just don't get the
dynamic, do you?

1265
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:49,156
You're in no position to give me
orders.

1266
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,123
- Ah!

1267
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:08,173
- We can put a stop to this
long evening you're having,

1268
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,636
and I'm sure that your
daughter is ready to go home.

1269
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:14,555
- Where is she?

1270
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:21,562
Get away from him.

1271
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:23,522
- We gotta get out there.

1272
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:24,608
- What about her?

1273
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:33,865
- All right, wait!

1274
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:34,658
- Down on your knees.

1275
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,536
- Ha, you must be the best
friend.

1276
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:39,540
- I said get your ass down on
your knees.

1277
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:46,712
- My sources told me
that you're a DEA agent,

1278
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:47,879
is that correct?

1279
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,256
- This is not talk time. This
is shut the fuck up time.

1280
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:52,843
- May I ask you a question?

1281
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:55,470
Are you here on official DEA
business

1282
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:57,388
or is this just some
kind of personal fucking-

1283
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,767
- Keep talking, asshole.

1284
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:00,686
Keep talking.

1285
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:03,438
Grant.

1286
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:05,856
Come on, buddy, get up, we gotta
go.

1287
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:08,694
- I think your friend might
need some medical assistance.

1288
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,820
You know, after the night you've
had,

1289
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:15,281
don't think you'd wanna
go back to that hospital.

1290
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:18,326
Oh, by the way, how's your
father?

1291
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:19,452
- Don't test me, Rooker.

1292
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,541
- No. Nobody kills him but me.

1293
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,168
- No one else is dying tonight.

1294
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:53,697
You sure about this?

1295
01:16:58,911 --> 01:16:59,787
- Hey!

1296
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,954
- Shoot him.

1297
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:03,997
- I don't want to.

1298
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:04,706
- Shot him!

1299
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,707
He's gonna take that gun off you

1300
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,292
and he's gonna shoot me

1301
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:08,877
and then he's probably gonna
shoot you!

1302
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:09,920
Shoot him!

1303
01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:10,754
- Stay back.

1304
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,297
- All right, little
girl.

1305
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:13,757
Give me the gun.
- Don't listen to him!

1306
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:14,883
- It's not a toy.

1307
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:15,967
- Jada!

1308
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,011
He'll kill me, kill you
and then kill your father!

1309
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:19,805
- Just give me the fucking gun!

1310
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:21,723
- Please, mister, stop walking.

1311
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,434
This gun is no used to you.

1312
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:25,644
- Shoot him!

1313
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:35,737
- I win.

1314
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:43,036
- I told you that that
gun was no use to you.

1315
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:43,745
- You little sh-

1316
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:48,959
- Your father should not be
showing you

1317
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:50,418
how to use guns at your age.

1318
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,879
- I didn't learn it from daddy,
doofus.

1319
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:55,882
I saw it on the Sopranos.

1320
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,718
- You're all right.

1321
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,388
Come on, let's get out of here.

1322
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:02,975
I need those bullets.

1323
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,721
- Hey, hey, hey.

1324
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:26,014
Don't you fucking move.

1325
01:19:29,562 --> 01:19:31,978
- So, I guess this is where you-

1326
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,232
- No!

1327
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,536
No.

1328
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,041
- Daddy?

1329
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:24,074
- You're okay.

1330
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:25,866
- Hey.

1331
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:26,994
Hey, Jay-Bird.

1332
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:29,329
- Ray-Ray.

1333
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,458
- I bet you weren't even scared,
huh?

1334
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,294
- Not a bit.

1335
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:41,008
How's Pops?

1336
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:56,023
- Hope you know your old man
would be very proud of you.

1337
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:59,190
- Yeah, well enjoy it while you
can,

1338
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,902
'cause we got a lot of questions
we're gonna have to answer.

1339
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:02,778
- Question?

1340
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,112
What questions are you talking
about?

1341
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,864
Oh, I know he is not talking
about

1342
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,908
calling the fucking cops again,
is he?

1343
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:08,827
- Yeah, Vincent.

1344
01:21:10,203 --> 01:21:11,327
I think he is.

1345
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:13,371
- Are you serious?

1346
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,373
You still wanna play Boy Scout?

1347
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,374
After everything that's
fucking happened here?

1348
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,002
There are so many dead
bodies in this building,

1349
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,378
lots of which you dropped.

1350
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,922
Or did you forget that?

1351
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:25,050
- I told you, we're doing this
my way.

1352
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:27,218
- You sure about that, big man?

1353
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,094
Huh?

1354
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:28,931
- Vincent.

1355
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:30,933
Hey.

1356
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:34,436
It's over.

1357
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,862
- It doesn't have to be.

1358
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:56,206
- You see? You fucking
need someone like me!

1359
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:59,334
That's what happens when
you don't finish a job!

1360
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:00,879
- Can we go home now?

1361
01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:04,466
- Yeah, baby.

1362
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,426
We can go home.

1363
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,177
- All of you guys go.

1364
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,097
I'm gonna stay and clean
some of this shit up.

1365
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:14,015
I don't know about you, but
after this,

1366
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,351
I'm gonna sleep like a fucking
log.

1367
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:17,187
- Not me.

1368
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:19,563
I'm gonna have nightmares about
devils

1369
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:21,356
for the rest of my life.

1370
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:23,525
- Oh, those stupid masks?

1371
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:24,568
Don't worry.

1372
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:27,072
There aren't any of those
guys abound anymore.

1373
01:22:29,032 --> 01:22:30,033
- What did you say?

1374
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,369
- I told her the masks weren't
so scary.

1375
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,621
- Yeah, how did you know?

1376
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:36,498
- Shit.

1377
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:41,251
I shouldn't have said that,
should I?

1378
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:42,502
- You weren't there
when Pops told us that.

1379
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,379
- Oh no, no, the cop told me.

1380
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:46,256
The cop told me about
the guys in the masks.

1381
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:47,384
G, we were there.

1382
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:49,551
- The cops didn't say anything.

1383
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:50,468
- He did, he told us about
the guys in the masks.

1384
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:54,472
- He didn't say anything about
masks!

1385
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:55,641
- Let me explain, G.

1386
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:56,850
Come on.

1387
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:01,314
- You're the only person who
knew what hospital I was in.

1388
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:06,234
Were you a part of this the
whole time?

1389
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:07,445
They killed my father!

1390
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,575
And they took my daughter
from me, Vincent.

1391
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:13,992
- Son of a bitch.

1392
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:18,454
You told Rooker Jada was
with Pops, didn't you?

1393
01:23:18,456 --> 01:23:21,166
- Why? We treated you like
family.

1394
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:22,709
- Like family?

1395
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:25,796
Like family? You treated
me like a family pet.

1396
01:23:25,798 --> 01:23:26,838
Let me tell you something G,

1397
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,800
you and your father didn't
give a shit about me.

1398
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:33,595
The only reason I was here is
because I have no bloodlines.

1399
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:35,346
You know, one thing that Rooker
had

1400
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:36,640
that your old man didn't?

1401
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:38,141
He paid.

1402
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:41,271
He paid more! That's
how you lost everyone!

1403
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:45,566
And you know what? He was
gonna give me status and power.

1404
01:23:45,568 --> 01:23:47,818
I was gonna run this
whole trafficking thing.

1405
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,194
Me!

1406
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,361
Which would've been a lot better

1407
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:53,281
than being your fucking chauffer
for the rest of my life.

1408
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,492
- You're a piece of shit.

1409
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:56,451
- You know what?

1410
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:57,869
I actually understand
why you feel like that.

1411
01:23:57,871 --> 01:24:00,664
But then you're a cop,
so who gives a fuck?

1412
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:03,875
But me and you, G, we were
close.

1413
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:05,212
I fucked it up.

1414
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:07,713
Shit!

1415
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:10,757
But it's okay, because the only
person

1416
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,760

guys.

1417
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:14,427

1418
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:17,598
Daddy!

1419
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,765
Daddy, no.

1420
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,266
No, please don't die.

1421
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:20,934
- And for what?

1422
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:22,268

1423
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,270

the end?

1424
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:25,772
Well, I got some good news for
you G,

1425
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,608

I think she's gonna end
up an orphan anyway.

1427
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:32,197
And you, you fucking pig cunt.

1428
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:34,783
You, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1429
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,749
Shit.

1430
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:05,313
- Daddy? Daddy, please be okay.

1431
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:09,983
- I'm gonna be okay, baby.
- Hey.

1432
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:11,361
- You're lying.

1433
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:15,739
- I don't wanna leave you.

1434
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:18,201
I never wanted to leave you.

1435
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:24,790
I'm gonna have to go, now, hm?

1436
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:27,375
But you're gonna be
fine with Uncle Ray-Ray.

1437
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:29,713
She's gonna be fine with
you, hm, isn't she, bud?

1438
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:33,048
- She's gonna be fine.

1439
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:40,432
- Why'd you do that?

1440
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:42,473
Why?

1441
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:44,392
That bullet had my name on it.

1442
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:46,019
Since when do you care about
other people?

1443
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:48,023
- You're not other people,
asshole.

1444
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,277
You're my brother.

1445
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:03,997
And you've been saving my
life since I was a kid.

1446
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:06,959
That's why I did it.

1447
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:10,754
That why I did it, to protect
you.

1448
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,007
I think I beat you to it.

1449
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:17,551
- Hey, hey, hey.

1450
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:19,012
Shh, Grant, please.

1451
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,511

01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:04,933
- I don't know.

1453
01:27:07,686 --> 01:27:09,813
But nothing bad is ever
gonna happen to you.

1454
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:12,440
- You sound like Daddy.

1455
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:23,827
- Your dad wanted make
sure you're safe, okay?

1456
01:27:25,788 --> 01:27:28,165
But you're with me, always.

01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:35,130
- Are we in trouble?

1458
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:42,470
- No, but I have some questions
that I need to answer.

1459
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:44,890

1460
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:51,939

of family and loyalty.
