00:20:57,105 --> 00:21:01,173
Yeah, I-I heard
about that.
Here.

340
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:04,775
We have a tuna fish
salad sandwich...

341
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,783
with lettuce and tomatoes
on whole-wheat toast.

342
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,617
Farm-fresh deli.

343
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:15,556
Yeah, that's a very,
very good s-store there.

344
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,559
Take half.
Thankyou.

345
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:20,961
Take this right here.
Ahh. Thankyou, sir.

346
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:22,964
Sure.
Thankyou, indeed.

347
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,966
Comes a certain time
in the day,

348
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,802
there's nothing like a fresh
tuna fish salad sandwich.

349
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,306
Uh-huh.
[ Laughing ]

350
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:33,808
Mmm.

351
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,311
Oh, yeah. It's crisp.

352
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,813
Mmm. Mmm.

353
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:40,913
Mmm.

354
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,983
Mmm.
Mmm.

355
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:48,321
Bullshit. Bullshit.

356
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:52,327
Lord, you have done it to
me again.
You done it again.

357
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:55,026
I promised myselfl wouldn't
letya, and ya done it again.

358
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:57,206
Deep cover.
Nice.

359
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,402
Cuban terrorist.
Bingo, you've done it again!

360
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,934
Itwas nice. Nice long
story,
lasted a long time.

361
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,342
That's it. That is it! No more
conversing.
Conversing is over.

362
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,779
Please calm yourself. Now
move away.
Awaywith you, boy.

363
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:13,781
I was trying to have
fun.
This is my spot.

364
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:16,284
I got here first. I didn't
mean foryou
to take me serious--

365
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:19,287
Get off my spot
before I layyou out!

366
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:21,789
Where's it say,
your spot?. Show me.

367
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:25,389
Show me the plaque. Where does
it say that?.
It says right here.

368
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:28,430
You read them hands?.
Study them hands, boy.

369
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:31,697
Them hands
were Golden Gloves...

370
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:34,601
in the summer
of 1 9 and 28.

371
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:36,604
This is my spot.

372
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:39,737
Been my spot six months now,
my good and peaceful spot,

373
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:42,643

374
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:46,046

375
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:48,049
I wantyou gone, boy.

376
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:51,052
I'm givin' you three

377
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,854
I'm comin' out
on the count ofthree.

378
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:56,987
One!
Wait, a brief
discussion.

379
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,994
The sound ofthe bell,
I'm comin' out.

380
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:02,260
Now, you won't hear it,
but I will. Two!

381
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,861
How areyou gonna hit me
ifyou can't see me?.

382
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:07,599
I just keep punchin'
till I hear crunchin'.
Three!

383
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:10,768
This is an embarrassing
demonstration.
Comin' atya.

384
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,774
Comin' atyou, boy.
Comin' atyou.

385
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,574
Sir, you have a
depressing personality...

386
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,741
anda terrible
attitude.
Prepare yourself.

387
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:20,696
Prepare yourself!.

388
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Oh, shit.

389
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,990
Mister?.

390
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,622
Mister?

391
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:34,508
Mister?

392
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,474
Oh, shit.

393
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,981
Don't move. Don't move.

394
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,276
All right. Could be
you broke something.

395
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:54,046
I know. Neverfall down.
Neverfall down1

396
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,314
Oh, it's nothing.
I fall down every morning.

397
00:23:56,414 --> 00:24:00,321
I get up, I have a cup
of coffee, I fall down.
That's the system.

398
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:02,756
Twoyears old,you
stand up, and then, boom1

399
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,423
Seventyyears later,
you fall down again.

400
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,910
Okay, first thing,
can you lift your head?.

401
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,767
Good. Good.
That's good.

402
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,269
All right, put it down.
Put it down slowly.

403
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,970
Easy does it. All right.
That's very good.

404
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:20,975
Okay. Good sign.

405
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,460
Now we're feeling for breaks.
Feeling the hips now.

406
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,131
Ifyou like this,
we're engaged.

407
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,782
Don't worry.
Everybodybreaks.

408
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:35,087
Me, I got a hip like a
teacup.
Twice lastyear.

409
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:38,593
You know, I was also
dead once for a while.

410
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,595
Six minutes.

411
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,997
They're doing a bypass,
a coronary bypass on me.
Everything stops.

412
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,866
They have to jump-start me
like a Chevrolet.

413
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,870
Six minutes dead,
the doctor said.

414
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,468
You know
what it's like?.

415
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,738
What?.
Boring.

416
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:56,244
All right, can you move
your arms at all?.

417
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:58,375
Try to m-moveyour arms.

418
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:01,382
Make like that boxer.
Show me that Golden Gloves.

419
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:04,216
Yes. Very good.
Very good. That's good.

420
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,750
That's a good sign. That's
good news.
Put them down slowly.

421
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,224
All right.
Boys, he's all right.

422
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:13,357
Thankyou. Go fight
the forces ofevil.
[Laughs ]

423
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:15,363
All right.

424
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,365
Now, from experience,

425
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:21,600
just lie there five minutes
and relax before getting up.

426
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,071
Best thing forrelaxing
isjokes.

427
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,603
Willy Howard, you heard
ofhim?. Genius, an artist.

428
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:32,113
Years ago he had this routine--
That was anotherlie,
wasn't it?

429
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:35,549
What?
'Bout you bein' dead.

430
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:38,553
No. No, it's a fact,
an absolute fact.

431
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,353
Man, you ain't even
friendly with the truth.

432
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,791
Your goddamn lies
put me on the canvas here.

433
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,126
Not lies. Alterations.

434
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,463
I make certain alterations.
Sometimes the truth don't fit.

435
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:55,403
I take in a little here,
I let out a little there,
till it fits. The truth?.

436
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:58,136
The truth is going to the
back door
ofthe Plaza Hotel...

437
00:25:58,236 --> 00:26:00,574
everymorning
foryesterday's club rolls.

438
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:04,411
I tell them it's for the
pigeons.
I 'm the pigeon.

439
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,011
Six minutes dead is true, a
fact.
And that's my last fact.

440
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:11,749
This morning I'm talking
to the counterman at Farm Fresh.

441
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,654
I tell him I'm an
American Indian,
an Iroquois.

442
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:16,657
He I istens.

443
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:21,095
Pretty soon I 'm remembering
the days on the plains,

444
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:25,763
the broken treaties,
my grandpa fighting the cavalry.

445
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,864
Not important,
he's convinced.

446
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:31,468
I am. And I love it.

447
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:34,942
This morning I'm an American
Indian,
this afternoon a spy.

448
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,776
I was one person
for 80-something years.

449
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,876
Why not a hundred
for the next five?.

450
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,451
Them club rolls.

451
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,786
How early doyou think
a person ought to get there
to get them rolls?.

452
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,852
Rolls?. Rolls?.
You missed the whole point.

453
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,859
The point?.
I got the point.

454
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,957
The point is,
you are crazy!

455
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:57,229
Point is, you ain't never
seein' your marbles again!

456
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,233
Oh, how fortunate,

457
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,466
an expert
on mental health.

458
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:04,405
Crazy, you say?.
Listen to me.

459
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:07,408
Listen to a trained
observer. You are a wreck.

460
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:09,410
Is this who you wanna be?.

461
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,244
Is this what you had in mind
for old, this guy here,

462
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:16,250
sitting and staring, once in a
while for a thrill
falling down?.

463
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,720
No, you gotta shake things up,
fella.
You gotta make things happen.

464
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,420
You tellin' me how to
live?. You tellin' me?

465
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,089
Mister, you talkin' to
the superintendent in charge,

Near 1 5 years
past retirement.

469
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,998
Howyou think
I'm still superthere?.

470
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:39,704
I ain't mentioned
a raise in 1 5 years.

471
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,940
And they ain't, neither.
[ Chuckles ]

Threeyears ago, moved to the
night shift
outta the public eye.

473
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:49,012
Daytime?. A bunch of
Arab supers,
come and gone.

474
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:51,018
But not Midge.

475
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:54,618
Mister, you lookin' at
the wise, old invisible man.

476
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:57,124
No, I'm lookin'
at a dead man.

477
00:27:57,224 --> 00:28:00,127
Fifteen years, no raise?.
That's a dead person.

478
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:02,725
That's a ghost.
What doyou know?

479
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,732
What does a ghost know?.

480
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,931
People see me.
They see me.

481
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,936
I make them see me!

482
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:12,738
You fool.
You crazy old fool!

483
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:17,408
They don't see you. They don't
want to look
at your old face.

484
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:19,610
Mine neither.
I just help 'em out.

485
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,584
Don'tyou get it, baby?. Both of
us ghosts,
onlyyou ain't noticed.

486

to stay outside after my run.

00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:54,608
Here, sit down, I'll
explain it toyou.
I'll educateyou.

994
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:57,495
Sit down. The
situation is simple.

995
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:03,751
We don't accept 1 0 weeks'
severance. We don't accept
20 weeks' severance.

996
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:08,559
What we accept is that
you retain Mr. Carter in
the capacity of advisor...

997
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:13,330
during your reconstruction
period, which I assume
will take a year, maybe two,

998
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,633
at which point, we'll talk
further.
I don't know this man.

999
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:18,733
I don't know him.

1000
00:59:18,832 --> 00:59:21,139
Ofcourse not. Mr.
Carteris more familiar...

1001
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:25,077
with Rifkin and Grady, the
gentler gentlemen
of our firm.

1002
00:59:25,176 --> 00:59:27,844
It was thought best to
bring the "Cobra"
in on this one.

1003
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:30,546
It's an affectionate term for
me at the office.
Look, Reissman.

1004
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:32,951
Yes, speak to me. I don't
know what
your game is, fella,

1005
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,922
and I don't knowyour
organization, but I do know
Local 32 ofthe Service Employ--

1006
00:59:37,022 --> 00:59:41,409
And do they know thatyou are
planning
to fire Mr. Carter?.

1007
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,464
Notyet, but--

1008
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:49,131
Anddoyou knowthat there is
no mandatoryretirement age
in Mr. Carter's union?

1009
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,200
Do you know further that this
gives Mr. Carter the right...

1010
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,574
to call an arbitration hearing
where he can defend
his competence?.

1011
00:59:56,673 --> 01:00:01,176
And thatyou have to get a minimum
offourtenants
to testifyagainst him?

1012
01:00:01,275 --> 01:00:06,585
Find them. I would love to see
this, Mr. Danforth.
[ Thunderclap ]

1013
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:09,920
Four tenants who wanna
be responsible--

1014
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,392
publicly responsible
for putting this old man...

1015
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:17,526
out ofhis home
andprofession of42years.

1016
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,595
A man who was voted
"Super OfThe Year"...

1017
01:00:20,694 --> 01:00:23,366
by the New York Post
in 1 968.

1018
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:25,703
A man who fought
in World War II.

1019
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:30,040
A man who served
with the now legendary
Black Battalion ofBastogne...

1020
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,173
during the
Battle ofthe Bulge.

1021
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:37,616
And are you aware that
for as long as you insist
on pursuing this matter,

1022
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:42,852
for as long as this hearing
lasts, thatyou can make
no contract with Local 32?

1023
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:46,758
And that without
a union contract, there
can be no co-op sales---

1024
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:48,890
no building corporation1

1025
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:54,164
Time, my friend,
will be your villain now!

1026
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:56,764
I'm talking months, cookie.

1027
01:00:56,864 --> 01:01:00,104
I'm talking litigation,
appeals,

1028
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,473
the full weight and guile...

1029
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:06,119
of Rothman, Rifkin,
Grady and the Cobra.

1030
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,980
I'm--
Speak to me.

1031
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,579
I'm, frankly,
a little thrown by this.

1032
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:14,649
I knew about the right
to arbitration, Midge.

1033
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:17,752
I never thoughtyou'd want to
putyourselfthrough something--
He wants!

1034
01:01:17,851 --> 01:01:21,558
Meanwhile, HURTSFOE goes
afteryou tomorrow anyway.

1035
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:25,593
-They'll make an example ofyou.
You're perfect for them!
-What have I done?.

1036
01:01:25,692 --> 01:01:29,799
Sir, you have hit every
human rights' nerve there is.
I'm talking old.

1037
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,739
I'm talkingblack. I'm talking
racial imbalance.
Racial imbalance?.

1038
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:39,543
The man was walking into walls
for God's sake.
He's an easy 80.

1039
01:01:39,643 --> 01:01:43,448
There is nothing, sir,
I promise you,
easy about 80.

1040
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:45,749
Damn it, why am
I bothering to warn you?.

1041
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:49,316
You'll see it all tomorrow.
Time to let HURTSFOE
out ofits cage.

1042
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,291
I find it hard to believe I
would be
held responsible--

1043
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:57,195
You will believe tomorrow
when you see those pickets
in front ofyour school!

1044
01:01:57,295 --> 01:02:00,761
What's the name ofthatplace?
The Manhattan Institute.

1045
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:03,600
Then those demonstrators in
front
ofyour apartment building,

1046
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,735
the name Danforth will
become an adjective, sir.

1047
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:12,144
A new word for the persecution
ofthe old and disabled,
the black and the blind.

1048
01:02:12,243 --> 01:02:15,012
Now, wait a minute!
Do it, Danforth!
Do it!

1049
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:19,985
Fire him1 It'syour
one shot
at immortality.

1050
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:24,321
Yes, I'm sorry, Carter. I
wanna see HURTSFOE
in action again.

1051
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:28,957
Those crazywildcats.
Those mad, inspired men.

1052
01:02:29,057 --> 01:02:31,863
I wanna hear those words
alive again and pure:

1053
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:36,599
"Strike for humane existence.
Strike for universal justice.

1054
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:40,134
"Strike! Strike! Strike!
Strike!
- [ Chanting ] Strike!

1055
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:44,306
Strike! Strike--"
Hold on.
Wait a minute!

1056
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:48,313
Now this whole goddamn mess
has just gotten out ofhand here!

1057
01:02:48,413 --> 01:02:50,411
Now, look, Reissman,

1058
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:54,015
believe me, this was never
my own personal thing.

1059
01:02:54,115 --> 01:02:56,151
I represent a committee--

1060
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:00,322
I'm sorry. The spotlight
falls on you because it must;

1061
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:03,891
becauseyou are so
extraordinarily ordinary;

1062
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,798
because there are
so many ofyou now.

1063
01:03:06,898 --> 01:03:12,204
You collect old furniture,
old cars, old pictures,
everything old but old people.

1064
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:14,639
Bad souvenirs,
they talk too much.

1065
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:18,009
Even quiet,
they tell you too much.

1066
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:21,575
They look like the future,
and you don't wanna know.

1067
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:24,848
Hey, mister,
don'tyou know...

1068
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:29,585
one dayyou too will join
this weird tribe?.

1069
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:33,559
Yes, Mr. Chairman,
you will get old.

1070
01:03:33,658 --> 01:03:37,625
Andifyou're frightened now,
you'll be terrified then.

1071
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:41,532
The problem is not that life is
short,
but that it's very long.

1072
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:44,199
So you better
have a pol icy.

1073
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:47,268
Here, look at us.

1074
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:50,107
Here we are. We're
the coming attractions.

1075
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:53,410
And ifyou're afraid of it,
you'll be afraid of us.

1076
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,180
You'll wanna hide us or make us
hide from you.
You're dangerous.

1077
01:03:57,279 --> 01:03:59,218
Don'tyou understand?.

1078
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:03,087
The old people, they're the
survivors;
they know something.

1079

Theyhaven'tjuststayedlate
to ruinyourparty.

1080
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:10,592
Whatyou'd like is for Carter to be
nice and cute
and quiet and go away.

1081
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:13,098
But he won't do that.
I won't let him.

1082
01:04:13,198 --> 01:04:15,601
Tell him he's slow
or stupid, okay.

1083
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,234
But tell him he's
unnecessary, and that's a sin!

1084
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:21,971
That is a sin
against life!

1085
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:25,653
That is abortion
at the other end!

1086
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:37,329
Ben, I'm glad you shared these
thoughts with me.
I'd never really--

1087
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,025
I'm through communicating
with you.

1088
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:45,497
Carter, I'm communicating
onlywith you now.

1089
01:04:45,597 --> 01:04:49,029
What shall we dowith him?.
I leave it up toyou.

1090
01:04:49,128 --> 01:04:52,436
I-- I thinkwe ought
to give him a break.

1091
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:57,504
Ben, I-I-I'm sure I can persuade
the members ofthe committee
to reevaluate Midge's--

1092
01:04:57,604 --> 01:05:00,073
Areyou saying you don't
care what
happens to the cause?.

1093
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:03,211
You just wanna keepyourjob,
Midge, and forget the cause?.

1094
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,415
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Keep the job and forget the cause.

1095
01:05:06,514 --> 01:05:09,050
Guys, I think it's essential
that we avoid any extreme--

1096
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,024
Areyou asking the Cobra
not to strike?.

1097
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:15,061
Don't want the Cobra
to strike, no.

1098
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,862
Mr. Danforth, my client has
instructed me to save your ass.

1099
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,198
Quickly,
the bomb is ticking.

1100
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:25,170
Jog home to your phone now.
Call the members ofyour committee.

1101
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,370
Don't persuade. Don't
explain. Just announce.

1102
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:30,707
Tell them there's a job
for Mr. Carter--

1103
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:36,277
guide, counselor, superintendent
emeritus; that has a nice sound to it.

1104
01:05:36,376 --> 01:05:41,551
Meanwhile, speak to no one. Your
union, your managing agent, no one.

1105

we're all in trouble. Here.

When you're finished,
call that number...

you wanna stop HURTSFOE.

That's HURTSFOE's advisory group.

1109
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,236
Speak only to the lady
on the card, Mrs. Clara Gelber.

at the HURTSFOE office.

Good-bye and good luck.

I just wantyou
to know that...

1114
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:18,320
this has been a very important
conversation for me for many reasons.

1115
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:21,557
A lot of primary thoughts.
Excellent. Good-bye.

A sudden awareness of certain
generational values--

I warn you, sir,
one more word and I will

against the language.

Go now! It's true. I sometimes
just don't know how to talk--

Go!

wanna be a lawyer, but years
