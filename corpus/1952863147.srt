1
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,019
(Animal roaring)

2
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,940
(scrapes)

3
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,197
(air hisses)

4
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:05,227
(panting)

5
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,429
(growling)

6
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,007
(screams)

7
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,571
(crunches)

8
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:27,319
(man screaming)

9
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:41,599
(roars)

10
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,051
- Hola, Javier.
- Hola.

11
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,748
- Como estas?
- Bien.

12
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,597
Hey Z.

13
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,042
(Sighs)

14
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:08,387
You're late.
I am in a hurry.

15
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:10,152
It's good to see you too, buddy.

16
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,523
Jesus.
The charts are right over there.

17
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:14,550
They're all current.

18
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,586
Business has been pretty good.

19
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,257
You shouldn't have a problem
keeping the boat full.

20
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:20,289
I have got eight for you
for tomorrow morning.

21
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,530
So be here at 9:00 sharp.

22
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,038
Most of my luck's been
over at Los Arcos,

23
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,132
but then I guess you know
your way around the bay.

24
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,370
Yeah, I guess I do.

25
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,575
I have got no reception in the USA,
so you're on your own.

26
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,083
Oh, how sad for me.

27
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,552
Yeah, well, try not
to screw things up, okay?

28
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,055
- Copy that.
- See you in a couple of months.

29
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,422
- All right.
- Hey, and don't sink the boat.

30
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,142
Adios.

31
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,956
You know, you still throw like a girl.

32
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,022
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

33
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,293
(Shouting and cheering)

34
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,832
(chuckles)

35
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:30,565
What did you expect, the QE2, huh?

36
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:34,439
- Hola carnal.
- Hola bonito.

37
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,344
Things must have gotten very bad
for you to come back here, huh?

38
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:40,142
- It's only temporary.
- Oh.

39
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:43,173
- It's good to see you. Come on.
- Good to see you too.

40
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:48,350
Are you still playing the captain
to the rich and the famous?

41
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,517
When I can find a ride, you know?
What about you?

42
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,357
No no, I am the man now.

43
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,989
- Huh?
- Ay carajo.

44
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,000
Ay carajo.
And I need to see your papers.

45
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,798
Yeah, that's a good one.

46
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:05,101
No, seriously.
I need to see them.

47
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:09,200
- All right, okay, El Capitan.
- Sorry, bro.

48
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,942
Things have changed, Trace, you know?

49
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:17,110
- You know Calderon, right?
- Yeah.

50
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,619
He doesn't allow any live-aboards
around the area.

51
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,681
Why does Calderon have a say?

52
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:27,354
He's the captain
of the harbor patrol now.

53
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,522
(Groans)

54
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,726
They're really lowering the bar, huh?

55
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,326
Wow.

56
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,599
100 ton Master?

57
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,904
Yeah, check it out--

58
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:41,904
Yes?

59
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,276
I don't really have
anywhere else to stay.

60
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,579
You think maybe you can just like...
Hey, Trace.

61
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,607
...look the other way
for a couple of weeks?

62
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,245
Trace, Trace, listen.

63
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:55,552
I can't do it.

64
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,615
No, that's cool.
I understand.

65
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,321
Look, l-- here.

66
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:03,887
I got something for you.
Here you go.

67
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,126
Is this a bribe?

68
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:08,761
No, it's a late birthday present.

69
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,293
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

70
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,863
- Wow.
- It's a bit of an aphrodisiac.

71
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,837
You mean, for the ladies?

72
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:18,345
- Yes, the mamacitas.
- Really?

73
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,473
Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

74
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,980
(Sighs)

75
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,318
Don't let Calderon see you.

76
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,255
I don't want to lose my job.

77
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,725
Dude, I owe you.
Thank you. Thank you.

78
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:35,228
Come on, have a beer with me.

79
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:37,253
It's still kind of warm.

80
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,493
Eh, doesn't matter.

81
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,967
- Cheers.
- Por la regreso.

82
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,557
Simon.

83
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,039
Come on.

84
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,421
(Screams)

85
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:53,905
FEMALE ANCHOR:
In other news,

86
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:56,409
no further contact with Jeremy Long II,

87
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,107
the solo sailor lost last week
in the Gulf of Alaska.

88
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,049
Search and Rescue has been
terminated due to weather

89
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:05,018
and no further attempts will be made.

90
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:06,918
What do you think happened?

91
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:10,355
The biggest danger for those
solo sailors is falling overboard.

92
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,757
Yeah, or going nuts.

93
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,420
You two girls swimming to the reef today?

94
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,761
Aron spotted a whale shark
on the north end last week.

95
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,027
You be careful, okay?

96
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:22,366
They're harmless.
They don't even have teeth.

97
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,395
Stay to the south, okay?
You promise?

98
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,465
Thank you, Luis.

99
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,579
Yes, Mamacita.

100
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:37,374
(Laughs)

101
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:42,545
Is this the immigration office?

102
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:45,616
I heard you were coming home.

103
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,150
- Hola, mi nina.
- Hola.

104
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,663
Que pasa?
Como esta tu madre?

105
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:51,756
Still keeping me under house arrest.

106
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,789
You finally got busted?

107
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:56,133
- Oh, please.
- I am so sorry.

108
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,104
- Hey.
- Hey, look who the cat dragged in.

109
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,606
- Hey, man.
- How are you doing?

110
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,006
I have been running around.
You doing all right?

111
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,374
- Doing good. Doing good.
- Good.

112
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,208
Captain Trace McGraw,
back from the high seas.

113
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,975
- Hola, mi loco.
- How are you, man?

114
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,004
- I am good.
- How's the place looking?

115
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,984
Looks good, man.
The walls are still standing.

116
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,247
Hey, drinks?

117
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:14,686
- Yes.
- Whatever's free.

118
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,348
- Not for you, man.
- Let's go sit down.

119
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:18,790
Come on, man,
you're going to make me go bankrupt.

120
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,657
TRACE:
Hola.

121
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,356
Pedro, tequila?

122
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:25,854
- Who is that?
- That's my good friend Trace.

123
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:29,062
Carol, meet my friend Trace,

124
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,799
captain to the Fortune 500.
Trace, meet my friend Carol.

125
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,033
Nice to meet you.

126
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,008
She came in last year
to teach at the international school.

127
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,600
Oh yeah?
What do you teach?

128
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,168
Oh, I teach environmental science

129
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,180
with a focus on aquatic ecosystems.

130
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,204
Yeah, big words.
Let's drink.

131
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:44,343
- Salud.
- To Trace.

132
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,613
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,019
TRACE:
Gracias.

134
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,045
Come on, man.

135
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,649
You have always got a story
when you come back.

136
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:52,818
What's the adventure this time?

137
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:56,796
Unfortunately, I don't remember her name.

138
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,389
No, for real.

139
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,229
TRACE:
For reals? Okay.

140
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,600
Well, actually recently I was--

141
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,765
I was chased by pirates.
Yeah.

142
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,139
I was doing a two-month gig,

143
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,371
you know, piloting this boat
to Kuala Lumpur

144
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,245
and a pirate ship-- a speedboat

145
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,807
came up across our bow
and actually started firing at us.

146
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,944
Next thing I know,

147
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,147
they're on board.
And I had no choice.

148
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,418
I had to rescue the women

149
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:27,018
and I fired on them....

150
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:29,620
....with my flare gun.
And I hit him.

151
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,122
- Probably in the ass, huh?
- Right in the arse.

152
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,930
But they got scared off....

153
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,699
....and sped out of there.

154
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,730
Boss was watching C-SPAN the whole time.

155
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,039
I will tell you this much--

156
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,238
there is no reward in being
a glorified cabin boy.

157
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:49,340
So I have returned home
to make my fortune.

158
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,941
Hey, compadre, come on.

159
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,613
We all know you're not going to
make a fortune out of snorkeling.

160
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,679
Simon, carnal.

161
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,625
I guess I will just have to
hunt for pirate treasure then.

162
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,525
Trace, come on.
We all know you.

163
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:04,292
All you're going to do is rob
the local tourists. Come on.

164
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,924
Isn't that the idea?

165
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:08,128
- Come on, let's have another drink.
- Let's do it.

166
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:10,262
(Phone ringing)
Everybody, want another drink?

167
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,930
- Yes.
- Not you. I know how you get.

168
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,941
- Rita?
- Sure.

169
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:16,637
Looks like I just lost my first mate.

170
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:18,235
Yeah.

171
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

172
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,573
- Salud.
- To Trace.

173
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,608
Sure.
I will see you in an hour.

174
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,678
Sure. Bye.
TRACE: Do you know Ernesto?

175
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:30,452
He's running the harbor patrol now.
He came by.

176
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,288
- Rita, that was Michael Kirshner.
- Yeah.

177
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,988
He wants to meet in an hour
regarding the water polo match.

178
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:37,429
I will give you a call
after the meeting, okay?

179
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,364
I am so sorry.

180
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:41,390
Don't worry about it.
I will see you afterwards.

181
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,925
And don't let him push you around.

182
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,995
He's got bigger fish to fry than me.

183
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:46,870
Anyway, thanks so much.
I will try and make it, okay?

184
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,968
- Bye.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

185
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,741
Okay, well, you guys,
I am off to the beach.

186
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,645
Whoa. Que onda?

187
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,809
I just got here.
Are you going to leave already?

188
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,115
Want to go up to the point
and catch up on old times?

189
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,317
Yes, I would love to go to the point
and catch up on old times.

190
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,291
How's your boyfriend?

191
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,793
No estes chingando.

192
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:08,226
I never would.

193
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:10,662
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

194
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:29,880
- Mine.
- Get back.

195
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,249
(Chatting)

196
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,554
Whoo.

197
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,143
- Good morning.
- Carol for Michael.

198
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,581
- Okay, go ahead. Thank you.
- Thank you.

199
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,955
Hola.

200
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,265
Carol, good to see you,

201
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,463
as usual.
Thank you.

202
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:25,301
Hey, thanks for rearranging your classes.

203
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,601
Of course.

204
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,404
(Boat horn blows)

205
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,774
Wow.

206
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,210
Beautiful, isn't it?

207
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,872
So...

208
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:37,440
Yeah, well, I had this idea
about the water polo match--

209
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,851
why don't we do it right here,

210
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:42,481
right in front of the marina?
What do you think?

211
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,617
Polo on the canal--
it's a great backdrop, right?

212
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:48,457
My girls play in a pool.

213
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,486
The channel is--

214
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:53,466
well, it's just not designed--

215
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:55,730
Carol, listen.

216
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,830
We have rearranged the entire program
to feature the waterway.

217
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,738
Your match would be the grand finale.

218
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:03,266
But you have the boats and--

219
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,709
Don't worry about the boats.

220
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,474
I have arranged
for all recreational traffic

221
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,243
to be shut down
during the time of the match.

222
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:10,648
And I have got some patrol boats,

223
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,481
so there's no problem,
nothing to worry about.

224
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,851
I have to talk to the girls.

225
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,791
And I can't see how--

226
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,658
Carol, I am in a bit of a pinch here.

227
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,789
I mean, I can understand
your concerns and everything,

228
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,131
but I was really hoping
you'd go along with me on this.

229
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,528
I have already talked
to the yacht club coach.

230
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,971
They're on board 100%.

231
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:36,602
I'd hate to have to have them
play against a different team.

232
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,476
The girls would be crushed.

233
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:42,177
Yeah.

234
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:44,746
(Sighs)

235
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,616
Okay.

236
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,146
Okay, we will make it work.

237
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,752
But I want you to promise me
you will get those patrol boats.

238
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:56,126
And I want the safety buoys too.

239
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:57,721
(Chuckles)

240
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,892
That was easy.
Come on, let's go to lunch.

241
00:19:14,796 --> 00:19:17,333
(Computer beeping)

242
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,108
(speaking Spanish)

243
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,172
(screaming)

244
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,310
This is Search and Rescue

245
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,790
X-ray-Tango-6-4-niner.
Hailing all vessels.

246
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,794
We have a distress signal
located near Los Muertos Reef.

247
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:10,194
Please proceed immediately to
that location.

248
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,651
(Screaming)

249
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:36,849
(crunching)

250
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,482
(roars)

251
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,726
You are one intriguing woman--

252
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:47,165
a diving champ, biology major,
Princeton grad.

253
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,396
It does beg the question--

254
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:51,495
how did you end up working here?

255
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:53,506
Sentimental reasons, I guess.

256
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:56,668
My parents had a fellowship
at the Marine Institute in the '80s.

257
00:20:56,668 --> 00:20:58,177
Scientists.

258
00:20:58,177 --> 00:20:59,508
Both of them.

259
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,571
They studied climate change here
for a year.

260
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:05,676
Can I interest you in any dessert,
coffee-- anything?

261
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,550
No, thank you.
I am fine.

262
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,682
I will take an apple pie and a coffee.

263
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:11,522
Thanks.

264
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:16,018
Say, Carol, I was thinking

265
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,861
maybe after the regatta
you and I get together for a drink.

266
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,691
Oh, no no no.

267
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:23,896
It's not what you're thinking.

268
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:26,838
To be honest, it is a proposition,

269
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:28,864
but I wonder if you're interested

270
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:31,776
in coming to work here at Paradise
Village as a social director.

271
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:37,042
It's a job at a family resort.

272
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,019
You're good with kids--
a good fit, right?

273
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,617
Can I think it over?

274
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,619
The drinks or the job?

275
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,597
(Chuckles)
Maybe both.

276
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,734
Well, look at the time. I am sorry.
I am afraid I have to go.

277
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,567
Thank you for lunch, Mike.

278
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,735
Carol, this is a serious job offer.
I really want you to consider this.

279
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:05,074
I will.
I will keep in touch.

280
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:11,674
(Exhales)

281
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,282
(dialing)

282
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,487
(phone ringing)

283
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,103
Hi. This is Rita.
Please leave me a message. Thank you.

284
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,164
(Beep)
Rita, Carol here.

285
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:37,473
Hey, let me know where you are
at the beach, okay? Bye.

286
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:45,683
(Whistle blows)

287
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,451
So, the match.

288
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,857
The field will be laid out
exactly the same,

289
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:55,657
except the goalie won't be able
to touch the bottom.

290
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,686
Eggbeater as long as you can.

291
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:01,132
We will substitute
every 10 minutes, okay?

292
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:02,328
Okay.

293
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,564
All right, girls,
give me a sprint to the goal

294
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:06,834
then the drive-pass drill.

295
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,899
Come on.
(Blows whistle)

296
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:16,471
Here. Here.

297
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,049
Nice catch.

298
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:24,990
(Blows whistle)
Janelle, that's a foul.

299
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,789
- She should watch the ball.
- You should watch your passing....

300
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,524
....and your temper.
Emilia, are you okay?

301
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,998
Yeah, I am okay.
Don't let her throw you off your game.

302
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:35,297
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

303
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,564
Hey,
what's the matter with you, Janelle?

304
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,503
(Blows whistle)
That's enough for the day.

305
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,735
Shower up.

306
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,846
(Javier speaks Spanish)

307
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,818
Not today, thanks.

308
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:54,286
Okay.

309
00:23:57,212 --> 00:24:00,591
Watch your step.
There you go.

310
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,027
You did good. Good job.
MAN: Thanks, buddy.

311
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,053
- Cheers.
- Thanks a lot, man.

312
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,088
Gracias.
Don't forget,

313
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:09,898
we like the tips that jingle,
but we love the tips that fold.

314
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,563
(Men laugh)
All right.

315
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:12,799
Hola.

316
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,332
Hey, Carol the aquatic eco coach.

317
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,208
Trace the embellishing pirate.

318
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,271
What brings you down here?

319
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:23,977
Oh, I was hoping Rita was here.

320
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:27,179
I was supposed to meet up with her,
but I can't find her.

321
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,950
Bienvenido a Mexico.

322
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,014
Don't take it personal.
That's just Rita.

323
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:34,357
Maybe, but she was going for a swim.

324
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:36,089
You don't think I should be worried?

325
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:37,391
No, I am sure she's fine.

326
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:40,889
I am actually going to go
and pick up some supplies,

327
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,799
so if I see her,
I will tell her to give you a call.

328
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,499
Okay, maybe I will drive down to the
beach and see if I can find her too.

329
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,064
I am telling you, she's fine.

330
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,337
Okay, adios.

331
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:51,844
Adios.

332
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,553
MAN OVER RADIO:
Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard,

333
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,588
what is your location? Over.

334
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:22,002
Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard,
this is Mexican Search and Rescue. Over.

335
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:24,704
Please continue on a heading of
20° north

336
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:27,612
by 105° west. Over.

337
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:56,339
I don't see anything.

338
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:59,504
Search and Rescue,
this is Vallarta Lifeguard.

339
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:02,276
We're approaching the reef,
but there is nothing here.

340
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:03,942
I repeat, there is nothing here.

341
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,974
Roger that.

342
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:09,819
Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard, this is
Mexican Search and Rescue. Over.

343
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,846
Please confirm your location

344
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:15,487
as 20° north by 105° west. Over.

345
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,793
LIFEGUARD:
Roger that.

346
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,166
I can't make it out.
Here, take a look over there.

347
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,174
There, just below the surface.
See it?

348
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:30,836
Whoa, what-- what is that thing?

349
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,173
I see it.

350
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,942
Where did it go?
Try to find it.

351
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:37,109
Check-- check over the bow.

352
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,550
I got back here.
What was that?

353
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,212
It's not up here, man.
I can't see it.

354
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:42,744
(Growling)

355
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:44,085
What the--?

356
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,286
(Both scream)

357
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,927
- Help me.
- Reach for my hand. I got you.

358
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,601
(Screams)

359
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,265
Bro.
Come on, man, kick.

360
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,638
(Screaming)

361
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,644
(creature roaring)

362
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:13,045
Mayday mayday mayday.

363
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,452
Los Muertos Reef.
Mayday.

364
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,057
(Dog barking)

365
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:37,284
Trace,

366
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,671
you're talking crazy, man.

367
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,273
I am telling you, okay?

368
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:46,751
This was not a shark, okay?

369
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,085
A shark does not eat a lifeguard boat.

370
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,090
A shark does not have horns.

371
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,821
Hey, carnal, I know you're upset
about what you saw, but you can't--

372
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:56,071
Luis?

373
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:01,293
Hey, why are you closed?

374
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:08,570
Trace is having a bad day.

375
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,476
He saw two lifeguards get attacked
by a tiger shark.

376
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:14,502
It was not a tiger shark.

377
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:17,415
Well, I am sorry to interrupt,
but I still can't find Rita

378
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:19,112
and I am starting to get worried.

379
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:20,744
Oh, don't worry about her.
REPORTER: Harbor patrol has impounded

380
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:23,346
a vessel belonging
to dive boat operator Bob Scranton...

381
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,755
- You want some water?
- Please.

382
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,622
REPORTER:
...who specializes in bringing his clients

383
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,184
up close and personal with sharks.

384
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:31,129
Scranton has been chumming the waters
around Los Muertos Reef,

385
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:34,133
which Captain Calderon believes
led to the fatal attack

386
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:37,295
on two lifeguards
and a local woman Rita Valdez.

387
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,327
- Oh my God.
- In making today's announcement,

388
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:42,569
Police Chief Captain Calderon
thanked Dr. Frank Reeves

389
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,770
for helping identify
the cause of the threat.

390
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,678
Next up, Randy Johnson with sports.

391
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,773
This wasn't a shark.

392
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,911
Trace, just stop, all right?

393
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,512
What are you talking about?

394
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,593
I have sailed on this bay half my life.

395
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:06,326
I know what a damn
tiger shark looks like.

396
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:10,601
I am going to find this thing
that killed my friend.

397
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:19,573
Trace...

398
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:23,079
I am coming with you.

399
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,929
Rita was my first friend here.

400
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,561
She worked at the administration
at the school.

401
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:47,038
For some reason she thought
I needed a social life.

402
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,475
Yeah, that sounds like Rita.

403
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:54,002
She looked up my birthday

404
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,209
and threw me a surprise party
at Luis's bar.

405
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:01,776
I didn't know a soul.

406
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:04,984
That's how friends were made,
according to Rita, in PV.

407
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:10,091
Seems like everybody's got
a story like that about Rita.

408
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,598
What's yours?

409
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,101
She fed me.

410
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:19,162
(Chuckles)

411
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,231
(clears throat)

412
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:23,139
When we were kids,

413
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:27,670
we both went to the same kind of--
it's like an elementary school.

414
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,343
We were, I don't know, six or seven.

415
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:38,580
I guess I was the poor kid

416
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,786
with no lunch money.

417
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:43,557
So every day

418
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:46,395
Rita would come to school
with an extra lunch.

419
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,368
And that was the first time

420
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:52,200
that I ever tasted food made with love.

421
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:55,797
It was good.

422
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,644
That thing is still out there.

423
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,672
And until we can prove it,

424
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:07,084
not Luis,

425
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:10,783
not the news channels, not Calderon--

426
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:13,258
nobody's going to believe us.

427
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:16,125
I need your help.

428
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,359
Rita was my best friend here.

429
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,926
Yeah, mine too.

430
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:29,999
Mine too.

431
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:39,045
Well, here we are.

432
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:53,193
- Come on, let me show you around.
- Great.

433
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,127
Wow.

434
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,578
There is a certain wow factor.

435
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,439
What a wonderful place,

436
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:13,315
so peaceful and private.

437
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:14,820
How about a drink?

438
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,413
You have really got this down,
don't you?

439
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,049
(Chuckles)

440
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,278
Thank you.

441
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,311
My pleasure.

442
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,691
(Bird squawking)

443
00:32:57,752 --> 00:32:59,823
Viva Ia fiesta.

444
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:08,205
And to think it was snowing
when I left Aspen.

445
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:09,833
(Gasps)

446
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,136
Is that your boat?

447
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:15,204
What, that old thing?
Yeah.

448
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,784
Will you take me for a ride sometime?

449
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:26,814
Sure. No problem.

450
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:30,526
Let's go for a dip first,
work up an appetite for lunch.

451
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:34,124
- Oh, I don't need to eat.
- Looking at you, neither do I.

452
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,503
No no, Steve.

453
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:41,234
Steve, I am serious. I do not want
to get my bathing suit wet.

454
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,866
No? What are you waiting for?

455
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,672
The pool deck at the Paradise.

456
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,508
(Screams)

457
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:49,007
(laughing)

458
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:53,482
I am going to get you for this.

459
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,748
I am going to get you.

460
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:59,190
(Gasps)
There's something down here.

461
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,420
STEVE:
What?

462
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,326
Help.

463
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,524
Oh, come on, Lois,
you're not getting off that easy.

464
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,562
No, Steve, help.

465
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:11,503
Help.

466
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:13,267
Lois.

467
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,467
(Screams)

468
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:22,211
(Lois coughing)

469
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,307
(grunts)

470
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:27,046
(creature roaring)

471
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:38,423
You really know these waters,
don't you?

472
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,865
I sort of grew up down here.

473
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:43,528
I spent more time in the water
than I did in school.

474
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,136
My dad was stationed
at the US Navy base down here, so...

475
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,776
Didn't follow in his footsteps?

476
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,006
Not exactly.

477
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:56,311
I was at Annapolis,

478
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,374
my father's pride and joy.

479
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:01,148
I don't know.
Something just didn't click.

480
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,587
I dropped out a year later.

481
00:35:03,587 --> 00:35:06,182
My father hasn't talked to me since.

482
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:08,216
Where is he now?

483
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:10,627
Somewhere in the States, I hear.

484
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:12,995
I am sorry.

485
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,296
Nothing to be sorry for.

486
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:18,864
Not that it's any of my business,

487
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,669
but some people--

488
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,142
well, parents have a hard time

489
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:27,112
adapting to how they thought
things would be

490
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,172
to how they are.

491
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,844
I didn't exactly take you
for the black-sheep-in-the-family type.

492
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:37,050
You'd be surprised
how high expectations can be set.

493
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:41,883
The only thing I have learned to expect
lately is bad news.

494
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:45,160
What about your pot of gold?

495
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:49,859
I am still looking for it.

496
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,928
You see that?

497
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:54,303
- What is it?
- I don't know.

498
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,468
It's right here on the starboard side.

499
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,878
Just keep the boat pointed right.

500
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:18,797
- What is it?
- It's called an EPIRB.

501
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:21,629
It's an emergency response beacon
that's triggered by water.

502
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:24,000
If your boat sinks,
it sends out a distress signal

503
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,301
with your GPS coordinates.
Every boat has one.

504
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:28,671
Well, does it say what boat
it's registered to?

505
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:30,698
I don't know.
It's got all this residue on it.

506
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:32,733
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let me see it.

507
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,769
Be my guest.

508
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,217
Fin Seeker, this is
Mexican Search and Rescue. Over.

509
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:41,083
In regards to your previous inquiry,

510
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,951
the EPIRB belongs to the sailboat

511
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,583
that disappeared
off the coast of Alaska. Over.

512
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,186
Repeat that.
Did you say Alaska? Over.

513
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,561
Affirmative. Strange--

514
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:54,624
we got the same signal
just before the lifeguards disappeared.

515
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:57,431
I have no idea how it got
this far south.

516
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,598
Can you bring it by headquarters
when you get a chance? Over.

517
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:03,404
Roger that. Over and out.

518
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,502
Alaska?

519
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:07,638
That's a long way.

520
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:09,875
Yeah, it's a long way.

521
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,491
(Sighs)

522
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,947
That's it.

523
00:38:57,947 --> 00:38:59,924
That's what I saw.

524
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:02,791
I found it on Dr. Reeves' website.

525
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,924
Trace, these creatures have been
extinct for over 150 million years.

526
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:11,698
Well, I guess it didn't get the memo,
because that's what I saw.

527
00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:14,138
Are you suggesting the species survived?

528
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:17,074
You're the scientist.

529
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:24,173
Suppose it did survive,
just for the sake of the argument.

530
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:27,379
A mutation more sustainable
to warmer waters

531
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:30,252
could be making its way south.

532
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:31,092
This...

533
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,189
....came from that boat
that vanished in Alaska.

534
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:39,824
Now, five days later

535
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:43,859
they picked up its signal here, okay?

536
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,167
That's 1600 miles.

537
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,537
You think this thing attacked
Jeremy Long's boat?

538
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:51,634
Yeah.
And it swallowed his emergency beacon.

539
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:54,009
Then it headed south to warmer waters.

540
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:56,207
But it couldn't digest the beacon,

541
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,012
so it regurgitated it.

542
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,681
So how do we kill it?

543
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,852
We have to go
to the authorities with this.

544
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,452
And tell them what?

545
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:13,056
As far as they're concerned,
this case is closed.

546
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,363
I will talk to Dr. Reeves about it.

547
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:18,199
He worked with my father.
Dr. Reeves will hear me out.

548
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,899
And he will think
you are as crazy as I am.

549
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:23,340
Well, I will take that chance.

550
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,037
I am going to need this.

551
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,976
The residue might be
bile from its stomach.

552
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:31,245
Dr. Reeves can sequence the DNA
and confirm that this thing exists.

553
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,352
Trace, promise me
you won't do anything

554
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:42,384
until I have had a chance
to talk to him.

555
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:43,588
Trace.

556
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:47,029
All right.

557
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:50,929
Carol.

558
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,333
Thanks.

559
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,685
Dr. Reeves.
Carol Brubaker.

560
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,127
You spoke at my class last month.

561
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,859
I remember.
Carl Brubaker's daughter.

562
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,798
I always enjoyed his lectures.

563
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,769
I am also a friend of Rita Valdez--

564
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,864
a woman killed at Los Muertos.

565
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:31,308
I was wondering if I could have
a moment of your time.

566
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:33,972
Of course.
Give me a moment. Here.

567
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:37,039
Follow me.

568
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:45,384
Trace recognized it immediately
as the creature he saw.

569
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:48,086
Carol, this is just
an artist's rendering.

570
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:49,685
It's on your website.

571
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:53,324
Yes, but it's just another
unconfirmed sighting.

572
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,800
There have been others?

573
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,633
Japan, New Zealand,

574
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,639
North Carolina.

575
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,642
But until we have a reliable record

576
00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:05,940
of the existence of this species,

577
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,344
something concrete,

578
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:11,942
we cannot assume the existence
of a living example.

579
00:42:13,774 --> 00:42:16,482
This is the beacon I told you about.

580
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:19,081
It may have
tissue from the creature on it.

581
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,754
Examine this please, Dr. Reeves.

582
00:42:22,754 --> 00:42:24,820
I Will.

583
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:42,211
(Quietly)
Trace, you promised.

584
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:45,651
(Groans)

585
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:23,646
(computer beeps)

586
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:50,563
(firing)

587
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,261
(gun clicks)

588
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:22,103
(phone clicks)

589
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,667
(siren sounds)

590
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:46,228
MAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
Stop your engine.

591
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,262
Prepare for boarding.

592
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:51,071
I repeat, stop your engine.

593
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,873
Stop your engine.

594
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:54,902
The engine's stopped, okay?
I hear you.

595
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:56,972
The engine's stopped.

596
00:44:56,972 --> 00:44:59,746
CALDERON:
Nothing changes with you, does it, McGraw?

597
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:01,844
TRACE:
I know. It's very sad. Entiendo.

598
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:04,048
Hey, you want to explain to me

599
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:06,615
why you were doing
10 times the speed limit

600
00:45:06,615 --> 00:45:08,024
through a no-wake zone?

601
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:11,188
Uh, no, actually I don't.

602
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:13,698
How about a registration for that weapon?

603
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:16,201
Look, Victor,

604
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,397
I am very happy for your promotion

605
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:21,872
and I am glad to see that they're
lowering their standards so much.

606
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:25,274
And as much as I'd like to stay here
and insult you some more,

607
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:26,710
I am kind of busy right now.

608
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,113
Oh, can we get you any ammunition, huh?

609
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:32,845
How about some fuel?

610
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:34,716
- Look, Victor.
- Yeah?

611
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:36,779
This thing--

612
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:39,950
this thing that killed Rita
and the lifeguards--

613
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,017
it's not just a shark, okay?

614
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:45,258
It's some kind of prehistoric shark,

615
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:47,856
like a dinosaur.

616
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:49,868
- What the hell are you talking about?
- This thing is out there....

617
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:51,892
...and it's headed towards the waterways.
I saw it, okay?

618
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:53,962
(Laughing)
I am not kidding, all right?

619
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:58,170
If we don't stop this thing,
it's going to kill a lot more people.

620
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,974
How long are you going to
carry on with this bullshit?

621
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,140
Those people were attacked
by a tiger shark.

622
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,616
- No, it was not a tiger shark.
- Yeah, and I have a warrant....

623
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:08,745
....to Search this vessel.
Search it for what?

624
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:10,881
You leave that to us.

625
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:15,360
You know what? Go ahead.
Search the boat. Fine. Be my guest.

626
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,226
You have got bigger problems
than a prehistoric fish, amigo.

627
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:20,698
It turns out your partner Zorra

628
00:46:20,698 --> 00:46:23,395
was arrested at the border
with 40 pounds of marijuana.

629
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,232
- Can you explain that to me?
- What partner?

630
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:26,761
He's not my partner.
I rent his boat.

631
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:28,364
Okay, that's it. That's it.

632
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:30,841
Now I am impounding this boat, okay?

633
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:34,539
Ernesto, get this fool off the deck
and onto dry land.

634
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:37,139
Yeah, good luck getting on board.

635
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,785
(Laughing)

636
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:45,882
All right, calm down.
This is not a contact sport.

637
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:47,824
Oh, come on, let's go.

638
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:49,452
All right.

639
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,360
Are you kidding me?

640
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,094
- Wait, hold on. Hold on.
- Fine.

641
00:46:58,091 --> 00:47:00,128
TOM:
All right, let's get out of here.

642
00:47:00,128 --> 00:47:02,640
Come on.

643
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,233
JADE:
All right, babe.

644
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,266
All right, you be up front.
I am in back.

645
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:09,304
All you got to do is just row
and I will match you, okay?

646
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:11,839
No big deal.
Here we go. Here we go.

647
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,647
One, two.
Perfect.

648
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:16,018
JADE:
All right. Paddle paddle paddle.

649
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:20,818
Right on, I have got this.

650
00:47:22,516 --> 00:47:23,859
Okay.

651
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:26,956
And what is it that you're doing
back there, babe?

652
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:29,695
I am trying to match your stroke.

653
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:31,964
Isn't that supposed to be my line?

654
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:36,133
(Jade laughs)
Come on.

655
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,940
Left, right, left, right.

656
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,641
Don't make me come back there.

657
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,310
Just keep in rhythm with me.

658
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,342
Listen here, mister...

659
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:50,821
(Tom laughs)
You're rocking the boat.

660
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:56,025
Tom, I think we're being followed.

661
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,832
It's probably just a dolphin.

662
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:03,130
I don't know.

663
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,194
It looks kind of big for a dolphin.

664
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:12,944
That's no dolphin.

665
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:16,038
That's a shark.
Now row. Row.

666
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,811
(Whimpering)

667
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:20,841
- Come on.
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

668
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:23,252
TOM:
Go. Jade, go.

669
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:24,002
Go.

670
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:28,556
(Screaming)
Tom, no.

671
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:36,063
(Screaming)

672
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:39,737
(singing in Spanish)

673
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:44,334
- I really want you to come with us.
- That would be awesome.

674
00:48:47,034 --> 00:48:48,809
Hey.

675
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:51,645
MAN: You guys are looking great.
Good to see you.

676
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:53,515
Dr. REEVES:
Hello. Good to see you again.

677
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,783
Sam, nice to see you once more.

678
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:58,585
Thank you for your hospitality.

679
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:00,353
Dr. REEVES:
Very good.

680
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:01,859
Hello.

681
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,419
- Simon.
- Ah, Frank.

682
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,124
Frank, good to see you again.

683
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:08,429
- I am glad you could make it.
- Thanks for inviting me.

684
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:10,526
- Let me introduce you to somebody.
- Sure.

685
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:12,559
- Elsa.
- Yes?

686
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,734
This is Dr. Simon Otis,
a distinguished colleague of mine.

687
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:20,404
Well, welcome, Dr. Otis. I am so glad
you're joining us this evening.

688
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:24,473
Simon is with us doing some research
on cryobiology.

689
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:26,279
I will let him explain.

690
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:30,186
I study organisms living
at below normal temperatures,

691
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:32,053
endangered fish.

692
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,589
Endangered fish.

693
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:39,619
Excuse me one moment.

694
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:41,758
I am so sorry
that the music is so loud,

695
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:43,927
but we are having our annual fiesta,

696
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:46,335
and I am so glad you're joining us
for this event.

697
00:49:46,335 --> 00:49:47,668
Yes, well, it's nice to be here.

698
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:56,071
Amigos, your music is great,

699
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:58,845
but could you hold the volume down
just a little bit?

700
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:09,525
Some Arctic species develop
antifreeze proteins....

701
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:12,621
...that bind to the ice crystals
in the fish.

702
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:13,926
Frank.

703
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:17,265
Very interesting, Dr. Otis.
It's been such a pleasure meeting you.

704
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:20,066
Nice to meet you.
Frank, I must say hello to your wife.

705
00:50:20,066 --> 00:50:22,630
I will join you later.

706
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,541
I was just telling her
about the Siberian sturgeon....

707
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:28,102
...and how I was trying to freeze
the DNA...

708
00:50:28,102 --> 00:50:30,240
...for future regeneration.
I was going to--

709
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,217
Simon, come with me for a moment.

710
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:34,913
I need your opinion about something.

711
00:50:34,913 --> 00:50:36,420
Okay.

712
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:44,791
There's been something
bothering me for some time.

713
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,764
I am checking up on this.

714
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:50,166
I am not really certain
as to what the answer is.

715
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,397
But do you think it's possible

716
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:55,839
that a prehistoric species
could survive in this way,

717
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,273
trapped in ice?

718
00:50:57,273 --> 00:51:00,073
I think it's highly improbable.

719
00:51:00,073 --> 00:51:02,740
But out of the question? No.

720
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:17,119
(Beeping)

721
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,410
(sighs)

722
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:44,081
Where's Trace?
I can't get him on his cell.

723
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:47,388
I don't know. He probably got some
last-minute customer or something.

724
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:51,294
He's out there looking for
the pliosaur. I know it.

725
00:51:51,294 --> 00:51:53,229
What?
(Phone rings)

726
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,233
Hello. Hello.

727
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:56,859
Hey, Carol. It's Mike.

728
00:51:56,859 --> 00:51:59,496
Listen,
the regatta fiesta parade thingy--

729
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,563
it's going to be happening
a little bit later than anticipated.

730
00:52:01,563 --> 00:52:05,133
So I was wondering if we could delay
the polo match till 3:00.

731
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,735
Sure. No problem.

732
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:08,939
Okay,
I will tell the yacht club coach.

733
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,312
Okay, is that it?

734
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:13,011
Well, not unless you want
to take me up on my offer--

735
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,211
dinner tonight?

736
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,084
Look, I don't know how to explain
this to you, Mike,

737
00:52:16,084 --> 00:52:18,555
but I just can't deal
with this right now, okay?

738
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,319
No, I totally understand that.

739
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,418
I mean, tomorrow night's good
if you're available.

740
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:26,589
(Groans)

741
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:27,309
Naely,

742
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:31,363
doing anything tomorrow night?

743
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:36,431
(Phone rings)

744
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:37,771
Hello.

745
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:40,107
Where are you?

746
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:43,973
I am coming.

747
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:46,006
It's Trace.
He's down at the dock.

748
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:48,952
Luis, that thing is in the canal.

749
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,791
Everything was peaceful around here
until Trace McGraw came back.

750
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,691
You still don't believe him?

751
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:58,457
Did you?

752
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:03,033
I believe what he saw was a pliosaur.

753
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,697
I believe he saw it go to inland waters.
And we have got to stop it.

754
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:10,573
And I believe you guys are going to
need my help.

755
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:22,116
(Boat horn tooting)

756
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:35,426
This is Steve's house here.
We should warn him.

757
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:37,323
Yeah, there's a good View of the canal
from his dock.

758
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:47,853
Steve.

759
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,347
Hey, Steve.

760
00:53:54,574 --> 00:53:56,178
Steve.

761
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:00,350
- Steve.
- Steve.

762
00:54:04,017 --> 00:54:06,429
I don't see him.

763
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:12,334
Looks like he hooked another one.

764
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:13,861
Yeah, looks like it.

765
00:54:25,605 --> 00:54:26,325
Steve.

766
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,687
Hey, Steve.

767
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,414
Are you okay?

768
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:01,282
It's real,

769
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:02,912
just like you said.

770
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:05,684
Where the hell is it headed for now?

771
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:08,885
Let's go.

772
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:20,701
The canal leads to the Parque Nacional.
That's where it's headed.

773
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:22,502
- How far is it?
- 12 miles.

774
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:24,770
But there's a pontoon barrier
at the Huatulco turn-off.

775
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,277
- We can stop it there.
- Then what?

776
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:28,301
Blow it out of the water.

777
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:31,805
Whoa.
This creature is a biological phenomenon.

778
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,079
So?

779
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,748
We should capture is somehow,
anesthetize it, study it.

780
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:40,519
We will get it mounted on your wall
if you want, after we kill it.

781
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:42,322
I like his idea better.

782
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:46,456
So what, we need explosives, right?

783
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:49,524
Yeah, I will try to get some
from my friends at the army base.

784
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:52,002
All right, make it happen.
We will take Steve's car.

785
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:54,528
You guys track the thing.
I will meet you at the barrier.

786
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:06,115
WOMAN:
Calderon.

787
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:08,016
Not now.

788
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:14,221
(Knocks)
What is it?

789
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:16,249
You need to take this.

790
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:20,424
Yeah.

791
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:23,161
Inspector Calderon,
it's Carol Brubaker.

792
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:26,136
There's been another shark attack
with two more victims.

793
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,502
Where?

794
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:29,131
33 Via del Sol.

795
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:32,405
At least two people--
Steve Leggins and a woman.

796
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:34,207
There's not much left to ID.

797
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,214
We're tracking the thing inland.

798
00:56:36,214 --> 00:56:38,807
We're going to try and stop it
at the Huatulco turn-off.

799
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:40,977
You have got to send some help
right away.

800
00:56:40,977 --> 00:56:42,384
Immediately.

801
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:44,787
That's for sure.

802
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:48,625
So he said he's sending someone.

803
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,880
This better work.

804
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:18,097
Pedro.

805
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,352
TRACE:
Pedro, tu eres aqui?

806
00:57:21,352 --> 00:57:24,225
Hey guys.
Came to visit your friend?

807
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:26,821
How long is it going to take you
to get that pontoon piece into place?

808
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:28,423
No se.
Para que?

809
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:31,664
Pedro, please, can you get
that crane running?

810
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,034
I was waiting for--

811
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,367
Pedro, no estoy bromeando.

812
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,034
Look, I am not joking, man.
We got to get that thing down, okay?

813
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:38,406
Just move it. Come on.

814
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:40,001
Okay okay.

815
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,944
(Speaking Spanish)

816
00:57:45,538 --> 00:57:47,677
Let's go.

817
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,846
- Be careful.
- Okay.

818
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,253
Pedro, keep bringing it down.

819
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:52,722
(Speaking Spanish)

820
00:57:55,048 --> 00:57:57,460
Watch your step.
Come on.

821
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:01,526
Okay, that's good.

822
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:04,428
So what's the plan?

823
00:58:04,428 --> 00:58:07,529
There are eyelets
on either side of this pontoon....

824
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:10,063
...that lock it into place.

825
00:58:10,063 --> 00:58:12,804
Once they're together, this thing
shouldn't be able to get through.

826
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:15,039
So how are you going to do that?

827
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,280
Unfortunately, I am going to have to
go underneath there.

828
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,578
What am I supposed to do?

829
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,047
Just make sure I don't get eaten.

830
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,078
That's not funny.

831
00:58:25,078 --> 00:58:26,647
Okay, take it up.

832
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:50,808
Come on.

833
00:58:57,143 --> 00:58:59,384
(Bird screeches)

834
00:59:03,883 --> 00:59:05,920
Got it?

835
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,488
Almost.

836
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:09,864
I have just got to catch my breath.

837
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:12,668
Carol, Carol.

838
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:27,575
Carol, Carol.

839
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:28,950
Carol, come on.

840
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,784
Carol, come on.

841
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:36,894
Carol, come on.
Carol.

842
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:43,898
MEN: Get her out. Let's go.
Carol.

843
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:45,960
Get out. Come on.
It's coming. Get out. Get out.

844
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,381
Hey. Hey, come on.

845
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:01,215
Ernesto, look.

846
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:05,086
We got it trapped inside the canal.

847
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,483
You're just in time, okay?
Look.

848
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:11,654
Okay, stay back.

849
01:00:11,654 --> 01:00:14,688
What are you doing?
Victor, listen to me.

850
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:17,930
We have it trapped
right here in the canal, okay?

851
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,563
- Oh yeah?
- It's right back there.

852
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,698
Really? How scary.
(Laughs)

853
01:00:22,698 --> 01:00:25,733
- Listen to me.
- No, listen to me, Trace.

854
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:28,678
You show up out of nowhere
and the next thing I know,

855
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:31,272
I have got four people dead
and a missing car....

856
01:00:31,272 --> 01:00:33,250
....and a brick of marijuana
from your boat.

857
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,411
We have it trapped.
Now if you don't do something--

858
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:38,012
- What do you want me to do, eh?
- I want you to stop this thing.

859
01:00:38,012 --> 01:00:39,921
You want me to pin it on a dinosaur?

860
01:00:42,415 --> 01:00:45,419
Is your dinosaur running weed too, eh?

861
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:50,932
(Creature roars)
(people scream)

862
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:54,033
Fire, now.

863
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,556
Whoa.

864
01:01:14,781 --> 01:01:16,419
(Groaning)

865
01:01:16,419 --> 01:01:18,053
(screaming)

866
01:01:39,338 --> 01:01:42,114
That's your killer--

867
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:45,418
a 150-million-year-old shark.

868
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:47,049
It's hungry.

869
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:48,787
We need to trap this thing.

870
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:51,659
Okay, the waterway leads
to a maze of canals....

871
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:54,426
...and then a swamp.

872
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:56,730
The canals lead to the estuary.

873
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,600
And the estuary leads to the open ocean,
so this thing can still get free.

874
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,105
Yeah, but the Mascaro is only
a few boat lengths wide....

875
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:04,130
...and it's shallow.

876
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,201
I have got a chopper.
We can spot it from the air....

877
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:09,235
....and blow this thing
back into the Stone Age.

878
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:12,944
- Ernesto, call the base now.
- Yes, sir.

879
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:14,849
And clear the park.

880
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:16,717
Dinoshark season is officially open.

881
01:02:20,246 --> 01:02:21,919
Hey, you see that boat?

882
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:23,859
I am going to take that boat, okay?
I will meet you--

883
01:02:23,859 --> 01:02:26,830
Hey, look, Trace, I want you
to stay out of the way, okay?

884
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,559
Leave it to us.

885
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,161
(Helicopter blades whirring)

886
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:45,515
That chopper's got a .50-caliber
machine gun.

887
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:47,518
No arguing with that, man.

888
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:50,180
MAN OVER RADIO:
We have the shark spotted right below.

889
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:54,986
(Men screaming)

890
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:57,790
Holy shit.

891
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,819
(People screaming)

892
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,765
You're going to need
a bigger chopper, cabron.

893
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,570
MAN:
You're crazy. You're crazy.

894
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,074
(Horns honking)

895
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:29,084
MAN:
Come on.

896
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:40,026
(Horn toots)

897
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:44,765
(phone ringing)

898
01:03:46,299 --> 01:03:47,471
Carol.

899
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:50,447
Luis, where are you?

900
01:03:50,447 --> 01:03:52,574
Via Escondido.
I am stuck at a federal checkpoint.

901
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:54,949
- I can't get through.
- He's stuck on Escondido.

902
01:03:54,949 --> 01:03:56,954
Tell him it's in the Parque Nacional.

903
01:03:56,954 --> 01:03:59,149
We can meet him at Punta del Flamenco.

904
01:03:59,149 --> 01:04:00,851
He will know where it is.

905
01:04:00,851 --> 01:04:03,326
LUIS:
Yes, I got it. I will be there in 30.

906
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:05,226
You have got to hurry, Luis.

907
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:07,731
I am bringing a little present too.

908
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:31,077
CAROL:
How do you find your way around here?

909
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:33,215
It all looks the same.

910
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:35,192
TRACE:
I told you, I grew up here.

911
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:38,991
Luis and I used to come down here
when we were kids and play hooky.

912
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:47,363
If I remember, this should lead us
to Punta del Flamenco.

913
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,423
(Roaring)

914
01:05:54,894 --> 01:05:57,204
It's nice.

915
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,607
WOMAN: I am not wearing
the right shoes for this.

916
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:04,615
All right, all right,
we have got to stop. This is good.

917
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:06,344
- Want to take a break?
- Right here's great, yeah.

918
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:07,908
- Okay.
- Let's get some water out.

919
01:06:07,908 --> 01:06:09,942
Sure, open it up.
Hey, Dad, can I go play by the water?

920
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:11,717
Sure. Just be careful.
Don't get wet, buddy.

921
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,746
- Okay okay.
- Just be really careful, okay?

922
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:16,089
Hold Still.

923
01:06:17,216 --> 01:06:19,355
MAN:
Thanks.

924
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:23,094
WOMAN: Oh, it's hot.
Can't wait to get on that boat.

925
01:06:23,094 --> 01:06:25,124
(Imitates explosion)

926
01:06:25,124 --> 01:06:27,137
See anything?

927
01:06:28,127 --> 01:06:29,697
Up there, what's that?

928
01:06:36,635 --> 01:06:39,115
Get out of here,
you stupid crocodile.

929
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:53,297
WOMAN:
It's hot.

930
01:06:53,297 --> 01:06:55,128
What's wrong with you?

931
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:57,259
Eddie, where's your boat?

932
01:06:57,259 --> 01:07:00,566
Well, there was this crocodile
in the water and this monster ate him.

933
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:02,971
Look, we have got the whale-watching trip.
We need to go.

934
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:04,497
- Come on, hustle up.
- No more.

935
01:07:04,497 --> 01:07:06,942
I have talked to you about this--
no more stories.

936
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:43,136
Trace. Carol.

937
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,611
Trace.

938
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,907
(Distant dogs barking)

939
01:09:07,086 --> 01:09:07,806
Trace.

940
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:19,200
Let's go.

941
01:09:23,335 --> 01:09:25,815
It was right here, taking a sunbath.

942
01:09:25,815 --> 01:09:28,341
Calderon's men shot at it 50 times.

943
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:29,580
It just flew over.

944
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,451
- It can fly?
- Hey, which way?

945
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:32,922
That way.

946
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,890
Let's go.

947
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:44,623
MAN OVER SPEAKERS:
Hello, and welcome.

948
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:46,500
As you can see,
the boats are getting ready

949
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,768
for what promises to be
a fantastic day of fun at the marina.

950
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,297
CROWD:
Hey.

951
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:28,374
We have in fact imported

952
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:31,313
the lovely Ballet Folklorico dancers.

953
01:10:31,313 --> 01:10:34,045
And I hope you enjoy that.

954
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:36,075
And-- oh, look who we have here.

955
01:10:36,075 --> 01:10:38,247
George, how are you doing, sir?
Good to see you.

956
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:40,883
- Hi, Mike. How are you doing?
- Good to see you.

957
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:42,654
Bill, if you have a seat there, please.

958
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:44,592
Barbara, I have reserved
a special seat for you.

959
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:46,654
From here you should have
a pretty good view of the match.

960
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:53,303
Hurricane Kenna
slammed this place pretty hard.

961
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:56,169
It washed out most of the waterways.

962
01:10:57,896 --> 01:11:00,706
You guys, this map is out of date.

963
01:11:04,003 --> 01:11:06,540
Now what?

964
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:10,417
CAROL:
What's that?

965
01:11:26,025 --> 01:11:28,369
At least they got their
wildlife adventure.

966
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:37,803
MAN OVER SPEAKERS:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

967
01:11:37,803 --> 01:11:42,080
the start of the 2009 Puerto Vallarta
regatta race for the cup.

968
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,245
(Horn blows)

969
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:14,978
Ha.

970
01:12:42,835 --> 01:12:47,284
Hey, Luis,
isn't that the main channel?

971
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:49,752
We're headed toward the ocean.

972
01:12:49,752 --> 01:12:52,415
Trace, Trace, right there.
You see it?

973
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:00,260
It's headed towards the hotel.

974
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,153
The girls.

975
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:04,361
(Girls chattering)

976
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:10,401
Hey, you can't be in here.

977
01:13:10,401 --> 01:13:12,306
What do you mean?
I own the joint.

978
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:14,971
- Have you seen Miss Brubaker?
- We thought she was with you.

979
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:17,981
- The match starts in six minutes.
- We can't play without a coach.

980
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:20,313
How could she let me down like this?

981
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,615
And we were hitting it off so well.

982
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:26,384
Wait, we could do it.
We practiced the plays all week.

983
01:13:26,384 --> 01:13:30,121
Janelle, you can lead the swim-off.
Monica, you can start on goal.

984
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,322
Let's show these yahoo girls
how to play ball.

985
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:33,796
All right, yeah, let's go.

986
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,835
MIKE:
Ladies and gentlemen,

987
01:13:49,835 --> 01:13:52,041
Paradise Village proudly presents

988
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:53,947
a brand new fiesta week event--

989
01:13:53,947 --> 01:13:56,475
an all-girl water polo match.

990
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,988
(Blows whistle)
(crowd cheering)

991
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,025
(cheering)

992
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:11,725
Janelle, come on. This side.

993
01:14:11,725 --> 01:14:14,260
(Girls shouting)

994
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,567
All right, Janelle.

995
01:14:23,869 --> 01:14:25,177
CAROL:
They have started.

996
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:31,243
Get out of the water.
(Blowing horn)

997
01:14:31,243 --> 01:14:33,119
- Out of the water.
- Shark.

998
01:14:34,947 --> 01:14:36,426
Shark.

999
01:14:38,383 --> 01:14:39,919
(Screams)

1000
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,496
Help me.

1001
01:14:51,396 --> 01:14:52,568
(Blowing horn)

1002
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:55,408
(screaming)

1003
01:14:57,369 --> 01:15:00,907
WOMAN:
Get out of the water.

1004
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:09,559
Help. Help me.

1005
01:15:19,825 --> 01:15:22,101
Help her.
Please help her.

1006
01:15:24,296 --> 01:15:25,775
Oh my God.

1007
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:29,611
(Screams)

1008
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:35,749
Emilia, come on.

1009
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:40,451
Come on, Emilia,
swim to the ladder, please.

1010
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,921
Come on.
Come on, you can do this.

1011
01:15:55,327 --> 01:15:57,398
Come on, you can do this.

1012
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:01,572
Carol.

1013
01:16:05,804 --> 01:16:07,147
We're almost there.

1014
01:16:11,977 --> 01:16:13,388
Come on.

1015
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:14,789
Carol.

1016
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:18,225
Luis, no.

1017
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:19,729
Take my hand.

1018
01:16:36,168 --> 01:16:39,342
(Muffled)
Carol, come on.

1019
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:41,942
Carol, come on.
We have got to get this thing.

1020
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,520
I need help untying this boat.

1021
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,149
Carol.

1022
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:50,101
Carol.

1023
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,122
Come on.

1024
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:58,097
(Phone ringing)

1025
01:16:59,191 --> 01:17:03,298
Reeves, look, it's too late, okay?
Just tell me how to kill this thing.

1026
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:06,332
The creature's exterior lamina is armor.

1027
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:10,871
The only vulnerability in the entire
skeleton is the orbital cavity.

1028
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:12,108
In English, Reeves.

1029
01:17:12,108 --> 01:17:14,947
The eye-- aim for the eye.

1030
01:17:14,947 --> 01:17:16,646
Okay.

1031
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:20,713
Reeves thinks this thing's only
weakness is the eye.

1032
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,733
It's headed for Paradise Beach.

1033
01:17:46,338 --> 01:17:47,715
MAN:
Oh, nice.

1034
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:04,324
WOMAN: Yes.
MAN: Nice.

1035
01:18:04,324 --> 01:18:06,996
You go, girl. Race you to the barrier.
You're on.

1036
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:08,402
Hey, I will catch up with you later.

1037
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:10,304
I got an appointment
with the parasailor.

1038
01:18:21,506 --> 01:18:25,147
TOUR GUIDE:
Jet skiing, windsurfing, parasailing.

1039
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,785
Bye-bye.

1040
01:18:30,785 --> 01:18:32,035
Whoo.

1041
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:41,134
It's gone.

1042
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:47,275
See that? Right over there.

1043
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:09,526
(People screaming)

1044
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:22,900
TOUR GUIDE:
This is Paradise Village, people.

1045
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,745
TOUR GUIDE:
This is Paradise Village, people.

1046
01:19:25,745 --> 01:19:28,615
Before we get
to the viewing area, folks,

1047
01:19:28,615 --> 01:19:31,553
this is a fine opportunity
to take in the sights.....

1048
01:19:31,553 --> 01:19:33,146
...of the Bahia de Banderas.

1049
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:36,352
And off to the starboard side,
you guys can see....

1050
01:19:36,352 --> 01:19:39,851
...the world-famous
Puerto Vallarta regatta.

1051
01:19:39,851 --> 01:19:42,695
Take a picture. It will be worth
a lifetime of memories.

1052
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:07,181
And if you look above us right now,

1053
01:20:07,181 --> 01:20:10,887
you will see an example
of the exciting sport of parasailing.

1054
01:20:12,717 --> 01:20:15,391
I bet he has a View to die for.

1055
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:27,138
Keep your eyes open
and cameras ready, folks,

1056
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:30,374
because we might just catch a glimpse
of a dolphin or two.

1057
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:36,610
Hey, Skipper, how about a lift?

1058
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:38,518
What do you say, mates?

1059
01:20:38,518 --> 01:20:40,284
Hard to say no to these mermaids.

1060
01:20:40,284 --> 01:20:42,349
Come aboard.

1061
01:20:48,954 --> 01:20:52,094
Okay, watch your step here,

1062
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:54,626
my little fish.
(Laughs)

1063
01:21:03,101 --> 01:21:05,138
Whoa.

1064
01:21:10,308 --> 01:21:11,787
Holy smoke.

1065
01:21:20,118 --> 01:21:21,688
Hey. Hey.

1066
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:34,209
There's a shark behind you.
Get out of the water.

1067
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:46,185
There's a shark behind you.

1068
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:49,658
There's a shark right behind you.
Right behind you.

1069
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:52,219
Get out of the water.

1070
01:21:58,223 --> 01:22:00,362
(Roaring)

1071
01:22:04,829 --> 01:22:06,365
(screaming)

1072
01:22:10,735 --> 01:22:13,614
Trace, it got the parasailor
right over there.

1073
01:22:14,606 --> 01:22:16,449
Go go go.

1074
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:24,124
Take the wheel.

1075
01:22:24,124 --> 01:22:26,322
Get as close to it as you can.

1076
01:22:26,322 --> 01:22:28,797
CAROL:
I don't think this boat can keep up.

1077
01:22:28,797 --> 01:22:30,231
Keep it straight.

1078
01:22:37,128 --> 01:22:39,768
- Carol, keep it steady.
- I am trying.

1079
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,644
Damn it.

1080
01:22:54,446 --> 01:22:55,754
Is that a shark?

1081
01:22:59,918 --> 01:23:02,956
It just hit the excursion boat
over there.

1082
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:09,802
(Gasping)

1083
01:23:09,802 --> 01:23:12,274
(screaming)

1084
01:23:14,366 --> 01:23:15,086
Eddie.

1085
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:18,335
Mom.

1086
01:23:26,845 --> 01:23:28,916
(Screams)

1087
01:23:47,265 --> 01:23:48,972
- Eddie.
- Eddie.

1088
01:23:50,335 --> 01:23:52,008
Mom.

1089
01:23:52,008 --> 01:23:54,483
It's right behind them.

1090
01:23:54,483 --> 01:23:56,144
The boat's not fast enough.

1091
01:23:56,144 --> 01:23:56,984
(Roars)

1092
01:23:58,810 --> 01:23:59,530
Mommy.

1093
01:24:04,349 --> 01:24:07,626
Carol, get me over to that jet ski.

1094
01:24:13,058 --> 01:24:15,470
- Closer.
- I am trying.

1095
01:25:08,012 --> 01:25:09,150
Help me.

1096
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:46,721
Come on, Trace.

1097
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:04,409
Help.

1098
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,176
Help me.

1099
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:25,123
EDDIE:
Help. Help us.

1100
01:26:25,123 --> 01:26:27,727
Help. Help.

1101
01:26:27,727 --> 01:26:29,705
Help me.

1102
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:35,477
Help.

1103
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:39,913
Help.

1104
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:46,154
Welcome to the endangered species
list, you bastard.

1105
01:27:32,657 --> 01:27:33,023
(Instrumental music playing)

1106
01:27:33,023 --> 01:27:34,833
(instrumental music playing)
