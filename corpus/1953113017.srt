No!

- Yes.

45

- Who?
- Yes.

47
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,652
161 Lexington.

48
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:06,252
OK, Mr. Navorski, I need to see
your return ticket, please.

49
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:10,006
No, your return ticket. Your...

50
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,293
- Oh... Yes.
- Ah.

51
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,409
This is just a standard procedure.

52
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,616
I'm going to need the passport also.

53
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,530
Oh... OK.

54
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,178
- No, no.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,773
Mr. Navorski.

56
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,774
That. Passport.

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,412
That.

58
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,176
Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:48,417
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

60
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,256
I help people
with their immigration problems.

61
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,982
We're looking for
an interpreter for you.

62
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:57,817
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

63
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,782
But I understand
that you speak a little English.

64
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:03,503
- Yes.
- You do?

65
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,860
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

66
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:09,857
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

67
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,505
on passports issued
by your government.

68
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,498
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

69
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,974
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.

70
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,739
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

71
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:25,058
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.

72
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:28,138
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

73
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,662
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.

74
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,977
They got it all on GHN, I think.

75
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,424
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

76
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:40,262
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

77
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,909
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

78
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:45,822
Krakozhia. Krakozhia

79
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,908
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

80
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,107
Er... Let me... OK. Look.

81
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,624
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.

82
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,941
Kra-kozhia.

83
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,464
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.

84
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,463
- Krakozhia.
- OK.

85
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:08,386
Er... So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

86
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:11,988
- And this apple...
- Big Apple. Big Apple.

87
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,746
...Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.

88
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,424
OK?

89
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,386
No more Krakozhia! OK?

90
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:26,025
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

91
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:29,311
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.

92
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:33,354
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

93
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,905
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.

94
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,906
Now, we can't process you new papers

95
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:44,753
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

96
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:47,350
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,

97
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:50,190
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,

98
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,190
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

99
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:56,234
You are at this time simply...

100
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,955
...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

101
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,268
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

102
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:10,959
<i>Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.</i>

103
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,157
<i>I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.</i>

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,038
OK. OK.

105
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:19,032
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

106
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:23,114
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.

107
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:26,592
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

108
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:30,276
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

109
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:35,642
<i>It's like a Twilight Zone.

<i>Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.</i>

112
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,241
Really? It's not important.

113
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:46,599
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

114
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:49,198
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.

115
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,434
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

116
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,200
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.

117
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,674
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

118
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:01,519
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

119
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,679
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.

120
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:09,203
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.

121
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,402
- Free?
- Free. Free.

122
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:17,278
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.

123
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,279
- OK?
- OK.

124
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,642
- OK.
- OK.

125
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:22,797
OK.

126
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:25,449
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

127
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,963
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.

128
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,400
- Thank you.
- OK. All right.

129
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,400

You can use them in the Food Court.

Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

144
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:37,050
that you are not

145
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:41,335
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.

00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,376

148
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:51,054

00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,673
The public lounge is downstairs.

172
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:16,714
<i>The tiniest nation in the region
has been shaken by another uprising.</i>

173
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:21,427
<i>Krakozhia has been involved in civil war
throughout the late '80s and '90s</i>

174
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,396
<i>as it has tried
to transition from Communist rule.</i>

175
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,311
- Watch it!
- Please.

176
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,591
Please, telephone?
Telephone?

177
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,552
Telephone?

178
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,839
Please. Please.

179
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:03,833
Please. Please.

180
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:37,365
<i>For security reasons, please
keep your luggage with you at all times.</i>

181
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>Unattended luggage will be removed
for inspection and may be destroyed.</i>

182
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:00,805
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you broke my bag!

183
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,484
I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

184
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,564
I can't believe you just broke my bag!
Mom, Dad! He broke my bag!

185
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:23,123
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it. Stop it.

186
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you have an appointment?

187
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:31,370
I don't let anyone to look
at my trash without an appointment.

188
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,331
I have an opening next Tuesday.

189
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:38,167
Tuesday. Tuesday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Tuesday.

190
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,849
It will be good time for you
to come back and get lost.

191
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,209
OK, goodbye. Sorry.

192
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,890
Tuesday.

193
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,786
Don't shoot!

194
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:54,715
She sleeps 12, Frank. Has a
120-volt generator, wet bar, gas range.

195
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,675
She looks amazing.

196
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:59,225
She's my pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

197
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,070
She's a beautiful boat
and I hope you get her soon.

198
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:05,150
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

199
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,877
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

200
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,836
Come on. Congratulations!

201
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,434
I'm nominating you to take my place.

202
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,556
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

203
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,313
until you get approval from Washington.

204
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,789
Really? I don't know what to say.

205
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,152
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.

206
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,630
Don't pretend to be surprised.

207
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:34,958
You've been waiting for me to retire
or drop dead for years now.

208
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,637
No, I haven't been
waiting for you to retire.

209
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,162
That's all right, Frank.

210
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,758
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

211
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:51,672
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

212
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,234
Just be careful
about the inspection process.

213
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:58,236
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...

214
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:01,397
We're talking about
the Field Commissioner position.

215
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:05,638
People are going to look to you
for leadership, to set an example.

216
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,876
What are you saying?

217
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:15,282
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.

218
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:19,519
Ship the Colombians
off to asylum hearings,

219
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,201
and call the parents
of those kids from Long Island.

220
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,086
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

221
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,399
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

222
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,683
I want them out of here in half an hour.

223
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,483
Mr. Thurman.

224
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,688
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

225
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,206
I know, sir. You put him there.

226
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,169
Welcome to the United States.

227
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:07,765
Next!

228
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,926
I need visa.

229
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:16,370
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

230
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,332
Go to the wall.

231
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,848
Next!

232
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,813
Sir.

233
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,244
The light green form.

234
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:35,732
<i># I love New York...</i>

235
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:38,172
<i>- I love it!
- # New York</i>

236
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:44,487
<i># I love New York</i>

237
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:49,896
<i># I love New York...</i>

238
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,929
Light green.

239
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,291
Mr. Navorski, you cannot
get into New York without a visa.

240
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,495
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

241
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,253
and you cannot get
a new passport without a country.

242
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,808
There's nothing
we can do for you here.

243
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,811
I give you light green.

244
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,018
I'm sorry,
but you've wasted an entire day.

245
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,012
At this time you are simply...

246
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:20,929
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

247
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,057
Unacceptable.

248
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:25,894
Why is he still here?

249
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:30,055
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

250
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:33,931
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

251
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:38,779
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

252
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,054
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?

253
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:49,423
No news from the State Department,
but we can deport him in a few days.

254
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:53,054
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

255
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,776
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

256
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,778
Next!

257
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:03,137
Everything he does comes back to me.

258
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:06,937
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

259
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,467
Hello.

260
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,379
Hello.

261
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:17,618
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.

262
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,826
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

263
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,186
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

264
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:25,702
Excuse me.

265
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:54,993
Airports are tricky places,
Mr. Navorski.

266
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,713
I'm about to tell you something.

267
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,354
Something you can
never repeat to anyone.

268
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:03,028
Do you understand? It's a secret.

269
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,709
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

270
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:10,949
At 12 o'clock today, the guards
at those doors will leave their posts

271
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,472
and their replacements
are going to be five minutes late.

272
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,625
Late five minutes.

273
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:21,665
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12 o'clock.
Just today. Just this once.

274
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:23,907
No one is going
to be watching those doors.

275
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:28,469
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

276
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:29,673
No.

277
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,797
America, for five minutes, is open.

278
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,914
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

279
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,629
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

280
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,678
You unhook him
and place him back in the water.

281
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,357
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

282
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,511
All right, here we go.

283
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,796
OK. Call them off.

284
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,077
Johnson, clear the doors.

285
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:10,037
All right. Go.

286
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:13,273
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

287
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:15,961
All right.

288
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,763
Here we go.
Now where is he?

289
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:21,597
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.

290
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:23,594
There he is.

291
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:25,116
All right, Viktor.

292
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,402
Here we go.

293
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:47,402
What's so complicated? Exit, Viktor.

294
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,798
Come on. In a few minutes,
you'll be somebody else's problem.

295
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:53,003
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

296
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,476
I told him nobody would be watching.

297
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:58,878
Come on. All right, here we go.

298
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,323
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

299
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:03,998
Excuse me.

300
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:26,165
You got it. There we go.

301
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:29,369
He's got to get a running start,
I guess.

302
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:31,886
Just leave. Just leave.

303
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,929
Leave. Leave.

304
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:37,482
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling? Is he praying?

305
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:40,007
No. He's tying his shoelace.

306
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,484
Come on, leave.

307
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:49,485
Get the cameras.

308
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,565
Where is he? Where is he?

309
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:06,689
- To the left of here.
- No. He was at the door.

310
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,655
- Just go a little left.
- All right. All right.

311
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,691
I wait.

312
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,651
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

313
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,937
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

314
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:50,900
- This belong you?
- Thank you.

315
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:52,779
Oh, shit.

316
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,299
See? Wet floor.

317
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,940
That you.

318
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,455
I'm so late.

319
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,137
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.

320
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:05,340
Gate 24.

321
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,699
- You sure?
- Yes.

322
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:10,941
Thanks.

323
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,744
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

324
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,860
Wait.

325
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:18,538
For you. Payless Shoes.

326
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,094
Second floor.
Sensible heels.

327
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,897
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

328
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:47,266
<i>I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.</i>

329
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:51,024
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

330
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,465
If he could learn to speak, this guy.

331
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,429
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

332
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,784
A flight attendant.

333
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,225
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.

334
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,783
She look like a Russian.
KGB. She gave him heel of her shoes.

335
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:08,748
And he gave her a piece of the paper.

336
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,189
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

337
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,661
Must be some kind of the code.

338
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:20,429
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

339
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:23,391
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

340
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:28,264
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

341
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:49,829
Excuse me, buddy.

342
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,232
What's going on?

343
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,471
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

344
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:42,272
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?

345
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,162
Keep the change.

346
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,319
Excuse me.

347
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:15,965
OK, go. Go.

348
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,840
Good boy. Thank you.

349
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:22,922
Bye-bye.

350
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,597
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...

351
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:11,882
"Crisis. Crisis in Krakozhia."

352
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,929
<i>Now that heavy fighting has subsided</i>

353
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,926
<i>and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,</i>

354
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:21,212
<i>it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.</i>

355
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:24,924
<i>Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.</i>

356
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:28,086
"And food... in..."

357
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:30,736
<i>... have caused food
and energy shortages.</i>

358
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:32,726
"...in Krakozhia."

359
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:58,934
"The story of Broadway is the..."

360
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:09,369
<i>"The cast of comedy hit Friends</i>

361
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,656

362

<i>Friends.</i>

363
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,932
<i>Friends.</i>

00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:29,971
<i>Due to the heavy snowfall,

"Wayne Newton is 61 today."

366
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,616
"It's a miracle."

367
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:51,656
"Korean conjoined twins

368
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:55,021
"Chances of survival 50-50."

00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,300
50-50.

370
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:02,137
Next.

371
00:33:03,627 --> 00:33:05,776
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Navorski.

372
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:09,303
Why do you wait here every day
when there's nothing I can do for you?

373
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:15,178
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the US.

374
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,224
You have two stamp.

375
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,141
One red, one green.

376
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:25,462
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

377
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,903
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

378
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:51,064
As acting Field Commissioner,
I've created a new position here at JFK.

379
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:55,305
Transportation Liaison
for Passenger Assistance.

380
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:59,344
Sir, what will that person do?

381
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,866
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

382
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:12,663
I'm Transportation Liaison
in charge of Passenger Assistance.

383
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:23,311
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

384
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:27,754
It'll be days before he goes through
the doors in violation of section 2.14

385
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:29,714
Then he's somebody else's problem.

386
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:32,789
Why don't we tag him
in violation of section 2.14 now?

387
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:34,311
Then ship him to detention.

388
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,434
He has to break the law by leaving.

389
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:39,794
I won't lie, particularly to get rid
of somebody like him.

390
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,877
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

391
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,159
Put it down. Put it down.

392
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:44,437
Put it down.

393
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:48,921
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

394
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:53,205
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

395
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:55,881
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

396
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,759
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

397
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,961
We need to talk.

398
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,567
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

399
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,849
I need information
on CBP Officer Torres.

400
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:30,844
You feed me information about her
and I'll feed you.

401
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:34,242
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

402
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:38,803
I want to know
what makes her knees weak.

403
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:43,842
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

404
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:47,084
She's a wild stallion
and you'll help me break her.

405
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:48,607
I'm...

406
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:50,763
I'm her man of mystery.

407
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:55,609
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Delores.

408
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:59,483
You help me to win her heart
and you'll never go hungry again.

409
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:04,284
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

410
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:07,492
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

411
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:10,525
What mean, "wild stallion"?

412
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:20,814
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.

413
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:22,808

414
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:25,696
- A what?
- Stallion, like a horse.

415
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,769
Stand behind the yellow line.

- Mr. Navorski, behind the yellow line.

418
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,538

- I'll get light green.

419

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,651

She say one thing.

422
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:53,979
- Very important.
- What? What did she tell you?

423
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:57,973
Something wrong with the salmon?

424
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,700
<i>Need gorchitsa.</i>

425
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:00,931
What?

426
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:03,138
Mustard. Mustard?

427
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,942
- Mustard?
- Yes. Please.

428
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,894
Thank you.

429
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:22,423
Officer Torres, you like the films?

430
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:24,735
- Movies?
- Not so much.

431
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:27,898
- The Rockettes?
- Can't afford it.

432
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:30,341
- What do you like?
- Conventions.

433
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,902
Conventions. What is?

434
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:38,424
- Conventions.
- Conventions?

435
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:40,463
This is like secret place you go?

She go to these conventions
dressed as Yeoman Rand.

437
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:48,945
- Yeoman Rand.
- She's a Trekkie.

438
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,021
<i>Favorite episode
is Doomsday Machine.</i>

439
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:58,948
Now, listen, Viktor.

440
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,499
You can ask her something
that is very important.

441
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:03,103
- OK.
- Look...

442
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:13,263
- I wait.
- Enjoy your visit.

443
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:16,905
Next.

444
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,463
- Officer Torres.

What is choose?

448
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:44,274
She had a boyfriend?

449
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:47,233
For how long? Two years?

450
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:48,669
What happened?

451
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:51,185

<i>What we call krushkach.

00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:12,073
One man, two womans.

459
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:14,070
So. Mm.

460
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:16,517
Crowded, you know.

461
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:19,989
OK. He cheats.

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,274

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,557
No. I won't cheat.

467

She's a nice girl.
She won't take your chitting.

468
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,077
Next.

469
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:45,201
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?

470
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:48,718
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

471
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:51,034
Who's telling you
to ask me these things?

472
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,591
It's a man of misery.

473
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:58,041
Misery?

474
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:02,242
- Mystery?
- No, no. Misery. Man of misery.

475
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,995
He's so sick. He's so in love.

476
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,677
But what did she say?

477
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,838
She did say, "Next! Next!"

478
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:14,565
And now she say,
"Please. Please come."

479
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,558
<i>That's... Wait.</i>

480
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:24,400
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

481
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,206
Viktor, just tell me more.

482
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,199
I coming. I coming.

483
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,198
Please, please.

484
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:52,160
Beeper went off.
Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.

485
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,845
We have an idea.

486
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:57,001
Would you like something to eat?

487
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:59,605
No. No food. I stuffed.

488
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,520
OK. All right.

489
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,839
Thank you.

490
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,527
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

491
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,330
What?

492
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:14,769
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

493
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:16,366
How?

494
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:20,493
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

495
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:24,044
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

496
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:26,523
If we can establish this fear with you,

497
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:31,927
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

498
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:37,614
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

499
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:39,731
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

500
00:42:39,816 --> 00:42:44,686
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

501
00:42:44,777 --> 00:42:49,453
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

502
00:42:49,537 --> 00:42:53,052
Yes, and we would have no choice

503
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:58,166
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

504
00:42:58,258 --> 00:43:01,250
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

505
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:06,493
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

506
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,289
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

507
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,610
You can go to New York City tonight.

508
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,536
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

509
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,212
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

510
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:20,780
- Fear.
- Fear.

511
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:22,931
From what?

512
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:24,774
That's the best part.

513
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:29,175
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

514
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:31,651
So I'm going to ask you one question,

515
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:35,860
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

516
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,055
So, I answer one question.

517
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:43,739
Go to New York City. Tonight.

518
00:43:43,823 --> 00:43:45,051
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

519
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:46,816
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

520
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:53,025
- OK.
- OK.

521
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:54,254
All right.

522
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:58,782
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

523
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,822
No.

524
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:07,695
OK. Let me try it again.

525
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,500
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

526
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:14,944
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

527
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,303
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

528
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,459
And God only knows
what could happen.

529
00:44:19,548 --> 00:44:22,062
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

530
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:24,901
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

531
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:26,980
So you're afraid.

532
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,107
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

533
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:32,909
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

534
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,901
Krakozhia?

535
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:41,260
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

536
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:46,383
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

537
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,905
Human rights.

538
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:52,668
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

539
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:57,950
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

540
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:03,662
So? I go to New York City now?

541
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:07,104
- No.
- No?

542
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:10,674
OK.

543
00:45:10,754 --> 00:45:14,714
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

544
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:17,752
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

545
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:23,147
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

546
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:24,516
Thanks a lot.

547
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:31,587
Damn.

548
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:39,113
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

549
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,709
This is the only fun I have.

550
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,838
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?

551
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:51,195
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

552
00:45:51,278 --> 00:45:53,429
I take four back-to-back flights,

553
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,479
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

554
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,190
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

555
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,192
The woman hates fireworks.

556
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,521
Don't lie to me, OK?

557
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,957
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.

558
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,397
Because you flew United, Max.

559
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:21,560
<i>South African Airlines
passenger Sharif Al-Calala,</i>

560
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:23,599
<i>please come to the main ticket counter.</i>

561
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:36,475
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

562
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:39,557
No, I try to call home.

563
00:46:39,645 --> 00:46:42,079
So then...

564
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:46,959
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

565
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:52,760
Because they're all liars.

566
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,238
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

567
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,280
Wet floor.

568
00:46:58,367 --> 00:46:59,959
Please. Don't be hurt.

569
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:01,686
How can I not be? He's married.

570
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:03,724
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

571
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,763
You want to know
what the worst part is?

572
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:09,842
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

573
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,682
What kind of sick person am I?

574
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:15,124
I'm rooting for the home team.

575
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,839
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

576
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,522
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

577
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:33,207
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,

578
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:36,489
I just stare at him over room service.

579
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:38,768
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

580
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:44,963
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

581
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:49,009
That we belong together.

582
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:56,010
This... man... has you.

583
00:47:57,254 --> 00:48:01,328
Why he need... puzzle?

584
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:05,125
This is my problem.

585
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,525
I always see men
the way I want to see them.

586
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,689
Do I know you from someplace?

587
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:18,576
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.

588
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:23,696
Oh...

589
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,689
You headed for home?

590
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:29,410
Er... No, no. I am...

591
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:33,617
I am delayed a long time.

592
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:37,533
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?

593
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,899
I go from one building
to another building.

594
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:45,972
I have beeper.

595
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,498
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.

596
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:55,695
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

597
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:56,975
What's "BH"?

598
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,972
In English...

599
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:02,014
Viktor Navorski.

600
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:07,372
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

601
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:09,454
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

602
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:11,454
Nice to see you again.

603
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:16,460
You like Italian food?

604
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,423
I know, it's late
and you've probably got other plans,

605
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:23,976
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

606
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:27,374
I know a place
that has the greatest cannelloni.

607
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,898
Erm...

608
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:31,341
No, I... I can't.

609
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,224
- You married?
- No.

610
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,105
- Girlfriend?
- No.

611
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:41,466
I... I can't go out... with you.

612
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:48,097
God. I am so... I'm so sorry.

613
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:49,416
I am so sorry.

614
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:52,181
I must come off
like a complete nut job or something.

615
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,420
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

616
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:57,420
Wet floor. Wet floor.

617
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:00,343
- I...
- You don't have to explain.

618
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:01,589
No, I... Please, I...

619
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,667
<i>Wheelchair to gate A-five.</i>

620
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,944
Nadia.

621
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:14,185
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

622
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:16,307
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

623
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,542
- Dollars?
- 20.

624
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:20,701
Two people, 40.

625
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,703
Two people, 40 dollars.

626
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:33,511
Two people, 40 dollars.

627
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:42,470

628
00:50:42,555 --> 00:50:46,946
I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.

629
00:50:52,356 --> 00:50:56,031
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

630
00:50:56,116 --> 00:51:01,145
Because we are very particular
about punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

631
00:51:01,237 --> 00:51:02,990
Gate 67.

632
00:51:06,837 --> 00:51:08,749
You got to be kidding.

633
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:13,316
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number...

634
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:15,958
...mailing address,
even a phone number.

635
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,635
Telephone? You need? I get.
I get. I get phone.

636
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:22,630
I get... I get phone.

00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:40,153
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

639
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:43,110
Now?

640
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:16,115
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.

641
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:18,481
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

642
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:20,955
<i>It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.</i>

643
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:23,196
Cliff. Hello.

00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:24,800
<i>- How's it going?

645
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:28,481
<i>- Is this a good time?

646
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,004
<i>Well, I got to tell you
that the position's been filled.</i>

647
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:35,603
<i>Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?</i>

648
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:38,442
<i>- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.</i>

649
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:39,848
- All right.

650
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,247
OK.

651
00:54:06,058 --> 00:54:08,449
Who is this?

652
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,814
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

653
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:14,415
There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.

654
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,178
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

655
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,980
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

656
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,131
Does Harry think
he's running this job?

657
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,292
- I go now.
- Go? Go where?

658
00:54:29,381 --> 00:54:31,816
- Gate 67.
- 67?

659
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,938
We're ten months away from 67.

660
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:37,379
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...

661
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:39,771
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

662
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:42,252
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

663
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:45,017
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

664
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:48,299
Pull him off Harry's crew,
put him on mine.

665
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:50,295
You start 6.30 Monday morning.

666
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:53,023
You give me job?

667
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:56,781
6.30, yes... Boss.

668
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,387
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.

669
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:40,939
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.

670
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:42,510
OK. Just bring it.

671
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,229
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

672
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:48,462
Look. The man without a country.

673
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:50,429
Come on in. Welcome.

674
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:53,310
- I see this.
- You did well.

675
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:54,867
Have a seat.

676
00:55:54,953 --> 00:55:56,101
- Here?
- Here.

677
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:57,511
Come on, sit down.

678
00:55:57,592 --> 00:56:01,870
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

679
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,990
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?

680
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:07,952
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

681
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:12,505
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.

682
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:14,824
A microphone up in his ass.

683
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:20,751
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

684
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,429
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

685
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,147
Close your eyes.

686
00:56:36,957 --> 00:56:40,427
- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

687
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:43,953
I will have money.
But... Friday.

688
00:56:44,037 --> 00:56:47,792
Don't worry about it. We play for
unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.

689
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:51,189
You'll be amazed
at what people leave at airports. Come.

690
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:54,477
I have two nines and two nines.

691
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,470
Four nines. Thank you.

692
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:00,877
- Careful.
- Watch out.

693
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:05,829
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.

694
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,718
What is in the can?

695
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:10,269
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.

696
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,431
We know there's no nuts in there.

697
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,272
What is in there?

698
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:17,314
This is jazz.

699
00:57:18,122 --> 00:57:19,840
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

700
00:57:19,923 --> 00:57:22,311
- Jazz?
- Yes.

701
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:27,519
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

702
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:29,878
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

703
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:32,637
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys. OK.

704
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:35,033
For tonight's grand prize, we have...

705
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:38,756
Show them, Gupta.

706
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:40,675
I found this upstairs.

707
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:43,324
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

708
00:57:43,405 --> 00:57:45,316
There you go.

709
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,717
And... they belong to?

710
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:49,397
Cher.

711
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:50,999
Cher?

712
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:52,518
As in... Cher?

713
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:53,801
Yeah. Cher.

714
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,082
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

715
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,397
Those are Cher's panties.

716
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:00,125
- Ready?
- Hurry up.

717
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:02,721
So, will we share the panties?

718
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:04,207
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

719
00:58:04,288 --> 00:58:05,801
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

720
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:11,127
<i>United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita</i>

721
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,279
<i>is now announcing final boarding.</i>

722
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:16,726
"You can't.
That is mine."

723
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:21,243
"You can get so confused."

724
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,763
Viktor?

725
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,124
Well, hi.

726
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,325
Please.

727
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,401
- How are you?
- Good.

728
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,243
Man.

729
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:34,927
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

730
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,810
I'm so used to guys
trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet

731
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:42,010
that when I meet somebody that doesn't,
I don't know how to react.

732
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:44,242
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.

733
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:46,847
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

734
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,844
Tell me about it.

735
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,487
Napoleon?

736
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:56,331
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.

737
00:58:56,414 --> 00:58:59,373
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

738
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,925
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

739
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:06,290
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

740
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,694
- His ego.
- Ego?

741
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:08,764
Yes.

742
00:59:08,855 --> 00:59:11,086
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,

743
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:15,135
Napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of Saint Helena.

744
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:17,650
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

745
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:19,967
but the version I like goes like this:

746
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:24,293
He's very depressed
and decides to take his own life.

747
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:28,897
But Napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength

748
00:59:28,978 --> 00:59:32,733
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

749
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:37,210
His stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it,

750
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:39,130
and he doesn't die.

751
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:42,370
See? Ego. Saved his life.

752
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:44,610
Maybe he need glasses.

753
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,373
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

754
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,371
Poison.

755
00:59:50,981 --> 00:59:53,369
It's funny you should say that.

756
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,055
Rumor has it
that Napoleon was farsighted.

757
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,733
- There you go.
- There you go.

758
00:59:57,821 --> 01:00:00,461
- There you go.
- And there you go.

759
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,339
I think we're rewriting history
right here.

760
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:05,378
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

761
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:09,301
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.

762
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:11,300
I just did it again.

763
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:15,492
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?

764
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:19,213
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

765
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:20,293
OK.

766
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,858
- OK, what?
- OK.

767
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:25,936
Lunch... with you.

768
01:00:27,385 --> 01:00:29,183
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

769
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:31,825
You're not running for a flight or?

770
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:33,225
I wait.

771
01:00:36,986 --> 01:00:38,942
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

772
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:41,381
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.

773
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:44,027
You work?

774
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,825
- No.
- Ah.

775
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,627
Three of you. Crowded.

776
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:50,902
Stay away from me, Viktor.

777
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:55,663
I'm... I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

778
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:59,900
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

779
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,708
- You're not sick, Amelia. No.
- No?

780
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:05,987
No. You're a little... farsighted.

781
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,868
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

782
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,022
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.

783
01:01:30,592 --> 01:01:33,107
Your CBP inspection's in three days.

784
01:01:33,192 --> 01:01:36,026
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

785
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:40,902
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

786
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,543
How much does Navorski make?

787
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:46,026
Sir?

788
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,705
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

789
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:52,585
They're paying him cash under the table.

790
01:01:52,672 --> 01:01:54,821
I know that. How much?

791
01:01:55,871 --> 01:01:57,826
$19 an hour.

792
01:01:57,911 --> 01:02:01,870
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?

793
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,986
That's New York City construction.

794
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,630
One of my own men
came up to me the other day.

795
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:10,348
Asked me
if I wanted to join the big pool.

796
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,829
Look at him.

797
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,141
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

798
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,107
Have you heard about this?

799
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:20,826
I have January 3rd.

800
01:02:24,948 --> 01:02:26,860
Bring him in.

801
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:30,497
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK? No country.

802
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:35,298
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

803
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:39,176
I want you to put him in a detention
centre and run a clearance on him.

804
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:41,179
That's all I want.

805
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:44,658
What about a federal prison?

806
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:48,660
What about another airport?

807
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:51,102
Hello? Hello?

808
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:57,743
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

809
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:02,619
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

810
01:03:02,706 --> 01:03:05,095
You want me to bring him back
to the terminal?

811
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:08,576
No. From now on, Navorski lives here.

812
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:23,614
The people who are coming here today
will be observing me, inspecting me.

813
01:03:24,465 --> 01:03:28,093
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

814
01:03:28,185 --> 01:03:33,133
So let's show them why this is the
number-one airport in the United States.

815
01:03:33,224 --> 01:03:36,580
We process about 600 planes a day,

816
01:03:36,663 --> 01:03:39,178
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

817
01:03:39,264 --> 01:03:41,175
about 60 seconds per passenger...

818
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:43,698
...to be brought into the country.

819
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:47,059
We keep it as clean as possible.

820
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:49,338
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

821
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:50,856
That's a lot of walnuts.

822
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:53,935
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.

823
01:03:54,023 --> 01:03:56,582
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

824
01:03:56,663 --> 01:03:59,301
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

825
01:03:59,383 --> 01:04:01,293
Mind if I try one?

826
01:04:10,422 --> 01:04:13,299
How did you know
those weren't for his mother-in-law?

827
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,179
If he's married,
where's his ring?

828
01:04:15,261 --> 01:04:18,458
And if he's divorced,
who still talks to their mother-in-law?

829
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:22,614
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...

830
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,453
- Sir.
- Yeah.

831
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:28,175
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

832
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:30,616
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

833
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,057
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they
found four prescriptions without an MPL.

834
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:37,653
They tried to take the pills away
and he went nuts.

835
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,299
There he is.
We think they're for his father.

836
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,099
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

837
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,058
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right. We're here to help you.

838
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:50,176
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

839
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:51,851
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

840
01:04:51,939 --> 01:04:54,453
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

841
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:58,088
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

842
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:03,489
Viktor.

843
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:06,134
Viktor.

844
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:08,652
Oh...

845
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,650
I need your help.

846
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:14,576
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.

847
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,330
He may not speak your dialect,

848
01:05:16,418 --> 01:05:18,692
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

849
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:21,530
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

850
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,936
This guy's very upset.

851
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:26,053
Just calm him down
and I'll let you back in the terminal.

852
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:29,526
No. New York.
No red stamp. Green. I green.

853
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:30,765
- New York.
- OK, yes.

854
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:32,733
- You say yes?
- Yes.

855
01:05:32,816 --> 01:05:35,330
- OK. OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!

856
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:39,375
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

857
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,685
Stay out!

858
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:58,689
So?

859
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,083
OK, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

860
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:10,362
he needs to have the proper form,
a Medicinal Purchase License.

861
01:06:10,453 --> 01:06:12,331
OK? You understand me, Viktor?

862
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:38,002
He say he bring
the medicine for his father.

863
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:47,330
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

864
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:48,639
It doesn't matter.

865
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:53,486
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.

866
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,120
He did not know
he need this document.

867
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,281
No one say to him
he need document form.

868
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,598
I'm saying it to him.

869
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:15,922
He needs to have the form signed by
the hospital who is treating his father.

870
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:18,967
These medicines
have to stay in the United States.

871
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:20,323
They have to stay here.

872
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:39,960
He... He's begging you.

873
01:07:40,047 --> 01:07:42,356
I know. I can see that he's begging.

874
01:07:46,448 --> 01:07:47,846
I'm sorry, sir.

875
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:53,875
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

876
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,917
I'm sorry.

877
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:02,084
Send him down!

878
01:08:07,246 --> 01:08:09,965
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

879
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:16,996
Whoa.

880
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:19,243
Goat.

881
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:23,955
- What?
- Goat. It medicine is for goat.

882
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:29,713
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

883
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,674
- He said that?
- Yes.

884
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:35,642
He say...

885
01:08:35,724 --> 01:08:39,511
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".

886
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:43,243
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

887
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:46,475
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

888
01:08:46,564 --> 01:08:52,035
The... Krakozhia...
The name for "father"...

889
01:08:52,123 --> 01:08:54,432
sound like "goat".

890
01:08:54,523 --> 01:08:56,433
I make mistake.

891
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:06,320
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

892
01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:09,519
Medicine is for... goat.

893
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:11,755
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

894
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:13,673
- No.
- Yes.

895
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:15,831
You read the blue immigration form.

896
01:09:15,922 --> 01:09:16,910
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

897
01:09:17,002 --> 01:09:18,832
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

898
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,436
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

899
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:26,513
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor. That's very good.

900
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:30,789
Why are you doing this? Huh?

901
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:33,713
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

902
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:36,076
Look at me.

903
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,071
I was going to help you.

904
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,514
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.

905
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:46,397
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

906
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,313
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

907
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,278
Please. Who the medicine is for.

908
01:10:02,758 --> 01:10:06,831
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

909
01:10:13,278 --> 01:10:16,475
OK. The pills stay. He goes. That's it.

910
01:10:21,477 --> 01:10:23,388
Goat.

911
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:26,637
Please. For goat.

912
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:28,866
Medicine for goat.

913
01:10:28,956 --> 01:10:31,471
Medicine for goat.

914
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:33,387
Medicine for goat.

915
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:37,546
Give him the pills.

916
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:40,067
Medicine for goat.

917
01:10:41,396 --> 01:10:43,307
Medicine...

918
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:54,991
Come on now, it's all over.

919
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:56,985
He love that goat.

920
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:03,307
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

921
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:05,305
to keep you there for five years?

922
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:08,625
You go to war with me, and you go to war
with the United States.

923
01:11:08,714 --> 01:11:12,468
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

924
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:15,705
while Uncle Sam wipes his ass
with Charmin two-ply.

925
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:26,741
<i>There was a 20 man.</i>

926
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:29,552
<i>Immigration gun was drawn.</i>

927
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,386
The Dixon was ready to fire.

928
01:11:32,473 --> 01:11:35,111
To kill the little man with the pills.

929
01:11:36,112 --> 01:11:41,345
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

930
01:11:41,432 --> 01:11:45,504
"Put the guns away," the man say.

931
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:47,946
"Nobody will die today."

932
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:49,703
Who?

933
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:52,510
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

934
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:54,502
Who was this man?

935
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:04,150
Navorski. Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.

936
01:12:31,829 --> 01:12:35,503
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

937
01:12:35,588 --> 01:12:40,218
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules
and concentrate on the people.

938
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:41,423
The people, I know.

939
01:12:41,507 --> 01:12:44,898
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.

940
01:12:47,347 --> 01:12:49,737
You could learn
something from Navorski.

941
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:54,820
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

942
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,936
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

943
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:25,734
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.

944
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:28,936
For you.

945
01:13:29,025 --> 01:13:30,936
For you.

946
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:33,335
For wall.

947
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:36,061
Fish for wall.

948
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:44,174
Why do you want to go to New York?

949
01:13:45,263 --> 01:13:47,175
And what's in the can of peanuts?

950
01:13:50,704 --> 01:13:52,137
Promise.

951
01:13:52,983 --> 01:13:55,417
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

952
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:00,451
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

953
01:14:00,543 --> 01:14:03,979
And this is a promise
that comes from a man who is stuck here.

954
01:14:04,062 --> 01:14:06,496
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

955
01:14:09,902 --> 01:14:13,736
From now on, you and I are partners.

956
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:17,653
If I stay, you stay.

957
01:14:17,742 --> 01:14:21,700
You will not set one foot
in New York City.

958
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:26,534
Not a single toe
in the United States of America.

959
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,210
Do you understand
what I am saying to you?

960
01:14:31,741 --> 01:14:33,652
Yes.

961
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:36,179
You don't like fish.

962
01:14:56,619 --> 01:15:00,294
Do you ever feel
like you're just living in an airport?

963
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:10,607
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

964
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:12,734
I can mail you
anywhere in the US.

965
01:15:12,818 --> 01:15:16,174
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.

966
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:20,216
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

967
01:15:20,298 --> 01:15:22,334
- I do.
- What's her name?

968
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:23,692
Amelia Warren.

969
01:15:23,777 --> 01:15:26,496
I thought we were looking
for a way out, not a way in.

970
01:15:26,577 --> 01:15:29,968
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

971
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:34,175
Flying back and forth between time zones
messes with their biological clock.

972
01:15:34,256 --> 01:15:38,249
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.

973
01:15:38,336 --> 01:15:42,295
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

974
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,731
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

975
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:47,693
You go in jail. Not me.

976
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,606
For... You know what? Forget it.

977
01:15:49,696 --> 01:15:51,367
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

978
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:53,127
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

979
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,807
Amelia Jane Warren?

980
01:15:54,895 --> 01:15:56,806
- Jane?
- Yeah.

981
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,772
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

982
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:04,403
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

983
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:47,363
Amelia,
would you like to get eat to bite?

984
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:53,650
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

985
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,766
Bite to eat?

986
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:06,762
Bite to eat?

987
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,967
Bite to eat?

988
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,043
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

989
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,166
Bite to eat.

990
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:19,399
Bite to eat.

991
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,479
Bite to eat.

992
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,606
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

993
01:17:22,688 --> 01:17:24,725
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

994
01:17:24,809 --> 01:17:27,368
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

995
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:30,122
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat...

996
01:17:35,249 --> 01:17:38,604
Gupta, you been ever married?

997
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,485
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

998
01:17:42,568 --> 01:17:48,200
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

999
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:50,596
Why?

1000
01:17:50,687 --> 01:17:54,725
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.

1001
01:17:54,807 --> 01:17:56,957
Made just enough money to survive.

1002
01:17:57,047 --> 01:18:01,962
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

1003
01:18:02,047 --> 01:18:06,358
I said OK.
This is common. So I pay him.

1004
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:11,042
The next day, the same policeman
come and keep coming and keep coming.

1005
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:15,005
And I am paying and I'm paying him
and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.

1006
01:18:15,086 --> 01:18:20,365
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

1007
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:25,761
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1008
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:28,040
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1009
01:18:28,124 --> 01:18:31,162
So you never go home?

1010
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:35,760
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.

1011
01:18:38,164 --> 01:18:42,680
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.

1012
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:48,081
As long as I keep
my floor clean, keep my head down,

1013
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:50,998
they have no reason to deport me.

1014
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:54,200
They have no reason
to notice a man like me.

1015
01:18:55,482 --> 01:19:02,002
<i>United Airlines Flight 2703
from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.</i>

1016
01:19:09,642 --> 01:19:12,395
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1017
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,912
No, no, no. It's wet.

1018
01:19:23,881 --> 01:19:26,156
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

1019
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,152
Watch out!

1020
01:19:31,961 --> 01:19:33,632
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

1021
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:36,553
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1022
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,153
He nearly killed me.

1023
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,151
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1024
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,268
I love the suit.

1025
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:45,997
Hugo Boss.

1026
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,310
On sale, $149.99.

1027
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,189
That's a bargain.

1028
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:53,156
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

1029
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,991
And Josephine.

1030
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:58,310
Do you know what Napoleon
gave Josephine on their wedding day?

1031
01:19:58,399 --> 01:19:59,957
Amelia?

1032
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:04,590
Would you like to have eat to bite?

1033
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,191
Food. Tonight?

1034
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:08,746
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

1035
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:10,556
Yeah. Sure.

1036
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:13,994
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

1037
01:20:14,078 --> 01:20:16,990
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

1038
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:31,314
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

1039
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:33,947
This way, please.

1040
01:20:42,556 --> 01:20:44,467
Thank you.

1041
01:20:46,116 --> 01:20:48,345
I didn't know they had a patio up here.

1042
01:20:49,476 --> 01:20:51,386
It's very nice.

1043
01:21:10,195 --> 01:21:12,150
Good night.

1044
01:21:15,753 --> 01:21:18,143
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1045
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:22,591
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

1046
01:21:22,673 --> 01:21:25,346
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

1047
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:27,310
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1048
01:21:27,394 --> 01:21:29,190
For you, sir?

1049
01:21:29,272 --> 01:21:32,265
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

1050
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:34,263
I'll be back.

1051
01:21:47,752 --> 01:21:51,107
Let me see. Enjoy.

1052
01:21:52,511 --> 01:21:55,389
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

1053
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:58,032
- Tell me.
- OK.

1054
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:01,660
It's 1742
and the Turks invade Bucharest,

1055
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,743
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

1056
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:07,298
<i>- But the town bakers...</i>

1057
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,022
Sorry.

1058
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:29,424
So, the bakers?

1059
01:22:29,509 --> 01:22:33,866
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

1060
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,223
I'm sorry, Viktor.

1061
01:22:35,309 --> 01:22:39,062
Nobody really cares
where the croissant was invented.

1062
01:22:39,148 --> 01:22:42,584
I'll bet the Romanians themselves
don't give a shit.

1063
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:43,896
I care.

1064
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:46,741
Is histories. Is truth.

1065
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:50,347
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

1066
01:22:51,187 --> 01:22:52,621
- Yeah.
- No.

1067
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:55,585
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

1068
01:22:55,668 --> 01:23:00,980
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of
the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

1069
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:03,376
I'm 39.

1070
01:23:03,467 --> 01:23:05,856
So? I was 39 once.

1071
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:10,542
I was 18 years old
when I started working for the airlines.

1072
01:23:10,627 --> 01:23:13,060
I've been doing this over 20 years.

1073
01:23:13,146 --> 01:23:15,615
And now there's no more pretending.

1074
01:23:15,706 --> 01:23:17,583
This is it.

1075
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:22,580
It's why my address book is by city
and my pager goes off during dinner.

1076
01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:29,097
You can switch off pager.

1077
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,738
I wish I could.

1078
01:23:31,825 --> 01:23:35,261
I've been waiting for a phone call
for seven years.

1079
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:39,542
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

1080
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:44,815
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

1081
01:23:44,903 --> 01:23:47,293
just in case
he wants to meet me for the weekend.

1082
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:50,335
Yeah.

1083
01:23:50,903 --> 01:23:52,814
I've been waiting my whole life.

1084
01:23:56,023 --> 01:23:59,982
<i>- Just don't know what the hell for.</i>

1085
01:24:02,102 --> 01:24:04,059
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:23,651
I live here.

1087
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:25,777
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

1088
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:27,772
Gate 67.

1089
01:24:28,581 --> 01:24:31,573
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

1090
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:35,130
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

1091
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,938
So I wait.

1092
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,739
All frequent fliers
feel the same way you do, Viktor.

1093
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,936
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

1094
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:46,536
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

1095
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,008
<i>- Then what are you waiting for?</i>

1096
01:24:52,099 --> 01:24:54,977
Is OK. I understand.

1097
01:24:58,299 --> 01:25:00,211
I have an idea.

1098
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:03,973
- Come here.
- What you do?

1099
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:07,406
You sure?

1100
01:25:07,498 --> 01:25:09,932
More than anything, I'm sure of this.

1101
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:11,929
Ready?

1102
01:25:26,337 --> 01:25:29,295
So, when do you come back?

1103
01:25:29,377 --> 01:25:32,528
13 days. How about you?

1104
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:35,256
I will be here.

1105
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:37,566
But what if your schedule changes?

1106
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:40,217
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

1107
01:25:40,296 --> 01:25:43,094
No. I will be here.

1108
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:48,366
You know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1109
01:25:49,096 --> 01:25:51,006
Tell me.

1110
01:25:51,655 --> 01:25:53,009
Come on. Tell me.

1111
01:25:53,095 --> 01:25:57,407
I will show you. 13 days from now.

1112
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:04,925
What's he doing?

1113
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:08,481
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

1114
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,401
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

1115
01:27:27,249 --> 01:27:31,401
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You got to do this for me.

1116
01:27:31,489 --> 01:27:34,765
You'll get really fat
with all the food I'm going to give you.

1117
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:39,239
But, please, do this for me. It will be
the last thing I ask you to do.

1118
01:27:57,168 --> 01:28:00,955
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.

1119
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:09,881
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1120
01:29:11,283 --> 01:29:13,193
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1121
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,358
Thanks.

1122
01:29:20,162 --> 01:29:23,711
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1123
01:29:23,802 --> 01:29:27,032
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.

1124
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:28,998
Please follow me.

1125
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:30,992
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.

1126
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,470
<i>In my line of work,
there are three things that matter.</i>

1127
01:29:56,559 --> 01:30:01,349
The person, the document and the story.

1128
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:07,111
Find the truth of one
and you find the truth of all three.

1129
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,474
I need your help finding the truth.

1130
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:14,274
Do you know a man
named Viktor Navorski?

1131
01:30:14,358 --> 01:30:15,870
Yes.

1132
01:30:16,518 --> 01:30:19,430
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1133
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:22,190
No. We're just friends.

1134
01:30:22,277 --> 01:30:28,147
Have you noticed that he hides a can
of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?

1135
01:30:28,237 --> 01:30:29,510
So?

1136
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:31,508
What do you make of that?

1137
01:30:33,197 --> 01:30:35,347
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1138
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:41,190
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1139
01:30:41,277 --> 01:30:43,392
Has he told you why he's in New York?

1140
01:30:43,476 --> 01:30:44,703
No.

1141
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:48,505
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1142
01:30:48,596 --> 01:30:52,304
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1143
01:30:52,396 --> 01:30:53,670
That's it.

1144
01:30:53,755 --> 01:30:56,111
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1145
01:30:56,195 --> 01:30:58,107
That's what he said?

1146
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:04,788
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1147
01:31:04,874 --> 01:31:08,834
You are the kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

1148
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:13,550
Why Viktor Navorski?

1149
01:31:15,474 --> 01:31:19,785
That's something a guy like you
could never understand.

1150
01:31:42,112 --> 01:31:46,628
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1151
01:31:46,713 --> 01:31:48,827
Please. Sit.

1152
01:31:48,912 --> 01:31:51,789
It's OK, Viktor. All men lie.

1153
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:55,308
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1154
01:31:55,392 --> 01:31:58,940
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.

1155
01:31:59,951 --> 01:32:03,023
Maybe you see the man
the way you want see the man.

1156
01:32:03,111 --> 01:32:07,183
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?

1157
01:32:07,711 --> 01:32:10,019
- I...
- Unacceptable?

1158
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:12,260
Yes. Yes.

1159
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:14,262
You want to hear the funny part?

1160
01:32:14,991 --> 01:32:16,662
I broke up with him.

1161
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,218
I was coming here to tell you
he's out of my life.

1162
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:23,098
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1163
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:25,100
At least we have that in common.

1164
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:35,306
Amelia, you know what Napoleon
give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1165
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:38,502
No.

1166
01:32:38,589 --> 01:32:40,579
I show you.

1167
01:32:44,908 --> 01:32:46,819
Please. Please.

1168
01:32:50,589 --> 01:32:52,498
Sit. Please.

1169
01:33:03,547 --> 01:33:08,063
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1170
01:33:08,146 --> 01:33:10,615
One thousand fountains.

1171
01:33:12,306 --> 01:33:13,819
You built this for me?

1172
01:33:13,906 --> 01:33:18,581
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1173
01:33:27,945 --> 01:33:29,857
Come on.

1174
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:33,220
Oh...

1175
01:33:33,305 --> 01:33:34,374
It no work.

1176
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:39,220
It should shoot,
big water up to ceiling.

1177
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:45,420
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?

1178
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,095
Are you a criminal?

1179
01:33:54,063 --> 01:33:55,736
You're living here, Viktor.

1180
01:33:55,823 --> 01:33:59,701
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1181
01:33:59,783 --> 01:34:01,694
Here. I show you.

1182
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,376
My father.

1183
01:34:14,463 --> 01:34:17,658
Viktor, please tell me
your father isn't in that peanut can.

1184
01:34:24,782 --> 01:34:26,693
This is jazz.

1185
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:35,620
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1186
01:34:35,701 --> 01:34:40,377
see this photograph
in Hungarian newspaper 1958.

1187
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:44,134
He say he look at photograph
for seven days.

1188
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,132
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

1189
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,531
Who are they?

1190
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,136
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1191
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:54,130
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1192
01:34:54,219 --> 01:34:56,574
57 of them all together.

1193
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:01,016
After looking at photograph
for seven days, my father has idea.

1194
01:35:01,099 --> 01:35:05,935
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1195
01:35:06,019 --> 01:35:11,092
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.

1196
01:35:11,178 --> 01:35:13,089
And then he wait.

1197
01:35:13,978 --> 01:35:17,653
He wait month, week, year.

1198
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:20,650
My father wait 40 year.

1199
01:35:24,977 --> 01:35:27,208
And they all sign names.

1200
01:35:30,178 --> 01:35:32,168
One by one.

1201
01:35:47,217 --> 01:35:51,687
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1202
01:35:57,895 --> 01:35:59,806
All but not one.

1203
01:36:01,695 --> 01:36:03,413
Benny Golson.

1204
01:36:06,855 --> 01:36:08,765
Saxophone.

1205
01:36:08,854 --> 01:36:13,928
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1206
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:17,723
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1207
01:36:21,454 --> 01:36:26,733
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1208
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,611
have him write name to put in can.

1209
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:34,128
And you've been living here
so you could do this for your father?

1210
01:36:34,813 --> 01:36:36,723
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1211
01:36:42,572 --> 01:36:46,247
You say you are waiting for something.

1212
01:36:47,572 --> 01:36:51,281
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait".

1213
01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:56,563
What are you waiting for?

1214
01:36:58,572 --> 01:37:02,610
You. I wait for you.

1215
01:37:57,327 --> 01:37:58,601
What?

1216
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:05,037
The war is over.

1217
01:38:05,127 --> 01:38:08,676
<i>... the right-wing military coup
that ousted President Vagobagin...</i>

1218
01:38:34,085 --> 01:38:37,122
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1219
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:40,958
Let's have a toast to my friend,
Viktor "The Goat".

1220
01:38:43,044 --> 01:38:45,115
May he never lose his country again.

1221
01:38:45,804 --> 01:38:47,237
Krakozhia!

1222
01:38:47,324 --> 01:38:51,078
Amelia! You here early!

1223
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:53,313
Hello. Amelia, look.

1224
01:38:53,403 --> 01:38:55,918
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace. Come.

1225
01:38:56,004 --> 01:38:58,802
See, the war,
the war Krakozhia is over.

1226
01:38:58,883 --> 01:39:01,477
Peace. The war is over.

1227
01:39:05,164 --> 01:39:08,313
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1228
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:11,076
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1229
01:39:11,163 --> 01:39:12,801
It's a pass, Viktor.

1230
01:39:12,882 --> 01:39:15,635
A one-day travel emergency visa
with your name on it.

1231
01:39:15,723 --> 01:39:17,393
- Wha... Visa?
- Yes.

1232
01:39:17,482 --> 01:39:19,552
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

1233
01:39:19,642 --> 01:39:23,475
Just go to New York, find that last name
and put it in the can.

1234
01:39:24,242 --> 01:39:25,310
- I go New York?
- Yes.

1235
01:39:25,401 --> 01:39:26,880
I go New York!

1236
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:38,071
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.

1237
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:45,676
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

1238
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,471
He did it for me.

1239
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:55,313
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.

1240
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,074
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1241
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,672
I not confused... Not this. Not this.

1242
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,428
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1243
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,477
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1244
01:40:11,919 --> 01:40:15,228
You know what Napoleon
gave Josephine as a wedding present?

1245
01:40:15,318 --> 01:40:17,274
It was a gold locket.

1246
01:40:17,358 --> 01:40:20,555
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1247
01:40:25,118 --> 01:40:27,109
"Destiny".

1248
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:31,669
Destiny.

1249
01:40:33,837 --> 01:40:36,954
<i>... rejoice in the streets
as well as in their local taverns.</i>

1250
01:40:37,036 --> 01:40:41,667
<i>The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye
from high atop the parliament buildings.</i>

1251
01:40:41,757 --> 01:40:43,713
<i>It is a clear sign of the power...</i>

1252
01:40:45,756 --> 01:40:48,430
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1253
01:40:49,196 --> 01:40:50,469
I missed you.

1254
01:40:53,475 --> 01:40:55,386
Come on.

1255
01:41:07,675 --> 01:41:09,154
Next.

1256
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:11,786
Viktor.

1257
01:41:13,635 --> 01:41:16,944
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?

1258
01:41:17,874 --> 01:41:19,830
What do you have here?

1259
01:41:23,794 --> 01:41:25,705
What do you have here?

1260
01:41:35,073 --> 01:41:37,110
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1261
01:41:38,633 --> 01:41:40,385
What?

1262
01:41:40,472 --> 01:41:43,146
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.

1263
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:47,590
To validate authenticity, it needs
to be signed by the supervising officer.

1264
01:41:48,192 --> 01:41:50,102
Dixon?

1265
01:41:50,232 --> 01:41:51,381
Yes.

1266
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:54,066
Dixon.

1267
01:41:57,431 --> 01:42:01,186
The war in my country is over.

1268
01:42:02,271 --> 01:42:07,026
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1269
01:42:07,111 --> 01:42:08,988
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1270
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:12,346
When you wait so long for one thing?

1271
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:15,620
One tiny moment.

1272
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:18,225
I had that moment today, too.

1273
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:20,459
You see this badge?

1274
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:24,225
This badge means that I was made
CBP Field Commissioner.

1275
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:29,099
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1276
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:32,744
Your ticket and your passport.

1277
01:42:35,269 --> 01:42:37,578
It's time for you to go home.

1278
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:44,858
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1279
01:42:44,948 --> 01:42:47,746
and make sure
he does not miss his flight.

1280
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,739
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1281
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:01,904
I think I want go New York City.

1282
01:43:04,226 --> 01:43:06,218
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1283
01:43:06,306 --> 01:43:09,139
I no more "unacceptable".

1284
01:43:09,227 --> 01:43:12,582
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1285
01:43:15,146 --> 01:43:17,057
Are you sure you want to do that?

1286
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:20,738
I go New York City now.

1287
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:30,698
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1288
01:43:31,865 --> 01:43:34,334
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1289
01:43:34,426 --> 01:43:38,417
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1290
01:43:38,505 --> 01:43:40,461
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1291
01:43:40,545 --> 01:43:44,424
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1292
01:43:44,504 --> 01:43:45,539
Yep.

1293
01:43:45,624 --> 01:43:50,300
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1294
01:43:50,384 --> 01:43:55,173
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1295
01:43:55,264 --> 01:43:57,141
That's a major security breach.

1296
01:43:57,224 --> 01:43:59,259
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.

1297
01:43:59,343 --> 01:44:01,300
But I'm going to have to let him go.

1298
01:44:01,383 --> 01:44:05,899
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.

1299
01:44:05,984 --> 01:44:10,294
But he's wanted for assaulting
a police officer back in India in 1979.

1300
01:44:11,702 --> 01:44:13,773
I'll have to deport him.

1301
01:44:13,863 --> 01:44:15,773
I will go home.

1302
01:44:16,703 --> 01:44:20,216
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1303
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:22,213
Leave them alone. I will go.

1304
01:44:22,982 --> 01:44:24,574
- Today.
- Yes.

1305
01:44:24,662 --> 01:44:27,574
If you don't get on that plane,
they're all gone.

1306
01:44:27,662 --> 01:44:29,379
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1307
01:44:29,461 --> 01:44:31,181
OK. Good.

1308
01:44:32,581 --> 01:44:34,378
<i>Your attention please.</i>

1309
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:40,092
<i>Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for
flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.</i>

1310
01:44:44,421 --> 01:44:45,695
I don't believe you.

1311
01:44:45,781 --> 01:44:49,250
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1312
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,172
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1313
01:44:52,259 --> 01:44:55,138
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1314
01:44:55,219 --> 01:44:58,132
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

1315
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,489
Gupta.

1316
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,092
Goodbye.

1317
01:45:05,179 --> 01:45:07,977
You try to fool us.

1318
01:45:08,059 --> 01:45:12,450
You make us to think you would walk out,
that you will fight with them.

1319
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:14,177
Why don't you fight?

1320
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:18,809
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1321
01:45:18,898 --> 01:45:23,255
Get lost. Go home
and tell them you never made it.

1322
01:45:23,337 --> 01:45:27,172
You come this close to America,

1323
01:45:27,257 --> 01:45:31,296
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

1324
01:45:32,738 --> 01:45:34,409
You are a coward.

1325
01:45:34,498 --> 01:45:37,170
The plane is on time.

1326
01:45:37,257 --> 01:45:39,486
You are a coward.

1327
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:42,485
You are a coward!

1328
01:45:42,576 --> 01:45:44,168
You make me sick!

1329
01:45:44,257 --> 01:45:47,488
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

1330
01:45:47,576 --> 01:45:51,330
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm...

1331
01:45:53,575 --> 01:45:54,975
Look at me.

1332
01:45:55,736 --> 01:45:57,647
Come on, look at me.

1333
01:46:02,135 --> 01:46:04,251
There's something you should know.

1334
01:46:08,015 --> 01:46:11,052
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865</i>

1335
01:46:11,135 --> 01:46:14,490
<i>from Krakozhia has landed
and is now taxiing to the gate.</i>

1336
01:46:14,574 --> 01:46:18,124
<i>For those passengers holding tickets

1337
01:46:18,215 --> 01:46:20,648
<i>we expect departure

1338
01:46:35,892 --> 01:46:37,770
Get back, please.

1339
01:46:47,252 --> 01:46:48,446
Gupta.

1340
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:02,088
Gupta!

1341
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:34,600
I am going home.

1342
01:47:38,929 --> 01:47:40,885
Get lost.

1343
01:47:51,448 --> 01:47:53,358
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1344
01:47:53,448 --> 01:47:58,282
<i>Flight 866 to Krakozhia
will be delayed until further notice.</i>

1345
01:48:06,407 --> 01:48:08,967
Do you have an appointment?

1346
01:48:11,207 --> 01:48:13,880
Somebody tell me
what the hell is going on down there!

1347
01:48:16,766 --> 01:48:18,678
We're right behind you.

1348
01:48:22,766 --> 01:48:24,119
Viktor's leaving.

1349
01:48:38,485 --> 01:48:41,795
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

1350
01:48:41,885 --> 01:48:44,274
He's going for the front door,
out to the city.

1351
01:48:44,365 --> 01:48:45,844
What?

1352
01:48:54,964 --> 01:48:56,920
Viktor. Remember us.

1353
01:48:57,004 --> 01:48:59,518
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

1354
01:48:59,604 --> 01:49:00,718
It's good luck.

1355
01:49:00,804 --> 01:49:02,714
A digital camera for cousin Katia.

1356
01:49:02,803 --> 01:49:06,398
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

1357
01:49:15,163 --> 01:49:17,631
<i>- Everybody in position?
- We're here.</i>

1358
01:49:17,723 --> 01:49:19,121
Secure the door.

1359
01:49:30,761 --> 01:49:32,672
Sorry, Viktor.

1360
01:49:35,921 --> 01:49:37,036
Take him, Judge.

1361
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,598
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

1362
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:45,230
You see those doors?

1363
01:49:45,321 --> 01:49:47,788
Those are the entry doors
to New York City.

1364
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:51,190
To the United States of America.
Turn around.

1365
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,955
It's snowing in the city
and you're going to need that.

1366
01:50:07,759 --> 01:50:08,748
Good luck.

1367
01:50:09,639 --> 01:50:12,471
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1368
01:50:12,559 --> 01:50:14,116
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

1369
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:15,517
I'm going to miss you.

1370
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,793
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

1371
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:19,755
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1372
01:50:19,838 --> 01:50:22,591
Goddammit!

1373
01:51:05,475 --> 01:51:07,067
Taxi!

1374
01:51:19,434 --> 01:51:20,662
Thank you.

1375
01:51:58,992 --> 01:52:01,301
Where you go?

1376
01:52:01,391 --> 01:52:06,260
161 Lexington. Please take Van Wyck
Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.

1377
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:07,830
It's faster than BQE.

1378
01:52:07,911 --> 01:52:11,107
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia. Viktor Navorski.

1379
01:52:11,191 --> 01:52:13,422
I'm Goran. Albania.

1380
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:17,629
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.

1381
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:31,459
You want us to block the south exit
and have AP sweep every vehicle?

1382
01:52:32,429 --> 01:52:34,341
Sir?

1383
01:52:38,389 --> 01:52:40,459
5.30 from Tokyo just landed.

1384
01:52:40,549 --> 01:52:44,507
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.

1385
01:52:44,589 --> 01:52:47,865
The night is young
and 1500 people are headed our way.

1386
01:52:50,108 --> 01:52:53,225
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.

1387
01:52:53,307 --> 01:52:54,707
Come on, let's go.

1388
01:52:54,788 --> 01:52:56,140
Let's go.

1389
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:28,937
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no. I don't check in.

1390
01:53:29,026 --> 01:53:30,778
I want to go to this place, please.

1391
01:53:30,866 --> 01:53:32,935
The lobby lounge
is around the corner.

1392
01:53:33,025 --> 01:53:36,905
They have happy hour specials
and live music. Do you like jazz?

1393
01:53:36,985 --> 01:53:38,896
The monitor's off.

1394
01:53:43,704 --> 01:53:47,822
The piano's OK. A little more
bass. More bass from the monitor.

1395
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:55,333
<i>Let's do Killer Joe.
It worked all right last night.</i>

1396
01:53:55,423 --> 01:53:58,222
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?

1397
01:53:58,304 --> 01:54:00,613
Yeah. Yes, I am.

1398
01:54:01,784 --> 01:54:05,902
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.

1399
01:54:05,984 --> 01:54:11,341
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,
was great, great fan of your music.

1400
01:54:11,423 --> 01:54:14,779
A jazz fan. Fantastic.

1401
01:54:14,863 --> 01:54:18,060
Would you sign your name, please?

1402
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:22,055
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

1403
01:54:22,143 --> 01:54:23,860
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.

1404
01:54:23,943 --> 01:54:25,852
OK.

1405
01:55:27,778 --> 01:55:29,655
Taxi! Taxi!

1406
01:55:51,216 --> 01:55:53,492
Where you want to go?

1407
01:55:56,056 --> 01:55:57,967
I am going home.
