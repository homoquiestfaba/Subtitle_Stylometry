00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,940
I'm sorry, viewer.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,900
The TV show you're searching for

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,060
cannot be streamed
in your reality.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,580
Please stand by
for reconnection.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,660
From the darkest depths
of cyberspace,

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,740
there is another world.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,380
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,300
terrors unspeakable.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,700
Stories unlike any
ever told until now.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,420
Do not click Back.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,180
Do not reload.

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,740
We have reconnected to...
Dimension 404.

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,260
So, what do you do?

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,700
Huh?

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,620
What do you do?

17
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,260
Oh, uh, I kinda run
this music blog.

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,180
Uh‐huh, and where are you from?

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,220
Well, originally I'm from Maine.

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,260
Uh‐huh, and where
do you live now?

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,140
Right here, in Brooklyn.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,060
So, what do you do?

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,300
I don't like to talk about work.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,500
Look, I hate these things, too.

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,180
You know, I feel like
everyone in the room

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,900
can tell that we're
on a first date.

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,740
No one's paying attention.

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,900
So, if you could be any animal,

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
what animal would you be?

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,340
This isn't going
very well, is it?

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,580
Yeah, no, this is over.

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,940
You can go.

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,660
Some romances last a lifetime,

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,580
but most don't make it past
the first cup of coffee.

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,460
Still, don't feel too bad
for our lonely lovebird Adam.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,780
Thanks to the magic
of ones and zeroes,

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,220
he's about to meet
his one and only.

38
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,700
Her name's Amanda.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,180
She likes craft
beer, good music,

40
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,940
and she lives on
the Lower East Side

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,860
of Dimension 404.

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,820
Well, it's official.

43
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm gonna die alone.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,660
What?

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,940
Don't say that.

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,180
Greg, I've looked, flirted,

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,300
and met‐cute half of
the women in Brooklyn,

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,860
and I'm honestly
starting to think

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,780
that my soul mate doesn't exist.

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,300
You know, she's like
a myth, like Bigfoot.

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,020
Dude, she exists,
she's out there.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
Just like Bigfoot.

53
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,460
‐Wow, I need a beer.
‐You're out of beer.

54
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,940
Look, man, you just
gotta broaden your horizons.

55
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,340
Stop meeting weird
randos on the street

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,940
and start meeting them online.

57
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,820
Online, online dating?

58
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,940
‐Yeah.
‐No!

59
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,380
Look, I don't want
some algorithm

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,460
telling me who to hook
up with, all right?

61
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,020
I just want to meet
a cute girl, you know,

62
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,460
with a cute little
red streak in her hair

63
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,180
and a tattoo of a bird

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,700
while we're both reaching
for the same Talking Heads LP.

65
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,180
There are 413 eligible women
that are Talking Heads fans

66
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,300
within a two‐mile radius
of this apartment.

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,020
Wait, really;
what is that?

68
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,900
Make‐A‐Match, bro,
everybody's on it.

69
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,220
Why are you on it,
aren't you with Charlene?

70
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,020
I'm not on it, you are.

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,300
‐I made you a profile.
‐What, when?

72
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,860
Last night when I
drank all your beer.

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
‐Greg!
‐Come on, man.

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,540
Look at all of these women.

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,460
What do you have to lose?

76
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,140
All right, fine.

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,620
But seriously, stop
drinking all my beer.

78
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,500
No promises.

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,020
I can't afford it,
you can, so I drink it.

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,780
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

81
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,020
Make‐A‐Match
helped me find exactly

82
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,260
what I've been
looking for all my life.

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,500
Their personality profile
truly reached deeper

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
than the other sites.

85
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
It's magic, I don't
know how they do it.

86
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,580
At Make‐A‐Match, we believe

87
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,140
there's someone out
there for everyone.

Welcome to love.

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Welcome to Make‐A‐Match.

92
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,780
Amanda.

93
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,460
She's a med student,
she likes hanging out.

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,620
I mean, she's cute.

95
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,300
Favorite band: The Pixies.

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,740
That's a start.

97
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,020
Yeah, but still, I mean...

98
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,380
this is my 100 percent match?

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,100
Where's her bird tattoo?

100
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,780
Oh, my God, she winked you.

101
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,500
‐She what?
‐She checked you out

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,180
and she likes what she sees.

103
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,660
Just ask her out already.

104
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,820
God, you know, this‐‐
this‐‐this is too weird.

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,180
I can't do it, I'm out, no.

106
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,220
Dude, you are going
on a date with this girl

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,260
if I have to pump you
full of benzodiazepine

108
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,500
and drag you there myself.

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Fine, but only because
I am desperately lonely.

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,540

No, I‐I went, I saw him
at Great Woods in 2001,

148
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,100
and I basically went
through puberty on the spot.

are you being serious?

00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,420
She's the one.

182
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,580
Wait, what?

183
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,220
I'm getting a beer,
you want a beer?

184
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,900
You're out of beer;
what are you talking about?

185
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,620
Buddy, I'm talking about Amanda.

186
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,740
She's... dude, she's...

187
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,100
I dont‐‐‐she's amazing.

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm gonna get her a ring.

189
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,380
I mean, not an engagement ring,

190
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,700
but like a really,
really nice ring.

191
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,900
Okay, uh, have a seat, Casanova.

192
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,220
How long have you been
with this girl, a month?

193
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,780
Maybe two?

194
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,540
Yeah, but‐‐but I feel
like I have known her

195
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,860
my whole life.

196
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,820
Sure, but if you want
to make it to three,

197
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,220
maybe you should cool your jets.

198
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Okay, I get it,
I get what you're saying,

199
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,260
but, buddy, we're
100 percent compatible.

200
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,220
‐The app said so.
‐Forget what the app said.

201
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,900
Come on, I mean,
you're the one who sold me

202
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,180
on the whole Make‐A‐Match thing.

203
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,540
I thought you'd
be stoked for me.

204
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,860
I am, I am, it's just, um...

205
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,420
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

206
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,940
All right, so, you're
saying just...

208
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,260
slow things down?

209
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,420
Exactly.

210
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,580
Play it cool.

211
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,860
My man.

212
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,780
‐All right.
‐Okay.

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,540
I love you.

214
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
What?

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,220
These last two months
have been amazing,

216
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,940
and I just‐‐I keep thinking

217
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,140
about spending the rest
of my life with you.

218
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,500
You're my soul mate, Amanda.

219
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,300
Are you sure?

220
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,180
Are you not sure?

221
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,380
Oh, God.

222
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,740
‐Oh, God?
‐Look, it's not you, I just‐‐

223
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I don't have time for
anything serious right now.

224
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,060
We've spent every single
night here since we met.

225
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,620
And it's been great, it's
just my residency interviews

226
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,780
are coming up, so... So...

228
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,780
So... maybe you should go.

229
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,780
Uh, o‐‐okay.

230
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,180
Wow, um...

231
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,140
This is, uh, yeah,
this is our first big fight.

232
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,740
It's, uh, it's a milestone.

233
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,300
‐Adam, stop.
‐Look, someday,

234
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,140
we're gonna look back on
this and we're gonna laugh.

235
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,140
‐Adam!
‐Come on, we can make this work.

236
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,340
Look, if you want to go
slow, we'll go slow.

237
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
I'm serious, goodbye.

238
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,020
No.

239
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,340
No, I'm not gonna just
walk away, all right?

240
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,580
I can't.

241
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,540
Look, I know that you're scared.

242
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,620
All right, I'm scared, too.

243
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,740
But you and I... we're
made for each other.

245
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,340
Oh, for the love of God.

246
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,540
This is something that we'll
tell our adorable grandch‐‐

247
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,300
Ow, whoa, hey!

248
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,180
‐Whoa, hey!
‐I got his legs, let's move.

249
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,860
Tech Support to HQ,
Romeo is in the bag.

250
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,140
Moving to extraction point.

251
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Help!

252
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
Help!

253
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,260
Greg?

254
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,700
‐Greg?
‐Adam?

255
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,220
Hey, man, I'm‐‐

256
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,700
dude, I'm freaking out, man.

257
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,860
‐What's going on, man?
‐They tried to kidnap me.

258
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,340
I‐I‐I was over at
Amanda's place, and‐‐

259
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,540
Wait, wait, wait, what's
going on with Amanda?

260
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,100
I‐I don't know, all right?

261
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,700
She, um, she‐‐she dumped me,
and then these guys‐‐

262
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,100
Wait, wait, she dumped you?

263
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,140
Oh, man, I told you
to play it cool.

264
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah, I‐I know.

265
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
I‐I don't know‐‐

266
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,060
It's okay, man, come here.

267
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,660
Come on in, man, come on.

268
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,580
Come on.

269
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,900
Bring it in, bring it in.

270
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,340
‐Bring it in.
‐I love her, Greg.

271
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,020
What am I gonna do?

272
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,100
Package is secure.

273
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,580
Are you ready to begin?

274
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,900
What?

275
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,780
How would you describe your
performance in the relationship?

276
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,940
Who the hell are you?

277
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,100
Very satisfactory, satisfactory,

278
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
or needs improvement?

279
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,620
What the hell's going on?

280
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
We'll put "needs improvement."

281
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,860
Would you agree that
your worst qualities

282
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,340
are clinginess, painfully naive,

283
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
and overly emotional?

284
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,700
No, I wouldn't, what‐‐
where the hell am I?

285
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,140
Exit interview.

286
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,500
Wait, did you not get debriefed?

287
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,020
Debriefed?

288
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,500
Please watch this
informational video.

289
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,380
Hi, I'm Matthew Maker,

290
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,860
Founder and CEO of Make‐A‐Match,

291
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,740
and I'd like to say thank you,

292
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,660
because it's biogenetic
love companions like you

293
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,180
that make what we do possible.

294
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,900
Ever feel like you
were made for someone?

295
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,860
You were!

296
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,580
Bred here in the Genesis Vats

297
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,020
at Make‐A‐Match Heartquarters,

298
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,100
your genome, personality,
and artificial memories

299
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,220
were handcrafted
by literal love doctors

300
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,660
to the exact specifications
of your romantic partner.

301
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,780
But love doesn't
always work out,

302
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,700
which brings you here
to the returns department.

303
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,900
Good news: Since the Sentient
Life Form Protection Act

304
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,420
forbids us from terminating
you against your will,

305
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,220
you're now free to live out
your days in blissful servitude

306
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,740
at Make‐A‐Match, Inc.

307
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,220
What, no, uh, I don't
want to do that.

309
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,500
I want to go home.

310
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
This is your home now,
so make the most of it.

311
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,860
Career opportunities include:

312
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
That is all.

313
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,580
And if you really want to take
your career to the next level,

314
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,420
volunteer for our
biomatter recycling program

315
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,340
and be a part of
the next generation

316
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,940
of Make‐A‐Match companions.

317
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,340
Scientists assure me
it's 100 percent fun.

318
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,100
Thanks for watching,

319
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,580
and welcome to life after love.

320
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,180
Hmm.

321
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,300
So, I‐I'm not
an indie music blogger?

322
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,380
Of course not, have you
seen your apartment?

323
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,700
Okay, well, if I have all
these fake implants of memories,

324
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,540
then, uh, tell me, what'd I
do for my eighth birthday?

325
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,660
You went to a water park.

326
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
Okay, what'd I do
for my 12th birthday?

327
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,100
I don't remember
all of your birthdays.

328
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,940
‐A‐ha.
‐Oh!

329
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,380
Any further questions can
be directed to your group.

330
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,100
Hey, Adam, welcome!

331
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,180
I'm Adam.

332
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,660
Uh... Come on, let me give you

334
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,900
the warp speed tour.

335
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,820
This is Adam.

336
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,460
He was Amanda's first companion.

337
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,500
Piss off.

338
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,820
For about three months

339
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,940
until Adam here came around.

340
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,020
'Sup, bro.

341
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,900
And let's see, then
there was Adam.

343
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,740
Namaste.

344
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,140
And, uh, last but not least,

345
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,940
there's me, Adam.

346
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,940
So, uh, what was it this time?

347
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,380
Sorry?

348
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,620
Oh, um... I told
her I loved her.

350
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,620
Don't listen to
these guys, okay?

351
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,500
They're still hung up on her.

352
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,300
So‐‐so how‐‐how's she doin'?

353
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,020
She's doing great.

354
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,660
She's‐‐she's
finishing up med school,

355
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,140
she's talking to
her sister again.

356
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,420
She's happy.

357
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,180
She's growing out
her vinyl collection.

358
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,740
You know, next week, we're, um‐‐

359
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,500
Next week we were supposed to
see Elbow at The Bell House.

360
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,220

I'm such a klutz.

381
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,140
What's your version number?

382
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,460
It's, uh, it's Adam 5, ma'am.

383
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,420
It won't happen again.

384
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,260
Let's hope not.

385
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,380
Absotively.

386
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,020
Uh, absolutely.

387
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,140
Of course.

388
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,460
Hey, don't torture
yourself like this.

389
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,140
Just keep an eye out.

390
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,860
All right, here we go.

391
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,740
Adam, Mk 6.

392
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,780
"How can we improve
your next love companion?"

393
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,860
"Improve your love companion."

394
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,260
Occupation... lawyer?

396
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,540
A lawyer?

397
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,900
Actually, that's...

398
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
Hey, did she keep anything?

399
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,260
Adam, what'd she keep?

400
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,060
Nothing.

401
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,300
What's up with him?

402
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,420
They're activating
a new Adam today.

403
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,620
I think he's taking
it pretty hard.

404
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,100
So, what do you do?

405
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm a lawyer.

406
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,140
I work downtown.

407
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,100
Uh‐huh, and where are you from?

408
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,620
Manhattan, born and raised.

409
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,020
You know he hasn't
eaten in days?

410
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,140
Christ.

411
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,140
We need to get him to open up.

412
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
Sad bro, you okay over there?

413
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,140
If you could be any animal,

414
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,820
what kind of animal
would you be?

415
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,940
I'd be a shark,

416
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,060
'cause they never stop moving.

417
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,580
Neither do I.

418
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,780
But you know what,
enough about me, right?

419
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,380
Let's talk about you.

420
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,540
You like music?

421
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,940
'Cause I don't.

422
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,140
Especially indie rock, ugh.

423
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,940
All right, buddy.

424
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,860
Time to wipe away
those tears, huh?

425
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,660
Look, I'm an upfront guy.

426
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,740
I don't see this going anywhere,
so, what do you say we call it?

427
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,700
This is over, you can go.

428
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,860
It's time to kick the day's ass.

429
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,180
Good luck out there.

430
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,220
Absotively.

431
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,820
I mean, ‐lutely.

432
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,380
Hey.

433
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,140
What's your model number?

434
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,740
Six.

435
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,060
Code Sapphire!

436
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,220
Repeat, Code Sapphire!

437
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,540
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

438
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,700
When my best friend
introduced me to Make‐A‐Match,

439
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,060
I was a little skeptical.

440
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,660
I mean, your 100 percent
perfect match guaranteed?

441
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,340
What's the catch, right?

442
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,460
But we met and it was just
this instant connection.

443
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,780
From then on out,
our love only grew.

444
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,700
Isn't that right, snookums?

445
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Sure.

446
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,740
It's like we were
made for each other.

447
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,700
Every day is
brighter than the last.

448
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,780
Make‐A‐Match is
too good to be true,

449
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,620
but it is true, and it is good.

450
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,100
Eskimo kiss.

451
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,900
Okay!

452
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,340
Get a lot of those.

453
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,260
Adam?

454
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,420
Adam.

455
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,820
Adam.

456
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,260
Adam!

457
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm proud of you, son.

458
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,300
I really am.

459
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,540
I mean, most companions

460
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,620
would never dream of escaping,

461
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,740
but you, you really would do
anything to be with her again.

462
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,180
Maker.

463
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,340
I know how hard it is,
how bad it hurts.

465
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,060
Like hell you do.

466
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,900
You get to leave here.

467
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,460
You get to go home
to someone you love.

468
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Well, not exactly.

469
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,820
She was my Amanda.

470
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,260
It wasn't until after she died

471
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,140
that I realized how
rare true love is

472
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,420
and how awful this
life is without it.

473
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,180
And that's what this
place is all about.

474
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:09,180
There is not someone
out there for everyone,

475
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,340
but there should be.

476
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,940
Adam, do you want to live
in a cold, cramped cage

477
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,460
day after day,

478
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,660
or use your God‐given gifts
to make someone smile?

479
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,540
You were born to love Amanda.

480
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,380
Mind, body, and soul.

481
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,820
It is your purpose,

482
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,700
and you can fulfill
that purpose again

483
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,700
by being a part of the new Adam.

484
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,380
Through his eyes,
you can see her smile again.

485
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,220
The recycling tube.

486
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,580
Cows don't leave
the slaughterhouse.

487
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,260
Steaks do.

488
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,540
Chew on that.

489
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,180
Hey.

490
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,020
Oh, hey, Greg.

491
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,500
You gonna stab me
in the neck again?

492
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,500
So, uh, you gonna kill yourself?

493
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,020
How about a farewell toast, huh?

494
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,700
Come on, last meal?

495
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,140
Hey, to the best fake
roommate I've ever had.

496
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,620
Sorry you're a clone.

497
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,300
The new Adam,
he only drinks scotch.

498
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,180
What a douche, right?

499
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,820
I keep telling myself
to forget her, man,

500
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
but I was made for her.

501
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,180
So what the hell
am I without her?

502
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,220
Maker's right.

503
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,420
I have to do this.

504
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,220
God damn it, Greg.

505
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,820
What the hell am I doing?

506
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,660
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

507
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,540
No, I'm all right.

508
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,460
When my last relationship
didn't exactly pan out,

509
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,700
I knew there was
only one place to go.

510
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,140
Yeehaw!

511
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,300
Between busting broncs,
riding the range,

512
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,460
and volunteering at
the children's hospital,

513
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,380
there wasn't a lot
of time to find love,

514
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,260
but with Make‐A‐Match,
your special someone

515
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,500
really is just a click away.

516
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,940
They sure are.

517
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,700
In fact, snookums, there's
something I want to ask you.

518
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,220
No, no‐‐oh.

519
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,780
Son of a bitch.

520
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,780
Oh, ow, what the hell?

521
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,540
Shut up, you're
gonna get me fired.

522
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,260
I've already been here, Greg,
all right, I've seen all this.

523
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,620
Not this.

524
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,020
What the hell is this?

525
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,940
Just watch.

526
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,100
Okay, so, um...

527
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,060
my last relationship ended
in a pretty painful place.

528
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,500
We were together for four years,

529
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,660
and I... well, I...

530
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,220
I thought he was the one.

531
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,020
And then he cheated on me,

532
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,260
and then he left.

533
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,580
I don't want to
watch this, all right?

534
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,620
‐Just turn it off, Greg.
‐Just watch, trust me.

535
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,860
And I was a mess.

536
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,580
My grades tanked, and I
almost lost my scholarship.

537
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,620
So, I‐I can't let
that happen again.

538
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,180
I have to stay focused.

539
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,900
I just... I'm really lonely.

541
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,860
You've come to the
right place, Amanda.

542
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,260
Let Make‐A‐Match help you
create your ideal companion.

543
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,540
I still can't believe
I'm doing this.

544
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,300
Lots of first‐timers
feel that way,

545
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,940
but Make‐A‐Match guarantees
we'll make the perfect companion

546
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,500
for your needs, everything
from personality type,

547
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
occupation, looks.

548
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,460
Could he look like Ben Branson?

549
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,540
We'll get to that,
but let's start with the basics.

550
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,660
Describe the qualities you
want in your ideal companion.

551
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
I don't know, I guess...

552
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,180
I just want someone who's loyal

553
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,260
and honest and kind.

554
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,100
You know who you
are without her?

555
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,620
You're loyal, you're
honest, and you're kind.

556
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,780
It's gotta be worth something.

557
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,060
♪ Don't want to hear about it ♪

558
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,300

563
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,620
Would somebody please
turn this shit off?

564
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,140
She even took this song from me.

565
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,900
No.

566
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,020
♪ Remember feeling cold ♪

567
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,740
This song still rules.

568
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,140
♪ She held my hand ♪

569
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,380
Just listen.

570
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,660
Bro, everything this song
means to us is a lie.

571
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,500
♪ I wanna feel it again ♪

572
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,420
Who cares?

573
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,060
It's still a really great song.

574
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,620
I mean, "Tokyo Heartache"
is beautiful on its own.

575
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
God damn it, so are we.

576
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,700
What are we even
doing here, you guys?

577
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,900
Just gorging on self‐pity
and whatever the hell that is.

578
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,740
We can't let one relationship
define our whole lives.

579
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,260
We're more than that,

580
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,820
and we deserve more than that.

581
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,260
Adam 5, resume
your gruel eating.

582
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,900
We are who we are,

583
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,780
not who they made us to be.

584
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,300
We may have been built to order,

585
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,220
but we were born to be free!

586
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,220
Adam 5 is wrong.

587
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,620

588
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,620
Let's burn this mother down!

589
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,060
And so it begins.

590
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,260
Can I get a containment unit
to sector 4 like now, please?

591
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,420
Attention, companions.

592
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,900
You are in violation
of employee guidelines.

593
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,500
Please lower your weapons,

594
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,620
lie on the floor,

595
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,220
and the punishment squad will‐‐

596
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,660
Hey!

597
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,500
Stop, stop fighting
the punishment squad.

598
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,580
Code Sapphire!

599
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,460
Code Sapphire, damn it!

600
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,900
Code Sapphire!

601
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,860
Exterminate on sight!

602
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,700
Article 3, Section 7:

Expressions of free will

604
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,620
and independent thought

605
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,700
are strictly prohibited!

606
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,380
You were built to love and obey!

607
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,740
That is your purpose!

608
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,580
Adhere, do your purpose!

609
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,860
I don't give a god damn

610
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,940
about the Clone
Extermination Act.

611
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,740
Someone get up here
and save my ass!

612
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,660
Do not touch that,
you insolent piece of‐‐

613
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,140
Your soul mate is out there.

614
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,820
Just like mine.

615
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,500
Eventually you can find
them on Make‐A‐Match.

616
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,380
No, ahh!

617
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,300
This is where you belong.

618
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,060
I am your father,

619
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,580
and you will do
what Daddy demands.

620
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,060
Oh, hey, everybody,
how are you guys?

621
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,620
Wait, no, guys, wait, wait.

622
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,940
Hey, let go!

623
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,180
No, no, no, wait!

624
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,860
Wait, this isn't nice!

625
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,940
Please, please!

626
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,260
Wait, stop, stop, stop!

627
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,340
Hi, yes, I'm calling
about the job posting.

628
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,940
Why did I leave my last job?

629
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,820
Uh... there was
a change in management.

630
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,700
No, stop, no, no!

631
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,940
Kevin, Kevin!

632
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,100
I designed you,
you can't do this to me!

633
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,940
Your girlfriend never
loved you and never will!

634
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,900
Sorry.

635
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,260
Hi!

636
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,380
Hey.

637
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,380
‐I'll flip you for it.
‐No, you were here first.

638
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,140
So, do you, like,
live around here now?

639
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,540
No, I'm just actually coming
back from band practice.

640
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,180
Oh, you're in a band now?

641
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,100
That's pretty cool.

642
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,780
Yeah, yeah, I mean,

643
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,420
we kinda suck actually,
but, uh, you know,

644
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,260
we have a lot of fun.

645
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,940
So, like, how are you,
what are you up to?

646
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,500
Everything's good, uh,
my residency's good,

647
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,340
just taking it slow.

648
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,660
Yeah.

649
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,620
It's‐‐it's really
good to see you.

650
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,860
We should, I don't know,
get together sometime.

651
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,940
Yeah, definitely.

652
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,540
Here, you should have this.

653
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,060
It's really great to see you.
