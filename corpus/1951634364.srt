1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,217
<i>Can you hear them?</i>

2
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:46,294
<i>The night noises.</i>

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,091
<i>Mockingbird in the magnolia.</i>

4
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,392
<i>See the moss hanging</i>
<i>from the moonlight.</i>

5
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,769
<i>Fairly taste the night, can't you?</i>

6
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,471
<i>You're part of it, Pres,</i>
<i>and it's part of you.</i>

7
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,904
<i>Like I am.</i>

8
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,977
<i>You can't get away from us, Pres,</i>
<i>we're both in your blood.</i>

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,680
<i>This is the country you were born to,</i>
<i>the country you know and trust.</i>

10
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:17,321
<i>Your country, Pres.</i>
<i>Amy wouldn't understand.</i>

11
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,327
- <i>She'd think there would be snakes.</i>
- <i>Julie, please.</i>

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,488
<i>Oh, it isn't tame. It isn't like the North.</i>

13
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,065
<i>It's quick and dangerous,</i>
<i>but you trust it.</i>

14
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,432
<i>Remember how the fever mist smells</i>
<i>in the bottoms, rank and rotten...</i>

15
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:31,771
<i>...but you trust that, too,</i>
<i>because it's part of you...</i>

16
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:36,173
<i>...just as I'm part of you</i>
<i>and will never let you go.</i>

17
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,067
Yes, ma'am?

18
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:09,205
Hello. Where's Richard?

19
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:12,376
Oh, he's not in today.
Could I have your name, please?

20
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:15,376
Hack, Marilyn Hack. Stage 11.

21
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,315
I'm sorry, I-- You look familiar.
Are you an actor?

22
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,322
Thirty-two years.

23
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:27,121
Yeah. You were in that prison movie
with Sharon Stone.

24
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:28,586
No.

25
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,292
And you had that scene where you
punched that little girl in the face.

26
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,902
- Not me.
- That was a good movie.

27
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,301
You should have been in that movie.

28
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:40,169
I'm sure I should have been.
May I go in?

29
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,970
Sure. And you're all set.

30
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,475
Have a good one.

31
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,313
Yes.

32
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,852
- Got a chair open.
- Oh, Sandy, am I late?

33
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:55,513
- Oh, you're fine.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:55,692 --> 00:03:00,095
Per our conversation yesterday,
I think steer clear of the Sephardic tones.

35
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,130
Go for the A-one or the A-two,
the Ashkenazi palette.

36
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,460
I didn't mean to make
such a big deal out of it.

37
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:06,727
Oh, it's nothing.

38
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,497
I just thought I could look a little younger,
couldn't I?

39
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,833
- But it's okay.
- You are playing an older woman.

40
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,602
But I could be a woman
who's taken good care of herself.

41
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,404
Who has a terminal illness.

42
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,446
Up until then, I--
You're right. You're right.

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,016
Liz said I should get
my face stonewashed like her--

44
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:25,677
Oh, honey, are we aware of
what was on cable last night?

45
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,823
<i>Song for Reuben.</i>

46
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,721
Honey, you killed me.
When was the last time you saw that?

47
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,953
- I've never seen it.
- I was a total puddle.

48
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,723
I mean, complete waterworks.
They had to resuscitate me.

49
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,630
I'm never gonna watch it again unless my
wife takes up CPR or paramedics move in.

50
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,201
I was dying.

51
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,838
We were babies then, weren't we?

52
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,530
- Yes, we were.
- Babies.

53
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,608
You have such a gift,
you shouldn't just keep it to yourself.

54
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,337
- You should teach.
- Teach?

55
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:52,140
Teach acting.

56
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:53,773
I wouldn't dare.

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,010
You gotta give it away to keep it.
You can't just hold on to this.

58
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,551
Sandy, now you're mocking me.

59
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,189
You might as well say,
"Why don't you save the world?"

60
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,723
Well, maybe you could
with what you have to give.

61
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,388
Victor. Victor.

62
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:07,927
- Hey.
- Oh, Morley.

63
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,065
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing here?

64
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,530
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,602
- You wanted to have a meeting?
- Yes. Yesterday.

66
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,932
We had a meeting scheduled.
You didn't show.

67
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:20,269
Yesterday? No, no, no.
No, no. What the hell are you talking--?

68
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:22,775
I was in the office all day.
Why didn't you call--?

69
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,312
I called you.
You didn't return my message.

70
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,848
- Well, you got a minute now, because--?
- No, I have to go to the stage.

71
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,849
What did you wanna talk about?

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,147
A lot of things. But, look...

73
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,786
...I'm working for scale.

74
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,324
An actor of my stature,
40 years in the business?

75
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,461
There's no excuse for me
working for scale.

76
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,722
That's exactly what
I've been telling people.

77
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,889
- You should not be working for scale.
- Good.

78
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,036
But you know these producers,
they have their own take on things.

79
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,535
I'm on your side, all right? I'm your agent.

80
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,401
You are my number-one priority.

81
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:55,704
There is nothing more important to me
in my life than--

82
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,243
Than you. Excuse me.

83
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,903
Yeah.

84
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,550
Stranger, what do you say?

85
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,312
Nothing important. I'm here with a client.

86
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,749
- I gotta go.
- Hang on.

87
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:09,949
Good, because I gotta take this, Victor.
Look, stop by the office any time.

88
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,787
You know, we moved.

89
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,451
Yeah, talk.

90
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,756
I've done all my homework
on this guy.

91
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,093
I've established everything
there is to know...

92
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,599
...as far as his short-term objectives go.

93
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,534
I know that I wanna defend my sister,
console my father...

94
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,833
...and, ultimately, I feel a sense of guilt...

95
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,740
...for having abandoned my shipmates in
the Galápagos Islands to come home, but--

96
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,971
I think you're making this
too complicated.

97
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,042
This is not about,
"What is the actor thinking?"

98
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,813
You go and see a movie, you don't say,
"I wonder what he's thinking."

99
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:40,956
You gotta know.
Can you see the difference?

100
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,184
That's exactly my problem...
I wanna show you what I'm thinking...

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,022
...but there are certain things
that I'm not sure about.

102
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:50,290
- I love the fact that you did all this work.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,026
I think it will help you later,
but not on this movie...

104
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,829
...if you know what I mean.

105
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:59,439
Oh, my God. Doesn't he know about
her allergies? Here's what you have to do...

106
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,077
...you have to call me tomorrow--
Give me two secs.

107
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,703
--as soon as they get back
and let me know exactly what happened.

108
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,749
Bye. I'm so excited for you. Bye.

109
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,613
Hey. Sorry about that.

110
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:19,352
Miss Campanella, this publicity campaign
is to be run with military precision.

111
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,761
It is to be timely, quantifiable
and orotund.

112
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,491
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

113
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:28,569
I warn you. These are actors.

114
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:32,834
In every actor there lives a tiger, a pig,
an ass and a nightingale.

115
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,341
You never know
which one's gonna show up.

116
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,675
Don't make assumptions about the talent.
Don't assume that the talent can hear well.

117
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,808
Don't assume they know the plot.
Don't assume that they have living parents.

118
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,580
Don't assume that
they don't have a drop of Indian blood.

119
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,486
Question, do I look like
I have Indian blood?

120
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,757
- Not at all--
- Question...

121
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:56,558
...would it surprise you to learn
that I am one-eighth mighty Choctaw?

122
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,261
- It would--
- Question...

123
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:02,427
...would it astound you to learn
that here on the set, I am Corey Taft...

124
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,800
...but when I'm at home, I'm Jo-Jo?

125
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,571
Picture's up.

126
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,733
- Roll sound.
- Sound speed.

127
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,401
And dolly.

128
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,339
And action.

129
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,085
She's not coming.

130
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:23,355
She's not coming home
to see her sick mother.

131
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,517
She'll be home.

132
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,162
And you, Shmuel?

133
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,293
How long do you think you can stay?

134
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,634
I don't rightly know, Daddy.

135
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,794
Long as it takes, I expect.

136
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:39,135
The Navy's pretty accommodating
about things like illness...

137
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,137
...and death.

138
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,207
Your mama was so happy
to see you today.

139
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,646
Oh, I know she couldn't show it...

140
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,946
...but she was <i>kvelling</i> in her own way.

141
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:55,249
<i>She smiled,</i>
<i>but I don't know if she knew who I was.</i>

142
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:58,325
<i>Your coming home today</i>
<i>was a dang mitzvah, is what it was.</i>

143
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,395
It ain't no mitzvah, Daddy.
It's family.

144
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,327
It's what a son does for his mama.

145
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,865
And what does a daughter do
for her mama?

146
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,095
Your sister ain't been home
in nigh onto 12 years.

147
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:12,105
I don't give two hoots
what Doc Silverstein says.

148
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:17,178
It was your sister
that put your mama on her deathbed.

149
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,772
I know Rachel, Daddy.
And she'll come home to see Mama.

150
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,851
And she'll come home
because it's Purim.

151
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:27,251
We all know what that means to Mama...

152
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,448
...or meant.

153
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,454
Was that Rachel's voice I heard...

154
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,060
...or am I just going meshuga?

155
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,625
Mama!

156
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,033
And cut.

157
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,106
Okay, everybody,
stay where you are, please.

158
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,038
That's a cut.

159
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,008
I thought it was great.
It's fantastic.

160
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,306
I just have a couple of suggestions.

161
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,278
You guys were great.

162
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,510
Simon, the move is too fast,
so we're gonna have to slow it down...

163
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,281
...and I wanna add one thing,
so just watch for a second.

164
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,449
Marilyn, you had a swooning,
kind of a fainting move which I love.

165
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,527
It's great. I love the eyes rolling back.

166
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,392
I want you to add one more thing,
something more...

167
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,729
...almost from the bottom
of your womanhood to make it a:

168
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,365
So let-- Let me--

169
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,030
- Let me see what that would look like.
- Okay.

170
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,212
Exactly. And Brian, I love that thing.

171
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,716
Let me see that, just that flash.

172
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,047
No, not the intake of breath,
just the eyes flashing as if:

173
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,250
"Mommy is going now?"

174
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,520
So this is gonna be great.

175
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,186
Whitney? Hi there.

176
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,424
- Can I talk with you for a moment?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,500
Hi. You okay in there?

178
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,837
- Not interrupting a meal or anything?
- No.

179
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:53,135
Sorry I'm on this thing. I hurt my back.

180
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,869
- I fell over the side of an escalator.
- Great.

181
00:09:56,045 --> 00:10:01,108
Whitney, I have to tell you that
I have been a publicist for 20 years--

182
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,879
Fifteen and five strapped to the gurney.

183
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:09,991
I have never experienced
the hostility that this little picture...

184
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,493
...which I think is a charming show,
is engendering in the community.

185
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:18,532
I've had hang-ups.
I've had rude-- Rude responses.

186
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,330
- That's not what I'm getting on this one.
- That's not good. But you know what?

187
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,565
It's all right because we should go
a whole different angle...

188
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,800
- ...that no one's even thought of.
- Okay.

189
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,810
What if we go the angle of
let's play it down?

190
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,915
Let's tell people not to see our show?

191
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,677
- What about--?
- That's a dangerous sell, Whitney.

192
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,582
Put a big ad in the paper
and say, "Don't come."

193
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,382
Okay. True enough.

194
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,859
But as my proud ancestors,
the Choctaw, say...

195
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,122
...what we're dealing with
on this picture is:

196
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:56,198
Difficult to translate it.
Basically, we don't have a blanket.

197
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:59,170
We don't have a blanket for a--

198
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,940
It's a diuretic pony, I'm sorry--

199
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:06,809
Urinary-problem pony to piss on.
Excuse me.

200
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,875
- Give me one sec.
- Okay.

201
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,212
- Just look up.
- I just need one sec.

202
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,252
Can you do that without touching me?

203
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,781
You're fine.

204
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,186
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you.

205
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,828
- I'm almost set here. We're rolling.
- We're good?

206
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,426
Okay. Actors.

207
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,088
Actors acting.

208
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,023
- Good.
- Not right now.

209
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,397
- But, yeah.
- Oh, you don't think you are?

210
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,732
I mean, we're all acting all the time.

211
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,931
You know, but I'm acting differently.

212
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,742
So tell me, <i>Home for Purim</i>.

213
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,674
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>
- Yeah.

214
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,474
It's a period film.

215
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:42,845
- Yeah.
- I play Rachel Pischer.

216
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:45,814
I play Sam Pischer,
her brother, little brother.

217
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,512
Yeah.

218
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,755
But, which brings me to,
I heard a rumor that you two are:

219
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,889
- Yeah...
- Is that true?

220
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,497
- Depends on what you mean by:
- That's so cool.

221
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,360
- That's really cute.
- It is.

222
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,399
We are-- That-- It's a very--

223
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,630
It's a very interesting scenario,
playing siblings, living the life of lovers.

224
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,402
Well, tell me how you both
got started in acting as art?

225
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:12,240
I started doing standup
at Jerry Seltzer's Laff Emporium.

226
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,148
I was at Chortles, The Comedy Place.

227
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,447
And-- But no one really--

228
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,558
- No one really got it.
- I got it.

229
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,194
- I thought it was hysterical.
- What did she do?

230
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,091
She has a show. Tell her the title.

231
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:31,028
- <i>No Penis Intended.</i>
- Oh, I actually did hear, yes.

232
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,532
- What was that about?
- One critic described it as:

233
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:38,765
"A humorless romp
into Miss Webb's dysfunctional psyche."

234
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,341
- That's a humorless critic.
- That doesn't make sense.

235
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,943
- No.
- No.

236
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,720
Tuesday night. Eleven-ish.

237
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,515
Diamond Pawnbroker
on Sterling and Fifth.

238
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,853
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah. There was a break-in.

239
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,551
And did you make out the report?

240
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,529
- Did I what?
- You heard me, son!

241
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,689
Yes, I made out the report.

242
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,429
This report is an I-N270,
file number 79251J.

243
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:12,972
It is not a 35-DIB...

244
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,508
<i>...and should not be filed as such.</i>

245
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,873
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

246
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,948
That's a good clip. That was a good clip.

247
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,549
I loved that. I love the movie.

248
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,312
<i>Paper Badge</i>, I just loved it.
What a roller-coaster ride.

249
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,319
Nothing happened!

250
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,050
- Nothing happened in that clip.
- But that's the beauty--

251
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,627
Yes, it's about time in a film
nothing happened. It's about time.

252
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:37,232
It always, it's-- People get
to story points and have a little problem...

253
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,891
- ...and then they say, "Let's blow it up."
- I am not one for violence...

254
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,971
...but I would have given anything
to see a coffee pot explode.

255
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:45,936
What a brave choice the director made.

256
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,804
What a-- What a pioneer this guy is.
"Let's do nothing."

257
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,611
<i>Sometimes it looks like somebody hit you</i>
<i>with a frying pan and you enjoyed it.</i>

258
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,444
<i>But I have been hit.</i>
<i>Been hit a couple of times.</i>

259
00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:01,556
<i>You know, this film reminds me of your wife</i>
<i>and her ceramic turtle collection.</i>

260
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,749
Can't believe you keep this
in your purse.

261
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,520
- Well, you never know.
- Yeah.

262
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:11,257
Mr. Orfkin, for the third time,
Victor Allan Miller is waiting.

263
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,334
Oh, okay, just give me five seconds
and then send him in.

264
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,208
Right this way, Mr. Miller.

265
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,141
Now, you listen to me, Bernie,
you may run a studio...

266
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:28,716
...but I've got way too much respect for
my clients to put up with this kind of crap.

267
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,681
Hang on. Simi, hold all my calls.

268
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,220
I'm in a meeting with Victor Allan Miller.
I do not wanna be disturbed.

269
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,085
I gotta run. Ciao.

270
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,726
- Thank you, Simi.
- Hey, look at you.

271
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:41,294
- Look at you.
- You look fantastic.

272
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,591
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You should be stopping by more often.

273
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,065
- Really? I know, I know.
- Yes, you should.

274
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:50,399
But we're not filming today,
I thought I'd drop by, say hello...

275
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,234
...while my tires are being rotated.

276
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,000
- Well, let's talk movies.
- Okay.

277
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,667
Okay? Movies.

278
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,814
There's nothing going on
in movies right now for you.

279
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,314
I mean, it's just-- This is the thing.

280
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,679
There was just--
There's no interest, okay?

281
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,718
You're like a cold piece of toast.

282
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,789
I'm not gonna
candy-coat things for you...

283
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,859
...because if you want candy-coated
information, go someplace--

284
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,359
Go to one of the bigger agencies.
Okay? Because I--

285
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,395
My thing is say it like it is.

286
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:20,057
But right now I don't think film
is what we should be focusing on.

287
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:24,535
Quite frankly, I think television
is where we should be looking.

288
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:28,370
- I know, but television--
- Okay, we're on a couple of pilots. Listen.

289
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,772
Listen, Victor.

290
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,937
There are some very exciting things.
Joel?

291
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,912
<i>Singing the Blues.</i>

292
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:38,952
The dysfunctional Blue family
rises to a position of prominence...

293
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,783
...in a small New England town.

294
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:45,757
- Very, very powerful. And I--
- Was that a drama or a comedy?

295
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:49,295
It's a comedy because it's--
They're dysfunctional.

296
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,228
The whole family's dysfunctional.

297
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,096
The father doesn't know.
The kids don't know. Nobody knows!

298
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,033
Nobody knows what's going
because of the whole dysfunction.

299
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,470
And that's-- That's the beauty of that.

300
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:05,708
Simon, all I'm saying is I want it
to be brighter. That's all I'm saying to you.

301
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,850
I want to come in the room
and I wanna see an object like the--

302
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:14,081
Like a chair or a light or a sofa
and be able to make out what it is.

303
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:15,723
- Do you understand me?
- I get it.

304
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,483
If you get it, then you turn it up.

305
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,063
Look, I know my job is to translate
your vision into the real world, okay?

306
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,131
But the problem is, I don't see a vision.

307
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,062
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

308
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,261
Do you know how tight my aperture is
right now? Have you any idea?

309
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:32,339
If you're being a smart-ass,
I'm gonna put you across my knee.

310
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,805
I want it to be bright.

311
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:37,309
It's bright. It's brighter than
Stephen bloody Hawking in here.

312
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:40,141
- Up, up, up. Just turn it up for me.
- All right. Fine.

313
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:43,250
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're the boss. You're the boss.

314
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,410
- Whole way.
- That's all there is.

315
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,851
- There you go. Look at that. Lovely.
- I love this.

316
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,548
I love it because I look and I go,
"Hey, it's a room."

317
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,660
It's a sports stadium, is what it is now.

318
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,254
You're so European.

319
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,331
There's something about you
that's just foreign.

320
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,627
Have you ever been to--?
You travel a lot or...?

321
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:04,000
No, I've-- I haven't been
out of the United States, actually.

322
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,967
Who is your--?
Who is your acting coach again?

323
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,905
- Leonid Kazovskich.
- Oh, she's good.

324
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,205
- She's amazing.
- He, it's a he.

325
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,510
Wasn't she the one that made her students
have nervous breakdowns?

326
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,117
- He, and yeah.
- Oh, it was a he.

327
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,618
It wasn't really necessarily
a nervous breakdown...

328
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,552
...it was more of, you know,
he would just break you down.

329
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,989
- You know, get rid of everything.
- Well, they're--

330
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,652
- That's not the thing out here, is it?
- It's a breath of fresh air out here.

331
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,265
- It's really not.
- At least that's intense and real.

332
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,424
I mean, out here it's like
magazine people.

333
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,365
Here it's all soda pop and blue jeans.

334
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,700
Excuse me, guys. Fifteen minutes,
we'll be ready for you on set.

335
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:41,468
Could you instead of
referring to me as "guys"...

336
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,441
...could you refer to me by
my character name, Mary Pat?

337
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,241
- Sure.
- Great.

338
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,677
- Sure.
- That's great.

339
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,478
- I apologize.
- No, no. Apology accepted.

340
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,519
It helps me. I appreciate it.

341
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,626
Move that up about another 5 feet.
Yeah, straight on up. That's good.

342
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,560
- How's it going, mate?
- Good.

343
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,132
Excuse me. Sorry.

344
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,793
- So much food and nothing to eat.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

345
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,769
What waste.

346
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,642
Ever notice, like, a kind of
a weird smell around here?

347
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,678
It's like-- It's just in this area.
It's kind of a...

348
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,245
I don't know. Maybe it's me.

349
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,318
Well, my father would say,
"A fox smells his own hole first."

350
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:30,415
Simon...

351
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:37,364
...I need to ask you a question,
but I don't want the answer.

352
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,996
I'll ask it anyway,
but stop me if you can, all right?

353
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:44,401
Stop me. Stop me.
How does the film look?

354
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,939
No. Stop me again. How do I look?

355
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,577
- You didn't stop me.
- No. I can stop you now.

356
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,736
- You look absolutely amazing.
- Okay, good.

357
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,041
I'm sorry I asked.
I didn't mean to bother you.

358
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,444
- No, please.
- No, I mean...

359
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:58,882
That's enough. I don't need any--
That's good. I'm glad to hear it.

360
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,578
- Oh, you know what?
- So it's good?

361
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:05,693
I forgot to mention. My girlfriend
was on the Internet last weekend...

362
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:08,623
...and she was checking out
her specialty sites.

363
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,925
Anyway, she got bored with that
and ended up...

364
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,227
...on one of the movie gossip things,
you know.

365
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,601
Filmtattle.com
or one of those celluloid...

366
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,742
- Do you ever go on those?
- I wouldn't know.

367
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,571
Well, anyway,
the long and the short of it is...

368
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,010
...some bloke got on the set...

369
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:31,118
...and he reckons there could be an
Academy Award nomination in the offing.

370
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,686
And more specifically,
he said that he thought...

371
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:37,121
...your performance
was likely to get recognized.

372
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,020
You know, come the announcements.

373
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:44,296
Anyway, thought I'd just share that,
for whatever it's worth.

374
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,061
See you out there.

375
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,065
All right, everybody, back to work.

376
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,839
- Whitney Taylor Brown.
- Yes.

377
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,240
That's a lot of names.

378
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,312
So you're a producer.

379
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,850
A woman producer.

380
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,185
What does a producer do?

381
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,984
Well, as my assistant, Lincoln,
can tell you...

382
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,956
...there's a lot of telephone calls
and, you know...

383
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:19,624
...lots of getting out the wallet and paying
for sometimes ridiculous things like--

384
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,530
Like snacks.

385
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,232
Let's go back
to the beginning of your career.

386
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,603
You are-- Your family is
in the diaper business?

387
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,972
Yes. Brown Diaper Service.

388
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,638
And what exactly did they do
with the diapers?

389
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:39,185
Well, they picked up the diapers
in big trucks...

390
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,687
...and then we washed them...

391
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,383
...and then gave them back
to the people.

392
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,285
That's neat. Thank you so much.

393
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:52,055
- We're done? We're done.
- Yeah, we're done.

394
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,895
All of it's done.

395
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,264
Don't you wanna know more about me?

396
00:20:56,705 --> 00:21:00,232
Yeah, but we-- I don't--
We don't have time right now, so...

397
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,378
Thank you, though,
for talking to us and...

398
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,776
I don't want anyone to know
what I look like from the back...

399
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,679
...so I don't want anyone to film my exit.

400
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,978
Okay, it's off. It's not even on.

401
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,054
All right.

402
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,154
First of all, it's been so creative for us.

403
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,886
Every aspect of the movie,
I think, is represented.

404
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:22,257
I hope you like it as much
as we liked doing it.

405
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:25,298
The first, of course,
is a sort of Norman Rockwell.

406
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,196
It's America. It's the family eating.

407
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,969
You have the title in the Hebraic letters.

408
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,338
All right, well, my first instinct says
it reminds me of my family.

409
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,172
- Which we--
- And I hate my family.

410
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,975
And I think a lot of people
might feel that way.

411
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:46,916
I think that's such a fascinating take
on what we've done...

412
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:51,185
...because we've gotten away
from the family...

413
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,725
...and we make it this.

414
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,427
Man, that one is scary.

415
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:57,360
You got disembodied heads.

416
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:00,968
You know what I like?
I like when it's misleading in a good way.

417
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,763
This looks like a horror film.

418
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:06,305
It's horrifying, but like,
it's horrifying like a horror movie.

419
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,308
Someone's killed their children
and made them into cookies...

420
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,002
...and I wanna go see that.

421
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:13,340
Oh, okay. This was also trying to be...

422
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:17,076
...a kind of family kind of presentation,
kind of a comedy thing, but--

423
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,881
What's creepy about this one is how
y'all made it where they eyes follow you.

424
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:24,253
That's scary.
Everywhere you go, they follow you.

425
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,360
You actually do want that in a poster...

426
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,258
...because when you set the posters
in the theater...

427
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,400
...as people walk by, you want that,
you actually do want that.

428
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,432
I'm really glad that you picked that up.

429
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,128
That's what we're trying to do
with both the visual...

430
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:39,205
...and maybe even something
with the eyes.

431
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:42,309
And, of course, this is just a gay romp.

432
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:45,241
- It's a party. It's fun.
- You also see the wistfulness here.

433
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,177
What's good about this is it's real.

434
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,476
It's very real.
I've been to a party before...

435
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:53,644
...where people's heads
were actually on the balloons.

436
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:56,484
I wanna go to this party.
This is a party I would go to...

437
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:59,354
- Okay, great.
- ...because it's got balloons with colors.

438
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,262
This is so stupid and I'm sorry
to bother you, but I just wondered...

439
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,025
There's something on the Internet.

440
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,796
Somebody had been on the set,
here, at <i>Home for Purim</i>...

441
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,600
...and brought up the idea
of there being...

442
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:18,769
...a possibility of a nomination
for an Oscar.

443
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:22,179
It's nothing, no big--
It's a big deal. Who cares?

444
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,183
I mean, it's no big deal.
It's nothing. Forget it.

445
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,445
- Forget I said it.
- Okay.

446
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,384
- I just thought, because...
- All right.

447
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,117
...if you Googled Simon Whitset,
apparently, you could--

448
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:35,127
Okay, this is a rumor that's out there
on the Internet and you think it's nothing.

449
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:41,031
Tell you what. I'm gonna look into it.
This could be very interesting indeed.

450
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:45,162
Okay, quick question. The Internet.
That's the one with e-mail, right?

451
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,740
- Yes.
- Got it. I'm on it.

452
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:53,338
- Why, did I get--? I had some salad.
- You're good.

453
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,483
Philip. Lane, Lane,
Philip, Philip, Philip.

454
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,447
- Hi.
- Hello.

455
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:01,385
- Tell me. <i>Purim</i>. Writers.
- <i>Purim.</i>

456
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,716
- You're writers.
- Yes.

457
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:04,415
<i>Home for Purim.</i>

458
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:08,757
This is probably the most personal play
that we've written.

459
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,125
There are elements of my family life.

460
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,063
Purim is strictly your territory.
I didn't know what it was.

461
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,534
I thought Purim meant "a face."
Cute little Purim.

462
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,639
- That's a <i>punim</i>.
- You straightened me out.

463
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,968
It's the one in the shack,
where the shrubs--?

464
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:24,112
No, no, no, that's <i>Sukkot, Sukkot</i>.

465
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,611
No, Purim, a lot of people
don't really know.

466
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:31,411
I mean, I didn't know that much
about Purim, but I like Purim a lot.

467
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,714
And it's got a tremendous amount
of symbolic...

468
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,222
...and metaphorical resonance
wrapped up in there.

469
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,223
- You like writing?
- We love to write.

470
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,862
- That's great.
- We would write if they didn't pay us.

471
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,691
And guess what, they usually don't.

472
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,730
- Some--
- That's why we're still teaching.

473
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,892
We write just enough
to keep us in teaching.

474
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,468
- Put it that way.
- Yeah, yeah.

475
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:52,471
- Let me just throw something at you.
- Okay, okay.

476
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:56,270
Philip, what is your favorite place?

477
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,071
I'd say Chicago.

478
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,716
Lane?

479
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,780
Under my mother's dining room table.

480
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:13,260
She's here, Daddy!
She's coming up the walk!

481
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:22,998
- Hey, sis.
- Hey, little brother.

482
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,071
Look at you, all decked out
in Uncle Sam's finest.

483
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,904
Well, if Tojo wants a fight,
a fight he's gonna get.

484
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:33,540
- Hello, Daddy.
- Ruchel.

485
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,682
My, my, you're a sight for sore eyes.

486
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:46,152
Daddy, Sam, I'd like you to meet my...

487
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:50,729
My friend Mary Pat Hooligan.

488
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,037
- Well, welcome to our home.
- Thank you.

489
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:57,330
How's Mama?

490
00:25:58,506 --> 00:25:59,871
Rachel?

491
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,975
Mama.

492
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:09,979
We're late, I think.

493
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,813
It was nice of you
to keep my sister company on this trip.

494
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,957
I love Rachel.
We don't spend a lot of time apart.

495
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,684
Do you two live near each other?

496
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:26,163
Well, if you call sleeping in the same bed
"near each other," I suppose we do.

497
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,734
Well, that just don't make no sense.

498
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,171
Sam, I love your sister.

499
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,434
- And cut.
- That's a cut!

500
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,510
- Okay, that was the best one.
- Hold it.

501
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,771
Okay, all right. Yeah.

502
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,074
Everybody stay where they are, okay?

503
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,918
I thought that was great.
Victor, come on out.

504
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:48,484
I thought that was fantastic.
I mean, you know.

505
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,921
I didn't think it was exactly
as it should be.

506
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:54,061
- Stinks.
- Tell me what's going on.

507
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,390
Okay, I'm just not feeling--
I'm not feeling it.

508
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:59,897
I feel like it's ambiguous.
I don't think it's clear that I'm gay.

509
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,403
I mean, I got the look,
but I just think that we're...

510
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,630
- ...pussy-footing around--
- Excuse me?

511
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,638
- That makes you sound gay.
- If I say--?

512
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,471
Let me approach this a different way,
because you're all--

513
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,842
There's obviously something that
isn't jelling about what we just did.

514
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,882
- I could be blind. I mean, this walks in--
- No, I understand.

515
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:21,419
Okay, time, time.
Look, this is just... It's just paper.

516
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:27,721
It's paper and they put a letter and a name
and a word and then they called it a script.

517
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,261
But you know what? I'd be--

518
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:31,797
Let's toss this away.
Let's start from scratch.

519
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,202
- Oh, Jesus.
- What would you do?

520
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,235
Okay.

521
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,636
- Where's Whitney? Where's Whitney?
- We don't care about the script.

522
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,173
Here's what I'd like to do.

523
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,335
And I don't mean to be the leader,
but I am.

524
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,345
So let's follow me around a circle.
You follow around.

525
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:50,313
And we kept going.
And remember the mumbling we did.

526
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,386
My name is Sam Pischer.
I'm stationed in the Galápagos Islands.

527
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:55,455
And we stop. It's like musical chairs...

528
00:27:56,324 --> 00:28:00,090
Are you seeing this? What is this about?
What is this about?

529
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,694
Why is the script on the floor?

530
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,763
- It's upsetting.
- What's this about?

531
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,527
You're another person. You're Debbie.
You're Brian. Say those lines.

532
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:08,794
- I'm Vic?
- Say her lines.

533
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,062
- Say his lines.
- I'm Sam.

534
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,570
- Just a couple of words.
- We have to speak--

535
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,936
Well, I'm gonna talk to Jay.
I'm gonna get him.

536
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,771
- Lincoln.
- Yeah, yeah, Miss Brown?

537
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,711
- Lincoln, I need to talk to Jay right away.
- All right. That director dude, right?

538
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,213
- Yes.
- All right.

539
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,784
I'm gonna shoot this again
and there's no script.

540
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,421
I don't even want to know
what's happening. What?

541
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,022
Whitney wants to see you.

542
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,091
- I'll be out in a second.
- No, she needs to see you right now.

543
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,252
Okay. I'll be right back.
We're gonna continue this.

544
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,594
I want you to do some exercise.
All of you guys, you pick this up, okay?

545
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:42,635
- Let's go.
- I'm Mary Pat Hooligan...

546
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:48,669
- Jay? Here.
- ...I'm Irish and I'm a freaking lesbo.

547
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,501
- I just want to-- Hi. Hi.
- Jay.

548
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,873
So, what's going on?

549
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:55,607
Well, Philip Kuntz and Lane Iverson
both have a problem.

550
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:58,218
- Koontz.
- Koontz.

551
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:03,016
We were a little bit disturbed when
we saw you throw the script on the floor...

552
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,751
...because the actors were asking
legitimate questions--

553
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:09,454
It was a way to motivate them.
It was a way to get them thinking:

554
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,065
- "Oh, <i>spilkes</i>, something happening."
- Hey, look.

555
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,997
I don't want to throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

556
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,138
You'll get a wet, critically-injured baby.

557
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:19,330
That's not what
you want to put your name on.

558
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,496
- Good point.
- Well-put.

559
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,108
I think you've lost your minds.

560
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:24,507
I don't think you understood
what was happening.

561
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,239
Those exercises,
the things we were doing, the thing--

562
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:29,713
You need to light a fire under an actor--

563
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,045
It seemed like you were
dodging the questions...

564
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,552
...the legitimate questions
the actors were asking.

565
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:36,849
- Lane?
- You were saying, "I don't really know."

566
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,515
Didn't say it out loud. In here.

567
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,821
"I don't know, but I'll have them
walk in a circle and change hats."

568
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:44,089
- But what about me?
- Lane.

569
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,494
I am not dodging your questions.
I'm trying to--

570
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,660
We're having a conversation here,
all right?

571
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,272
I'm just saying,
don't provoke the situation.

572
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,032
Me, don't provoke?

573
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:57,839
We didn't walk on in the middle
of the scene and say, "Don't do this."

574
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,206
- Yes, we did.
- We did.

575
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,711
Right.

576
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,544
Marilyn--

577
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,085
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- Every time.

578
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:10,247
I'm sorry. I wanted to let you know
you're wrapped for the day.

579
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,758
- No, I have another scene.
- They just said that you're all done.

580
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:16,624
Of course they did.
Next time, they'll tell me.

581
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,390
I'll make sure they do. I'm sorry.

582
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,295
- And your name is...?
- Sam.

583
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:23,562
No, it isn't. No, it isn't.
That's not what I've been calling you.

584
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,467
I know, you've been calling me Brian.

585
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,403
- Because your name is Brian.
- It's Sam.

586
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,102
I'm so sorry, Sam. I love you.
I love--!

587
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,678
- Sam.
- Sam! I love Sam!

588
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,836
Thank you.

589
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,710
- Sorry, Sam.
- It's okay.

590
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,284
You work the computers
in the AD wagon, I've noticed.

591
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,580
- Yes.
- So you know about these movie sites...

592
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,417
...where they go to sets
and talk about them on computers.

593
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,422
- Sure.
- Why am I telling you this?

594
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,289
But it seems my name
has been mentioned...

595
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,556
...with reference to an Oscar nomination.

596
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,199
- Wow, that's exciting.
- Oh, big deal.

597
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:56,269
- That's exciting.
- But-- Yeah, so I just...

598
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,201
You might have known
or seen such a thing.

599
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,467
Would you like me to do
some research for you?

600
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:02,632
- If you want to.
- Sure.

601
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,641
- Wonderful.
- I'll let you know tomorrow.

602
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,507
- Big deal, but if you can--?
- Okay.

603
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:07,875
- Say your name again.
- Sam.

604
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,641
- Sam. Thank you, Sam.
- My pleasure.

605
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,182
- Thank you, Sam.
- Okay.

606
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:12,649
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

607
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,153
Oscar. It would be in reference to Oscar.
Are you still there, Sam?

608
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,189
- I'm here. I'll look it up. Oscar.
- Okay.

609
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,348
- Wonderful.
- Great.

610
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:21,688
- If you can. Not a big deal. Who cares?
- Okay.

611
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,533
Oh, Marilyn, wow. Okay.

612
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,670
No, stop it. Stop it, dear.
Let it go, let it go.

613
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:38,509
Don't think about it.

614
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,746
Oh, an Oscar. Oh, okay.

615
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:46,978
No, thank you. Just-- I just love the work.

616
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,056
It's enough for me. It really is.
It really is. Really is.

617
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:52,749
It's enough. It's enough. It's plenty.

618
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:56,021
Oh, God, it's plenty.
You're lucky to be alive.

619
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:00,163
<i>And now, Chuck Porter and Cindy Martin.</i>

620
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,133
Well, the much-awaited,
star-studded Hollywood epic...

621
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,670
<i>...The Pride of Plymouth Rock</i>
opens soon...

622
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,469
...and this is one film every patriotic
American has been waiting for.

623
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:10,941
I'll tell you what, Chuck.

624
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:14,377
Its two megastars,
Cynthia Chapman and Jim Beyman...

625
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,881
...may command the highest salaries
in Hollywood...

626
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:22,045
...but can all that money buy them
a coveted Best Actor and Actress award?

627
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:29,225
Oh, look, Daniel.

628
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:33,328
Gaze upon this bountiful
and beauteous place.

629
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,200
The Lord hath surely guided us
to this New World...

630
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,899
...so that we may till its fertile soil
and plant the seeds of a new life.

631
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:44,941
Oh, Daniel, let us seize
this glorious moment, now and forever...

632
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:48,640
...and commit ourselves to do his service
and to love each other, you and I.

633
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,276
I love you, Sarah.

634
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,411
And I you.

635
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:02,629
<i>Wow, well, I say, dust off the mantle,</i>
<i>Jim and Cynthia.</i>

636
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:04,662
<i>This could be your year.</i>

637
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:07,892
<i>That film has a budget of almost</i>
<i>300 million.</i>

638
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,438
<i>My gosh, just how much does</i>
<i>a funny-looking hat cost anyway?</i>

639
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,143
- Liz.
- Hey! Hi!

640
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:21,039
You look so good.
I'm so glad you could make it tonight.

641
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:22,739
- Oh, me too.
- Thank you.

642
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,385
I finally get off early and you're here.
I'm so happy.

643
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:28,750
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

644
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:35,028
Thanks. You know, I'm glowing
because I have very big news.

645
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,185
What?

646
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:40,300
First, you're never gonna guess
who I ran into today.

647
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,968
I went to Shoe Barn
because I wanted to get a strappy sandal...

648
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,232
...something open-toed and kind of sexy,
kind of loose.

649
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:51,105
And you'll never believe
who was the salesman.

650
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,707
Take a wild guess.

651
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,846
Your gynecologist.

652
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:59,976
No. Zach. From <i>Sisters of Stone</i>?

653
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,122
- Remember?
- I'll never remember, but go on.

654
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,350
He's running naked through tombstones.
He finds out he's gay.

655
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,086
- It's a full moon and he--
- Sort of. Is he still acting?

656
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:12,494
No, he's selling shoes,
but we just had this incredible connection.

657
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,658
He was cradling my instep
and looked me in--

658
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:16,326
Oh, the one with the breath.

659
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,102
The one with the breath.
How was it today?

660
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:22,538
He'd have to have had his guts removed
and his teeth to have it better.

661
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,735
- Does he still stink?
- He doesn't, he's fine.

662
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:26,379
God, that was the smell of sin.

663
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:30,848
It was. But he's-- So he looks good?

664
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,046
Yeah. Yeah, he looks good.

665
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:36,349
Well, he was at your feet.

666
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,020
Not up...

667
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:41,661
It's a good thing
he's not a hat salesman.

668
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:46,166
I had some wonderful news today too.

669
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,394
What?

670
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,867
What is it?

671
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,872
I think I might get nominated
for an Oscar.

672
00:34:56,043 --> 00:35:00,673
Oh, my God! Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

673
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,612
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

674
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,684
I could see it. I could see us.

675
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:11,182
A little piece of land,
far away from here...

676
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,554
...you teaching acting class
somewhere in town--

677
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,162
- No, that's too far.
- What?

678
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,821
The fantasy had gone too far?

679
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:27,741
It wasn't the apple in the tree...

680
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:31,936
...but the pear on the ground
that caused all the trouble.

681
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,369
Morning, kids.

682
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,379
- Hi, Corey.
- Hi, Corey.

683
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,542
- Big day?
- For her it is.

684
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,653
She shoots her big scene with Marilyn.

685
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,413
Big day for all of you.

686
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:47,891
No. I have, like, two exteriors with Victor
and then I'm done.

687
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,422
You haven't heard the rumor?

688
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,723
No.

689
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:00,171
Do you kids like to use
the World Wide "Interweb"?

690
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,774
The Internet?

691
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,172
- It's the Internet.
- Yep.

692
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,746
We do. We know what it is.

693
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:12,011
Well, there was an item
published on the--

694
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:13,676
Internet.

695
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:18,815
--and it mentions very favorably
this little picture...

696
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:23,361
...and in particular, your colleague,
Marilyn Hack.

697
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,865
- Good for her.
- That's so great.

698
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:31,630
In further "particularlyness,"
a possible Oscar nomination.

699
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:33,439
- For Marilyn?
- For Marilyn Hack.

700
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,632
That's so cool.

701
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,640
- For <i>Home for Purim</i>?
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>

702
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,302
- That's great.
- That's great for her.

703
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:41,978
Chew upon that.

704
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:44,413
- See you, Corey.
- Yup.

705
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,817
--days in this scene...
- Oh, my, this is too much.

706
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,253
- ...I need to know the script count...
- Too much.

707
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:52,221
What? What do you have?

708
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:56,193
I told you there was a blurb
on the Internet.

709
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:57,797
- Oh, did you get it?
- I did.

710
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,366
- Tell me.
- That lovely AD printed it off.

711
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:03,196
- They can do that now.
- On his own!

712
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,236
- On some connection?
- He has a machine...

713
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:08,068
- ...and a cord right out of his computer.
- To a printer?

714
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,800
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Amazing.

715
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,639
And now I have it here on paper.
Real paper.

716
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,207
It's short, but it's powerful.

717
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,975
"Marilyn shines in <i>Home for Purim</i>.

718
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,381
The role of Esther,
like her biblical namesake...

719
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:21,714
...is laden with the riches
of complexity...

720
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:25,450
...and guilt as old as the parchment
on which the Purim story was written.

721
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,651
- Yes?
- In the hands of anyone less capable...

722
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,259
...the casting would be criminal.

723
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:33,423
But Marilyn Hack is delivering a performance
sculpted by tools...

724
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:36,798
...in whose hands only the most
experienced craftsmen should handle...

725
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:40,668
...a performance that could only be
described as Oscar-worthy."

726
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,277
Hello. Well, how about
getting it right, for once?

727
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,742
- It's very nice.
- It's crazy.

728
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:47,676
He's right. I could have written that.

729
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,440
- Did you?
- I could have.

730
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,414
Could have been your nocturnal labors.

731
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:54,315
What's my nom de plume?
Remind me.

732
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:57,988
It's just a bit silly about the Oscar stuff,
don't you think?

733
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,559
Silly? It's the backbone of this industry.

734
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:02,719
An industry noted
for not having a backbone.

735
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,297
The problem is, there's not enough
pageantry anymore.

736
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:07,331
People want pizzazz,
they want pageantry.

737
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,028
They want more red carpet, not less.
And what's wrong with that?

738
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:16,203
And settle in. Roll sound. Okay. Rain up.

739
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,509
And action.

740
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,315
The air is as heavy
as a magnolia blossom...

741
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,527
...with the weight of a thousand teardrops
on its petal.

742
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:41,926
If you're waiting for forgiveness, Rachel,
I don't believe I can muster the strength.

743
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,498
It don't much matter now, Mama.

744
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:51,772
It don't much matter who forgives who.

745
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,147
What?

746
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,654
What did I do that was so wrong?

747
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:04,620
Wanting my daughter to grow up
to be a mama of her own...

748
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,953
...with a houseful of babies
and a decent man...

749
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,688
...to cherish and take care of?

750
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:12,560
You just didn't want the boys around,
Rachel.

751
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,167
What kind of girl
doesn't want to meet a nice fella?

752
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:19,632
I only invited the best ones over,
the ones whose daddies were professionals.

753
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,874
There wasn't a nebbish in the group.

754
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:25,911
But you wouldn't have it.
You wouldn't have any of it.

755
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,011
And so you ran.

756
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,780
You ran and tore a chapter
out of your family's life...

757
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:38,049
...and a piece out of my heart.

758
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:42,355
I was screaming, Mama,
but you couldn't hear me.

759
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,355
And you couldn't see me
for who I was.

760
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,661
I didn't want your life.
I didn't wanna be in a kitchen...

761
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:52,465
...with the brisket or the fish balls
or the kreplach or the <i>kugel</i>...

762
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,632
...or go out with boys that turn into men
I don't want to marry.

763
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,300
It was all <i>fershteit</i>.

764
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:59,542
I am not you, Mama.

765
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:06,252
I am me, Rachel Pischer.

766
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:11,185
And, oh, yes, I did meet a nice fella.

767
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:15,692
Her name is Mary Pat.

768
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:24,664
<i>Oy gevalt</i>, what have I done?

769
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:35,714
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Corey.

770
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:38,818
Excuse me. Miss Hack, Miss Hack,
permission to speak with you?

771
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:42,114
- Of course. How are you on this fine day?
- I'm very well, thank you.

772
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:45,918
I just got off the phone with
the segment producer from <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

773
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:49,392
Guess who they want on their show
tomorrow morning.

774
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,556
- Oh, Corey, you think you're ready?
- No, not me. You.

775
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:55,966
- Marilyn Hack.
- No.

776
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,298
You and Victor Allan Miller.

777
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,871
- Oh, Corey.
- Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:07,402
You have no idea how difficult it has been
to get people on the phone.

779
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:08,946
- It was worth it.
- Thank you.

780
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,708
Corey, good job.

781
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,853
See what a little buzz
can do in this town?

782
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,218
Just a little bit of buzz, a little bit of
fairy dust and... you're off to the races.

783
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,196
Oh, Victor, incidentally, those radio
auditions have been changed to Friday.

784
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,628
What do you mean, auditions?
Hold on.

785
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,767
- A banana and water, please.
- All right.

786
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:28,993
- You?
- I don't audition.

787
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,764
- I'm gonna have the corned beef.
- Thank you.

788
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:34,874
You told me I don't have to
read for commercials. You said that.

789
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:38,239
I told them that. I said,
"My client should not have to read for this.

790
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,676
I think he's proven himself
time and time again."

791
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:44,181
- Excellent. So I've got the gig?
- Well, if you read for it.

792
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,080
- Why--?
- I think reading is important.

793
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,847
I don't understand why,
after 40 years in the business...

794
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:52,925
...I have to read for a freaking radio
commercial in freaking Oregon.

795
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,893
Victor, if you go in and audition, okay,
what you're saying to these guys is:

796
00:41:57,064 --> 00:42:00,465
"Hey, fellas, I know I don't have to
audition for this, but you know what?

797
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:05,196
I'm going to audition for it, just to show you
why I shouldn't have to audition for it."

798
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:08,830
Just do me a favor. Let me be
the last person in, if I'm going to do this--

799
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:11,170
- Gentlemen, pardon the interruption.
- Hi, Corey.

800
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:15,372
Victor, the booking.
Tomorrow morning. <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

801
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,450
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i> for Victor?
- For Victor Allan Miller.

802
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,587
- Which is what?
- Which is a morning show.

803
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,153
<i>Wake Up L.A.</i> Wake up.

804
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:26,316
- I don't have a TV, Morley, as you know--
- Doesn't have a TV. Cherish this client.

805
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:29,485
One hour infotainment. Variety.
Cohosts: male, female.

806
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:32,188
Happy addition tomorrow morning,
you and Marilyn Hack.

807
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,194
- Victor, fantastic.
- Congratulations.

808
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:35,494
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

809
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:38,229
This ship's turning around.
Thought you'd like to know.

810
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,396
That is so fantastic.

811
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,974
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>
- Did I not say--? Am I a mind reader?

812
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,044
- What do you mean?
- <i>Home for Purim.</i> I predicted it.

813
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:48,408
I said, "This is the one.
This is the vehicle."

814
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,106
Morley, you told me not to do it.

815
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:55,143
And so a high of 79 in Los Angeles
with a low of 67.

816
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,689
Long Beach is 77 and a low of 65.

817
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:03,558
Anyway, all around, it's gonna be
a pretty hot day and not very much wind.

818
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,722
Where does wind come from?

819
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,231
Where does wind come from?

820
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,732
I don't know. It just blows around.

821
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,695
That was a complete non sequitur.

822
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:15,808
We won't worry about it.
We'll go over to Skip and Sanchez.

823
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:19,104
Hello, Skip. Hello, Sanchez.
You look nice today, Sanchez.

824
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,975
Well, thank you very much, Monkey.

825
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:24,584
Oh, Sanchez, if only...
If only it was your hand and not Nina's.

826
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:26,982
- That's so rude.
- Get in line, get in line.

827
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:29,213
- He always does this.
- Good God.

828
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,225
All right. We've got a couple of wonderful
actors coming up on the show this morning.

829
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:37,523
Miss Marilyn Hack
and Victor Allan Miller.

830
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:39,822
You know, these two are good.

831
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,629
Very tough to do a morning show,
this chitchatty kind of thing.

832
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:48,764
But these two have an intellect
behind whatever it is they're doing there.

833
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,341
Oh, Skip's a good guy.

834
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:53,207
He and I worked on
<i>The Jerry Jeckel Show</i> together.

835
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,974
I can't speak for the painted whore
next to him.

836
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,684
Hi, hi, good morning.

837
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:01,286
In about 30 seconds,
at the end of this break...

838
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:03,218
- ...you guys are gonna go on.
- Okay.

839
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,689
Now, the seating arrangement
is Mr. Miller is in the middle...

840
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,658
- ...and Miss Heck is next to him.
- Hack.

841
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,765
- Okay, so I'm--?
- Right, so let me show you.

842
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,958
- Mr. Miller is in the middle...
- Yes.

843
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:17,535
- ...Miss Heck is next to him.
- Hack.

844
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:19,366
- She's on first?
- That's all right.

845
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,599
- As long as they have the name right.
- Yeah.

846
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:24,710
- And we're back. <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

847
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:28,712
- We have two fabulous veteran actors...
- Yes.

848
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:32,784
...that have joined us to talk
about their new movie, <i>Home for</i>--

849
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:33,942
- We want to--
- <i>Purim.</i>

850
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:35,110
- <i>Purim.</i>
- <i>Purim.</i>

851
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:37,985
- That's a Jewish holiday, correct?
- It is a Jewish holiday.

852
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,184
It's a wonderful Jewish holiday.
Family, good triumphs over evil.

853
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:42,522
A wonderful story.

854
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:45,062
Victor, I want to tell you
that my family and I...

855
00:44:45,232 --> 00:44:47,792
...we stop when your commercials
are running.

856
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:49,265
Thank you, that's very kind.

857
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:53,964
Does anybody out there know
Victor's day job as an actor?

858
00:44:54,141 --> 00:44:55,199
- Let him have it.
- I do!

859
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,038
- Name of the character?
- This is on the tip of my tongue.

860
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,543
- It's the wiener...
- Yeah.

861
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:02,181
- Irv the Footlong Wiener!
- The Footlong Wiener, right.

862
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:04,442
Head of the class.
Told you I'd get one right.

863
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,018
<i>I wanted a wiener</i>
<i>every time I saw your commercials.</i>

864
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:08,654
- <i>That's the idea.</i>
- <i>Fantastic.</i>

865
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:11,154
- Good, good.
- <i>And you buy the hot dogs too?</i>

866
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,794
Let me ask you a couple of questions
about <i>Home for Purim</i>.

867
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,023
It's a story about a Jewish,
Yiddish family?

868
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,463
- Jewish family.
- Tell us a little about the movie.

869
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,603
- Marilyn, why don't you--?
- Yes, Marilyn.

870
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:27,571
I just would like a moment
to collect my bearings.

871
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:29,606
<i>Okay. Can I--? If it's okay with you.</i>

872
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:32,575
<i>You gave a performance</i>
<i>in</i> Song of Reuben...

873
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:34,475
Oh, she looks nervous.

874
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,310
She's too sensitive for this.
She shouldn't even do that.

875
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,515
You look gorgeous!
I'm calling her on her cell.

876
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:43,349
I swear, I'm calling her in 10 seconds,
when she goes off.

877
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:46,186
When they go to commercial break,
I'm calling to tell her.

878
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:49,260
Yes, Victor!

879
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,757
I don't act for trophies.

880
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:56,369
I think some people act for trophies.
Some don't.

881
00:45:56,537 --> 00:45:59,506
- This is the range we don't see in actors.
- I hope I don't laugh.

882
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,608
Absolutely not.
Now, Victor, let me ask you something.

883
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,637
Because you are so distinguished
as the wiener...

884
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,181
...do you feel that people
are going to accept you in this role?

885
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,617
Well, if they've seen my theatrical work
over the years, I think they will.

886
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:20,123
Well, I have to tell you, for my money
and how I feel about it...

887
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:22,888
...I think you're looking
at an Academy Award nomination.

888
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:24,428
This is the woman, right here.

889
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:27,692
No, we know that, but I'm telling you,
I think you can...

890
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,234
- Did he just say what I thought he said?
- What?

891
00:46:30,404 --> 00:46:33,805
Did he just say Oscar buzz at Victor?

892
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,442
He thinks there's gonna be Oscar buzz
around Victor?

893
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,907
- That's what he said.
- Great.

894
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,512
That's two Oscar nominees.

895
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:43,479
He said, "Oscar" and "Victor"
in the same breath, didn't he?

896
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,880
- Yes, he did.
- Do you know what this means?

897
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,214
- The guy said Victor--
- The man.

898
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,016
- Has to be quiet.
- He thinks Victor's gonna be nominated.

899
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:52,886
- Oscar buzz.
- I need a Selectric.

900
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,723
- Let's send a big gift basket to Victor.
- I need to compose a very long letter.

901
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,798
- Oh, my God, that was...
- Oh, Corey.

902
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:03,130
- My infrastructure had a meltdown!
- No, no, you were perfect.

903
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:05,066
- Couldn't have done better.
- Don't lie.

904
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,672
- It won't help me.
- I'm not.

905
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,569
I didn't know what I was saying.

906
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,506
- Oh, I heard.
- How did he do it?

907
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:13,737
- Well, he's a natural, okay?
- He is.

908
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,882
You made him look good,
you were so stiff.

909
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:19,041
- I mean, you were a little nervous.
- Stiff? I should be so lucky.

910
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,153
- He was marvelous.
- But you looked pretty.

911
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:23,346
- She had a sexual feeling to you.
- Thank you.

912
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:26,049
I'm not used to being a sex object,
more of a food object.

913
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:28,456
- Get used to it.
- You play the actor so well.

914
00:47:28,629 --> 00:47:30,529
- Congratulations.
- You had a quiet drama.

915
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,460
- That was wonderful.
- Sure, thank you.

916
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,965
- Do you know any, like, coaches?
- Come with me.

917
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:37,160
- Victor, go like this:
- Yeah?

918
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,434
You taste that?

919
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,902
That's the taste of stardom,
my friend.

920
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:47,774
You're entering a new plateau,
joining the ranks of a very select few.

921
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,711
I know,
I've seen this a hundred times.

922
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:52,283
I've guided so many actors
to this place.

923
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,615
You are now a star.

924
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,725
You have to start walking and talking
and thinking of yourself as a star.

925
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,053
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:04,163
Give Victor Allan Miller fans
the star they've been waiting for.

927
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,060
- Got you, got you.
- Yeah?

928
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,027
In today's "Lost and Found" segment...

929
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:14,765
...we're going to look at careers that
seemed to be missing for quite some time.

930
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:19,276
And wouldn't you know it? They both
turned up in exactly the same place.

931
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:24,713
Marilyn Hack made quite the splash
in <i>Song for Reuben</i> back in 1989...

932
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:28,082
<i>...for her memorable portrayal</i>
<i>of Imogene the blind prostitute.</i>

933
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,985
Know what they say about blind prostitutes?
You really have to hand it to them.

934
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,922
We can cut that out.

935
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:36,722
But where did she go? She got lost.

936
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,991
And Victor Allan Miller,
the venerable Broadway veteran...

937
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,430
<i>...best known as</i>
<i>Irv the Footlong Wiener...</i>

938
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:45,731
<i>...in those amusing commercials</i>
<i>for Felber's Kosher Hot Dogs...</i>

939
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,004
...well, he just up and disappeared.

940
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,336
Until now, Cindy.
They have been found.

941
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,240
And I'm glad to report
they are not only alive and well...

942
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:55,244
...but more important, they're working.

943
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,215
I'll tell you what, Chuck. Both are
starring in the Sunfish Classics feature:

944
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,048
<i>Home for Purim.</i>
And from what we hear...

945
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:05,089
...they could both be marching
down the red carpet this year.

946
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:08,785
And Cindy and I will be on the set
of <i>Home for</i>-- How to pronounce?

947
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:10,224
- Purim.
- <i>Purim</i> tomorrow...

948
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,797
...talking to Marilyn Hack
and Victor Allan Miller...

949
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:16,424
...and the cast of this hot little movie
that seems to be creating a stir.

950
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,730
We'll have that story
and much more for you...

951
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,339
...on tomorrow night's show.

952
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,708
<i>When Achashverosh heard the news</i>
<i>Of Haman's evil scheme</i>

953
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,377
<i>He told his wife Queen Esther</i>
<i>"Don't</i> fabrent

954
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,593
<i>Haman will be punished</i>
<i>And the Jews will all be saved</i>

955
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:44,788
<i>And you'll</i> shep noches <i>later</i>
<i>In my tent"</i>

956
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,894
<i>Purim, Purim, Purim</i>
<i>It's a time to have some fun</i>

957
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:55,701
<i>By drowning out the sound</i>
<i>Of Haman's name</i>

958
00:49:56,143 --> 00:50:00,409
<i>Purim, Purim, Purim</i>
<i>Spread the news to everyone</i>

959
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:06,779
<i>That Mordecai and Esther</i>
<i>Saved the day</i>

960
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,350
- Let's get you back to bed.
- No.

961
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:19,424
My time is short
and I will not leave the Purim table.

962
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:26,436
What is it about Purim
that is so special to you, Mama?

963
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:30,434
I'm an Esther, like the queen.

964
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:34,579
She was a woman who came
from the worst of times to the best.

965
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:37,376
To a palace where she had
everything she wanted.

966
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,617
Comfort, riches, power.

967
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,187
And she risked it all,
including her life...

968
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,318
...to serve a higher purpose...

969
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,159
...commit a selfless act
to save a nation.

970
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,554
Your daddy was my king...

971
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,789
...this house, my palace...

972
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:58,570
...and my selfless act was to protect
my family from all the Hamans.

973
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:04,065
I don't have much time!
Let's put the toys down!

974
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:12,450
Only now do I realize the irony...

975
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:16,914
...that my selfless act
was indeed a selfish one.

976
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:21,589
Because the Haman I was trying
to protect you from, Rachel...

977
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,691
...turned out to be me.

978
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,060
Mama.

979
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:28,833
- Mama.
- Mama.

980
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,300
You're no Haman, Mama.

981
00:51:31,605 --> 00:51:36,042
You are... Queen Esther.

982
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,014
- And cut.
- That's a cut.

983
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,243
- Very good, everybody. Very good.
- Thank you very much, everybody.

984
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:48,717
And we are moving on.

985
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:50,754
Scene 31, in the kitchen.

986
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:52,585
- Simon? Simon.
- Yeah?

987
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,587
- Brilliant.
- Do me a favor.

988
00:51:56,763 --> 00:52:01,200
In the next take, extreme close-up
of the kugel, all right?

989
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,199
Make a note of that.

990
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,860
I got it.

991
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,772
- To call attention to...
- I don't alter my reading.

992
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:10,876
That was terrific, unbelievable.
I loved that. That was great.

993
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,740
Victor? What I want to do is,
I want to come in low.

994
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:16,075
See your face after lunch.
I want to see your--

995
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:18,012
- Not too low?
- No, not under your chin.

996
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:20,153
Because I wanna be able
to crosscut after.

997
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,947
- Hello, everyone.
- And Debbie, who--

998
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:24,522
Everyone, quiet, please.

999
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:29,160
I have Martin Gibb,
the president of Sunfish Classics.

1000
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:30,626
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

1001
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:33,197
- Victor Allan Miller.
- Hi.

1002
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:35,095
- This is Marilyn.
- Hi.

1003
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:37,299
- Marilyn Hack.
- Yeah?

1004
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:41,571
- And this is the gang.
- I'm Brian Chubb. Nice to see you.

1005
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,969
- Callie Webb.
- Hi.

1006
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,540
The article.

1007
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,309
The article?

1008
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,679
Planet Earth calling.

1009
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:53,843
Did you get a chance
to see the last take?

1010
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:57,384
Yeah. Right. <i>Variety.</i>

1011
00:52:57,557 --> 00:53:01,618
So "Star on the Rise" is the headline.

1012
00:53:01,795 --> 00:53:03,990
Okay. "With stellar performances...

1013
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:07,827
...from its veteran mainstays,
Marilyn Hack and Victor Allan Miller...

1014
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,893
...it is the surprisingly adept
portrayal of Rachel...

1015
00:53:12,072 --> 00:53:14,973
...that could earn Webb
Academy recognition."

1016
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:21,206
- Made you happy?
- Oh, my God.

1017
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:24,043
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1018
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:27,787
- Oh, bye-bye.
- Wow, that's unbelievable.

1019
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,752
- It's gonna be so much fun.
- This is good news for everybody.

1020
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:34,291
- Bye! Bye, thank you for coming.
- Baby, this is fantastic.

1021
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:41,334
I just feel like...

1022
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:45,031
- ...I got in trouble.
- No.

1023
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:47,298
- Like I don't know you.
- No. You don't--?

1024
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,807
- You're mad at me for something.
- I'm not. I'm...

1025
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,444
You're not happy for me.

1026
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,637
I'm happy for you
because you do good work...

1027
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,078
...and you're wonderful
at what you do.

1028
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,583
You know how embarrassing
that was for me in there?

1029
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:03,985
- You weren't happy for me.
- Listen, Callie, I'm happy for you.

1030
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,785
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem. I'll--

1031
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,053
- You're jealous. That's your problem.
- No.

1032
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:13,188
If you're not gonna be there for me
then I will do this alone.

1033
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:15,561
- I'm confused.
- I don't need you.

1034
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:19,227
I don't need anybody.
I don't need you.

1035
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,267
And you know what, Brian?
You're not confused.

1036
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:25,002
- Callie.
- I see right through you.

1037
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,978
- Come back here, please.
- I see right through you.

1038
00:54:34,955 --> 00:54:36,684
If you take my meaning.

1039
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,484
Oh, good times, good times.
Well, done.

1040
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:42,992
- Well done, everybody.
- We're very, very relieved and happy.

1041
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,688
I mean, we had no idea, you know,
what to expect.

1042
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,231
- We've never been here before.
- Babes in the woods.

1043
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:50,096
It's great. The cast are great.

1044
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,398
We make enough money on this,
there'll be babes in the trailers.

1045
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,666
Hey, hey. Hey, now.

1046
00:54:55,842 --> 00:55:00,336
And so with a few little tweaks
here and there, you know...

1047
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,208
What kind of tweaks?

1048
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,510
Just make it more palatable.
We want a wider audience to see it.

1049
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:07,414
We don't want a very small art movie.

1050
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,487
Oh, I see what you're saying.
No, no, no.

1051
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,420
I don't think you have that problem.
I've seen cut footage.

1052
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:15,220
It's vital and it's exciting.
It's about real people.

1053
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we can--

1054
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:21,161
It will be if we just tone
some of the themes down a little bit.

1055
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,562
- That's all. Just tone--
- And how would that be?

1056
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,568
- Just--
- What is the theme?

1057
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,971
Well, the Jewishness.
Which is good. Ethnicity is good.

1058
00:55:30,143 --> 00:55:32,805
- Well, they are Jewish.
- Absolutely. Tone that down...

1059
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:34,640
...and then everyone can enjoy it.

1060
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:36,748
Wait. This is about a Jewish family.

1061
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,816
They're home for Purim.
That's the title.

1062
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,545
Well, we could--
Yeah, we could change the title.

1063
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,588
I wasn't suggesting we change the title.
I'm pointing out...

1064
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,660
...that Purim is an essential part
of this story.

1065
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,921
It looks like guys in suits
are telling you--

1066
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,621
- No, no, no.
- It's not that.

1067
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,166
Just tone down the Jewishness
so everyone can enjoy it.

1068
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:58,133
- Title change would be good.
- No one...

1069
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,239
...is wearing a hat or has ringlets.

1070
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:03,672
I'm just saying the film as a whole,
the theme...

1071
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,470
...the whole thrust of the film...

1072
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:08,739
...the whole in-your-face
Jewishness of the film...

1073
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:10,974
...tone it down.
We could change the title.

1074
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,142
Oh, here's people coming
to see it now.

1075
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,720
It's a good film and there's people
watching. That'd be good, wouldn't it?

1076
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,656
What if we do a different holiday
around the table-- Easter.

1077
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:22,294
--and just focus on the rabbit?

1078
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,558
All I'm saying is have it there,
don't shove it down people's throats.

1079
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:28,826
I don't-- I don't run around--

1080
00:56:29,002 --> 00:56:31,994
I don't run around going,
"I'm a Gentile, look at my foreskin."

1081
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,766
I don't shove it down your throat,
because I don't care.

1082
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:38,039
Three, two, one, and hit them.

1083
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:39,473
We're sitting on the set...

1084
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,911
...of one of the hottest movies
being made in Hollywood today.

1085
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,880
It's called <i>Hello, Purim</i>.

1086
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:46,416
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>
- No, <i>"Home."</i>

1087
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:47,917
<i>Home for Purim.</i>

1088
00:56:48,088 --> 00:56:51,546
Some faces we're not familiar with.
Some new faces.

1089
00:56:51,724 --> 00:56:54,386
And I recognize Victor Allan Miller.

1090
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:56,859
- How are you? Question for you.
- I'm fine, Chuck.

1091
00:56:57,063 --> 00:56:59,429
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>
What was your favorite character?

1092
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,524
- Jan.
- Well, she's an attractive young lady.

1093
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:05,437
Mine was-- I think her name was Alice.
Was that it?

1094
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:08,665
She was the maid. She was the glue
that held the family together.

1095
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,810
- You had a question, Cindy?
- Yes. Victor...

1096
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:14,174
...when word got out
that I was interviewing you today...

1097
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,907
...I was inundated
with phone calls and e-mails...

1098
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:20,416
- ...all of them asking me to ask you...
- Knocked out by the opportunity.

1099
00:57:20,587 --> 00:57:22,521
- ...the same question.
- Which is?

1100
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,850
Where the heck have you been?

1101
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,993
Oh, aren't you nice?
Well, actually, I've been teaching in--

1102
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,389
That's rhetorical.
You don't have to answer.

1103
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,997
Marilyn Hack,
you play the matriarch here...

1104
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,134
...and you are dying as I understand.

1105
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:38,298
That must be tough,
doing a dramatic scene like this.

1106
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:42,071
Let me ask a question.
Anybody play any gags...

1107
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,073
...any pranks on the set?

1108
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:46,542
Anything funny that happened?

1109
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,277
No high jinks per se, but I--

1110
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,250
Hold it just a second. I gotta take this.
Yeah?

1111
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,853
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1112
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:58,388
- Nothing much.
- Yeah, talk amongst yourselves.

1113
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,583
- No, it was easy day.
- Hang up the phone.

1114
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,489
Aren't these things wonderful?

1115
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:06,120
In a restaurant, you can use them.
You don't have to hunt for a pay phone.

1116
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:09,063
They say soon we'll be able
to use them on an airplane.

1117
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,965
Callie Webb,
you had to play the daughter...

1118
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:14,698
...that comes home to her mom
who is dying.

1119
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:16,842
You have a history of standup comedy.

1120
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:19,638
Were you able to fall back
on your comedy chops...

1121
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:21,939
- ...in playing a role like that?
- No.

1122
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:23,980
- It doesn't translate, eh?
- It's a drama.

1123
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:27,551
Tragedy plus time equals comedy.
I didn't know if it worked the other way.

1124
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,654
- It's a different movie.
- Yeah.

1125
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:32,620
Years ago, I read a book called
<i>The Little Engine That Could.</i>

1126
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,350
- "I think I can."
- What?

1127
00:58:34,527 --> 00:58:36,461
"I think I can, I think I can...

1128
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,494
- ...I think I can.
- That's what he says.

1129
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:40,929
- That's what the train said as--
- I think I can...

1130
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,466
- I think it was just three.
- ...I think I can."

1131
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:47,402
And it reminds me of this little movie
that started out as practically nothing...

1132
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:49,701
...and is chugging up, up, up.

1133
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:52,640
Who knows if it's gonna
reach its goal and explode.

1134
00:58:52,812 --> 00:58:54,746
It's a wonderful book.

1135
00:58:54,914 --> 00:58:58,350
It's big print, lot of pictures,
not too heavy reading.

1136
00:58:58,518 --> 00:59:02,284
If you want something heavy, see <i>Hamlet</i>
or Shakespeare or something like that.

1137
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,753
For me, something you can
get into and out of.

1138
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:07,654
God bless you all.
Victor, keep plugging at your career...

1139
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,158
...despite what critics say.

1140
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:11,889
You know, the dogs bark,
but the caravans move on.

1141
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:15,967
Everyone, keep up the good work.
Tune into our show Friday night...

1142
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,987
C.J. Simon...

1143
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:39,748
...and a group of people
who stand around him...

1144
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:43,018
...because there's no studio work.
Please get a name for your band.

1145
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:47,028
Our next guest finished shooting
a charming little movie this past summer...

1146
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:49,029
...that was just supposed to pay rent.

1147
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,862
Here we are in January,
with the Oscars around the corner.

1148
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:55,301
Let me tell you, that charming
little movie not only paid the rent...

1149
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:57,634
...could end up buying her
the whole block.

1150
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:59,333
It turned this town on its ear.

1151
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,104
Please welcome the star
of <i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1152
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,443
...Marilyn Hack. Oh, Marilyn?

1153
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:15,323
I love you, Marilyn!

1154
01:00:17,261 --> 01:00:20,458
- Well, good evening.
- Good evening, Ben.

1155
01:00:20,698 --> 01:00:23,030
Thank you very much
for being here with us.

1156
01:00:23,201 --> 01:00:25,431
Oh, no, thank you.
It's a dream come true.

1157
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:29,937
Well, we're glad that we could
help you achieve your dream.

1158
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:32,668
Speaking of which,
there is word on the street...

1159
01:00:32,844 --> 01:00:36,541
...that your performance in this movie
is spellbinding.

1160
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:39,706
- Well...
- Tell me a little about the movie.

1161
01:00:39,884 --> 01:00:42,011
It's about Thanksgiving,
which I believe...

1162
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:45,917
...is probably our most elegant holiday.
Don't you think so?

1163
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,358
- I do now.
- Because we say "thank you."

1164
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,757
And I, for one,
can't say thank you enough.

1165
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:56,059
And it's all-inclusive. It includes
everyone, no matter what religion.

1166
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:58,566
- It's nondenominational.
- Exactly, that's the word.

1167
01:00:58,736 --> 01:01:01,796
And it kicks off Awards season.

1168
01:01:01,973 --> 01:01:04,840
I gotta tell you.
I see a lot of films. I love all of them.

1169
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,773
And <i>Home for Thanksgiving?</i>
I think it's my favorite film.

1170
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:09,310
Favorite film of the year.

1171
01:01:09,714 --> 01:01:11,875
- Well--
- Oh, here we go.

1172
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,517
--I hate to surprise you, Ben...

1173
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:17,619
...but I also enjoyed it very, very much.

1174
01:01:18,823 --> 01:01:20,848
- You know, when people see--
- I slobbered.

1175
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,993
I don't believe this.

1176
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:25,822
- Well, thank goodness.
- <i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1177
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:29,091
...is, as far as I'm concerned,
one of the top films of the year.

1178
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:31,326
I mean, Oscars. I smell Oscars.

1179
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:33,333
I loved it. I loved the movie.

1180
01:01:33,504 --> 01:01:36,132
KXBD 104.9 Talk Radio.

1181
01:01:36,307 --> 01:01:37,899
- Dinkie and Don--
- Turning you on.

1182
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:41,239
It's the Morningwood Show.
Morningwood and Holly would if she could.

1183
01:01:41,412 --> 01:01:44,472
- I've got morning wood this morning.
- Yes, we do.

1184
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:47,914
We got a special guest.
That's the reason for my wood, I tell you.

1185
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:49,883
- Her name is Callie Webb.
- How are you?

1186
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:52,454
- I'm good. How are you?
- Excited to have you here.

1187
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:56,059
We heard there's a little bit of,
I don't know, Awards-season buzz...

1188
01:01:56,227 --> 01:01:58,661
- ...around the film you have opening.
- That's right.

1189
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,661
- Tell us about that.
- I'm very excited.

1190
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:02,857
The film is called <i>Home for Thanksgiving</i>.

1191
01:02:03,034 --> 01:02:05,229
- And--
- How many topless scenes do you have?

1192
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:07,462
- There are no topless scenes.
- No scenes?

1193
01:02:07,638 --> 01:02:09,401
- What's the point?
- How is there buzz?

1194
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:10,802
But there's...

1195
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:15,207
Gentlemen, welcome.

1196
01:02:15,379 --> 01:02:16,846
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1197
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:19,073
So here you are, playwrights.

1198
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:23,681
How has the transition been from writing
for the stage to writing for screen?

1199
01:02:24,355 --> 01:02:27,153
Because it starts out
as a wordsmith's medium.

1200
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:30,726
It starts out as a medium
in which your script is sacrosanct.

1201
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:34,131
- Yes.
- Correct? And it's a medium...

1202
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:37,597
...in the screen,
where the director calls the shots.

1203
01:02:37,768 --> 01:02:42,068
The director designs what's gonna go on,
the sequence of events.

1204
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:46,467
The director, in fact,
can marshal your words around...

1205
01:02:46,644 --> 01:02:49,112
...and you're relegated.
Do you feel relegated...

1206
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:51,874
...in this situation?
Or do you feel like...

1207
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:54,779
...you have reached a position of comfort?

1208
01:02:58,156 --> 01:03:00,556
What up, everybody?
It's your boy, chillaxing.

1209
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:02,420
We have a special guest today.

1210
01:03:02,593 --> 01:03:06,085
He's the star of the upcoming new movie,
<i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1211
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:07,697
...which comes out this Friday.

1212
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:09,958
I want you guys
to give a warm welcome...

1213
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:13,069
...for Victor Allan Miller.

1214
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:16,070
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1215
01:03:19,277 --> 01:03:21,404
- What's up, man? How you doing?
- How you doing?

1216
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:24,912
- I'm so glad you could be here.
- I am so thrilled. I'm pumped, stoked.

1217
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:28,051
Absolutely, absolutely.
Here on <i>Chillaxin'</i>.

1218
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:30,585
- We're gonna pump this beat now.
- So am I dancing?

1219
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:34,782
Yeah, exactly.
All right, cool. Right there.

1220
01:03:35,993 --> 01:03:38,018
Let go a little bit.
That's what we gonna do.

1221
01:03:38,196 --> 01:03:41,097
That's what I'm talking about, chillaxing.
Let go even more.

1222
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:42,823
- Let go even more. More.
- More?

1223
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,900
- Absolutely.
- I'm a sandwich, huh?

1224
01:03:45,069 --> 01:03:47,936
- Just have a good time. That's what it is.
- All right, Victor!

1225
01:03:49,574 --> 01:03:51,735
- Yeah, right there.
- <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1226
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:55,310
Some love for him right now.
Victor, right now, letting go.

1227
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:02,080
Well, the countdown
to Awards season has begun.

1228
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:05,017
The nominations will be announced
in just two days.

1229
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:08,590
And once again, we have to rely on
Chuck and Cindy's crystal ball...

1230
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:11,660
...to give us the inside track
on this year's favorites.

1231
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:14,855
Yes. We will gaze into the crystal ball...

1232
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:18,627
...and tell you who we see
as our nomination picks.

1233
01:04:18,803 --> 01:04:21,203
Nice accent, incidentally.

1234
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:24,273
Cindy, who do you see for Best Actor?

1235
01:04:24,475 --> 01:04:27,205
Well, I see two faces appearing, Chuck.

1236
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:30,142
Ben Connelly
for <i>Whispers in the Attic...</i>

1237
01:04:30,314 --> 01:04:34,341
...and Victor Allan Miller
for <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1238
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:36,946
Who do you see
for Best Actress, Chuck?

1239
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:41,922
I see Louise Mayer for the classy,
big-budget musical, <i>Dream Alley</i>.

1240
01:04:42,093 --> 01:04:45,358
And there seems to be two other faces
fighting for recognition.

1241
01:04:45,529 --> 01:04:48,828
Marilyn Hack and Callie Webb.

1242
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,831
Both for <i>Home for Thanksgiving</i>.

1243
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:52,492
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.

1244
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,003
Tomorrow night, the Best Supporting
Actor and Actress category.

1245
01:04:56,173 --> 01:05:00,439
- But right now...
- I see a commercial in the future.

1246
01:05:00,611 --> 01:05:03,307
And I'm feeling a lot better
about my accent.

1247
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:12,879
Guess who. Hi.

1248
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:15,248
Hi.

1249
01:05:16,027 --> 01:05:17,358
Hi, darling.

1250
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:20,520
Do you believe this?
Do you believe any of it?

1251
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:23,228
It's too exciting. How do you feel?

1252
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:24,834
- I feel good.
- Oh, yes.

1253
01:05:25,002 --> 01:05:28,699
I don't see anything wrong with both of us
being nominated. Don't see why not.

1254
01:05:28,873 --> 01:05:31,171
I'm sure it's been done before,
don't you think?

1255
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:34,208
I mean, after tomorrow,
I won't talk to you, but...

1256
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:37,745
- Marilyn?
- Yes, it's exciting.

1257
01:05:37,915 --> 01:05:39,576
It's exciting, isn't it?

1258
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,081
Yeah.

1259
01:05:41,252 --> 01:05:42,981
I'm so-- I'm very happy for you.

1260
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:45,179
I'm happy for you too, Marilyn.

1261
01:05:45,356 --> 01:05:48,348
I haven't seen Brian here,
my other little baby.

1262
01:05:49,593 --> 01:05:51,527
- We split up.
- You did not.

1263
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:53,129
- Yeah.
- Tell me you're kidding.

1264
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:55,765
- Yeah, it's--
- That's awful.

1265
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,430
Hello, blondie.

1266
01:05:59,203 --> 01:06:01,137
Are you a natural blond?

1267
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:04,806
Oh, no. All of it
is really brown and curly.

1268
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:11,743
Mixing business with pleasure.
My pleasure.

1269
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:14,245
Yeah.

1270
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:17,649
Do you like restaurants? You like wine.
Do you like restaurants?

1271
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:20,780
- They're okay.
- Yeah.

1272
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:22,783
Do you wanna go to a restaurant?

1273
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:24,958
Maybe.

1274
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:27,460
What sort do you like?

1275
01:06:27,631 --> 01:06:29,155
I like...

1276
01:06:30,368 --> 01:06:33,667
..."latesion"? Lesion?

1277
01:06:34,405 --> 01:06:37,374
Lesion, that's a-- That's like a wound.

1278
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,704
No, it's Latin restaurants...

1279
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:43,403
- ...but I don't know what the word is.
- Latin?

1280
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:46,311
Latin restaurants.
You mean, like, Mexican or...?

1281
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:49,885
No, Latin. The people that speak Latin.

1282
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:52,215
I need this to calm my nerves.

1283
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,585
- I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
- It's so exciting.

1284
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:57,956
I'm a peeled nerve. I'm just--
I'm all jitters. I can hardly...

1285
01:06:58,129 --> 01:07:01,326
I think Marilyn is very deserving,
but I think Callie is equally...

1286
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:02,966
...as deserving of an award.

1287
01:07:03,134 --> 01:07:05,261
She's wonderful,
but it's an early celebration.

1288
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:07,336
I don't think she's quite ripened yet.

1289
01:07:07,505 --> 01:07:11,373
But you know what? I have to tell you
that when I was a very little girl...

1290
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:13,772
...my daddy would say to me,
he said, you know:

1291
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:16,174
"Never let them see you sweat."

1292
01:07:16,347 --> 01:07:20,215
And I think that the voters
can smell the fear. It's like dogs.

1293
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:22,079
They know that she's hungry.

1294
01:07:22,253 --> 01:07:25,450
No, but you know what? I'm sorry.
Dying is easy.

1295
01:07:25,623 --> 01:07:27,250
Playing a lesbian is hard.

1296
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:31,054
Oh, please. Marilyn Hack is the queen
and tomorrow, there will be a coronation.

1297
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:33,162
There was a thousand queens
on that set.

1298
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,957
- And you know that.
- Your point is?

1299
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:36,895
Oh, come on. There's a ton of queens.

1300
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:40,695
It's been a good experience
for everybody. I mean, you know...

1301
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:44,398
...this is the last bargain-basement deal
you get out of this guy.

1302
01:07:44,575 --> 01:07:46,634
You know?
We now have to be more discerning.

1303
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:49,746
We're not gonna just take
any commercial that comes our way.

1304
01:07:49,914 --> 01:07:52,382
- We're not gonna take any.
- We're not gonna take any.

1305
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,314
Gentlemen, <i>c'est ça</i>.
Now, if I may go out on a--

1306
01:07:55,486 --> 01:07:57,249
- Jesus, don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1307
01:07:57,421 --> 01:08:00,083
Corey, what is it, Pioneer Days
at Moorpark this weekend?

1308
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:03,385
Certified degree of Indian blood.
It's on my wall, <i>kemo</i>.

1309
01:08:03,561 --> 01:08:06,826
Mr. Miller, I presume you will be
watching the nominations...

1310
01:08:06,997 --> 01:08:09,329
...this morning at 5 a.m.
on your television set.

1311
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,663
Well, I would, except for the fact
that I don't own a television.

1312
01:08:12,837 --> 01:08:15,738
- Has no TV. Yeah.
- I'd be happy to telephone you.

1313
01:08:15,906 --> 01:08:18,204
Call me, Taft, and I will call him. Okay?

1314
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,899
- We're having a meeting.
- Got you.

1315
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:22,307
Could you step back, physically?

1316
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,847
- Yep. I'm going to go sit in my car.
- Thank you.

1317
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:28,244
Hello.

1318
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:30,183
Hello, everybody.

1319
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:32,178
Come around.

1320
01:08:33,691 --> 01:08:36,455
Come on. Okay.

1321
01:08:37,061 --> 01:08:38,460
Okay:

1322
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:44,024
Okay. Thanks.

1323
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:49,562
When the enchanting Whitney Brown
first came into my office...

1324
01:08:50,808 --> 01:08:54,608
...I realized I was in
for a very special encounter.

1325
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:58,578
And when I actually got around
to reading the coverage...

1326
01:08:58,749 --> 01:09:02,845
...I realized I had in my mitts a story...

1327
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,955
...the likes of which
I had not seen before.

1328
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:08,220
Which goes to show...

1329
01:09:08,392 --> 01:09:11,759
...the suits aren't always the wankers
they're made out to be.

1330
01:09:11,929 --> 01:09:13,624
Hear, hear.

1331
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:17,298
So with that in mind...

1332
01:09:17,468 --> 01:09:19,902
...I would like to propose a toast...

1333
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:24,439
...to the future nominees
for <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1334
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,740
The future nominees.

1335
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,435
<i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1336
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:31,740
<i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1337
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:44,753
<i>The backup, however,</i>
<i>remains northbound at Costa Mesa.</i>

1338
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:49,559
<i>In Hollywood, traffic on the 101</i>
<i>is running smoothly in both directions...</i>

1339
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:52,702
<i>...through the Cahuenga Pass</i>
<i>and into downtown L.A.</i>

1340
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:55,134
<i>That is your early drive-time report...</i>

1341
01:09:55,306 --> 01:09:58,070
<i>...and now we head back</i>
<i>to our KAJE coverage...</i>

1342
01:09:58,242 --> 01:10:01,268
<i>...of the nominations from the Academy.</i>

1343
01:10:01,445 --> 01:10:06,348
<i>And now the nominations</i>
<i>for Best Actress in a Motion Picture.</i>

1344
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:12,112
<i>Veronica Randolph</i>
<i>in</i> Whispers in the Attic<i>.</i>

1345
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:16,992
<i>Cynthia Chapman</i>
<i>in</i> Pride of Plymouth Rock<i>.</i>

1346
01:10:18,128 --> 01:10:19,857
- Okay, say it.
- <i>Sally Ann Middleton...</i>

1347
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,828
- ...<i>in</i> Whispers in the Attic<i>.</i>
- Say it now.

1348
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:27,098
<i>Louise Mayer in</i> Dream Alley<i>.</i>

1349
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:33,507
<i>And Monique LeBlanc</i>
<i>in</i> Le Cheval Obscurité<i>.</i>

1350
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:36,512
Dark Horse.

1351
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,781
<i>The nominations for Best Actor</i>
<i>in a Motion Picture are...</i>

1352
01:10:42,653 --> 01:10:47,056
...<i>Ben Connelly in</i> Whispers in the Attic<i>.</i>

1353
01:10:48,092 --> 01:10:49,354
Marilyn Hack.

1354
01:10:49,526 --> 01:10:51,824
- <i>Jose Mercado in</i> Crystal Lake<i>.</i>
- Just...

1355
01:10:51,996 --> 01:10:55,261
Just say Marilyn Hack.

1356
01:10:55,432 --> 01:10:57,525
- <i>William Montague...</i>
- It's so easy.

1357
01:10:57,701 --> 01:11:00,067
...<i>in</i> Tomorrow Never Sleeps<i>.</i>

1358
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:30,563
<i>Hi, this is Brian,</i>

1359
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:34,431
<i>Brian? Brian, it's Corey.</i>
<i>Corey Taft and Associates.</i>

1360
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:37,165
<i>Congratulations, my young friend.</i>

1361
01:11:37,341 --> 01:11:40,037
<i>You have achieved a nomination.</i>

1362
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:44,203
<i>That is very exciting news</i>
<i>for a young actor...</i>

1363
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:49,647
Good evening America, and anyone else
who can understand the king's English.

1364
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,381
Well, the nominations are in
and there are surprises galore.

1365
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:57,254
Well, I'll tell you what, Chuck.
Once again, the voters have spoken.

1366
01:11:57,428 --> 01:12:01,694
And it seems that sentiment alone
will not get you that coveted golden statue.

1367
01:12:01,865 --> 01:12:05,266
And because there were so many surprises,
Cindy, I thought to myself...

1368
01:12:05,436 --> 01:12:08,564
...instead of hearing the usual drivel
from the glowing nominees...

1369
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:10,604
...what could be more
fun than hearing...

1370
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:15,575
...what the devastatingly disappointed
losers had to say this morning?

1371
01:12:15,746 --> 01:12:19,273
Well, I guess it all depends on what
your definition of fun is, Chuck.

1372
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,940
Fun is where you find it.

1373
01:12:21,118 --> 01:12:24,679
We had our roving cameras on the losers
first thing this morning...

1374
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:27,483
...and here's what they had to say.

1375
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:31,952
Hi, Callie. Chuck Porter...

1376
01:12:32,362 --> 01:12:35,991
<i>...Hollywood Now.</i> Scrunch over. I thought
you'd like some company this morning.

1377
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:39,795
So let me start by saying... no nomination.

1378
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:43,201
And I say that on behalf of myself
and all your fans.

1379
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:45,841
Your movie was exceptional.

1380
01:12:46,009 --> 01:12:50,036
But what went wrong?
Why no nomination?

1381
01:12:51,014 --> 01:12:54,006
Honestly, Chuck,
I haven't really thought about it.

1382
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:56,277
- No thought?
- It doesn't really matter.

1383
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:59,354
It doesn't matter. Can I have an order
of humble pie over here?

1384
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:03,459
For Miss Callie Webb? Don't say, "Who?"

1385
01:13:03,994 --> 01:13:06,622
One thing you have to look forward to
is having privacy.

1386
01:13:06,797 --> 01:13:09,732
Not having people come out and say,
"Can I have your autograph?"

1387
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,765
No autographs for this lady.

1388
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,563
What do you mean
you didn't want one anyway?

1389
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:19,232
Victor Allan Miller is inside auditioning
for a Buffalo-wings commercial.

1390
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:22,037
Let's sneak inside like a fly on the wall.

1391
01:13:22,212 --> 01:13:24,578
Maybe they won't even notice
we're there.

1392
01:13:24,748 --> 01:13:27,478
Wow, that's spicy.

1393
01:13:27,785 --> 01:13:29,946
- Wow, that's spicy.
- You've sold me.

1394
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,111
I'll take a thousand
of those Buffalo wings.

1395
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:35,053
Because I got 500 buffalo
I'm teaching how to fly.

1396
01:13:35,225 --> 01:13:37,819
Chuck Porter, <i>Hollywood Now</i>.
Would you all be an angel...

1397
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:40,293
...and give us two minutes
with Mr. Miller, here.

1398
01:13:40,464 --> 01:13:42,125
- Hello, Chuck.
- How are you, Victor?

1399
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:44,358
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Victor, listen.

1400
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:47,834
You're striking
while the iron is cold, right?

1401
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:51,099
I was shocked that you were
considered for a nomination.

1402
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:53,869
But once the word came out,
I was rooting for you.

1403
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:57,036
How did it feel when you thought
you were gonna get a nomination?

1404
01:13:57,214 --> 01:14:01,048
You know, when you just came in, I thought
you were gonna say there was a mistake.

1405
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:03,982
I wish I could have.
There were so many great performances.

1406
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:06,714
You know, I'm gonna call you Mr. Miller.

1407
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:09,518
Because it's kind of hypocritical
to call you Victor.

1408
01:14:09,693 --> 01:14:11,718
- You get what I'm saying?
- I get it, yeah.

1409
01:14:11,895 --> 01:14:13,658
Victor, he's certainly not a victor.

1410
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:16,095
Can I help you?
Are you a member of the union?

1411
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:19,133
Would you tell your cameraman
I have to sign a release?

1412
01:14:19,303 --> 01:14:21,601
I'm kidding. Just get back there
and make notes.

1413
01:14:21,772 --> 01:14:26,038
We are out of here. We're in Times Square.
And we've watched this man's ball drop...

1414
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:31,238
...ignominiously, so let's light the sparklers
and move on down the road.

1415
01:14:31,548 --> 01:14:34,449
I think we see Marilyn Hack right now.
Let's pay her a visit.

1416
01:14:34,618 --> 01:14:38,315
Morning, Marilyn. Chuck Porter,
from <i>Hollywood Now</i>.

1417
01:14:38,488 --> 01:14:40,752
- Wrong house.
- No, the right house.

1418
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:43,256
- I didn't get nominated.
- We wanna talk to Marilyn.

1419
01:14:43,427 --> 01:14:46,794
- Marilyn and trash. What a juxtaposition.
- I didn't get nominated.

1420
01:14:46,964 --> 01:14:48,454
We know that. And what happened?

1421
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:50,327
- What was that?
- But the important--

1422
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,161
You get close to being nominated.

1423
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:55,703
- That's what it's all about.
- No, it's not right. It's a big tease.

1424
01:14:55,873 --> 01:14:59,900
Because four out of five of those girls
are gonna lose, bigtime.

1425
01:15:00,077 --> 01:15:01,840
- Can I ask you--?
- Way worse than me.

1426
01:15:02,012 --> 01:15:03,309
I didn't even get nominated.

1427
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,574
- I'm not gonna lose. I'm not gonna lose.
- What happened? All right.

1428
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,911
How could I think I'd win
if I'm not nominated?

1429
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:11,577
- That's what I mean. You came this close--
- Stop it!

1430
01:15:11,755 --> 01:15:14,019
- I don't think you--
- I'm gonna go to France.

1431
01:15:14,191 --> 01:15:16,250
- What for?
- How'd the French girl get in?

1432
01:15:16,426 --> 01:15:19,395
The French movie. Drives me nuts,
with the writing on the screen.

1433
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:23,590
- That's French. It's French. It's not legal.
- I don't think it's late-breaking news.

1434
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:27,362
Then I'm gonna come back,
and they're gonna say, "Oh, la, la, French."

1435
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:31,268
"French, foreign. You're so--
Let's give you all the awards."

1436
01:15:31,441 --> 01:15:33,136
And I'll say, "Fuck you.

1437
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:35,778
You didn't know-- Even know it was me."

1438
01:15:35,946 --> 01:15:39,177
- No. I'm sure--
- Yeah, go see Frenchie.

1439
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:41,783
No, I think they did a wonderful job.
Best of luck.

1440
01:15:41,952 --> 01:15:43,715
Come in. I got so much food. Come on.

1441
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:46,822
Marilyn Hack. Now I know
what it feels like...

1442
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,424
...to stare down into the Grand Canyon.

1443
01:15:49,593 --> 01:15:54,428
Chuck Porter, <i>Hollywood Now</i>,
saying, fade out.

1444
01:16:02,272 --> 01:16:06,333
<i>You were never there for me</i>
<i>You never really cared</i>

1445
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,206
<i>I can see right through you</i>

1446
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:13,679
<i>You were always running scared</i>

1447
01:16:14,952 --> 01:16:19,013
But wait. Were you there for him?

1448
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:23,023
Did you give him everything he needed?

1449
01:16:24,394 --> 01:16:27,955
Maybe it was you
who was running scared.

1450
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:38,064
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute</i>

1451
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:41,074
<i>You're changing the subject</i>

1452
01:16:41,244 --> 01:16:44,475
<i>I'm getting all confused</i>

1453
01:16:44,648 --> 01:16:47,776
<i>He always was the problem</i>

1454
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:51,751
<i>I was being used</i>

1455
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:55,720
Or was I?

1456
01:16:57,928 --> 01:17:03,423
<i>Second chances don't happen every day</i>

1457
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,262
<i>But in every single way</i>

1458
01:17:06,436 --> 01:17:09,633
<i>I will forgive him</i>

1459
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:18,178
Maybe I will forgive him...

1460
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,611
...in hell!

1461
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:39,129
What if I told you...

1462
01:17:39,302 --> 01:17:42,430
...that you could have a slim,
trim and sexy body...

1463
01:17:42,606 --> 01:17:44,540
...in just nine and a half days...

1464
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,336
...and have all the fun
of a Hawaiian vacation?

1465
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:48,910
Sound too good to be true?

1466
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,412
Well, not when you're exercising
with Hula Balls.

1467
01:17:52,582 --> 01:17:55,745
And here to help demonstrate
this fantastic new product...

1468
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:59,446
...a man who came this close
to getting nominated for an Oscar:

1469
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:01,284
Victor Allan Miller.

1470
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,186
Victor, welcome.

1471
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,591
And congratulations on almost
being nominated. That's exciting.

1472
01:18:06,763 --> 01:18:08,230
Yes, it is. Thank you very much.

1473
01:18:08,398 --> 01:18:10,423
It was an honor
just to be almost nominated.

1474
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,262
It's an honor to be demonstrating
this fantastic product.

1475
01:18:13,437 --> 01:18:15,928
Let me just show you
how easy it is to use.

1476
01:18:16,106 --> 01:18:18,734
Great. Now, to the untrained eye...

1477
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:22,106
...it may look like Victor is having
the time of his life...

1478
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:24,611
...but he's actually working
his abdominals...

1479
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:27,841
...quads, calf and hip muscles.
Victor, may I join you?

1480
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:29,315
- Please, do.
- Okay.

1481
01:18:29,486 --> 01:18:30,976
Plenty for everybody.

1482
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:34,021
- God, this is as fun as it looks.
- Feels good, doesn't it?

1483
01:18:34,191 --> 01:18:36,056
- I'm feeling that burn.
- He looks good.

1484
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:38,990
Good? He's this close from the A-list.

1485
01:18:39,162 --> 01:18:42,154
I mean, this is such a profile booster
for Victor.

1486
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:45,028
Because you gotta be somebody
to sell these balls.

1487
01:18:45,202 --> 01:18:46,726
They don't just ask anybody.

1488
01:18:46,903 --> 01:18:49,303
More people will see this
than all the Shakespeare...

1489
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:51,407
...and all the Broadway he's ever done.

1490
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:53,770
He's gonna get a lot of work from this.

1491
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:56,970
- I'm gonna need some help to get up.
- I'm right here.

1492
01:18:57,581 --> 01:19:01,608
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

1493
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:07,116
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

1494
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:12,591
Amy wouldn't understand.
She'd think there'd be snakes.

1495
01:19:12,762 --> 01:19:14,696
Julia, please.

1496
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:17,890
- That was good.
- Thank you.

1497
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:25,666
- Not bad. Not bad.
- Thank you.

1498
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:27,173
- But indulge me.
- Okay.

1499
01:19:27,344 --> 01:19:28,936
Okay.

1500
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:34,345
Like I am.

1501
01:19:34,518 --> 01:19:37,578
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

1502
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:42,088
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

1503
01:19:42,259 --> 01:19:44,022
Your country, Pres.

1504
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:48,761
Amy wouldn't understand.
She'd just think there was snakes.

1505
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:50,797
Julia, please.

1506
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:54,169
See the difference?

1507
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,571
Was it louder?

1508
01:20:00,477 --> 01:20:02,968
Oh, my darlings, you are so talented.

1509
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:04,909
That's why you're here, with me.

1510
01:20:05,448 --> 01:20:09,544
But you are so full of yourselves.

1511
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:15,390
Ask yourself why the naked mole-rat mother
allows 30 babies at once...

1512
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:18,960
...to grow inside her,
feed on her every resource...

1513
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:22,428
...and stretch her skin
to the point of breaking.

1514
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:27,426
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Because it feels good.

1515
01:20:28,438 --> 01:20:30,099
She lets it all go. Everything.

1516
01:20:30,273 --> 01:20:33,674
And she's left feeling comfortable
in her own skin.

1517
01:20:33,843 --> 01:20:36,368
Oh, I wish I could jump-cut you babies...

1518
01:20:36,546 --> 01:20:39,743
...right now to the happy place
that I'm in.

1519
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:42,544
I wish, but that's your own journey.

1520
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,584
It's worth it.

1521
01:20:44,754 --> 01:20:46,722
I have learned...

1522
01:20:47,123 --> 01:20:51,025
...that if I can expunge everything within...

1523
01:20:51,294 --> 01:20:54,422
...I am left comfortable...

1524
01:20:54,598 --> 01:20:57,158
...in my own skin.
