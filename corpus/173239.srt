1
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:10,453
This bit was really difficult.

2
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:15,789
I always remember the idea here,
talking with Hans and Julian,

3
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:18,888
was to get this huge overblown intro

4
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:22,332
that almost had
a Star Wars/Wizard of Oz feel,

5
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:26,532
you know, so people thought
we'd gone really Hollywood.

6
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:29,837
But then when the characters appear,
you're really back down

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,640
in Wallace and Gromit's
British territory.

8
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:34,613
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:41,510
It's really nice the way
this captures people immediately,

10
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:47,056
and gives a bit of a backstory
as well to the whole film

11
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,595
and introduces it to people

12
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:52,655
who aren't necessarily familiar
with Wallace and Gromit.

13
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:01,068
I think it was probably the last shot
we did in the shooting.

14
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,972
Yeah. With much discussion.

15
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:06,069
I know, we were both quite reluctant
to put this sequence in.

16
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:07,670
Yeah.

17
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:16,083
I mean, it is a danger...
It could have seemed added on,

18
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:20,422
but... it seems a nice kind of way

19
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,088
just to get into a new,

20
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:27,827
a whole new film years after people
might have seen Wallace and Gromit.

21
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,802
We're so keen on,
I think, capturing the genre

22
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,237
and it's so important for us that,

23
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:37,640
you know, to have that, especially
with this, that horror feeling

24
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:42,011
that it kind of... It did...

25
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,607
It could have had a danger
of being tagged on.

26
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:48,643
Yeah. The original idea we had
was that the camera would just be

27
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:52,818
kind of roving across the moors through
the fog and up to the moon like that,

28
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:57,455
and then coming to the policeman's
footprint like that in the puddle.

29
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:00,500
And we far preferred that idea,

30
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:04,162
but I think it was suggested
that we're just taking too long

31
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,603
to get into the movie
and into the comedy.

32
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,132
There was a lot of talk
of allowing the audience

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,577
to know they can laugh,
which was a good move.

34
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,982
PO Mac there just walked
straight past Harvey's vegetable shop

35
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:22,681
and for a long, long time

36
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,088
there was extra footage there

37
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:30,027
of Peter Kay cracking
these jokes about a big moth

38
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,394
that had frightened the policeman.

39
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,765
Unfortunately it got cut out in the end
to keep the film moving.

40
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,167
Yeah.

41
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,769
There was going to be a shadow
creeping up behind him

42
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,901
as he looked at the poster,
and it turned out to be just a moth

43
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:47,936
in lamplight with kind of feelers
that looked like big ears.

44
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,513
There was probably about a minute's
worth of footage cut out there.

45
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,819
It's probably one of the big losses.

46
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:00,689
There's already
an introduction of, you know,

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,628
knowing there are gonna be a lot
more characters in the movie there.

48
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,859
In the other Wallace and Gromit films,

49
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,959
you know,
Wallace and Gromit are always there,

50
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,800
plus maybe one or two other characters.

51
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:16,832
And we felt that the whole world
had to open up for this movie,

52
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,676
but somehow still retain its colloquial,

53
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,011
local, small feel.

54
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:24,980
Yeah.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,367
The music on this bit
was a big issue for quite a long time,

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,904
keeping it, really ramping it up

57
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:48,270
and making the movie
an exciting beginning,

58
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:52,471
yet at the same time,
keeping that kind of smallness,

59
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:56,004
as you say,
of Wallace and Gromit as well.

60
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:58,812
I think, you know, Julian Nott,

61
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,821
who wrote the music
along with Hans Zimmer,

62
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,517
who was fantastic to work with,

63
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,286
just created a fantastic score.

64
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:11,626
I adore the music for the film.

65
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,689
- It's lovely.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,259
I remember a joke here,
Nick, that we wanted

67
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,898
to reprise Wallace
and Gromit's kind of launch,

68
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:25,308
like you did in Olose Shave,
but we wanted an extra twist on it.

69
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,973
We had a joke for a long time that
they came out of the front of the house,

70
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,675
and after all that palaver
of getting ready,

71
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,550
that Mrs. Mulch's
was actually next door.

72
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,653
They just drove out
to the road and back.

73
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,592
It was incredibly difficult
just to get that across,

74
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:44,596
that it was to show the geography,
that it was just next door.

75
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,688
Yeah.

76
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:51,998
We had so many versions
of this little sequence,

77
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,869
of how to make this funny.

78
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:01,104
Gosh, the amount of times we boarded
and re-boarded, even earlier than this,

79
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,014
when the rabbit comes
into Wallace and Gromit's garden,

80
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,581
of how to get it right.

81
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,450
I always wonder though whether we...

82
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,957
You know, we were so keen
on trying to pull off this idea

83
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,755
that there was some kind
of beast in the town already,

84
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,228
that maybe the Were-Rabbit
already existed

85
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:21,859
and what they were trying
to capture was something large,

86
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,894
and I don't know truly
whether it fully comes off

87
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:28,770
that it actually turns out
to be a little rabbit.

88
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:33,006
That false teeth joke there
was very last-minute addition

89
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,775
to get an extra laugh.

90
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,750
I think there was
a general feeling that there wasn't...

91
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:42,379
People weren't starting to laugh
enough early enough in the film,

92
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:45,891
from test screenings we had.

93
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,327
That always gets a big laugh.

94
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:05,466
This is one of those sequences
that went backwards and forwards

95
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,536
between us for quite a while.

96
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,775
Yeah, you storyboarded it, didn't you?

97
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,680
At one point, yeah.

98
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,742
I started and you took over

99
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,914
and then you edited it all
and then gave it back to me.

100
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,023
There are a few sequences
like that in the film

101
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,229
that went between us for a long while.

102
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:26,731
Yeah.

103
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,302
This was in it from very early on,

104
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,902
but the sequence that kind of
follows this was a very late edition,

105
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,345
probably in the last four weeks
of shoot actually.

106
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:47,114
Again, because we felt we needed
to have some more fun with the bunnies

107
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,678
before the story gets going.

108
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,326
I think it really...
Actually, this sequence coming up here

109
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,990
that you're talking about,
Nick, actually

110
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:02,831
had an extra, you know...
It helped in some ways, I think,

111
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:06,838
to show that their house
was overrun with rabbits.

112
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:10,307
So maybe it was fortuitous in the end,

113
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,742
even though at the time
again we were reluctant

114
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:15,337
to cram more in at the beginning.

115
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:18,313
I think for good reasons
too as well, you know,

116
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:20,909
because I think
it works beautiful in itself,

117
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:25,385
and I'm glad we put it in, but there
was a real risk of it seeming,

118
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,417
you know, an after-thought tacked on
and not quite in keeping with the movie.

119
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:33,125
It had a slight kind
of Warner Bros. Feel to it.

120
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,996
Yeah.

121
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,969
Neither of us probably
would have naturally done this,

122
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,597
but it kind of works.

123
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:45,110
But I think it's right to have that
instinct to be dubious, actually.

124
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:52,110
It's notjust about getting laughs early
on. It's about making a good movie.

125
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,714
This is one of the good jokes
in the film coming up.

126
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,885
- Which was there from so early on.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,090
You boarded it.

128
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,393
I remember
you drawing sketches of all this

129
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:10,300
being hammered through the trap door
when we started writing.

130
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,396
When we started, we spent
about a yearjust brainstorming it,

131
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:16,772
and we thought up most
of the visual jokes then, I think,

132
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:19,175
didn't we, in that first year?

133
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:22,737
We were constantly
writing towards the jokes.

134
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:26,752
We were just trying to find a way
to include all the gags.

135
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,447
Yeah.

136
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:31,306
The music here I think
is absolutely fantastic,

137
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,784
spine-tingling.

138
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,451
It was a very short piece of music

139
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:40,321
that was originally
with Lady Tottington,

140
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:44,693
coming up later in the movie,
as a kind of romantic theme.

141
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,198
And I think Hans suggested

142
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:51,203
that it could be used to represent
Gromit's love for his marrow as well,

143
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,970
and it's just
the most beautiful piece of music.

144
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,710
It was a difficult kind of score...

145
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:07,683
Oue, this bit, because it's
at home with Wallace and Gromit

146
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,746
and not getting too big and orchestral.

147
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:16,058
I mean, Julian's way is usually right

148
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,065
for that smallness of it all
and coziness.

149
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:24,331
And yet this is a movie,
and so it has to be sometimes big.

150
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:28,636
We didn't want
to underline every emotion,

151
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,668
you know, every sentiment, everything
that was being said with a music cue.

152
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:38,848
Yeah, not do the work
for the audience too much.

153
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:43,745
It's a very hard position
to be in as composer, I think,

154
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:48,453
how to play things and how
to complement what's going on visually

155
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,655
without trying to double it

156
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,722
or compete or overstate things.

157
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,797
Looking at the Mind-O-Matic here
and remembering that...

158
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:03,205
I remember when we decided
to include that in this breakfast scene

159
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:06,837
to introduce it for later on,
because for a long, long time

160
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:10,349
itjust came out of the blue,
you know, later in the movie

161
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,976
when Wallace
didn't know what to do with the rabbits

162
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:17,045
and he suddenly
received a package from Russia.

163
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,857
A brainwashing machine, ex-KGB,

164
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,828
and itjust came out of nowhere.

165
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,229
- Wipe the snow off the top of it.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,360
We used to have a whole sequence here
where he demonstrates it

167
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,599
and we cut out
about 30 seconds worth of stuff,

168
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:37,234
but it was felt that it was
doubling up too much when later,

169
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,336
when it actually is...
when it's actually used later.

170
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:44,247
So we lost quite a funny little sequence
of it kind of acting like a toilet

171
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:48,344
as he flushes his cheesy thoughts
back down into his head.

172
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:54,790
I feel the film here...
You suddenly get an inkling

173
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:57,295
that it's gonna be much bigger

174
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,696
than the the other mov...
the shorter films.

175
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,464
And you meet these kind of crazy,

176
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,438
upper-class characters,

177
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,135
fantastically voiced
by Helena and Ralph.

178
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,703
The whole kind of thing
suddenly branches out

179
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:19,275
and you have these new exteriors

180
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:23,846
and 'cause the characters have lips,
it's gonna get more sophisticated.

181
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,021
- Just to make them posh, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:31,954
She's amazing. I love Lady Tottington.

183
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,659
Helena so complemented her.

184
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:39,728
We watched so many movies that
had kind of posh ladies of the manor,

185
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:44,243
The Go-Between and different films.

186
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,308
Barry Lyndon, I remember... Kubrick.

187
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,914
I had such trouble
with this sequence here,

188
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,978
the arrival of Wallace and Gromit.

189
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,547
This got passed around a lot, didn't it?

190
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,458
It did. You worked
on this sequence for months,

191
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,759
probably years, I think,
and at some point...

192
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:09,996
I remember having Victor
singing to Lady Tottington with...

193
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,094
...a lute, playing romantic...

194
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,834
Kneeling and playing romantic songs
while having a picnic.

195
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:20,106
That's right, a whole picnic sequence
where he was offering her a ring

196
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,616
to get engaged and it was the ring
that got sucked into the burrow

197
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:28,017
by the BunVac
instead of his wig at one point.

198
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:31,716
Which I know I was keen on,
which would have been a huge mistake.

199
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,259
The wig was so much more fun.

200
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,724
The first appearance

201
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,824
of quite a bit of OGI
in the BunVac there.

202
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,368
With the bunnies.

203
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:50,602
Yeah, it was very impractical
to do that with clay bunnies, wasn't it?

204
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:52,610
Although you wanted...

205
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:55,943
You made sure
that the clay look was retained there.

206
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,749
I remember one of the animators,
Seamus Malone actually,

207
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,620
trying to animate
about 30 Plasticine bunnies

208
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,717
on cocktail sticks
to see if it could be done.

209
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:13,256
I think he tore his hair out.
It was never gonna work.

210
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,062
You even worked with the OGI guys

211
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:20,265
to keep a stop-frame kind of movement
quality there with the bunnies.

212
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,241
Yeah, there was a bit
of twitching around on the bunnies,

213
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,438
but it kind of ties it in.

214
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,141
MPO did a fantastic job.

215
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:54,498
It was a real clay bunny scanned
into the computer, wasn't it, Steve?

216
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:56,397
Yeah.

217
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,002
With fingerprints and everything
to keep the same look.

218
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,041
I love this little bit.

219
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:06,710
- She's beautiful, Lady Tottington.
- Yes, she is.

220
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:11,179
I remember we showed an early model

221
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,784
of Lady Tottington
to the whole team and everybody,

222
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:18,128
and I think people had real problems

223
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:22,531
that she was so odd,
you know, her hair was so giant.

224
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:27,395
And I remember we stood up
in front of all of them

225
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:31,170
and we said, "Well, we love her.
We think she's wonderful and funny."

226
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:35,180
And they kind of weren't
going for it for a while.

227
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:39,378
I think then when we married her
to Helena's voice,

228
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,421
she became so likeable.

229
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,150
- Yes.
- She's such a positive character.

230
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,159
I remember it being suggested
that we take

231
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:51,458
half an inch off her hair.

232
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,363
I remember not wanting
to take a single millimeter off.

233
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,491
Yeah.

234
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:59,470
You always had that idea
for her hair from really early on,

235
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,938
which is a "T," isn't it?

236
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,203
- Yeah, she was there.
- "T" for Tottington.

237
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:07,678
She reflected... We talked about how,
I remember at the beginning,

238
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:11,239
how she should reflect,
as a nature lover,

239
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,616
reflect the environment around her,
the trees and the clouds.

240
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,583
There's good verbal gags, a toupee.

241
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:25,757
That was a hard one to pull off
with the dialogue with Ralph,

242
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:29,426
to say "toupee,"
but to kind of make it sound

243
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:33,268
like he's asking "to pay,"
but so you know what it means.

244
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,636
Yeah.

245
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,436
Backwards and forwards a bit.

246
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:59,220
A lot of the jokes took a lot
of working on, didn't they?

247
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:00,890
This is classic,

248
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,992
one of the classic
moments in the film, I think.

249
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:08,770
I love how he spins round
and the rabbit stays in the same place

250
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:12,174
- on his shiny bald head.
- Yes, it's nicely done.

251
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:15,441
We had that idea very early on,
didn't we?

252
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,641
And you pulled that off really well.

253
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:23,485
Later on in the movie Wallace
gets a rabbit on his head as well.

254
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,787
Some kind of re-occurring theme there.

255
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,019
Yeah.

256
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:31,154
Fantastic animation
with Lady Tottington here

257
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,929
and that speech is just superb
I think, Jay Grace.

258
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:40,595
I love the way she kind of laughs
in that upper-class toff kind of way

259
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,707
because that really made her funny
as well as sympathetic.

260
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:45,370
Because that really made her funny
as well as sympathetic.

261
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:51,644
Gosh, and this sequence
was how to, I remember,

262
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,777
how to get Wallace infected,

263
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:58,415
you know,
to get him to be the Were-Rabbit

264
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:03,394
was probably one of the biggest hurdles
to overcome in the whole writing process

265
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,987
because, you know, traditionally...
You know,

266
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,829
we watched all these werewolf films,
didn't we, Nick,

267
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,892
you know, with...

268
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,835
- You know...
- Lon Ohaney, Jr.

269
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,899
- Yeah.
- Oliver Reed.

270
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,639
- And of course they all get bitten
- Hammer horror.

271
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:24,342
By a werewolf that already exists,

272
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,250
and their only release
from that is to be shot,

273
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,846
you know, by a silver bullet and killed.

274
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,983
But it had to be Wallace
that was gonna be the Were-Rabbit.

275
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,425
We always knew that.

276
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:40,022
But how to get him infected
and then, you know,

277
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,001
make it so that he could recover
was the most difficult thing.

278
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:48,438
And we didn't want it to be
kind of chemicals or bites.

279
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:51,874
Infections and things. It didn't
seem to go with clay animation,

280
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,038
to be bitten
and have any blood or anything.

281
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,918
We had to sort of
steer this one very carefully.

282
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:06,719
And really it's absolutely preposterous

283
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,022
and ridiculous what happens to him.

284
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:12,393
It doesn't really make a lot of sense,

285
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:16,595
but we thought it was funny that Wallace
tried to rehabilitate the rabbits,

286
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,127
and just by having
their minds merge together

287
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:24,666
it caused this kind of short circuit

288
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,211
of DNA or something technical.

289
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,075
Yeah. These bunnies are OGI,
aren't they?

290
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,141
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,552
That's one of the only jokes
that doesn't play outside the UK

292
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,385
is AY-UP! Magazine.

293
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,693
For obvious reasons.

294
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,129
Outside the northwest.

295
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:52,465
I remember the whole
Mind-O-Matic early on.

296
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,907
It was a completely different machine
as well, like some huge centrifuge

297
00:19:56,976 --> 00:20:00,343
that spun around
and that was all boarded.

298
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,972
Even the maquette
was built when we realized

299
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,243
it had to be this thing
that went on his head.

300
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:08,309
That's right,
it had many forms, didn't it?

301
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,788
I remember, you know, racking my brains

302
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:15,486
because even though it has no logic
really, this crazy logic,

303
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:20,021
it had to kind of
have some kind of logic.

304
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,763
The rabbits were so popular,
weren't they, the little simple rabbits.

305
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,239
We worked so hard
to keep them very basic.

306
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,071
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:14,243
This is the beginning of a lovely
sequence, I think, in the movie.

308
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,311
I always... I say love,

309
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:20,757
and at the same time
find them so difficult,

310
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:24,922
those parts of movies where everything
is just absolutely wonderful

311
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,899
and tranquil and life's great and
you know it's all gonna go wrong.

312
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,603
It's a great part in the movie I think.

313
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:36,129
See this in the cinema,
everyone just goes...

314
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,539
Yeah, for Gromit.

315
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,604
I know, it's like gold, isn't it?
It's like really...

316
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,444
...wins people over
and it's just a vegetable.

317
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,108
Well, it's a dog.

318
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,210
- A vegetable.
- It's a very loving dog.

319
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:53,616
I always feel like this is where
the movie starts when I'm watching it

320
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:57,423
because this is where the story
starts to happen.

321
00:21:57,496 --> 00:22:01,125
It always had a kind of
fairly slow build, didn't it,

322
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,431
from really early on in the script.

323
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:07,472
I mean, so far it's been set up,
I guess.

324
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:14,012
And now this is where
the inciting incident happens.

325
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,639
Starting to meet
all the other characters.

326
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,407
Yeah.

327
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,180
I used to...

328
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,882
I remember looking out the back door
as a kid at the moon

329
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,323
and having to go to bed.

330
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:30,226
Itjust has that very homely feel.

331
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:36,759
We put a rubber bone
in for Gromit there.

332
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:39,804
This, for me, is pure Wallace
and Gromit because it's...

333
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,136
You're seeing it
from the point of Gromit

334
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,267
and yet Gromit also lacks knowledge,

335
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:48,404
at this point, of what's going on.

336
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,917
And, plus, we're playing
a big red herring here.

337
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:54,653
Yes. Yeah, and that was...

338
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,587
Yes. Yeah, and that was...

339
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,146
That took a while
to evolve in the film, didn't it?

340
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:02,990
It did, yeah. It was taken out
completely at one point.

341
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:06,031
- I love the vicar. He's great.
- Yeah, I love him.

342
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,534
- Nicholas Smith, perfect vicar.
- Yeah.

343
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:13,560
Again this is, you know,
we so watched so many other...

344
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:17,871
We're such fans of all movies
and, you know, watching horror films,

345
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,740
there's always this bit

346
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:22,781
where you meet this character
who's not a main character

347
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:26,113
and you know he's gonna get attacked,
you just know he's had it.

348
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,685
And I think...

349
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:32,485
There's a werewolf film...

350
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,663
I always like thatjoke.

351
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,565
- That's a very early joke.
- It gets a good laugh.

352
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,034
That was one of our early jokes,
wasn't it?

353
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,636
Many visual jokes.

354
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:51,142
And the fog in the graveyard
was a challenge here

355
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,644
that we used throughout the film,
didn't we?

356
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:54,701
Yeah.

357
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,773
So the animation was shot
and the characters were removed

358
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,319
and the same camera move was done

359
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:05,618
but we'd actually
blasted smoke onto the set,

360
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:11,323
so it really is hanging over the sets
and the two were composited together

361
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,524
and we had extra OG smoke put on.

362
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,264
I always like thatjoke.

363
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,332
Was that Mark Burton's joke?
Very funny.

364
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,969
Mark was such a great addition.

365
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:30,276
He was a gag writer on Ohicken Run

366
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:32,783
and came in more as a, you know,

367
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:37,447
to help us out on the script
structure and dialogue on this one.

368
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:41,493
He's great at those
one-off gags as well.

369
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,826
I remember that sketch you did of that,
really early on with the cucumbers.

370
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:49,891
- This scene was in from the beginning.
- It was the first scene shot, I think.

371
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:54,098
I mean, whether it was completely
shot... Oh, and some of the launch.

372
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,665
This was one of the more
elaborate scenes shot early on

373
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:00,906
because it was always constant.

374
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,447
We had faith
that it wouldn't get cut out.

375
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,244
Yeah.

376
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:09,548
I think it's because you really
know where you are in the movie,

377
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:14,251
you know it's sending up
the whole horror genre.

378
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:26,900
It's a great idea,
the shape of the beast in the fog there.

379
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:31,909
I often find that gets a good laugh
as well, all the flashing eyes.

380
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,838
Yeah, yeah.
I never thought that would actually.

381
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,475
This bit, there was a lot of talk
of cutting this out.

382
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,542
Actually we did
and we put it back in,

383
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,646
whether Gromit should see
anything around the house.

384
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:48,124
And I think, in the end,
it gave a slight breathing space

385
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:50,593
after the town had been attacked.

386
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:54,397
And, actually,
what you can realize later on

387
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:58,266
is that it's actually Hutch
that's been out looking for cheese.

388
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,836
Yeah.

389
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,173
I just like the way with Gromit...
It's the start of a Gromit movie,

390
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:09,611
because he's suspicious of something.

391
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:15,354
Fantastic. Peter Kay
doing the voice of PO Mackintosh.

392
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:17,686
Fantastic. Peter Kay
doing the voice of PO Mackintosh.

393
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,781
This must have been
a nightmare to shoot.

394
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,849
This was... Yeah.

395
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:25,727
This was my difficult part.

396
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,062
The scene was always there, wasn't it?

397
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:33,070
It was, you know, like the scene
in Jaws when everyone gets together

398
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:36,938
and they have to decide
how to deal with this problem,

399
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,738
you know, from all sorts of...

400
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,801
Yeah, we watched Jaws, didn't we?

401
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:43,678
Titfield Thunderbolt.

402
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:46,912
Yeah, a big meeting
where everyone's at odds.

403
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,345
They make a decision

404
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:53,858
and then that moves
on the rest of the movie then.

405
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:58,124
A lot of these horror movies, like
Ealing comedies and what have you...

406
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:02,030
The Invisible Man has a
skeptical policeman like Peter Kay.

407
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,194
- Where there's a town hall meeting.
- They're always wrong.

408
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,737
Yeah.

409
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:09,840
And the vicar,
who's on a single-minded mission

410
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:13,503
to rid the world of evil
and seems to have all the knowledge.

411
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,913
I became so fond of all the characters,

412
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:21,350
all the other townspeople.

413
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:26,084
What was difficult in this scene,
we talked about it so much,

414
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:30,322
was keeping Wallace and Gromit
involved and I really do...

415
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:33,956
You know, I did realize as it went on,
that they were a little absent,

416
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,900
but it kind ofjust
gets away with it I think.

417
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,838
You allow them to be out of it

418
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,898
because of the gags and everything.

419
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:45,967
Yeah. Great gag, that.

420
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:49,070
- One of the oldest, but one of...
- It's an old joke.

421
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,138
But they're the best, aren't they?

422
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:57,445
I think there were something
like 50 or 60 characters

423
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:00,719
in this sequence
and, you know, throughout...

424
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:04,455
We were filming the sequence
on two or three sets simultaneously.

425
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,963
I think it took about a year
to do the sequence,

426
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:10,729
you know, with a couple
of animators every day.

427
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:12,633
So we were shooting it out of sequence

428
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,502
and all these characters
were constantly moving around

429
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,304
and so they had to have charts
of where they were

430
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,777
and where they were gonna be.

431
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:23,337
It was quite a thing
to keep tabs on them all.

432
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,407
Oh, yeah, continuity nightmare.

433
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:30,387
Never thought thatjoke with Phillip
and the angel worked very well.

434
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,017
- It's OK though. I don't mind it.
- It's punctuation.

435
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:38,756
I don't think people quite understand
where the angel's come from.

436
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,765
It's supposed to be loosened
by Victor's gunshot.

437
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:46,429
This always gets a good reaction,
the angel versus the devil.

438
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,937
I must admit I did doubt on that

439
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,637
when I saw it on storyboards,
that it was, you know,

440
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:57,170
it was OK to go along with,
but it really works a treat.

441
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,018
I think what this scene
just manages to pull off,

442
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:04,487
that all these people
are completely crazy actually.

443
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,284
Wallace and Gromit's world
is inhabited by people

444
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,625
that are equally as mad as them.

445
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:15,462
Yeah. It is actually the first time
we've met other people in their world,

446
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:18,230
actually, which was always an issue.

447
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,362
How that's gonna go down.

448
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:27,168
I love Gromit's reaction here,
just there when he nods to Wallace.

449
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,510
- The old Wallace wave.
- Yeah.

450
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,017
Oomes in very handy
at the end of the film.

451
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:11,982
I think the sequence is fantastic here
with the lady Were-Rabbit.

452
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:16,588
This was a difficult part
of the film to write, wasn't it?

453
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:21,064
It was. We went through different
versions of this actually, I remember.

454
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:24,591
The sequence where they
sat in their car drinking soup.

455
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:29,072
Yeah, and Victor sometimes was gonna
appear in this sequence, wasn't he?

456
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,574
To threaten them.

457
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:33,907
Oh, that's right, yeah.
It took a long time to land on this.

458
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,277
Once we'd got this
it seemed to come together.

459
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,381
The handy female Were-Rabbit costume

460
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:44,422
that we could then
use later in the movie.

461
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,718
- Very much from The Pink Panther.
- Peter Sellers.

462
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:53,230
We had many different ambitions
with that costume, didn't we,

463
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:55,266
and which all went out of the window.

464
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:01,265
Yeah, Wallace and Gromit had
this wicked neighbor, Mr. Wormald,

465
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:06,902
who was a vegetable
steroid enhancing cheat.

466
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,441
Oheat at vegetable growing.

467
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:11,948
And he ended up
in the costume at one point.

468
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:22,155
Gromit in the roof, that was originally
gonna happen in the garage door.

469
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:23,489
Of the house.

470
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,393
There was gonna be some struggle.

471
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,556
- I think when Victor comes...
- Later on.

472
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:30,692
...to shoot Wallace,
Gromit was gonna be struggling with him

473
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,294
and was kicked into
the aluminum garage door.

474
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,896
- By the Were-Rabbit.
- It made its way into the van.

475
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:39,171
Yeah. Gosh, we had so many
versions of this sequence.

476
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:46,339
It was often trying to serve
too many purposes in the story,

477
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:50,514
and then I remember when Mark came
in and we worked on it a lot together,

478
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,523
we sort of very slowly simplified it.

479
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,156
We had to pull off here that, you know,
Wallace had gone to get the costume,

480
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,961
but not kind of...

481
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:09,803
I hope the audience didn't
get suspicious, too suspicious,

482
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:15,141
you know, to begin to think
that the Were-Rabbit was Wallace.

483
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:17,306
I think it pulls it off well actually.

484
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:21,079
Yeah, I'm always wondering whether
this worked as well as I wanted it to,

485
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,279
you know, the ears remaining here.

486
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:29,191
I'm not sure people see that or not,
or whether the music cued it, but...

487
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,094
I always thought people
mightjump more at this bit.

488
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:34,631
They did at one point.
I'm not sure what happened.

489
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:35,893
Yeah.

490
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,396
Like in the test screenings we had,
people jumped more

491
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,939
than in the final version
and I'm really not sure.

492
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:45,773
I think it's subtle changes
in editing and the music.

493
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:48,438
I think it was right in the end.

494
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,078
- This took a lot of editing.
- Really exciting sequence.

495
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,211
The music is fantastic as well.

496
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:01,022
We had all sorts of bits in here
as well of him seeing the vicar...

497
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,116
Oh, boy.

498
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:05,060
We tried for ages
to put more gags in this bit.

499
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,067
I do sometimes wish there
was a better gag here or there, but...

500
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:16,000
Gosh, we shot quite a bit more
footage here on the end of each shot,

501
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:21,808
you know, trimmed every shot
by about 75 percent... probably.

502
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,283
It was hard for you, I know,
to keep the Were-Rabbit out of shot

503
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:29,616
- without giving him away.
- That was quite a policy that came in.

504
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:32,555
I always wish that this gag
was a bit funnier, just there.

505
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,889
We once had him sliding
into somebody's marrow

506
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,485
and it said "squash" next to it,

507
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:41,464
and I thought that was quite funny.

508
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,491
There's great tension here.

509
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:51,175
I love Gromit's eye-roll
just before he plummets into the abyss.

510
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:52,937
Oh, yeah, it was mad, this.

511
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,672
It was always too long, this sequence.

512
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:59,649
It took quite a bit of editing down.

513
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:03,586
All that mud is OGI is it, Nick?
Flying towards the camera?

514
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:08,149
The mud on the window is real,
but any mud in the air flying

515
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:10,421
with kind of blur-effect

516
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,362
is put on afterwards by MPO OGI guys.

517
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,025
This makes me laugh.

518
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:28,006
I like the change in tone
on the music there in the greenhouse.

519
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,014
Tranquility about to be disturbed.

520
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,950
It's funny, they're so worried
for their vegetables.

521
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,148
Yeah.

522
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:44,821
Sort of a OGI there
with the mud being kicked up, just here.

523
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:48,490
Fantastic.

524
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,696
I remember the van used to get...

525
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:55,262
In an earlier version
it got destroyed, didn't it?

526
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,900
It was just a chassis with a seat on it.

527
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,534
And the airbags still came out.

528
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:02,205
That's right,
we always had that gag, didn't we?

529
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:05,079
It's a great gag.

530
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:10,449
I remember here there was a shot
cut out. It was Gromit checking...

531
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,956
I wonder whether we
should have lost that really?

532
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,151
I kind of slightly miss it a little bit.

533
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,023
- Director's cut?
- Yeah, maybe.

534
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:19,461
Or the other director's cut.

535
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:22,159
One of the directors' cuts.

536
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,363
He looked back and checked his marrow
and it helped let you know where he was.

537
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:30,365
You know, it isn't here
or there really, I don't know.

538
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,577
It's interesting, I...

539
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,885
I suppose other people feel the same,
but I really don't suspect

540
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:49,757
that the Were-Rabbit's Wallace here
even though I know it full well.

541
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,022
You know it quite well.

542
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:54,690
I believe he's
just gone home in a temper

543
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:58,429
and it's quite a successful red herring.

544
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:34,931
This is Gromit the sleuth really,
isn't it?

545
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:38,032
Gromit... Gromit wondering...

546
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:41,101
I mean, the whole movie
revolves around Gromit.

547
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:43,409
It's Gromit's film here.

548
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:49,081
I remember, you know,
particularly myself doing sequences,

549
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,280
if I ever got into trouble...

550
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:55,158
...you know, keeping it on track,

551
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:58,218
I think the key
was to see what Gromit was doing,

552
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:02,733
and to make sure you were experiencing
the movie through his eyes.

553
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:08,031
Yeah, that was always the kind of
savior, wasn't it, to think like that.

554
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:11,735
The best notes were always:
Tell it from Gromit's point of view.

555
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:16,678
Sometimes it would only take
an extra couple of cutaways.

556
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,613
Yeah.

557
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,488
Good old bodily function.

558
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:30,027
I think that would have been
a very base bodily function joke

559
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,494
if it wasn't for Gromit wafting the air,

560
00:37:32,564 --> 00:37:36,159
because that kind of helped it I think.

561
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,293
Gromit's so cute here.

562
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:46,541
This explanation of how the Were-Rabbit
occurs every night is a bit...

563
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:47,976
Exposition.

564
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:50,981
Shouldn't be listened to too intensely.

565
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:53,017
It comes across as a bit expositional,

566
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:55,882
but I think it's all right
because of the way it's done.

567
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:59,856
Also you're gonna find out very soon
that it's obviously a load of rubbish.

568
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,915
It's a complete red herring.

569
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:06,395
This reminds me
of Grand Day Out in some ways.

570
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:14,065
Yeah, 'cause that's obviously
not the Were-Rabbit, is it?

571
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:16,163
Something's wrong here.

572
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,643
I always wonder whether people catch
the word "botch" there on the rivet gun.

573
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,976
I've heard them saying it in the cinema.

574
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,844
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

575
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,278
It's amazing what people spot.

576
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:30,253
People always spot
the footprints there as well,

577
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,721
you know, over Gromit's shoulder.

578
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,122
Do they? I love the music round here.

579
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:40,522
For me, this is pure Wrong Trousers.

580
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,266
Film noir.

581
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,632
Yeah, it reminds me of Hitchcock.

582
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:50,538
I guess the stairs and, you know...

583
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:55,102
"Is it in the house as well?"
Is a slight thing in people's minds.

584
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,613
Yeah.

585
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:00,378
This is a great idea of yours, Nick,

586
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,284
of rabbit feet turning to human feet.

587
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:06,152
- Fantastic.
- Do you think people see that?

588
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,125
I don't know. I don't know. But I do.

589
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,384
That was the idea.

590
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,396
It was quite hard
to edit it to make it...

591
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,557
And this little bit here took a lot...

592
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:18,158
We both played around
with the edit of this bit

593
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:21,672
and with Greg and Dave, the editors.

594
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:31,816
Lady Tottington's
like toff on helium here.

595
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:36,276
Lady Tottington's
like toff on helium here.

596
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:39,781
She's completely bonkers.

597
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:42,087
I love her.

598
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,893
I remember thinking of things like
Silence of the Lambs here, you know,

599
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:50,263
when the murderer's gone round
to the victim's house.

600
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:55,767
Not quite as sinister.

601
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,472
And the sets of the interior of Lady
Tottington's house were amazing.

602
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:03,275
Fantastic.

603
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:06,043
I love the paintings of her ancestors.

604
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:09,018
Yeah, lots of background detail.

605
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,784
- I always think that's hilarious.
- But it doesn't get much of a reaction.

606
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:16,019
I don't know why. I'm not sure why.

607
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:25,734
What I like about Lady Tottington
is that you realize she's quite naughty.

608
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:28,363
She has a side to her, she's...

609
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,965
Which just gives her that extra edge.

610
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,409
She's notjust nice.

611
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,674
I mean, she is nice, but...

612
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,015
It's an important side
of her that, isn't it?

613
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:45,715
I think it's to do with nature loving,

614
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,384
and, you know, growing vegetables.

615
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,917
There's this fantastic,
heavenly conservatory.

616
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:53,657
The way you pull this off, Steve,

617
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:56,359
we had this vision for this
for a long time, didn't we?

618
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,232
This scene of rising
into the conservatory.

619
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:06,910
And Dave Riddett and I...
Dave, our DOP...

620
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:12,416
We looked at lots of postcards
and prints of Pre-Raphaelite paintings,

621
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:15,748
you know, with these women
in these fantastic silk dresses

622
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,756
kind of playing flutes
surrounded by plants

623
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,849
and the sunset behind them.

624
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,417
And I think Dave
so made it look like that,

625
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,656
the color scheme
and, you know, the puppets

626
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:30,428
and the set designs.

627
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:34,130
It also has a... It reminds me
of The Empire Strikes Back as well

628
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:36,400
and Oloud Oity.

629
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:39,910
I mean, a lot of the cinematography
and the lighting is, you know,

630
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:43,538
treated by, you know, our chief
cinematographers Dave Alex Riddett

631
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:46,412
and Tristan Oliver, as a serious movie.

632
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,611
It's real serious filmmaking.

633
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:53,917
It's not lit for kids or anything,
you know.

634
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,589
A very funny scene.

635
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,208
I remember I had a lot...

636
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:16,303
Storyboarding this,
I had to cut so much out as well.

637
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,783
I wanted, you know,
some of the slightly naughtierjokes,

638
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,514
and I think there
were more of them originally.

639
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:27,149
I think it was
my slight affectionate nod

640
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:30,661
towards Benny Hill and Oarry On.

641
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:33,697
You know, I realize now
how un-PO they are,

642
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,631
but at the time, as a kid,
I loved those films.

643
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:39,261
I think it's got about
the right balance, hasn't it?

644
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,862
And it's kind of naughty,
but it's all suggested.

645
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,240
Yeah. They do it so innocently
as well, I think, that...

646
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:48,903
Yeah.

647
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,144
I'm never sure that you quite
understand what's happening here, but...

648
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:54,878
Yeah. It's clear.

649
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,219
A lot of editing.

650
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,349
Yeah.

651
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:04,362
That water there was done with OGI,

652
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,125
That water there was done with OGI,

653
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:08,961
although Dan did a greatjob here
with the animation,

654
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:13,732
and tried to do it with using bits
of resin and gel on his hands.

655
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:18,537
We try as much as we can, don't we,
to keep everything in camera.

656
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,634
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:24,306
The way this is all shot, you'll...

658
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:28,443
Tristan... Tristan's lighting
is great in this scene.

659
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:31,181
It was a good moment
to take the music out, I remember.

660
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:33,280
That was a really good choice,

661
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:37,225
'cause that was scored and we thought
it was greatjust to let them chat.

662
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:40,162
It really gave a... It's good.

663
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,892
It gave it a breathing space.

664
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,868
It also made you aware that
something bad was going to happen.

665
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:48,735
- The gaps can be...
- Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:52,936
...as poignant as the music
itself sometimes can't.

667
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:58,245
I think, for me, Nick, this is one
of my favorite sequences in the movie

668
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:01,183
that, you know,
you work so hard on, and...

669
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:04,813
Because it's almost like
the essence of the film, I think.

670
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,120
This is kind of... I sometimes feel
this is why we did the whole film,

671
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:11,889
for this sequence,
just for that transformation.

672
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:15,524
And I love it that the bully,
Victor, really gets...

673
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,159
You know, he's gonna beat him up,

674
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:21,466
but he's the one
who really gets the beating.

675
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:22,938
It's so rewarding.

676
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:26,204
It was great fun to do
and a lot of work.

677
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:33,810
And from the very earliest
horror movies, werewolf movies...

678
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:37,081
In The Hound of the Baskervilles,
with the, you know,

679
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,952
- upper-class villain.
- Yes. Yes.

680
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:42,959
That's one of my favorite jokes,
that one.

681
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:46,224
Gromit locking the door
cause he's all full of anticipation

682
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:47,628
and knowledge of...

683
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:49,563
You know what Gromit knows,

684
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:52,466
but you don't quite know
how it's gonna happen.

685
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:55,300
I always wish we hadn't seen
Wallace in that shot,

686
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:58,968
because I think it slightly takes away
from the mystery.

687
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:01,372
I think you're OK.

688
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,233
You just know you're in for fun here.

689
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,136
And that was the challenge, was...

690
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,471
'Oause we often had it as too horrific.

691
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,602
And it was like, how to keep it

692
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:37,613
at the same time
real genre on the horror movies,

693
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,081
but a real reference
to horror movie genre

694
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,449
and yet at the same time real comedy?

695
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,354
I think the music again is good
with that kind of barrel organ.

696
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:48,949
That almost burlesque fairground.

697
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:52,955
- The temp music was often too dark.
- Yeah.

698
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,363
Too heavy on the strings.
It felt like genuine horror.

699
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,696
Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:45:57,768 --> 00:46:00,430
- He's quite scary in some ways.
- Yeah.

701
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:03,098
But that's great, you know.
Kids love it as well.

702
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:05,369
Yeah. I love thatjoke. David Bowers...

703
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:08,708
A very early joke that David Bowers,
storyboard artist, did.

704
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:13,182
And I'm so proud of lan's animation
on the Were-Rabbit here.

705
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,616
We really wanted him
to have that feeling

706
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:17,847
of a sort of Ray Harryhausen,

707
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:22,325
- Willis O'Brien, furry monster.
- Yeah. That's right.

708
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:24,054
A monster with a character.

709
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:25,755
We could have done it OGI,

710
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,994
but we couldn't have found the money
to do it 'cause it's so expensive.

711
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:33,867
We wanted it to have
that vintage King Kong quality.

712
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,997
I love this joke with the rabbits.

713
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,337
There's no reason for them to have...

714
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:40,741
Oompletely arbitrary joke.

715
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:45,271
I remember we talked also
about the Were-Rabbit,

716
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:47,340
that he's furry,

717
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:50,683
but somehow you can see
in his eyes that Wallace is inside,

718
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:53,518
trapped inside,
and I think that comes across.

719
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:56,355
- Yeah. The bow tie helps too.
- Yes.

720
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:59,362
I love this fantastic,

721
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,297
sort of melodramatic,

722
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,358
over-the-top reactions
with the lightning.

723
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,498
It's a big change in the movie here
'cause Victor knows now.

724
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:14,237
These were kind of two big scenes
in a way, apart from the conservatory?

725
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,041
Then you came...
After I finished on that scene,

726
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,878
- then you came into your own here,
- Yeah.

727
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,182
With Victor really coming out
in terms of his evil.

728
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:26,917
- Yeah.
- He comes into his own here.

729
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:29,050
The lighting is great as well here.

730
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:30,388
Yeah.

731
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:08,025
This sequence
just had to be filled with...

732
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:12,928
Well, you know, you had to get
into that mood of revelation.

733
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,563
Everything had to be a joke.

734
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:21,244
The lightning and the rain.

735
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:24,770
The performances are so serious
from Ralph and the vicar,

736
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:26,839
but it's just crazy.

737
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:30,318
It was so gothic. Kind of camp gothic.

738
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,658
This is where it really does
the horror movie genre again.

739
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:37,853
You know where you are
and it's pure spoof.

740
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:44,589
I love Nicholas Smith's performance.
He's so crazy.

741
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:47,364
Though you can't tell
what he's saying sometimes.

742
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:50,407
He's very good with Ralph
as well 'cause it's so...

743
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:53,204
Ralph's so straight and in a mood,

744
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:57,008
but he goes off on these crazy tangents.

745
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:00,545
It's great to hear Ralph
doing comedy actually.

746
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:02,142
Superb. Yeah.

747
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,281
I think this idea... I know
Dave Bowers boarded this early on,

748
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:10,486
but I think that idea
of the bullet thing came from Jeffrey.

749
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:14,292
Am I right in remembering?
"A bullet, a bullet, a bullet..."

750
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:16,765
- Oh, yeah.
- We were pitching it to Jeffrey

751
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:18,859
- That's right.
- And he kept...

752
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:24,608
- That was yours?
- Oheesiestjoke in the movie.

753
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:25,734
- That was yours?
- Oheesiestjoke in the movie.

754
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,267
Steve's joke, that.
But it works incredibly well.

755
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:32,247
It's like it had to have that
at the end when we hit on it.

756
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:35,846
- And that's yours there, Nick.
- That's right.

757
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,615
But there's always
that danger of it not coming off

758
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:42,056
'cause it's a sort of knowing
kind ofjoke to the audience.

759
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:43,525
But it really does work.

760
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:47,387
It's at times like that

761
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:50,126
that I feel there is a hint of Naked Gun

762
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,658
or Police Squad! In the movie.

763
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:57,400
Some of the jokes are so corny
and, of course, we know it,

764
00:49:57,474 --> 00:50:02,138
but it's great
'cause everyone is in the film.

765
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,703
They're all taking things so seriously.

766
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:08,115
It's real drama playing out
and yet it's completely crazy.

767
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,953
They're having fun as well.

768
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:16,617
I really kind of enjoyed this scene,
actually.

769
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:20,790
The tension and the way
you're with Gromit.

770
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:24,891
It's nice for this kind of quiet bit
after all that activity.

771
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:31,303
It feels like you're getting
towards the end of the film.

772
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:34,367
You're on the home run towards the end.

773
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:36,310
And now it's about the characters.

774
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,314
It's about our main characters now.

775
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:39,849
Yeah.

776
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,715
It's got to go somewhere here,
hasn't it, the story.

777
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,252
That's great.

778
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,263
No apology for thatjoke.

779
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:03,670
It was one of the firstjokes
that we thought of.

780
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,141
I love the dialogue here,

781
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,145
which I think was, again,
was quite early on, actually.

782
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:12,478
I think it was in another place
originally in the script.

783
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:17,043
But the sense of what he's saying
was very similar for a long time.

784
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:21,683
I think we all wrote it, you know,
at one point, didn't we?

785
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:22,987
Yeah.

786
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,654
I love how stupid Wallace is.

787
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:30,326
And the music. The use of the
Wallace and Gromit theme is really good.

788
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:32,232
Yeah.

789
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,761
It's a scene between the two of them.

790
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:38,001
This is what makes it worthwhile,
you know.

791
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:40,210
There's that quirkiness
of the scene itself.

792
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,178
There's that quirkiness
of the scene itself.

793
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:45,579
You know, one character has ears
and completely in denial

794
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:48,447
of him being the Were-Rabbit.

795
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:50,578
And Gromit can't... He's a silent dog.

796
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,919
He can't find a way of explaining it.
It's a great dilemma.

797
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,117
A dramatic dilemma.

798
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:03,663
I really don't think people expect this,

799
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,259
you know, what's about
to happen here as well.

800
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,395
That's such a good reaction, you know.

801
00:52:08,472 --> 00:52:12,533
OK, so he's the Were-Rabbit.
But what happened to Hutch?

802
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,476
I don't think people are quite ahead...

803
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:18,071
You know, they haven't
got that far in yet.

804
00:52:18,148 --> 00:52:20,616
When he speaks,
it's such a great reaction.

805
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:22,982
At every point along the way
in every scene

806
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:26,181
we tried really hard to kind of
not do what people expect

807
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:29,350
and be a bit out... away from formula,

808
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:32,361
and be a constant quirky...

809
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:36,365
Oonstantly quirky
at every different story point.

810
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,467
Peter Sallis still.

811
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:47,772
- Speeded up.
- Just speeded up. Yeah.

812
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,972
He did all of Hutch, didn't he?

813
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:57,713
From here on until, you know,

814
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:02,384
you're getting towards the fairground
at the end, I find it so difficult.

815
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:06,793
This run of sequences
was so long to work out

816
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:11,198
and to get that bridge
to the final confrontation.

817
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:13,632
Yeah.

818
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:21,677
It's nice to get back into daylight

819
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:24,213
and into a more
lighter scene like this...

820
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,312
...that then takes this turn.

821
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:31,149
A very contentious line there,
the brassicas line.

822
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:33,086
Yes. I'm glad it stayed in, though.

823
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:37,024
Yeah. I am. I really am.
It's official, on record.

824
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:39,289
It was so, you know...

825
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:41,422
People so wanted us to take it out

826
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:46,561
and if you think about it
then it is a little bit risky maybe.

827
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:48,969
But it happens so quickly.

828
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,064
It's just part of the color of the film.

829
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,575
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's OK.

830
00:53:53,644 --> 00:53:56,078
I think you do need it,
actually, in the scene.

831
00:53:56,914 --> 00:54:00,850
We did cut it out
and it seemed to go too quickly.

832
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:02,510
Yeah.

833
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:05,350
And you need to know
what the villagers are thinking

834
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:09,381
for her to reach this conclusion
that she has to turn to Victor.

835
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,528
They have to pressure her
into this decision.

836
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,163
And it's a funny joke anyway.

837
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:20,993
Yeah.

838
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:24,172
Sometimes something's
gotta stay in 'cause it's funny.

839
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,777
This short sequence
was difficult as well.

840
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:31,871
I think it was almost a hangover
from earlier scripts,

841
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:35,441
but shooting this
was so late on in the process that...

842
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:40,888
...you know, it was hard
to find a better way through.

843
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:44,621
And I somehow feel we
should have used Hutch more here.

844
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:49,725
- More use of him being like Wallace.
- Right.

845
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,030
And yet the touching moment
is quite nice.

846
00:54:52,102 --> 00:54:54,434
Yeah. No, it works well.

847
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:58,440
It's always difficult when you're
working with a scene that's an overhang,

848
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:02,376
that's got a lot of history to it,
and was once much bigger.

849
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:06,177
I think what was happening around
the time when we were filming this,

850
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:08,774
we were still working out the ending,

851
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:11,343
and at that time we always felt

852
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:15,687
that Wallace was gonna have to go back
into the Mind-O-Matic with Hutch

853
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,317
to reverse the experiment.

854
00:55:17,394 --> 00:55:21,660
So we felt that we needed
to get this machine repaired.

855
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:25,834
Now what's happening
is that Wallace can't do it,

856
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:28,666
but because Hutch
is like Wallace, he can.

857
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:31,333
And so this was being shot

858
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:34,741
when that was
making its way out of the film.

859
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:37,939
Yeah, and it's a less important
story point now, isn't it?

860
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:41,075
It's just important that it starts
to get positive again

861
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:43,016
before it starts to get bad again.

862
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,111
There's a whole thing, I know, here,

863
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:48,988
that a film we don't often talk about
that we watched a lot was The Fly.

864
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:51,619
You know, that the...

865
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,493
The original version,
where the fly itself

866
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:58,295
is actually quite crucial
to putting things back to normal.

867
00:55:58,368 --> 00:56:01,826
And there's a sequence
where the fly goes out the window

868
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:04,305
and it has the, you know,

869
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,842
that essence of the man in it that...

870
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,572
Lost his kind of alter ego
or whatever.

871
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:12,581
And Hutch was gonna
take on that role, actually,

872
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:14,776
very much in earlier scripts.

873
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:19,788
Hutch was gonna join this
George Formby Society band and leave.

874
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:22,086
They had to go and get him back.

875
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,524
Oan't even go there.

876
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:26,589
- That was another story.
- Yeah.

877
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:29,257
But it didn't kind of go that way.

878
00:56:29,332 --> 00:56:31,129
No, no.

879
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:32,862
I love... I love the comedy,

880
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:35,769
you know, the basic
comedy set-up of this scene

881
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,330
of her...

882
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:42,003
...her coming to tell him
this terrible news

883
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,482
while him trying to cope
with turning into a Were-Rabbit

884
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,782
- and trying to keep it a secret.
- It's so difficult when that happens.

885
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:55,414
I can imagine.

886
00:56:55,492 --> 00:57:00,020
And she's so... She's come round to say,
"Look, I really care for you, you know."

887
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:02,361
She really likes him

888
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:04,662
and he has to slam the door
in her face.

889
00:57:04,735 --> 00:57:05,724
Yeah.

890
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,500
- People really feel for her here.
- Yeah.

891
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:13,509
Notice as she walks away,
everyone goes "aww" when she cries.

892
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:16,746
And we thought it would just be funny.

893
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:18,178
Yeah, yeah.

894
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:23,582
This is, I think, Mark's joke again.

895
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:26,053
The final rout. The final insult.

896
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,657
And the tears there were...

897
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:31,660
They took so long to get them
to look right,

898
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:34,925
and I'm still aware that they look
kind of slightly awkward.

899
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:38,798
But it was a real homage to
one of my favorite animated films.

900
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:42,862
I think one of yours as well, Nick,
The Big Snit, Richard Oondie.

901
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:45,464
And the sound of the tears
hitting the floor.

902
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:52,873
Oh, this was such hard work,
this sequence.

903
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:56,282
This area of the film was hard.
We went backwards and forwards.

904
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,116
We had much bigger sequences,

905
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,816
like the Space Hopper scene itself was...

906
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:04,088
When he jumps on the Space Hopper,
was enormous at one point.

907
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,789
- It was a huge sequence.
- Like the end of the film,

908
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,956
- which is why we cut it.
- Yeah.

909
00:58:09,933 --> 00:58:13,164
I somehow feel like
I wish it had more energy here,

910
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,033
but... I don't know.

911
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,701
I like this bit.

912
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:22,940
Nice line.

913
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:24,742
I like the lighting.

914
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:28,581
Very bright colors here.
Striking yellow.

915
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:31,917
I think we were trying
to keep it colorful and rich

916
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:34,081
like a sort of Disney film.

917
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,454
The colors are lovely in the movie.

918
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:46,962
So, yeah, this would have been
the beginning of a huge chase.

919
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:50,395
This idea was always in, wasn't it?

920
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:53,965
From the beginning
this kind of... him, Wallace...

921
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:57,138
We thought it was funny,
Wallace starting to get romantic

922
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:59,546
with the decoy
that he made in the first place.

923
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:00,605
Yeah.

924
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,313
It doesn't bear thinking about too much.

925
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:17,695
Poor Lady Tottington.

926
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:45,124
I think you realize just how selfish
the townspeople are really.

927
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:48,792
Just happy to be rid of it.

928
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,463
And also I remember
you did that scene, Steven,

929
00:59:52,535 --> 00:59:56,403
and you were asked to change
Mr. Growbag's flask of brandy

930
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,567
- for a carrotjuice carton.
- Yeah.

931
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:02,874
Which is ridiculous 'cause
you would never have spotted it.

932
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,607
It was just a hip flask.

933
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:17,252
That's a bit of subtle acting
from Victor here.

934
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:37,338
This took a lot of working
on this edit, didn't it?

935
01:00:37,414 --> 01:00:41,475
This whole sequence, 'cause it's like
how does act two go into act three?

936
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:46,113
And it took a lot of work
to unfold it quite a bit, didn't we?

937
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:48,454
Yeah.

938
01:00:48,858 --> 01:00:52,851
I remember, at one point, Gromit
believed Wallace was dead as well

939
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:54,764
and went home, sadly went home,

940
01:00:54,764 --> 01:00:56,197
and went home, sadly went home,

941
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:58,257
to the tune of Bright Eyes.

942
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:02,034
And Hutch was there,

943
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:06,974
and discovered in a newspaper
that the beast was still at large.

944
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:08,943
This is the bestjoke in the movie.

945
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:16,879
And it was a contentious one.

946
01:01:27,697 --> 01:01:31,292
I'm amazed how many people
spot the writing on the stall there.

947
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:32,426
Yeah.

948
01:01:33,636 --> 01:01:36,230
- "Oats 'n burgers."
- That's right. There.

949
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:39,575
I love this joke.

950
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:44,775
Growbag's great.

951
01:01:53,523 --> 01:01:55,787
We loved those, you know...

952
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:59,260
We loved ending the film
in the fairground and thinking...

953
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:02,457
Watching stuff like Strangers On a Train

954
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:06,263
at nighttime in the fairground.

955
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:09,328
The models and the props
are just stunning.

956
01:02:10,774 --> 01:02:14,210
- I think it's a good joke.
- You pulled that one off well, Steve.

957
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:18,941
- It's a good laugh.
- You boarded this, didn't you?

958
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:23,008
This whole sequence went
back and forth between us a lot.

959
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:24,075
Yeah.

960
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:27,684
How to end the movie
is always the difficult bit.

961
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:30,021
I think this bridge
was particularly hard.

962
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:32,687
I never felt...
Sorry, I shouldn't ruin it.

963
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:37,162
I think it was OK.
I never felt this quite

964
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:40,760
felt as satisfying as it could be,
Gromit's escape.

965
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:44,238
And we'd actually shot some of Hutch
in the launch sequence

966
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:48,107
really early on, didn't we,
just to be economical...

967
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:50,476
- That's true.
...while we were shooting.

968
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,378
Gromit was next to him, wasn't he?

969
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:55,646
He was and we OG'd him out,
rubbed him out.

970
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:23,470
I think, like,
so many things in the film, really,

971
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:26,276
they don't stand up
to a lot of scrutinizing

972
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:29,375
'cause, you know,
he just happens to go backwards.

973
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:34,112
- It works though.
- It gets him out the cage.

974
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:37,023
I think the way
you've edited it is really good.

975
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:38,424
It's like all of...

976
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,020
Particularly this whole area to the end,

977
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:44,760
I have so many mixed feelings
about, but no one...

978
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:47,394
You know what?
I haven't heard anyone complain.

979
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,965
I think only we see it
a lot of the time.

980
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,075
I always feel I can breathe
a sigh of relief, though,

981
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:01,515
because that little run of sequences
that I've done is over

982
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:04,314
and now it was up to you
to get it back on line again.

983
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,487
It's funny when you watch a film,
you know,

984
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:11,550
your heart beats a lot quicker
in the cinema

985
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,619
when it's stuff you've worked on.

986
01:04:14,597 --> 01:04:17,998
It was in your hands now
to get it all going again.

987
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:19,796
Yeah. And it was always...

988
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:22,064
I mean, we sort of struggled for ages

989
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:25,335
on how to do this next whole bit,

990
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:29,435
'cause it's now how to end the film
in the most satisfying way,

991
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:32,072
and as usual we have too many ideas

992
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:36,209
and how to make them all work
together as a unified piece.

993
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:39,217
The music really helped do that,
I think, didn't it?

994
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:42,551
Julian and Hans' work there

995
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,616
and all the composing team.

996
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:48,425
Do you remember this sequence,
Nick, of Mrs. Mulch running away,

997
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:53,435
being chased by the barrow
was actually in part of the sequence

998
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,836
where Gromit was chasing the beast
earlier on in the film?

999
01:04:56,906 --> 01:05:00,205
For a long time Mr. Mulch,
I think, was pushing the pram.

1000
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:01,641
Oh, that's right.

1001
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:05,306
As Gromit was being pulled underground,
they were being chased.

1002
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:06,439
Yes.

1003
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:09,451
Like a lot of things,
they move around, don't they?

1004
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,647
We have an idea and it maybe
hasn't found the right place.

1005
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:16,886
But here it helped to bring the beast
towards the vegetable stand.

1006
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:19,061
Yeah. Yeah.

1007
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:23,064
I know a lot of the editing of this
is kind of naughty animation directing.

1008
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:25,396
But the animators, you know,

1009
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:28,130
would do more footage
than you actually use

1010
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:30,195
and you edit quite a bit out,

1011
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:32,673
and use it almost like it's live-action

1012
01:05:32,742 --> 01:05:35,176
and just edit it around.

1013
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,009
I mean, shots would change order
quite late on

1014
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:40,879
as we were mixing the sound even.

1015
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:48,682
Yeah, and this...

1016
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:50,749
The whole golden carrot thing was...

1017
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:55,594
I think it was because of that
24-caratjoke earlier on

1018
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:57,826
that the carrot became a golden one.

1019
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,869
- Right.
- And that suddenly clicked for us

1020
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:03,997
that, you know, that would be
his final piece of ammunition.

1021
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:08,066
It seemed so neat and tidy,
as if we'd thought it from day one.

1022
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:10,169
But we hadn't at all, had we?

1023
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:13,309
No.

1024
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:19,047
I'm always amazed how much
the audience reacts here.

1025
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:21,988
He's squashed his marrow.

1026
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:25,255
I didn't know we'd built up
that amount of emotional attachment.

1027
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:29,992
Because it's been for nothing as well.
It's sad, isn't it?

1028
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,397
Yeah.

1029
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,261
Merlin's bit
of Were-Rabbit animation here...

1030
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:37,670
That rabbit broke three times
on that shot

1031
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,675
and he would have to replace
the rabbit three times.

1032
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,643
Three different rabbits.

1033
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:46,313
I do feel proud of thatjoke,

1034
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:48,543
but it had to be cut down quite a lot.

1035
01:06:56,859 --> 01:06:59,794
This was put together so quick,
this bit.

1036
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:02,763
We were scrambling like crazy
at the end of the movie

1037
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:04,823
in the last five weeks or something.

1038
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:09,561
We shoot so much of the film towards
the end of the production, don't we?

1039
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:11,664
Yeah, yeah.

1040
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,470
Everybody pulls out the stops,

1041
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:16,774
and shooting on 30 different sets
at the same time.

1042
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:21,572
You know, with as many animators
and as many cameras rolling.

1043
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:28,717
Now we're getting into that beast
climbing to the rooftops thing

1044
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:32,591
that, you know, are in so many
monster movies as well.

1045
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:34,152
King Kong and...

1046
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:39,123
The Oliver Reed werewolf film,
he ends up on the rooftops.

1047
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:41,261
That's right. They all do, don't they?

1048
01:07:41,337 --> 01:07:43,362
Most werewolf movies are pretty...

1049
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:46,875
...not very interesting endings,
actually.

1050
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:48,604
So we had the challenge

1051
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:52,307
of how to make this funny
as well, and positive.

1052
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:54,274
I love this bit.

1053
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,545
Steve's bit in the greenhouse.

1054
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:00,817
Back to the sanctuary of the greenhouse.
They had to go there, didn't they?

1055
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:04,485
Yeah. These are all your bits
inside the greenhouse, aren't they?

1056
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:08,153
I don't know if people
read that until she says it.

1057
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:10,892
- I think they do. Yeah. I think so.
- Do they?

1058
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,026
Yeah, I think
you can read it's Wallace.

1059
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:26,145
And the dogfight was...

1060
01:08:26,215 --> 01:08:28,911
...was all on dodgems
once throughout the interior.

1061
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:30,509
- It was, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1062
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:32,645
This was quite a challenge of how to...

1063
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:35,054
This is like the beginning of the end.

1064
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:38,116
And I have, you know,
I have heard one or two comments

1065
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:40,219
that it feels too much of a set piece.

1066
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,663
But I'm not sure really, you know.

1067
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:46,702
I think it's...
I think we did the right thing.

1068
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:50,068
I think, you know, with...

1069
01:08:50,139 --> 01:08:53,540
That's great. Oandy floss. Your gag.

1070
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:55,770
I think, like with The Wrong Trousers,

1071
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:58,837
it was, you know,
once he'd got to this stage...

1072
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:01,679
Once you knew
what all the characters wanted,

1073
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:03,082
they jumped on the train

1074
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,417
and that was even heading
towards the end at breakneck speed.

1075
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:09,720
But we had so many stories

1076
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,920
to tie up here
before we could let it go.

1077
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:16,692
You know, it was
quite a complex story in a way.

1078
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:18,666
Their marriage,

1079
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:22,896
you know,
her finding out that he knew,

1080
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,701
and it was quite a lot of dialogue

1081
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:28,437
and quite a lot
of wrapping up of story lines

1082
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:30,911
before the chase could get going.

1083
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,780
If anything I feel it holds back a bit,
but there wasn't much of a way of...

1084
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:38,844
It was a nightmare. You were shooting
the stuff inside the conservatory.

1085
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,913
I was shooting all the stuff outside,
all the chase-y bits,

1086
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:45,483
and working the two together
into cutting. We were cutting...

1087
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,587
We were editing it at the same time
as we were shooting.

1088
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:08,507
It was great.
Ralph's fantastic at comedy.

1089
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:09,642
- He is.
- Fantastic.

1090
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:21,593
A very Olose Shave-y kind of moment
with Gromit in the plane.

1091
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:24,326
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

1092
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:30,362
That was a good edit, though,

1093
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:33,272
'cause we always had Victor
baring himself to the world

1094
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:35,708
before the vicar's line.

1095
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,246
At the last minute we changed it around.

1096
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:42,182
The edit here was quite a challenge
'cause it was how to make the gags

1097
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:46,984
be "by the way" kind of things
rather than the point of it.

1098
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,584
And when you've seen
Tottington Hall before now,

1099
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,458
there's no way that
it's anywhere near this big.

1100
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:58,191
But we just don't care at all, do we?
We just make it as big as we want.

1101
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,792
It's real Tom and Jerry.
I love that explosion.

1102
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:17,008
The music does a really good job here
of keeping it going,

1103
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:19,418
even though you're having to stop.

1104
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:23,821
We lost an umbrella shot there.

1105
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:26,953
I still wonder whether that
would've helped that or not.

1106
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:28,553
It might have slowed it down.

1107
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,303
Where all the characters
put up umbrellas after PO Mac's line.

1108
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,574
Oh, and this gag.

1109
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:43,540
This gag idea we had from the beginning.

1110
01:11:43,613 --> 01:11:46,104
Of course,
they were coin-operated planes.

1111
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:48,707
We had to use that somehow,
and then we...

1112
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:52,550
It was so hard to get the sequence
working that we took it out.

1113
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:56,058
And then I think you said we've
got to try to get that back in again.

1114
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,524
We were having a meeting,

1115
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:02,053
one of these giant meetings with
40 people in, Jeffrey and everybody,

1116
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:04,122
and there was a question

1117
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,727
that itjust wasn't getting
as many laughs as it could.

1118
01:12:07,803 --> 01:12:11,705
And I think it was almost
like repeating the joke

1119
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:14,004
with the organist in the church.

1120
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:17,204
You know, what about
just completely stopping it?

1121
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:18,678
But I remember saying it

1122
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:22,275
and at the same time thinking
that's pretty risky to do.

1123
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,285
But itjust seemed
to be exactly the thing.

1124
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:26,582
We just had to do it.

1125
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:29,489
And then we thought we got
to have the plane slowing

1126
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:32,220
and, you know,
the search for coins between them.

1127
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:35,821
And then Mark said,
"What if Phillip had a girl's purse?"

1128
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,230
Then we all cracked up
and decided to do it.

1129
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:41,601
Then it was a matter
of finding the right place for it.

1130
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:47,304
I love this section here, Nick.

1131
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:50,868
It's just beautiful, I think.

1132
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:54,005
People say it's a bit Matrix,

1133
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:58,486
but I wasn't sure I was really
thinking that, or either of us were.

1134
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:00,715
Itjust seems so over-the-top again.

1135
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,122
And it's moving, but comical.

1136
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:06,984
The music is good.

1137
01:13:07,063 --> 01:13:11,056
I was trying to find a way to make
the moment as big as possible with this.

1138
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:14,728
I know someone had a go

1139
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,830
at speeding that up, that edit,

1140
01:13:17,907 --> 01:13:21,206
in this stage,
but it didn't work at all.

1141
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:22,403
It didn't work, no.

1142
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:32,750
And then we're back
into your scene here.

1143
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:36,485
I thought that was a greatjoke,
that he landed on a table of crackers.

1144
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:39,795
It was Dave Riddett's joke.

1145
01:13:39,862 --> 01:13:41,591
It seemed funny.

1146
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,136
This sequence was...

1147
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:57,737
And you boarded it originally,
lots of times, didn't you, Nick?

1148
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:01,374
And then it was sort of a necessity.

1149
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,111
I took it on,

1150
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,778
and it was always very long.

1151
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:09,222
It took so many things
to get over, and it...

1152
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,088
And we'd shot it

1153
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,594
and then had such
a radical go at the edit

1154
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:17,189
which really
knocked it into shape, I think.

1155
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:21,232
The chase-down sequence.

1156
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:23,197
Yeah.

1157
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:27,436
I know, it's like how to end the movie
as well. When does the movie end?

1158
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,576
But I think it works.

1159
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:28,838
But I think it works.

1160
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:34,482
Without too many endings.

1161
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:40,912
The rabbits, a good addition.

1162
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:47,686
Again, the music is fantastic.

1163
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:50,027
That alone brass band.

1164
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:53,296
- Playing the Wallace and Gromit theme.
- It's really good.

1165
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:57,396
This was actually an idea
from DreamWorks

1166
01:14:57,473 --> 01:15:00,033
to bring back the mind waves,

1167
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:02,168
which I thought was a good, nice touch.

1168
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:03,438
It makes no sense.

1169
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:07,312
Why does he fall off the roof
and change back? We don't care.

1170
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:09,374
I find it very moving, this scene.

1171
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:14,184
- You pulled it off well.
- The dialogue was changed to...

1172
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:18,886
That was shot with different dialogue
and then we re-voiced it

1173
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:22,397
to get the idea
that the rabbit had gone,

1174
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:25,194
but Wallace was there,
but there was no helping him

1175
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:29,735
until we hear Hutch, you know,

1176
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:33,798
and cheese is going to be
the kind of reviving answer.

1177
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:37,676
And that shot was originally
much earlier in the sequence.

1178
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,943
So the whole thing
was completely made in the edit room.

1179
01:15:41,016 --> 01:15:43,780
- It was quite last minute.
- It was very last minute.

1180
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:46,879
I think it's good.
It really works well, that structure.

1181
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:51,620
Wallace here, I think, as you may see
on the DVD extras,

1182
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:55,027
originally was shot
with the rabbit ears, the fluffy ears,

1183
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:57,361
from here to the end of this sequence,

1184
01:15:57,433 --> 01:16:01,096
because as I said earlier on,

1185
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,661
there was always a plan
that they would go home.

1186
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:06,037
I think Wallace
had this line where he said,

1187
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:08,668
"Oome on, Gromit.
Better get home and changed."

1188
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:12,043
They would go back to the Mind-O-Matic
and put things right.

1189
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,241
But then, quite rightly so,

1190
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,843
people felt that he should be...
This is a greatjoke...

1191
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,515
That he should be cured here
so everything's OK.

1192
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:25,788
And the good thing about that, actually,
was that Hutch can stay Hutch

1193
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:27,658
and it would have been quite sad

1194
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:31,928
to have not had Hutch
existing at the end of the film.

1195
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:36,635
And it's good to feel that sense
of resolve here as well.

1196
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:42,138
I know I was quite stubborn
about not wanting to change that,

1197
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:44,873
but the things you go through.

1198
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:48,144
I think we all are, aren't we,
about some different bits?

1199
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:51,544
- The rabbits...
- I love the bunnies.

1200
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,417
They're great.

1201
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:05,029
Who animated Lady T there?

1202
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,695
- Suzy Fagan. She's good.
- Nice bit.

1203
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:12,969
And this. What to do here
in the last sequence was, you know...

1204
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:16,102
- We just had so many endings.
- We did.

1205
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:19,841
She was even at one point
gonna marry PO Mackintosh.

1206
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:23,407
I think it... I remember again
I was keen on that.

1207
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:25,919
But I think sometimes
these different ideas

1208
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:28,513
are just like a catalyst to... You know,

1209
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:30,922
'cause the wedding thing
is still in the air.

1210
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:33,257
- It's all part of getting there.
- Yeah.

1211
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:36,457
You have to believe in the wrong ideas

1212
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:40,059
for a certain amount of time
and this seemed like the perfect thing.

1213
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:42,467
And I know it was Dave Sproxton,
I think,

1214
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:44,631
that brought this back into the mix,

1215
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:47,267
and was probably the way we ended

1216
01:17:47,343 --> 01:17:49,607
the very first script we ever wrote.

1217
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:53,944
That it ended up back at Tottington Hall
as a bunny sanctuary.

1218
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:57,144
It resolves the actual story
we were telling, doesn't it,

1219
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:59,813
rather than create a new...
a new thing.

1220
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:04,416
It makes me fond of what I've seen
being back at Tottington Hall.

1221
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:07,428
I remember the fun
of the earlier part of the movie

1222
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:09,157
and I actually feel sad

1223
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,928
that I won't see Lady Tottington
again at this point.

1224
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:16,904
Yeah. This is the perfect ending
for Wallace and Gromit

1225
01:18:16,972 --> 01:18:18,098
'cause there was...

1226
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:20,937
The other ending
had too much sadness for Wallace,

1227
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,446
'cause you thought "Oh, no,
he hasn't married Lady Tottington."

1228
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:27,380
And the perfect word to end the film.

1229
01:18:27,449 --> 01:18:28,711
"Oheese."

1230
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:30,718
Yeah. I thought you meant "The End."

1231
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:34,783
That's good as well. Two words.

1232
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:41,591
And then we decided to use the...

1233
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:45,599
As a... MPO, the guys who did
the OGI bunnies,

1234
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,794
they had them in their computers.

1235
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,930
So we decided to use them again
in the credit sequence.

1236
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:52,735
I think we wish we'd had more time

1237
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:55,800
and, you know, put more of them

1238
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:59,006
doing more particular things.

1239
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:03,347
But we... It was just, like,
in the last week of making the film.

1240
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:06,946
They worked so hard and this is
the ultimate they could get together

1241
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:10,685
for this sequence in the time they had.

1242
01:19:12,828 --> 01:19:14,352
It's quite a piece of work.

1243
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,419
Yeah.

1244
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:21,566
Very good.

1245
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:24,162
We can talk about
all the people in the credits.

1246
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,570
Yeah.

1247
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:42,990
Yeah, it's... It was fun working on it.

1248
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:46,255
Yeah. I think it's kind of...

1249
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:49,923
From the beginning of writing it,
it was five years of work

1250
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,398
and I know throughout
that amount of time

1251
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:55,266
I just thought of nothing else,
it seemed, you know.

1252
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,134
You know, we'd have...

1253
01:19:57,206 --> 01:20:00,334
The huge challenge
was writing the script

1254
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:03,810
and I had no idea
it was going to be as complex...

1255
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:06,211
I think it is a fairly complex story,

1256
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:09,409
and I remember waking up
in the middle of the night

1257
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:10,952
and writing things down.

1258
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:14,011
It was kind of like
living it for five years.

1259
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:16,751
- I know. Like coming out of prison.
- Yeah.

1260
01:20:16,825 --> 01:20:19,350
It does. It changes your life actually.

1261
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,760
- It does.
- 'Oause coming out this end of it

1262
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,923
and going through eight weeks

1263
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:26,627
of non-stop talking
about it around the world,

1264
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,296
you come back,
like, out of the whole thing

1265
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,931
like a changed person, you know.

1266
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:34,373
Like a... I don't know.

1267
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:38,379
You know, it's like an ambition
that's been fulfilled.

1268
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:42,440
Yeah. It must be amazing for you, Nick,

1269
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:47,182
'cause you must have always thought
of Wallace and Gromit as a feature film.

1270
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:51,056
And not that the others
in their way weren't, but it's done now.

1271
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:54,254
You can look back
at a Wallace and Gromit feature.

1272
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:56,854
- Yeah, yeah.
- It must be quite a thing.

1273
01:20:57,533 --> 01:21:01,594
In a way, I'm so pleased that it's
had such critical acclaim in a way.

1274
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:05,470
Not that that matters in itself,
but itjust shows...

1275
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:08,533
'Oause you're working
in the dark for so long

1276
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:12,876
with this just kind of blind belief
that it's going to work.

1277
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:14,872
And then...

1278
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,885
And you go through such
a lot of doubt in such a lot of it

1279
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:22,151
that it's more relief that you've done
something right, you know.

1280
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:26,627
And I think, you know,
I remember so early on

1281
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:28,356
talking about it and saying

1282
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:31,831
that itjust had to retain
that quality of the other films

1283
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,994
and that was always
in jeopardy, I think.

1284
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:38,597
You know, just putting it on
the big screen and being, you know...

1285
01:21:38,674 --> 01:21:41,438
Having more money,
having more people involved.

1286
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:44,104
But we so wanted to make sure

1287
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:48,582
that Wallace and Gromit fans
weren't disappointed as well.

1288
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:51,448
You know, that it could
be a great, you know,

1289
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,047
fantastic, huge, like, movie.

1290
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:59,583
But we so didn't want
to alienate the original, core fans.

1291
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:01,128
And to keep it...

1292
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:05,257
To keep it kind of quirky
in its concept, basically.

1293
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,996
It was in its initial concept,

1294
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,129
but keep it absurd and quirky

1295
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,197
at every different story point,
at every turning point,

1296
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,175
so it never fell into, like,

1297
01:22:15,244 --> 01:22:18,270
off-the-shelf
kind of Hollywood scenes and...

1298
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:21,214
So it always had
this odd Britishness about it.

1299
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:22,614
Yeah.

1300
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:26,415
And yet, at the same time,
we're always trying to do...

1301
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:31,687
I found somehow you're always looking
for the obvious way to do your idea,

1302
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,288
that you start off
in the most abstract ways

1303
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:38,799
but you're constantly looking
for that route

1304
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:42,394
that everyone's gonna get it
even if the idea is quirky.

1305
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:43,460
Yeah.

1306
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:46,905
It's like a real mixture of conforming,
but not conforming.

1307
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:49,102
Yeah. Yeah.

1308
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:53,437
Yeah, I know.
It's the hardest thing, really,

1309
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:56,177
'cause we were very strong

1310
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,776
about what we felt about the whole film

1311
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:01,846
and what...
the kind of story we wanted to tell.

1312
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:05,586
And so many people come in,
and often their comments, you know...

1313
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:10,588
Quite often people's comments
are very irritating a lot of the way

1314
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:14,898
'cause they're constantly criticizing
every little thing that you're doing.

1315
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:18,406
You're so grateful because
you're glad someone's had the courage

1316
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:21,738
to tell you something isn't working
when it's not working.

1317
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,334
I mean, I... Gosh.

1318
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:26,404
It's my first feature film

1319
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:29,348
and I find it so challenging

1320
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:33,946
and, you know, often difficult
to be so heavily criticized.

1321
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:39,759
But I can truthfully say that itjust
would not be as good as it is

1322
01:23:39,828 --> 01:23:42,296
if it weren't for people doing that.

1323
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,832
Whether you agree with them...
I think often...

1324
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,892
Often solutions are not right.

1325
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:52,235
But they are hitting on something that's
probably a good reason to worry about.

1326
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:54,935
And at the end of the day,
I think we've made,

1327
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:57,171
I think, what is truly our own movie.

1328
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,576
Definitely.

1329
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:02,577
- What an ending.
- Perfect.
