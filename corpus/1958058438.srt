00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,166
[disembodied voice] You're doomed! Doomed!

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,166
[moody music]

00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,333
[thunder clap]

00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,416

00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,666
[music resumes]

7
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,583
[whispers] Arbor Day.

8
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,250
[Raymond] [clears throat]

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,250
[Nurse] Arbor Day...

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,083
Hmmm?

11
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,291
I wonder what he meant by "Arbor Day"?

12
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,708
[knowingly] Arbor Day.

13
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,416
I can tell you about Arbor Day.

14
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,500
It happened a long time ago.

15
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,458
In color.

16
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,041
It started out

17
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,125
just like any other day.

18
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,041
[heavy breathing]

19
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,166
[Dad] Honey, honey, please wait.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,125
Whew!

21
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,458
[Elmer] Do you think we’ll find a
swell place to plant our tree, Daddy?

22
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,416
Sure Elm.

23
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,666
The woods are full of great places to plant trees.

24
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,625
We’ll look for the best one, and we’ll plant that baby!

25
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,000
Gee, Arbor Day sure is neat, Dad!

26
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,208
[Dad Laughs]

27
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,750
Well as a botanist, I think it’s pretty neat, too.

28
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,583
Honey, honey... would you like me to take over?

29
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,541
Oh no dear. I’m feeling as strong as an ox.

30
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,208
[Dad] Damn E-R-A.

31
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,291
[Elmer] Daddy...

32
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,250
What is it, Elm?

33
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,416
[reluctantly] Why does mommy
have so much hair on her face?

34
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,166
[sighs] You should see her pits.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,583
[gasping for air]

36
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,583
[Dad] I’ll be alright, really, really I’m OK.

37
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,750
[Mom] Alright, relax.

38
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,458
I’m gonna be OK. I’m gonna be alright.

39
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,333
[Mom] I told you not to wear long sleeves

40
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,541
[Dad] [gasping]

41
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
Ohhhh boy.

42
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
[Mom] Deep breaths...

43
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,250
[Dad] [gasping]

44
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,375
[Mom] Alright...

45
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,666
[Dad] [gasping]

46
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,291
I’m gonna be OK. I’m gonna be alright.

47
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,708
[Mom] Well maybe next time
you won’t fill your pockets so heavy

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,791
you didn’t need your wallet

49
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,041
you didn’t need your keys

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,083
and you don’t need spare change in the forest!

51
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,250
[slap]

52
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,016
[gasps]

53
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,458
[Beatnik] Hey cats, you dropped your bags.

54
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,458
Happy Arbor Day!

55
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,750
[Dad] Thanks!

56
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,791
Wow, this must be our lucky day.

57
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,708
[pick sound]

58
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,708
This sucks.

59
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,166
[bird tweets]

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
I gotta work on fucking Arbor Day!

61
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,666
I hate this fucking job.

62
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,625
[bird squawk]

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,041
Bingo!

64
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,583

67
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,583
Bingo.

68
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,583
Ah shit.

69
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,416
[sizzle sound]

70
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,041
[demeanor change] Howdy folks!

71
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,416
[Elmer] Hi Mr. Forest Ranger! Happy Arbor Day!

72
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,750
[Ranger] And a happy Arbor Day to you, too!

73
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,666
Say that sure is a beauty!

74
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,625
You know when I was your age

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,416
me and my daddy planted a tree just like that one.

76
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,583
You know that tree’s still standing there today.

77
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,333
Sometimes I go back and look at that tree...

78
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,083
It’s like a piece of my past.

79
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,416
How come you’re not planting trees today?

80
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,583
[Dad] Well Elm,

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,541
Mr. Ranger has a very important job.

82
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,750
He has to make sure the forest the forest is safe

83
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,250
for all the campers.

84
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,375
[Ranger] Speaking of safety, you folks remember

85
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,583
we share this forest with our animal friends.

86
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,541
Respect the woods, and it’ll respect you.

87
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,166
[Mom] Thank you Mr. Ranger, bye!

88
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,583
Bye bye now, and you folks have a happy Arbor Day.

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Assholes.

90
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,041
[Dad] There.

91
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,500
That oughta do it.

92
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,291
You know Elm, I think we picked a perfect location.

93
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,041
There’s rich topsoil, ample
sunlight & plenty of water.

94
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,333
All the ingredients necessary
for a plant to grow up healthy.

95
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,125
Wow! Our tree’s gonna last a
hundred million, zillion years!

96
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,416
Ha ha ha.

97
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,750
Well Elm, I don’t know if it will be here that long

98
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,416
But it should be here for years
for us to come and enjoy it.

99
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,666
[growl]

100
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,541
Look Daddy, a man in a bear suit!

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,041
[Bear sighs]

102
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,250

104
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,583
Look Daddy, a GRIZZLY BEAR!

106
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,791
[Dad] [kissing noises]

107
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,333
Come here, lil’ fella. Cmon...

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,750
I’ve got a nice fig newton for ya.

109
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,708
Good boy! [kissing noises]

110
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,500
Here ya go [kissing noises]

111
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:44,625
C'mon. [kissing noises] C'mon. That’s good.

112
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,250
Please Daddy I'm scared!

113
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,291
Relax Elmer, it’s only a little bear.

114
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,541
[kissing noises]

115
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,166
What do you think a bear is
doing in this part of the woods?

116
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,541
He’s probably just a little hungry.

117
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,708
[00:08 07.23]Hey you know, it is mating season

118
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,708
He’s probably hungry for a little love.

119
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:01,750
[chuckles]

120
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,250
Honey, not in front of Elmer.

121
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,125
Please Daddy, please!

122
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,125
Ah Elm, this guy’s been around humans so long

123
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
he’s probably tame as a kitten.

124
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,250
Please daddy! Please, please!

125
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:16,750
Relax Elmer.

126
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,250
Your father wouldn't feed the bear if it wasn’t safe.

127
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,083
C’mon Elm, he’s probably more
afraid of us then we are of him

128
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,416
You watch this...

129
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,416
[splat] [dramatic music]

130
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,750

137
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,541

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,166
[Doctor] Strange case with this Jacob’s boy.

143
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,166
As a youth he witnessed his
parents being mauled by a bear.

144
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,083
His father was decapitated.

145
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,208
And they found traces of bear semen

146
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,083
in his mother's mutilated body.

147
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,416
God! What a horrible story!

148
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,125
Poor child.

149
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,458
Yes, and to add to the tragedy

150
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,666
the event occurred on Arbor Day

151
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,125
[dramatic bells]

152
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,291
making the holiday unbearable.

153
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,333
Poor kid.

154
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,333
Imagine...

155
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,666
not being able to celebrate Arbor Day.

156
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,250
[contemplating] No, no.

157
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,041
Oddly enough the only day
of the year that his brainwaves

158
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,750
show any change is on Arbor Day.

159
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,583
The rest of the year he remains in a catatonic trance.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,791
What the HELL is that?!?

161
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,750
It’s the New York Mets, Doctor.

162
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,416
"It’s the NY Mets, Doctor." The NY Mets.

163
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,666
And tell me missy,

164
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,666
Who are the mets playing their next home game, hmm?

165
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,291
The Cubs.

166
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,541
Who?

167
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,291
The Cubs, Doctor.

168
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
"The Cubs, Doctor."

169
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,250
The Cubs, Doctor.

170
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,083
[louder] The Cubs, Doctor!

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,666
And I take it you intend to remind poor Elmer

172
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,708
of his early childhood trauma, hmm?

173
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,250
Why don’t you just run up to him and say,

174
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,291
"Look out Elmer, there’s a bear behind you!"

175
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,166
[growling sounds]

00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:43,416
[snorting & roaring]

177
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,583
Don’t you realize the mere mention of the word bear

178
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,750
can prolong poor Elmer’s recovery?

179
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,375
Now exercise your sensitivity

180
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,166
and change that channel!

187
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,458
So you’re saying that the only
day that Elmer's brainwaves

188
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,208
show any change is on Arbor Day?

[savage roars]

190
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,750
Yes, yes I did say that.

191
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,750
Well, correct me if I’m wrong doctor but

192
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,750
isn't tomorrow Arbor Day?

00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,750
Why yes. Yes it is.

195
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
We better prepare some type of restraint

196
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,625
as a protective measure.

197
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,416
It pains me to have to have to chain up

198
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,583
such a poor human being like this.

199
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,416
[Briggs] Well if you ask me

200
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,750
all these freaks should be chained up

201
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,500
just like animals

202
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,125

205
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,166
I thought I told you to mop up all of C-Section.

206
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,750
Maybe you should attend to your job

207
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,500
or I'll attend to it for you.

208
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,375
When you’re through with that

209
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,750
then you may return and clean Mr. Jacob’s room.

210
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,458
Have it done by midnight.

211
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,375
Yes, sir.

212
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,708

that crazy people are people too

219
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,416
they just need someone to look out for them

220
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,750

350
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,250
Yeah, I'm inclined to believe you, Doc

00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,166

367
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,250
[bad accent] It makes me feel right at home.

368
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,583
[laughs]

369
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,083
Don't worry, Sunshine.

370
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,708
After a few lines of my mystical guru powder

371
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,416
this place will look like the Taj Mahal.

372
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,583
I don’t know guys, this place doesn’t look too safe

373
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,750
the floors could be rotten. We could all get hurt.

374
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,208
Are you kidding, sis?

375
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,458
This building is at least fifty years old.

376
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,041
It must have been built

377
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,083
according to the old building codes.

378
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,541
I bet it's still as solid as a rock.

379
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,125
What's this kid know anyway?

380
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,666
You can believe him

381
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,541
He’s a whiz at calculus, biology, physics...

382
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,625
Not to mention mechanical engineering

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,791
psychology and chemistry.

384
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,375
Chemistry?

385
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,791
The only thing I remember
about chemistry is that time

386
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,750
I brewed up some wicked mushroom dust

387
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,458
for the Ted Nugent concert.

388
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,125
C'mon, trust me.

389
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,041
Hey you kids! RUN! RUN!

390
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,750
It's not safe!

391
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,458
The place is evil!

392
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,375
You'll all perish!

393
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,375
You're doomed! DOOMED!

394
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,416
Yeah!

395
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,583
And a Happy Arbor Day to you too, pal!

396
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,791
I’m starting to have second
thoughts about this place.

397
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,333
C'mon Smiley Face. There's nothing to worry about.

398
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,666
Holy Shit!

399
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,041
Look at this!

400
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,166
Jacobs? Who's that?

401
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,416
Wasn’t that the guy that invented

402
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,291
blackjack moon rocks?

403
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,583
No.

404
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,375
But I remember that name
from one of my history text books.

405
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,583
As I recall, it had something to do with Arbor Day.

406
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,583
Bingo, kid!

407
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,666
Twenty years ago, Elmer Jacobs watched

408
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,166
his parents being mutilated

409
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,250
by a grizzly bear.

410
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:27,583
Now, he’s a basket case in the looney bin at South Oaks.

411
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,250
Every year on Arbor Day his power grows.

412
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,583
And one day he'll escape

413
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,291
and come back to the only place he knows.

414
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,250
This house.

415
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,166
And he'll come back

416
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,625
for revenge.

417
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,125
He’ll come back

418
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,333
TO KILL!!!

419
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,291
Charlie you IDIOT!

420
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,083
[Charlie laughs]

421
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,666
C'mon guys, let's go in the house

422
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,500
before that nut comes back.

423
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,500
[phone ring]

424
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,166
Hello.

425
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,041
Yeah hi Honey, it’s me.

426
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,083
Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna hafta work late tonight.

427
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,458
But Honey, it’s Arbor Day.

428
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,500
I just put the turkey in the oven

429
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,333
and Junior’s been waiting to plant that tree all day.

430
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,375
I know Honey. Don’t you think
I’d rather be out planting a tree

431
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,625
with my son than chasing after some whack job?

432
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,708
I'm sorry, dear.

433
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,291
It’s just that Arbor Day has
always been so special to us.

434
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,416
Yeah I’m sorry too, Honey.

435
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,625
But sometimes a man’s job has gotta come before

436
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,000
his turkey dinner

437
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,541
Even turkey with stuffing and brown gravy

438
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,750
on a bed of corn niblets in butter

439
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,500
and mashed potatoes with pearl onions

440
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,125
and tender glazed green beans

441
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,791
smothered in Hollandaise sauce

442
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,083
and a hot peach cobbler

443
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,458
with a scoop of french
vanilla ice cream and cool whip.

444
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,708
I also maid some triscuits and cheese whiz.

445
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,541
Well, maybe just a little nibble.

446
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,250
[door opening]

447
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,625
[Pitbull] Holy horror show, man.

448
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,208
[Charlie] [bad accent] Aye caramba

449
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,625
they neeed 'ze new cleaning lady.

450
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,250
[Stacey] Uhh, this place is a mess.

451
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,125
[Jen] Oh my god.

452
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,375
[door closing]

453
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,750
[Pitbull] Whoa, the maid’s on vacation.

454
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,374
[Charlie] This is NOT the Taj Mahal.

455
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,041
You can say that again.

456
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,750
[Rachel] Stop it, don’t touch anything.

457
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,666
This is disgusting.

458
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,750
This place is filthy

459
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,708
[click, click]

460
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,500
And the lights don’t work.

461
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,625
Pitbull, why did you drag us out to this shack?

462
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,458
Don’t worry, Jen.

463
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,083
In just a few minutes,

464
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,250
you'll be able to see by the light of my silvery bong.

465
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:02,708
Hey Pitbull, why don't you try one of these beauties?

466
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,208
Whoa! Mintoid, Dude!

467
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,458
[boom]

468
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,624
Whoa!

469
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:17,375
[Charlie] [irritating laugh]

470
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,333
[Rachel] Charlie!

471
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,583
Maybe I'll just go look for the circuit breaker.

472
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,750
Considering this house is over 40 years old

473
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,750
it would be safe to assume a fuse box

474
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,583
would be located in the basement.

475
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,541
Well thank you Thomas Alva Edision.

476
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:33,250
This kid’s a regular Whine-stien.

477
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,625
He’s just trying to be helpful.

478
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,125
Yeah Charlie, lay off!

479
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,500
Alright, look kid

480
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,583
I’m sorry.

481
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,416
I'm not such a bad guy.

482
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,083
Let’s shake.

[Charlie] [bad accent] Aye caramba, Charlie

00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,416
Aye yai yai yai aye.

00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,791
[Charlie] [irritating laugh]

488
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,583
I guess I'll check the cellar.

No one understands poor Elmer

516
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,250
No one understands.

517
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,750
Beneath that whacko killer

518
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,500
There’s a frightened,

519
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,166
gentle man.

520
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:54,208
Denying people the love they need

521
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,708
is a selfish thing to do.

522
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:02,250
If we're not sharing

523
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,625
and not caring

524
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,125
Perhaps we're killers too.

525
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:14,333
Behind every killer

526
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,541
There’s a heck of a guy.

527
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,250
Heck of a guy

528
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:25,208
And behind every cloud

529
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:30,458
There’s a bright blue sky.

530
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,416
After coldest winter

531
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,125
comes the warm thaw of spring

532
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,583
warm thaw of spring

533
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,750
So take that troubled bird

534
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:50,291
underneath your wing.

535
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,541
So to criticize poor Elmer

536
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,166
is unjust and unfair.

537
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:06,583
Besides your parents were not

538
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,333
killed by a grizzly bear.

539
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,750
So there.

00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,541
[music fades]

541
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,291
[Bobby] I’m telling you she’s dead!

542
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:20,666
It was horrible!

543
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:24,375
Her viscera was smeared all over the basement.

544
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,458
Stacey always had a lot of guts. [laughs]

545
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,083
Charlie, this is serious.

546
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,083
OK if you don’t believe me

547
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,250
come downstairs and see for yourselves!

548
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,083
[Rachel] Bobby!

549
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,583
[mocking] If you don’t believe me

550
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,791
Come downstairs and see for yourselves.

All alone

743
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,708

What are you doing, Bobby!

785
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,291
The way Stacey's organs were torn out

786
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:55,208
would indicate a creature of super human strength.

787
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,041
We'll need something to combat this aberration.

788
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,208
Stop talking that nonsense.

789
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,375
The only psycho here

790
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,416
is the one you've created in your subconscious.

791
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,583
Then please explain. Where is everybody?

792
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,375
I don’t know, they’re around somewhere.

I'll go upstairs and find them right now.

Please don’t go, sis!

797
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,666
Alright Bobby, relax. I won’t go anywhere.

798
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,541

why do they call you Pitbull?

829
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,208

Come on! Get up!

Thanks a lot, Smokey.

1155
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,500
No problem, Detective.

1156
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,666
Valuable acres of forest are lost every year

1157
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,375
by man’s careless handling of fire.

1158
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,666
If people would just take the time to

1159
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:28,750
make sure that their matches,
cigarettes or campfires are out

1160
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:31,416
we could all avoid the needless destruction

1161
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:35,166
of one of the planet's most valued natural resources

1162
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,708
the forest!

1163
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,250
So, whadda ya say

1164
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,208
ya give me a hand?

1165
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:43,333
Uhh,

1166
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,083
Yeah, sure.

1167
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:48,083
C'mon, the fire is spreading!

1170
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,375
Must be my lucky day.

1171
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:06,208
Oh, Detective.

1172
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,083
You must be here to see Rachel.

1173
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:11,458
Yeah, is she going to be ok, Doc?

1174
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh.

1175
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,791
My cd's are about to mature.

1176
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:19,291
Well does that mean she's gonna be alright?

1177
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,791
Oh, well she’s a remarkable girl.

1178
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,375
I'm sure someday she'll be able
to put this tragedy behind her.

1179
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:30,208
Of course, Arbor Day will never be the same for her.

1180
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:33,125
It will never be the same for me either, Doc.

1181
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:36,766
Hey!

1182
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,458
How about a quick nine?

1183
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,583
Sounds good.

[music fades]

1187
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,250
He meant all that with those two words?

1188
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,083
No.

1189
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,250
I just made it up.

[both laugh]

1191
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,375
No man could mean so much

1192
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,041
by two words.

1193
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,416
Excuse me, sir?

1194
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:29,583
I found more stuff in the vault.

1195
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:32,625
Throw it on the fire with the rest.

1196
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,208
Ok.

A time to reap what you sow.

My fruit is ripe and my branches strong

1215
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,250
And I'll plant anybody who does me wrong.

1216
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:45,083
Now I got some beer and I got some weed

1217
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:48,000

1218

[guitar melting finale]

1225
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:15,500
Sometimes you gotta stand up

1226
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:18,250
for the things that you believe

1227
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:21,416
Stand as tall as trees

Kill the enemies like weeds!

1229
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:28,375
So I prune a bush in my baby's park

1230
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:34,291
and my stem is hard, I want to make her bark.
