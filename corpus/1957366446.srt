00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:07,417
Where am I?
What... What happened?

184
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,586
It's okay.
You're in a hospital.

185
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,213
Where's Derek?

186
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,300
Do you remember what happened?
Someone broke into your house.

187
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,389
You were attacked, and Derek...

188
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,932
[crying] I was...

189
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,352
- Just... Just rest.
- I was...

190
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,855
[continues crying]
I was so scared.

191
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,984
Scared for my baby.

192
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,950
[gasps]

193
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,285
Where is she?

194
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:46,540
Where is she, Syd?
Where is she?

195
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,170
I'm so sorry, Maddy.
They couldn't save her.

196
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,509
[crying] No.

197
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,931
No, no, no. No. No.

198
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,020
[wailing]

199
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,063
It's okay.

200
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,025
No! Please, no.

201
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:15,444
[screams] No!

202
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,112
Hey, okay.

203
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:18,655
No!

204
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,291
[knock on door]

205
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,542
[Kekoa] Mrs. Mitchell?

206
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:34,504
Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

207
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:36,798
I'm sorry to bother you,

208
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,092
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

209
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,386
Mrs. Mitchell?

210
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,807
[Sydney] Can I help you
with something?

211
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,810
Uh, I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

212
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,147
Oh, I'm Sydney Lake.
I'm Madison's sister.

213
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,650
So, can I help you?

214
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,278
Oh, this.

215
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:03,909
Um, I'm a...
a princess at Family Planet.

216
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,327
So, I'm on my lunch break,

217
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,163
and I thought I'd come by
and check on Maddy.

218
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:11,875
She's been like this
for two days.

219
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,752
I can't even get her to eat.

220
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,253
Well, maybe
you can help me then.

221
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,630
Did you know of anyone
who wanted

222
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,507
to hurt your sister
or her husband?

223
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,175
There's no sign
of forced entry at the house.

224
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,468
May have been
somebody they knew.

225
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,011
Somebody with access.

226
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,473
I wouldn't know.
Derek kept us apart.

227
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,893
This isn't her first, right?

228
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,353
The doctor said your sister

229
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,605
had three miscarriages
in the last two years.

230
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,525
Oh, my God.

231
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:40,404
Um, I didn't know.

232
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,199
I don't know why
she wouldn't have told me.

233
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,662
[softly] Maddy...

234
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,213
If there's anything,
just give me a call.

235
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,339
Yeah. Thank you.

236
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,478
[Regina] Keh,
you'll get a kick out of this.

237
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,898
No fingerprints, but all the
hand patterns are upside down.

238
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,234
Like our perp was hanging
from the ceiling.

239
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,111
That line up with anything
from forensics?

240
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:24,031
No footprints on the ceiling,
if that's what you mean.

241
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:26,867
But I spoke to the neighbors,
and more than one of them said

242
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,871
that Mr. Mitchell used to
knock Mrs. Mitchell around.

243
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,081
He beat her?

244
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,918
No forced entry,
an abusive husband.

245
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,712
Motive.

246
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,228
[Sydney] Please let me stay
with you for a few days.

247
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:58,690
I can blow off work,
and a few auditions.

248
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,568
It's not like I'm booking
anything anyway.

249
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,073
[sighs]

250
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,658
It felt so real this time.

251
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,995
[sighs deeply]

252
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,623
I just...

253
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,753
I just couldn't do enough
to protect her.

254
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,804
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

255
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,556
[Madison] I know,
but this is my home,

256
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,768
and I'm not gonna let it be
taken away from me too.

257
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,688
I'll be fine, I promise.

There's nobody there.

277
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,439
There's no one there.

278
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:29,150
It's all in my head.
It's all in my head.

279
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,695
There's no one there.
It's all in my...

280
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,447
It's all in my head.

- Hey, are you gonna let me in?
- [sighs]

293
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,466
Jesus, Sydney,
what are you doing?

294
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,261
[grunts] Okay. My key wasn't
working and you weren't...

295
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,262
Oh, God.

296
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,722
You weren't answering.

297
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,643
I thought something was wrong,
I was worried.

298
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,895
[exhales heavily]

299
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,063
Thanks.

300
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:37,237
Oh, I, um, installed deadbolts.

301
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,824
[sighs in relief]
That makes so much sense.

302
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,618
Well, okay.

303
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,245
Mom made a casserole.

304
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,581
I could not climb with it,
so it is outside, but,

305
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:49,833
um...

306
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,419
You okay?

307
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:55,713
Derek did that.

308
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,300
He smashed my head
against the wall.

309
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,510
What?

310
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,222
I'm so sorry, Maddy.

311
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:06,724
Nobody deserves to die that way,

312
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,811
but seriously, fuck him.

313
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,314
You deserve so much better.

314
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,152
I thought about it a lot,
about leaving him.

315
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,239
By the time I got the courage,
I got pregnant.

316
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:27,328
Now, if only I'd been able
to have a baby.

317
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,998
Don't do that.
This is not your fault.

318
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,624
That's not what I'm saying.

319
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,838
I wanted to know
what it felt like

320
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,841
to have a blood connection
with someone.

321
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,136
A biological connection.

322
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,347
Maddy, what are
you talking about?

323
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,809
[sighs] Shit.

324
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,818
Mom and Dad took me in
when I was eight.

325
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,156
I don't remember
anything before that.

326
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:07,118
Mom told me that my biological
mother died during my birth.

327
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:09,871
Sydney, I'm adopted.

[dark dramatic music playing]

329
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,767
[woman] Welcome to
the Seattle Underground.

330
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,852
No, folks, this is not

331

- of Nirvana or Pearl Jam.
- [laughter]

332
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,190
This is a tour of old Seattle,

333
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:38,399
buried underneath here

334
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,527
like a time capsule
of a bygone era.

335
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,153
All this used to be
at street level

336
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:43,738
where the people worked
and lived.

337
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,491
But after the great fire
of 1889,

338
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,785
they decided to rebuild
the new city

339
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,245
on top of the old city.

340
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,248
One story higher
to stave off flooding.

341
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,250
You can still see
the cobblestone streets

342
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,669
and the storefronts down here.

343
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:01,339
And there are rumors of
passages stretching for miles.

344
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:03,258
Some say the ghosts of the past

345
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,842
still haunt these tunnels.

00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:08,233
<i>Mommy said she'd love me

722
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,447
<i>I won't.</i>

723
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,616
<i>You can't make me.</i>

724
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,870

726
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,585
<i>Nothing, Daddy.</i>

727
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,134
Some of the conversations
you had with Gabriel

728
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,928
just chilled us to the bone.

729
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:40,473
Wait, so Gabriel was something
that I made up?

730
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:42,976
Whatever you went through
before you joined our family,

731
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:46,896
it hurt you in a way
that I can't even imagine.

732
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,482
I always figured
you created Gabriel

733
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,859
so that you could survive that.

734
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:54,988
We thought if we
gave you enough love,

735
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,490
you wouldn't need him anymore.

736
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,495
I hope we weren't wrong.

Emily started</i>

Uh, I'm sorry.

Madison,

01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:32,505
the department works
with a hypnotherapist

815
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,548
that helps unlock
repressed memories.

816
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:38,010
Trauma, sexual abuse, PTSD.

817
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:40,012
Would you be willing to see one?

818
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,347
I knew it.

819
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,933
[Regina] She's not a psychic,
God damn it.

The bygone years
reconstructing themselves.

823
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,445
I want you to go back
to before the adoption.

824
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:59,031
[breathing heavily]
I think I'm in a hospital.

825
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,701
But I don't remember any of it.

826
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,911
Okay, you've gone back

827
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,412
beyond your conscious memories.

828
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:08,332
Can you tell us why
you're in the hospital?

829
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,126
[thunder rumbling]

830
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,505
I'm not sure.

831
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,344
But I'm better now.

832
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:23,264
That's why they're here for me.

833
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:26,267
- [hypnotherapist] Who?
- [Madison] My new parents.

834
01:07:27,935 --> 01:07:30,604
They've come to take me
to my new home.

835
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,857
It's nice.

836
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,362
But he's here too.

837
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,411
Gabriel.

838
01:07:49,748 --> 01:07:52,418
He followed me home
from the hospital.

839
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:56,672
Who is Gabriel?
Is he a friend?

840
01:07:56,755 --> 01:08:01,510
He says he is, but I'm the
only one that can see him.

841
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:02,928
[Frank] You ruined
your mother's cake.

842
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,014
- I didn't, it was Gabriel.
- Stop.

843
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:06,974
You can't keep lying
like this, Maddy.

844
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:09,226
- I'm not lying.
- There's no Gabriel.

845
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,813
Go to your room. Madison,
go to your room right now.

[Madison]<i> So when</i>
<i>he does something bad,</i>

Go away.

What?

853
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,057
But she's sleeping.

854
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:55,731
I guess.

855
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,237

like a good surprise?

- Beverly!
- Get her out right now!

01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,490
When I touch your forehead,
you will be back with us.

Are you okay?

881
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,879
I remember now.

882
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:47,760
It's happened before,

883
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,970
waking up in strange places,

884
01:10:50,971 --> 01:10:52,473
seeing things.

885
01:10:56,351 --> 01:11:00,314
I don't know how,
but Gabriel wanted to...

[Madison sighs]

887
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,781
What did he want, Madison?

888
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,577
To hurt the baby.

889
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:19,124
It's as if he knew
that with you here...

890
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,045
I wouldn't need him anymore.

891
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:27,299
And he was right.

892
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:30,386
He became a lost memory,

893
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:33,097
buried deep in the back
of my head...

894
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,183
until now.

895
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:42,940
The killer said he was Gabriel.

896
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:47,319
My Gabriel.

897
01:11:50,531 --> 01:11:53,700
Wait, are you saying
that the killer is

898
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:56,662
your imaginary friend?

It's the rest of
the missing trophy,

928
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,213
I told you, from day one.

929

You got the murder weapon,
the coat, the gloves,

930

He got into my house.
He's done it before.

- I don't know.

tell you what I think.

Those doctors helped you.
It worked for a while.

943

But now your sickness is back

944
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:37,924

[Gabriel]<i> You know who I am.</i>
<i>You found me.</i>

961
01:16:40,695 --> 01:16:43,782
I didn't find you soon enough.

962

<i>But you found my things.
I want them back.</i>

963

Why was your stuff
in her attic, hmm?

964
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,043
You trying to incriminate her?

<i>Dumb bitch didn't even know
I was nesting in her home.</i>

966

in your face last night,</i>

968

Who are you, Gabriel?

970

already told you.</i>

01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:39,877
[Sydney] Oh, my God! Maddy!

1074
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:44,465
[Dr. Weaver]
<i>So what exactly is Gabriel?</i>

1075
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:48,553
<i>Gabriel is an extreme version
of a teratoma.</i>

1076
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,556
<i>A tumor consisting of tissues,
hair, teeth, muscles, bones.</i>

1077
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,766
<i>But more specifically,
in this case,</i>

1078
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:56,978
<i>it's a parasitic twin.</i>

1079
01:26:57,061 --> 01:26:59,063
<i>When two embryos
develop in the womb</i>

1080
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,982
<i>don't separate like they should,</i>

1081
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:02,316
<i>one twin is dominant,</i>

1082
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,860
<i>while the other
is underdeveloped.</i>

1083
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:05,111
<i>It's not considered conjoined</i>

1084
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:06,654
<i>because the underdeveloped twin</i>

1085
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:08,239
<i>is dependent on the body
of the other.</i>

1086
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:13,703
<i>Like a parasite,
Gabriel feeds off Emily.</i>

1087
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:15,621
[woman 1] What's the matter,
Pollyanna?

1088
01:27:15,705 --> 01:27:18,291
You get lost on the way
to the country club?

1089
01:27:18,374 --> 01:27:20,168
[laughter]

1090
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,427
Look, I don't want any trouble.

1091
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,387
I don't give a fuck
what you want.

1092
01:27:40,813 --> 01:27:42,190
<i>An apple.</i>

1093
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:46,194
<i>Pig.</i>

1094
01:27:46,277 --> 01:27:47,612
<i>A teddy bear.</i>

1095
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:49,447
<i>We're starting to suspect
that Gabriel</i>

1096
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,532
<i>can somehow access
the region to the brain</i>

1097
01:27:51,616 --> 01:27:53,785
<i>that process visual stimuli,</i>

1098
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:56,829
<i>and make Emily see
what he wants her to see.</i>

1099
01:27:56,913 --> 01:27:58,748
<i>This would explain
her recent claims</i>

1100
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:03,169
<i>of hallucinations
and waking dreams.</i>

1101

[woman 1] What the fuck
did you do to get in here?

1103
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,174
Forget to separate

1104

[laughter]

1105
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:12,553

[woman 2] Oh, shit.

1122
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:07,024
Yo, this bitch
is having a seizure.

1123
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:08,985
<i>Because they literally
share the same brain,</i>

1124
01:29:09,068 --> 01:29:10,778
<i>I think he's able
to trick her mind</i>

1125
01:29:10,862 --> 01:29:13,281
<i>and make her think she's
living her life as usual.</i>

1126
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:17,201
<i>Essentially, placing her
in a mental prison.</i>

1127
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:18,870
<i>When in reality,</i>

1128
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,665
<i>Gabriel has hijacked her body
and is using it himself.</i>

1129
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:25,543
[screams]

1130
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,879
[gasps and screams]

1131
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,299
<i>It's time to cut out the cancer.</i>

1132
01:29:31,382 --> 01:29:34,343
<i>Gabriel's parasitic nature
has increased significantly</i>

1133
01:29:34,427 --> 01:29:37,180
<i>as he's now siphoning
more fluids and nutrients,</i>

1134
01:29:37,263 --> 01:29:39,015
<i>resulting in severe weight loss.</i>

1135
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:41,309
<i>So Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory,
and myself have concluded,</i>

1136
01:29:41,392 --> 01:29:45,813
<i>the only way to save Emily
is to excise the teratoma.</i>

1137
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:48,608
<i>Now, Gabriel is conjoined
at the brain,</i>

1138
01:29:49,901 --> 01:29:52,069
<i>so full removal could kill Emily</i>

1139
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,488
<i>or result in permanent
brain damage.</i>

1140
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:57,742
<i>Course of action would be
to remove what we can</i>

1141
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,494

1142

I'll stay with her. It's okay.
Paramedics are on the way.

Right, I know, Officer,

but if you could just call
Detective Kekoa Shaw,

1260

then he can fill you in,

that Sydney Lake is here.

I'm sorry.
Nobody is allowed in here.

1263

He was the cause
of your miscarriages.

He was feeding off
of your fetuses

1321

Did you forget
we share the same brain?

1353
01:44:03,336 --> 01:44:06,423
I didn't ask
to be tethered to you.

1354
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:09,134
You don't deserve your body.

1355

You can't lock me
in here forever.

You'll always be stuck with me.

1365

Sooner or later I will get out.

Yet in the end, it was right
in front of me all along.
