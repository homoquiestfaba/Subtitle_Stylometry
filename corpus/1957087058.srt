1
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,008
[Silence]

2
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:27,244
[August] So, this is
my last day in this life.

3
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,942
Fucked up, right?

4
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,902
Ever since I was a boy,
I dreamed about
doing this shit.

5
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:36,297
Some kids dream about
being a ballplayer,
a firefighter,

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,689
some quack doctor.

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,778
Fuck all that.

8
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:43,695
I wanted to play
in the big game,
and I got there.

9
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,263
Hey, you know what?
I'm getting ahead of myself.

10
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:48,613
Let me start
at the beginning.

11
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:51,703
[Tires screeching]

12
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,489
[Rapid gunfire]

13
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:06,370
[Sirens wailing]

14
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,894
[Gunfire continues]

15
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,859
How you doin', man?

16
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:22,821
What's up, man?
What you doin'?

17
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,911
Hey, let me get
some of that popcorn, man.

18
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:38,402
Fuckin' grease.
You got any napkins, man?

19
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,665
Thanks, bro.

20
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,321
You ain't got no goobers
or some shit?

21
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,237
Are you here by yourself?

22
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,631
I don't like coming
to movies by myself.

23
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,720
It's hard to get somebody
to come to the movies with you

24
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,200
in the middle
of the day, right?

25
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,506
Everybody's got
a fuckin' job.

26
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,336
I like comin' here alone.
You can do whatever you want.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,644
Whatever the fuck
you want, right?

28
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:05,603
Just get up...

29
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,519
Do some fuckin'
jumpin' Jacks and shit.

30
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:11,609
Push-ups...

31
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:15,265
Just chillin'
in the movie theater,
doin' some push-ups.

32
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,876
Yo, yo, yo...
If there was some girls
in here, I'd be like...

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,662
Aah...ooh...

34
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,317
Yeah!

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,407
Fuckin' six pack,
shit like...

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,453
Fuckin' drago
or some shit.

37
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:33,153
Damn. Yo,
let me get some more
of that popcorn, bro.

38
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,375
All you.

39
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,378
I don't even know why
they call this shit butter.

40
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:46,122
This shit isn't
even butter-flavored.
It's disgusting.

41
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,471
You know what they put
on this stuff?

42
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,820
It's like rocket fuel.

43
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:51,997
You could launch
like missiles and shit.

44
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,696
Hey, I'm Ronnie.

45
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,482
August.

46
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,441
How you doin'?

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,922
That's a fucked-up name.

48
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,402
It's a long story.

49
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,448
How about you save it
for another time?

50
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,406
Yeah, I was plannin' on it.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,973
Man, you got any money?

52
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,457
If you're hungry,
you can finish off
the popcorn.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,849
I said,
you got any money?

54
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,069
Careful with
that knife there, son.

55
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:23,507
Am I speakin' Chinese?
Give me your shit.

56
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,944
You don't understand.Eh, you don't understand,
you fuck.

57
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,294
Let me get your wallet.

58
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:28,730
I'm a fuck, huh?Yeah.

59
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,819
Listen, kid.
You don't understand.

60
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,258
Hey.

61
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:38,435
Give me your money.

62
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,872
I'm no fuckin' fool.All right, all right.

63
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,439
And I ain't about to be
partin' with my money.

64
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,701
Okay.

65
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,094
Are we followin', here?Okay.

66
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,878
Put your little
peanut knife away.

67
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,445
All right.All right.

68
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,752
Take it easy.All right.

69
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,494
Now you wanna do
a job right...

70
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,844
[Whispers] You better
have the right tool.

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,629
Now what?

72
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,462
Well, my new-found friend
August,

73
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,422
that would depend
on what you want to do
after the movie.

74
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,472
[Honking]

75
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,517
[August] I met Ronnie
at a movie theater
on the lower east side.

76
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,214
I guess he saw
somethin' in me,

77
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,216
thought I'd be good
at this shit.

78
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,654
They say you reap
what you sew, right?

79
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:37,788
Create your own destiny
and whatnot.

80
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,964
Well, Ronnie had no idea
what he was sewin'.

81
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,358
We became best of friends,
though, tight.

82
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,013
We still are, but that
was three years ago,

83
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:48,669
and a lot of shit can change
in three years, trust me.

84
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:02,334
[Door opens]

85
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,169
Roy boy!
Where's my joy?

86
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,695
This better be good
to get me out of my bed.

87
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:18,525
Where'd you buy that outfit?
The fucking methadone clinic?

88
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,396
Oh, shit.

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,616
Frankie, get me
a cup of coffee, huh?

90
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,097
How you doin'?
Everything's all right?
You been out today?

91
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,664
How the fuck
can I be out?

92
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,145
You woke me up
when you called me.

93
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,060
You hear anything
about me?

94
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,411
What the hell
happened now?

95
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,286
Well, i'm...
[Clears throat]

96
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,637
I'm pretty sure you
could call this a fuck-up,

97
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,640
but let me just run this
by you just to make sure,
all right?

98
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,817
So, I'm doin'
this job tonight.

99
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,732
Don't ask me for who,
because I'm not gonna
tell you,

100
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,342
but I did this job
tonight.

101
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,170
So a couple hours, you know,
I'm in their house...

102
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,041
I'm getting
a little bumped up

103
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,217
because, you know,
sometimes I work better
like that, you know?

104
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,698
A little snow to start
the fuckin' show, all right?

105
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,005
Anyway, this guy,
he owes money--
about 10 grand.

106
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,224
It's no big deal,
but it's nothin'
to blow snot at, right?

107
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,791
But he's actin'
like a real prick.

108
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,358
The guy's skippin' in
and out of town

109
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,795
like he plays for the Knicks
or some shit.

110
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,405
Fuckin' Knicks...
You see that game last night?

111
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,320
Just tell me the story.

112
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,409
All right,
so the collector decides
he ain't worth the space.

113
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:20,238
So he gives me a call
because, you know,
I'm who you call, right?

114
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,023
Yeah,
like ghostbusters, huh?

115
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,199
Right, but I don't
bust ghosts, I make 'em.

116
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,592
Just tell me
the story, huh?

117
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,768
So, I'm followin'
this guy around.

118
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,684
This guy's got on
a blue shirt,
khaki pants, hush puppies.

119
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,207
I don't know what the fuck--
he must've been

120
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,731
at a fuckin' sale
at j.Crew or some shit.

121
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:38,387
But anyway, it's neither--Frankie, where's
the fuckin' coffee?

122
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,173
Can I finish?Go ahead.

123
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,788
The fuck
you go for it.

124
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,572
What's this?

125
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,356
Come here.
What is this shit?

126
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,749
Don't give me
this pink shit!

127
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,273
Give me sugar!
Sugar!

128
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,971
Just 'cause you're
on a fuckin' diet

129
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,929
doesn't mean everybody else
has to eat that shit.

130
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,801
Can I have
your attention?

131
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,585
Tell me the story.

132
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,761
So, I'm out. I'm followin'
this guy around.

133
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,720
We're hoppin' from bar to bar.
This guy's a real big-shot.

134
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,809
He's buying drinks
for everybody in the house.

135
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,725
This asshole
even bought me a drink.
Can you believe that shit?

136
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,379
Bought you a drink?Isn't that ironic?

137
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,817
It's ironic.Anyway...

138
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,428
It is ironic.I just said it was ironic.

139
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:23,171
Do you know what that means?Yeah, I know what it means.

140
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,912
All right, listen...Finish the fuckin' story.

141
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,653
All right, anyway,
it's gettin' late,

142
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,307
and at this point,
with all the little sniff
and the drinks,

143
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,310
I could be considered
legally intoxicated, you know?

144
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,486
I don't have all
my faculties about me.

145
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,793
How many times I gotta tell you
you gotta be tight on a job?

146
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,229
Would you just let me
finish the story?

147
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,622
So, the guy leaves
the spot, right?

148
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,406
I'm followin' him
and followin'.

149
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,844
For some reason,
this guy takes a walk
through the park.

150
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,149
So there's no one around.

151
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:48,152
I grab him from behind,
bust him over the head.

152
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,893
The guy goes down
like a sack of shit.

153
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,895
There's blood everywhere.
It's like a--

154
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,376
a Kodak moment.
The son of a bitch goes down.

155
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,986
I turn him over,

156
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,337
and you know how they say
that everyone's got a, um...

157
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,035
Like a-- like a twin?

158
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,907
What do you call it? A d--
you know, like when...
What?

159
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,996
People kind of like--
like, there's two of you,
double duty...

160
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,434
Doppelganger?right, a doppelganger.

161
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,915
I can't imagine what
your fuckin' doppelganger
looks like.

162
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,439
Just get to the story.That poor bastard.

163
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:17,268
All right,
so I turn him over,

164
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,488
and it's not my guy.

165
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,839
He's got on the same sweater,
same pants, same hush puppies,

166
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,581
the same shit,
but it's the wrong guy.

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,539
I cracked the wrong guy.

168
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:31,021
Can you believe that shit?
I was pissed off.

169
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,023
Jesus Christ.

170
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,547
Is that bad?

171
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,289
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

172
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,946
It's bad, right?

173
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,253
No, i--i--i saw him.
He was bloodied up.

174
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,777
But I recognize
this poor prick down there.

175
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,213
It's this guy--
I saw him downtown.

176
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,867
He's like a connected guy
or somethin'.

177
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,870
I mean,
this guy's got juice.

178
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:56,873
You got a fuckin' problem.

179
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,137
I'm not really the one
with the problem now.
He is. Right?

180
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,791
I mean,
what the hell's he doin'

181
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:04,054
walkin' in the park
at 3:00 in the mornin', right?

182
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,100
Asshole.

183
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,631
You really fucked up
this time.

184
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,418
Does Ronnie know
about this yet?

185
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,551
He'll know soon enough.

186
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,554
It's bad, right?

187
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,860
Hey, baby.

188
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,557
Good morning, gorgeous.

189
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:13,950
We got any aspirin?

190
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,822
No, we're all out.

191
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:29,139
[Sighs]

192
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:32,142
So, what's on your
day planner today?

193
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:36,843
I'm doing a favor for Madison.
I'm gonna walk her dog petey.

194
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:42,457
Doesn't she have
other people that can
walk her dog for her?

195
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,372
Well, it's not really a dog.

196
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,244
It's her brother-in-law,
and he's going
on his first job.

197
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,290
She's a little nervous
he ain't ready.

198
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,031
He's a bit of a live wire.

199
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,554
And avi ain't
the kind of cat to meow

200
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:56,340
if he loses his shit,
right?

201
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,603
[Groans]

202
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,000
So, what are you gonna do
about August?

203
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,697
I don't want
to talk about August.

204
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,047
Whatever.

205
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,572
Hey, do you think he likes
tulips or daisies?

206
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,227
Huh?

207
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,230
For his headstone. You think
he'd like tulips or daisies?

208
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:19,581
I like tulips.
I think he'd like tulips.

209
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,238
Don't try to pretend
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:26,675
I'm talking about you
trying to save August

211
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,764
from catching a bullet
in the brain.

212
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:34,552
Any way you slice it,
August gets got.

213
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:37,555
You're trying to throw
a lifesaver to a man
who's floating face down.

214
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,297
Pray for him or pity him,
but don't try to rescue him.

215
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,647
You know, you don't understand
August and me.

216
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,693
Hmm.

217
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,521
I got him
into this whole thing.

218
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,262
Kicking and screaming.
Oh, poor guy.

219
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:50,568
Why am I even trying
to talk to you about loyalty.

220
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:55,878
Loyalty to you
and most women in america

221
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:59,273
means shoppin'
in the same store twice,
right?

222
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,971
Don't try to turn this
into a man-woman thing.

223
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,974
Trying to save something
that can't be saved
ain't no man-woman thing.

224
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,890
It's just a fuckin'
waste of time.

225
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,110
I'm just saying there's
a bond between men

226
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,068
that women just don't have.

227
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,591
Really, now?

228
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,898
All the best teams are men.

229
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,378
Who?

230
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,555
Butch Cassidy, Sundance kid.

231
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,122
Tom Sawyer, huck Finn.

232
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,079
E.t. And Elliott.

233
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,646
How do you know
e.T.'S a guy?

234
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:27,127
Oh, you didn't see?
He's got a huge penis.

235
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,695
E.t. Stands for
extra testicles.

236
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,828
How about lone ranger
and Tonto?

237
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,656
Ah...

238
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,179
Kramden and Norton.

239
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,615
Norton. Mm-hmm.

240
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,487
The main difference
between men and women...

241
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,012
When things go south,
men stand together, women bail.

242
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,145
August would let you
choke on your own vomit

243
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,929
if it meant 50 cents.

244
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,979
You know, it's
a shame you don't feel
the same way about me

245
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,285
as you do about August.

246
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,201
We'd be like
joanie and chachi.

247
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,773
Who?[laughs]

248
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,776
You watch too much TV.
Gotta get out more.

249
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,299
[Tea kettle whistling]

250
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,735
Don't worry about this.
I'll get this.

251
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,216
Fuckin' slob.

252
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,170
[Ronnie]
You don't understand
August and me.

253
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,172
You don't.

254
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,827
I got him into
this whole thing.

255
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,888
[August]
Yo, is he dead?

256
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:21,545
I don't know.
I shot him.

257
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,547
He's probably dead.

258
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,028
Damn.

259
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,812
That's what I thought
the first time.

260
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,684
Now, listen,
'cause I'm tellin' ya.

261
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,468
You don't ever
shoot nobody

262
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:34,602
without a contract
or a reason.

263
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,473
What about five grand?

264
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,433
Pretty good reason.

265
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,739
Yo, yo,
did he just move?

266
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,524
No, that's you, man.
You're shaking.

267
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,876
Yo, i--i never killed
anybody before.

268
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,532
You know that, right?

269
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,840
The first time's
the hardest, right?

270
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,495
Don't worry about it.
Your record's still intact.

271
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,845
You still didn't
kill nobody.

272
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,065
What are you talking about?
He's--he's dead.

273
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:06,590
This is one dead guy,
but you didn't have
a thing to do with it.

274
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,678
What do you mean?
We both shot him.

275
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,115
I shot him,
and you shot him.

276
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:12,205
No. I shot him.
You missed him.

277
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,945
How do you know
I missed?

278
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,426
I had my eyes open
when I pulled the trigger.

279
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,560
The fact of the matter is,
is you didn't kill this guy.

280
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:24,478
And we're splitting 10 grand
for a job that
I completed on my own.

281
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,134
So, what are you sayin'?

282
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:31,789
I'm sayin', so maybe
I should keep all the money.

283
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,617
No, you can't do that.

284
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,271
Oh, no? Why not?

285
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,099
'Cause I'll
fuckin' shoot you.

286
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,101
You'd miss.

287
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,277
Well, yo,
I want my money, man.

288
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,670
What do I gotta do now?

289
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,150
You do the job that
you're being paid for.

290
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:47,196
You kill the guy.

291
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,199
He's already dead!Then kill him again!

292
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,810
Yo, I can't shoot him, man.
He's down. He's already dead.

293
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,812
I can't do that.

294
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:58,816
Whatever your problem is,
August, pullin' the trigger,
get over it.

295
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,255
You want your money?
You got to stand
behind your work.

296
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,084
Okay.

297

[Cocks gun]

298
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,962
August.

299
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,268
Okay, okay, okay.

300

301
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,273
Ooh!

302
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:22,318
Shit!

303
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,972
Fuck.

304
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,365
You see that?I saw it.

305
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,627
Do it again.

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,848
Oh, fuck, man!

[Heavy breathing]

310
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,678
Yo, I killed him again.

311
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,899
Ho--!

312
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,510
Come on, let's get
out of here, man,

313
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,470
before we're swimmin'
in blue boys.

314
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,211
[August]
Ronnie was right--

315
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:48,649
two bullets and a dead body,
and I was hooked.

316
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,955
This lifestyle,
what we do--

317
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,436
for most guys,
it's all about the money,

318
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,569
but for me,
it was about playing god.

319
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,353
I can see that now.

320
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,442
If Ronnie knew all this
was gonna happen,

321
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:02,532
pshh, I bet he would
have left me back
in that movie theater

322
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,621
where he found me.

323
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,483
Now Ronnie thinks
he could buy me time

324
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,398
by doing favors
for these assholes,

325
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,923
like Madison,
the big bitch in town.

326
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,754
I owe her a few bucks.
What's the big deal?

327
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,409
She's got
a hard-on for me.

328
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,456
Now Ronnie's trying
to throw some water
on a couple of my fires,

329
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,414

brought a bigger hose

is burning fast.

that what we talked about,

515
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,736
There's a big difference.

516
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,609
Being closer to god is just
a spiritual thing, you know,

517
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:59,178
like chanting or praying,
that kind of shit.

518
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,093
But bein' god-like

519
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:05,314
is havin' the power to control
someone's destiny.

520

is goin' like this

531

a question.

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,621
Do you think god has pity
on these people we go after?

536
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,362
I mean,
look at some of the stuff
they're involved with--

loan sharking, bribery.

852
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:12,210
I don't drink dairy.

853
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,651
Got any aspirin?

854
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:21,697
I'm sorry...

855
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:24,570
No drugs you can buy
over the counter.

856
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:32,708
The weirdest thing
just happened to me, Paige.

857
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:36,625
So tell me.

858
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:40,281
[Ronnie] I was headin'
to some club to pick up
this kid petey,

859
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:43,893
tryin' to buy August
some breathin' room
with Madison.

860
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,722
Between
my roof-top adventures
with the senator

861
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,029
and Madison's brother-in-law,

862
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:52,206
my pal August has kept me
real fuckin' busy today.

863
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,904
He's not exactly
employee of the month,

864
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,776
if you know what I mean.

865
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:08,918
For every action,
there's an equally
violent reaction.

866
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:11,660
And fuckin' over Nicky caputo
is something

867
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,662
I can't even really
think about right now.

868
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:15,186
I have other things
on my mind.

869
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:22,584
[Man] Damn!

870
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:28,677
So I get to the place,
and there he is,
little man petey.

871
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:31,811
Tough guy. I hate
workin' with amateurs.

872
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:34,248
I wouldn't work with amateurs
even when I was an amateur.

873
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,729
And petey...

874
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:39,253
He reeked of stupidity.

875
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:43,910
I didn't have to smell
his breath to realize

876
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,695
this kid spends a lot of time
with his head up his ass.

877
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:48,262
Are you Ronnie?

878
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,658
That's Ronnie.
I gotta go.

879
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,616
Bye-bye.

880
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,493
You don't pull a piece out
in public unless
you're gonna use it.

881
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:03,799
That's common knowledge,
right?

882
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:07,673
That's how I've always felt.

883
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:12,156
[Ronnie] I swear to god,
if August puts me
in this position again--

884
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:27,519
They call this part
the calm before the storm.

885
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,538
Please don't fuck me.

886
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:48,322
Come on, man.
I'm solid, all right?

887
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:51,456
Solid like a rock.

888
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:54,328
[Ronnie] I can tell
why Madison would want me
to hold petey's hand

889
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,808
through this exchange
with avi.

890
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:57,549
Fucking speed freak.

891
00:51:57,592 --> 00:52:00,378
Doing drugs and dealing drugs
at the same time

892
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:02,945
can be a very bad thing.

893
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,266
Oh, man!

894
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:23,270
I don't think
I can handle this, Ronnie.

895
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:24,750
I'm not really good
with blood, bro.

896
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:28,101
Get in there.
It'll get better fast.

897
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,103
[Chickens clucking]

898
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:38,720
[Laughing]

899
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:41,027
Ronnie...

900
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,725
[Ronnie] Now, I've
dealt with avi before,
and I gotta say,

901
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:47,512
it ain't exactly
my favorite place
to conduct business.

902
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,427
The plan is
to get in, get out.

903
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,298
A quick exchange
of product for capital.

904
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:54,606
Madison gets happy,
August gets time.

905
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,782
[Avi] Oh...
[Laughing]

906
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,566
Well, now look
what we have here.

907
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,700
[Laughing]

908
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:04,703
Ronnie, I expected
to see you.

909
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:07,880
Madison told me
to expect one man.

910
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:12,624
And look at this.
We have twice that.

911
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:16,280
A little unsure.
This kid's a little green.

912
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:20,632
No, I wouldn't
have guessed.

913
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:23,852
Huh? You doin' okay?
You know somethin', Ronnie?

914
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:27,247
I think you're gonna
have to change
someone's diapers

915
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,640
when we finish
our business here.

916
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:31,295
Speaking of which...

917
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:36,865
You know the routine.

918
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,650
[Ronnie] So far,
things are goin' smooth,

919
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:40,304
but I'm keeping
one eye on petey.

920
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:42,436
He was shifting around,
acting nervous.

921
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,699
I don't know, man.
What the fuck?

922
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,962
And this kid avi,
he's got instincts
like an animal.

923
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:49,791
Once he smells fear,
you're his.

924
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:53,621
[Laughter]

925
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,280
[Laughter]

926
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:05,590
I see all the cocks
aren't in cages.

927
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,203
[Laughter]

928
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:19,995
Whoa!

929
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,215
[Ronnie] Showtime.

930
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:27,307
Ronnie!

931
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,615
[Chickens clucking]

932
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,535
[Ronnie] Then somethin'
really weird happened.

933
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,754
Well, it was, like,
in-my-head weird.

934
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:42,104
Like everythin' around me
stopped,

935
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,455
and all of this world
was this childhood scene

936
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:47,153
that was just playing out
in my head.

937
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:50,548
[Man] Listen to me, Ronnie,
'cause I'm tellin' you,

938
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:54,552
there's a common bond
among men that should
never be taken lightly.

939
00:54:54,595 --> 00:55:00,427
Seasons come and go,
but a good friend
is timeless.

940
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:04,605
And everything else
gets devoured.

941
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,395
As you mature, Ronnie,
you'll experience
many new things--

942
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:14,833
new sights,
sounds, smells--

943
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:18,184
some filled with pleasure,
some marked with pain.

944
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:21,056
If you're lucky enough
to find that special friend,

945
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,494
you do whatever it takes
to keep it goin',

946
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:27,193
even when the goin'
gets hard.

947
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:29,238
That's right, Ronnie.

948
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:32,198
Nourish that friendship,
'cause life is fleeting,

949
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,678
just like god.

950
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:37,029
Remember that.

951
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:41,555
A good friend is
a life-long investment.

952
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:44,471
You do whatever you must

953
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:47,561
to keep the friendship
alive and breathing.

954
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:49,084
[Thunder crackles]

955
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:51,217
[Organ plays]

956
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:57,354
Until there's nothing left
of either of you.

957
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:03,185
That's pretty
fuckin' strange, Ronnie.

958
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:05,884
Was your father always
saying shit like that?

959
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:09,104
I never met my father.

960
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:14,980
Look at that!

961
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,591
He's screaming!

962
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:18,679
Is this painful?

963
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,594
It looks uncomfortable.

964
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:23,597
[Laughter]

965
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:25,382
[Gunshot]

966
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:30,169
Ronnie!

967
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,433
Motherfucker!

968
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:35,522
Ronnie, you're
disturbin' my birds.

969
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:37,959
Huh, Ronnie...

970
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:40,353
Take it easy, kid.
Take it easy.

971
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,660
Avi, put the gun down,
prick.

972
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,489
He was your responsibility,
Ronnie.

973
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,491
It's not gonna end
like this now.

974
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:50,624
Come on, now, ro--
Ronnie! Put the gun down!

975
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,583
It seems we have
a problem, my brother.

976
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,585
You know what
has to happen now.

977
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:58,023
Back off and shut up.
All right? Now,
back off, shut up!

978
00:56:58,066 --> 00:57:00,286
[Ronnie]
In hostage situations,
there are no winners.

979
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:02,201
You may be able to prolong
the inevitable,

980
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:04,638
but come to think of it,
that's a pretty good reason

981
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,335
to stick a gun
in some bloke's back.

982
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,512
Quit yelling in my fuckin' ear!
My name's Leo, all right?

983
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,775
I don't even like
my fuckin' job!

984
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:12,951
You know what?
You know what I did for
the last 10 years of my life?

985
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,909
I was a fucking
casting director!

986
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,476
Give me a fuckin' break!

987
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,653
I work in a chicken shack!Hey, easy!

988
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:21,481
I've read about
these situations.

989
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:22,874
Remain calm.

[Ronnie] When the message
is bad, sometimes
they kill the messenger.

20 thou. What's up?

00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:25,518
Yeah?this one's for you.

1026
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,782
Everybody's
gonna be cool, okay?

1027
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:30,436
Huh, be cool.

1028
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:34,005
This is for you.I'm taking the telephone.

1029
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:36,790
Hello?

1030
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:39,793
Who is this?

1031
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:43,188
I'll Bury your fuckin' ass,
you understand?

1032
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,799
You know, he was just goin'
on and on and on,

1033
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:48,759
so I figured I'd just save
your battery.

1034
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:51,892
With friends like this,
who needs enemies?

1035
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:54,155
Now, what were we gonna do?

1036
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,896
[Beeping]

1037
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,637
May I?

1038
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,857
Please do.

1039
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,252
August, you motherfucker!

1040
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:07,865
I'm sorry.

1041
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:08,996
[Whispers]
Madison.

1042
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,911
Hey, Madison,
how you doin'?

1043
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:12,870
Oh, it's a long story.
Never mind.

1044
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,308
Oh. Oh, yeah,
that guy flipped out,
and now he's in pieces.

1045
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:19,441
Who was that masked man?

1046
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:21,356
Oh, he was.

1047
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,010
Sorry.

1048
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,014
Okay.

1049
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:28,886
Okay.

1050
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:29,756
No, he didn't.

1051
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,845
Yeah, he did.

1052
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,891
Yeah, I'm lookin'
at him right now.

1053
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,196
Yeah.

1054
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,112
Yeah. Okay.

1055
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:42,551
Oh, sure.
Oh, that's no problem.

1056
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:43,988
Oh, that's more than fair.

1057
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,382
No, no, no.
No, saffron.

1058
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:50,211
Yeah, saffron,
and a hint of nutmeg.
Just a hint.

1059
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,126
Brings out that flavor.

1060
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,345
Oh, that's nice.

1061
01:00:53,388 --> 01:00:55,477
Oh, okay.
Okay.

1062
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:57,697
All right, then.
Uh-huh.

1063
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,568
Well, I'll see you
around the club.

1064
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:02,876
Shalom,baby.

1065
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,227
The governor called--
governess, to be precise.

1066
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:09,927
You've been pardoned.

1067
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,930
Easy, easy. Whoa, Nelly.
Down. Down, boy.

1068
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,366
Fuckin' thing down.Put it down.

1069
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,411
Put it down. It's okay.
It's all right.

1070
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:20,198
If I were you,
I would hop on a bus
and go to Atlantic city.

1071
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:24,028
'Cause today is
your lucky fuckin' day.

1072
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:27,074
Go on.

1073
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:30,382
Get the fuck out of here.

1074
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,169
Ugh!

1075
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:37,389
[Coughing]

1076
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:46,311
[Dana] I want you to keep
one thing in mind--

1077
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:48,139
August would let you choke
on your own vomit

1078
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:50,358
if it meant 50 cents.

1079
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,752
[Heavy breathing]

1080
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,210
Blood, chickens--
dirty, filthy fuckin'
birds, man.

1081
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:19,474
They were eatin'
each other.

1082
01:02:19,518 --> 01:02:22,956
Just another fuckin'
perfect day.

1083
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,525
It's so fuckin'
exciting, Ron.

1084
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:29,267
You know that shit
gets me hot.

1085
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,966
Hey, take it easy, okay?

1086
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,446
August is my best friend,

1087
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:37,057
even though he almost
got me killed today.

1088
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,885
He doesn't own me.

1089
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,888
I fuck who I want,
and that includes you.

1090
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:47,198
You're a bad girl.

1091
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:49,069
But it ain't gonna happen.

1092
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:50,941
Are you afraid of augy?

1093
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,031
Your blood's
gotta be pumping.

1094
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,684
Why don't you pump
some of that into me?

1095
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:57,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey!

1096
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,297
Come on.

1097
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,603
That was a long time ago.

1098
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:05,390
Fine.

1099
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:08,785
Let me ask you this then.

1100
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,573
When you were
in that elevator

1101
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:17,445
and you thought
you were gonna die--

1102
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:20,405
you did think you were
gonna die, didn't you?

1103
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:22,668
Yeah, I thought
I'd bought the farm.

1104
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:25,236
Mm-hmm.

1105
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:28,152
So, when you
were in that elevator

1106
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:31,242
and you thought
what you thought was gonna
be your last thought,

1107
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:32,330
what'd you think?

1108
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,419
Who'd you think about?

1109
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:39,946
Tell me your last thought.

1110
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,122
Was it about me?

1111
01:03:43,689 --> 01:03:45,212
Was it about Dana?

1112
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:48,128
[Speaking French]

1113
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:52,089
Stop! And you know
you can't talk about
my wife. Enough!

1114
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:58,312
Don't tell me
who the fuck I can
and can't talk about!

1115
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:02,055
Anytime you want,
you can exit
from the rear!

1116
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,756
[Speaking French]

1117
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:14,154
You're mad, you know that?
I forgot how mad you are.

1118
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:16,853
And you're fucking crazy.

1119
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,642
Hey, come on.
Be nice.

1120
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:33,782
Come on, Ron.
Just one more time.

1121
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:35,262
For old time's sake.
Come on.

1122
01:04:35,306 --> 01:04:39,092
How about you let me
sleep on your couch?

1123
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:42,835
For old time's sake,
let me keep this
nice and simple.

1124
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:56,849
So, what was that
last thought, Ronnie?

1125
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,807
Tell me.

1126
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:08,121
You know what I hate?

1127
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,515
What?

1128
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:12,517
Elevators.

1129
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,216
You hate elevators?
As--as a rule?

1130
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,871
That's right.

1131
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,307
I don't--
I don't use 'em.

1132
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,180
I've eliminated them
from my life completely.

1133
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,008
And don't think
it's because
I'm worried about them

1134
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,879
falling out of the sky
or something stupid
like that,

1135
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,360
even though that happens
more than you know.

1136
01:05:29,403 --> 01:05:30,883
What you got
against elevators?

1137
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,233
It's not just me, it's...

1138
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,192
You know, I don't think
you could appreciate this.

1139
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:38,499
I think this might be
above your head.

1140
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:44,114
All right, listen,
'cause this is important.

1141
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:48,205
Are you aware that 84.5%
of the American public

1142
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:52,252
uses an elevator every day
to get to and from work?

1143
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:54,646
I mean, it's become
such a regular occurrence

1144
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:56,561
that people don't even
think twice about it.

1145
01:05:56,604 --> 01:05:58,084
It makes me sick.

1146
01:05:58,128 --> 01:05:59,825
You understand
that america's become

1147
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:01,740
the laziest country
in the world.

1148
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,785
Well, what about France?

1149
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,700
That's a good point, Ronnie,
but the French aren't lazy.

1150
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:07,050
They're just pussies.

1151
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,921
I mean, look at some
other countries, though.

1152
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,575
Take Korea, for example.

1153
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:12,620
I got a lot of respect
for those pricks.

1154
01:06:12,664 --> 01:06:15,232
The elevator to them
is a western invention.

1155
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:16,711
They frown upon it.

1156
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:19,062
It's like opium.
It's fuckin' evil.

1157
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:21,325
What about Israel?
You think they
take elevators?

1158
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:24,371
I don't think so.
You know that
it's mandatory

1159
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:27,853
for every swinging cock
and tit over there
to serve in the army?

1160
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:29,681
Mandatory.

1161
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:31,074
Birds and all?

1162
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,293
What I just say?
Every schmuck goes.

1163
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:35,513
Mandatory stuff.

1164
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:36,731
I didn't know that.

1165
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:39,299
Well, start knowing it,
okay?

1166
01:06:39,343 --> 01:06:42,302
Because those shysters
are pointin', and plottin',

1167
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:44,522
and plannin' for a takeover.

1168
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:47,090
You know how much money
the national security
council spends

1169
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:50,658
watching these
renegade countries?
Trillions.

1170
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,444
But it don't matter,
because one day
the end is coming.

1171
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,664
I'm telling you,
it's gonna happen.

1172
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,666
End of what?

1173
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,581
Do I have to spell it
out for you?

1174
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,758
We've been kicking
so much ass for so long

1175
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:07,719
that one day
some small country that
no one thinks about,

1176
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:09,199
that no one
even talks about,

1177
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:12,463
is gonna come along
and pick up the check.

1178
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:15,422
You know?
Fix the wagon.

1179
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:17,859
Fix the wagon.

1180
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,774
Clean our clock.

1181
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:21,950
Ring our bell.

1182
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:26,868
You know, the fuckin' bell
with the clock and the tower.

1183
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:28,653
Oh, yeah.

1184
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:39,185
So, what do you think
about escalators?

1185
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:41,318
That's a good question.

1186
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:43,450
I thought a lot about that,
and my answer is,

1187
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:46,410
is that at first,
an escalator is
a moving stairway,

1188
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,586
so it's a tricky subject,
right?

1189
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:52,329
But in the end,
it's just another
death sentence for america.

1190
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:54,809
You're not foolin' me,
you sneaky bastards.

1191
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:56,637
You're an angry
son of a bitch,
ain't you?

1192
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,900
Suspicion beats confidence.

1193
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:01,381
Only the paranoid survive,
rondo.

1194
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:03,383
You ever think about

01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,456
then it's my concern, too.

1360
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,112
You do good work, Ronnie,
and I like you.

1361
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:22,246
Saving August is only gonna
put your own life at risk.

1362
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:26,032
What if I told you
I was...Retiring?

1363
01:17:26,076 --> 01:17:28,687
[Scoffs]
Don't be ridiculous.

1364
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,950
Retirement in
this business is death,

1365
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:32,778
one way or the other.

1366
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:34,954
You make your choices
in this life,

1367
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:37,348
and then you wake up
every single day

1368
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:39,219
and you live with them.

1369
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:42,222
You married yourself
to this job the first time
you picked up a gun.

1370
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:45,356
I just ain't gonna make this.
It's fuckin' killin' me.

1371
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,097
I'm dying inside.

1372
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,882
Stop stressing
about this life
and live it.

1373
01:17:49,926 --> 01:17:53,712
Maybe I don't feel like
courting death anymore.

1374
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,932
You're not goin' anywhere.

1375
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:58,412
Neither am I.

1376
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:02,547
Besides, you're
a member of the club,

1377
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,854
and membership
is irrevocable.

1378
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:07,421
Maybe you're right.

1379
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:09,510
Yeah, of course
I'm right.

1380
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:14,341
How do you think
I managed to survive
for so long in this game?

1381
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,223
Madison.

1382
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:27,833
Yes, Ronnie.

1383
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:32,316
I gotta make a call.

1384
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:36,363
Hmm, I'll sit right here
till you get back.

1385
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:38,931
You know,
he's his own worst enemy.

1386
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,324
August?

1387
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:42,805
Not while I'm alive.

1388
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:56,993
[Dana] Hello? [Ronnie] Hey, you.

1389
01:18:57,036 --> 01:18:59,386
Hey. Where are you, baby?
Comin' home soon?

1390
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,433
I'll be home
as soon as I can.

1391
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:04,217
August called.

1392
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,219
He was checking to make sure
you were meeting him later.

1393
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:07,699
I said I hope not.

1394
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,135
Oh, yeah?
What'd he say?

1395
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:11,659
He laughed.

1396
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:14,967
Don't go meet him, Ronnie.
Just come home, okay?

1397
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:17,274
[Sighs]
I can't explain this, okay?

1398
01:19:17,317 --> 01:19:22,061
But I have to go,
and I need to do this.

1399
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:26,849
You always put August first.

1400
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:31,331
Well, I'm sorry,
Dana, about that.
I really am.

1401
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:34,987
About what?
About August?

1402
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:38,034
I'm sorry about--
just about everything
right now.

1403
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:43,517
I just wanted you
to know that.

1404
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:48,044
Dana, can you hear me?

1405
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:51,699
Dana.

1406
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:05,801
I love you.

1407
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:46,178
What's up?

1408
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:47,788
The sky.Yeah?

1409
01:22:47,832 --> 01:22:49,747
What about you?

1410
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,141
You know,
the same old shit.
What's goin' on?

1411
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:54,186
How was your day?

1412
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,145
My best friend
almost got me killed...

1413
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:57,885
Nothin' unusual.

1414
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:00,845
That? Well, you gotta let
bygones be bygones.

1415
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:04,631
Don't let, uh, yesterday
dictate tomorrow.

1416
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:07,634
Well, it was just
a few hours ago, so, uh...

1417
01:23:07,678 --> 01:23:09,201
I'll get there.

1418
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:10,898
Whatever. How was
the rest of your day?

1419
01:23:10,942 --> 01:23:13,379
All right.
Where you coming from?

1420
01:23:13,423 --> 01:23:18,471
Just met Roy.
Came down here to see you.

1421
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:22,258
You?i had dinner with Madison.

1422
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:25,217
How was your day?

1423
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:29,917
Fuckin' Jonah knocked up
his girlfriend.

1424
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:32,224
Must not have made
the wife too happy.

1425
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:34,313
Usually doesn't, right?Right.

1426
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:37,708
She don't want to
get rid of it, though,
because she's catholic.

1427
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,972
So he tells me to, uh--make her not pregnant.

1428
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,974
Yeah, exactly.

1429
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,411
How'd you manage
that one?

1430
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:47,326
You know,
I did what I had to do.

1431
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:53,071
I, uh, broke
into her apartment
and waited for her.

1432
01:23:54,203 --> 01:23:55,552
And, you know,
she came in,

1433
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:57,467
and it was, like,
this, uh...

1434
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,556
Real pretty
Spanish girl.

1435
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:03,734
You know
how they say, uh,

1436
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:06,650
women glow
when they're pregnant?

1437
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:13,657
The girl looked,
you know, so happy
she was, like, glowin'.

1438
01:24:14,832 --> 01:24:18,357
And I just--

1439
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,185
then I...

1440
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:23,145
Grabbed her
and just started
hittin' her.

1441
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:26,365
You know, I was
just punchin' her.

1442
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:29,499
I must have punched her
like 10, 15 times.

1443
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,632
And then she's cryin',

1444
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,766
"no, no, my baby."

1445
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:37,724
Like, she's talkin'
in Spanish.

1446
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:39,291
I started
hittin' her harder

1447
01:24:39,335 --> 01:24:43,339
'cause I just wanted her
to be quiet, you know?

1448
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:44,992
And I got nervous.

1449
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:46,820
I didn't think that
the hitting was
gonna work, you know?

1450
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:49,171
Like it was gonna--
whether or not it was gonna
get rid of the baby.

1451
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,608
So I take out my gun.

1452
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,827
She panics.

1453
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:57,831
I guess she thought
I was gonna shoot her
or some shit, so...

1454
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,225
She started cryin' harder,

1455
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:02,488
but, like, that kind of...

1456
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:06,753
That kind of cry
where it's so hard

1457
01:25:06,797 --> 01:25:11,323
that nothing's comin'
out of her mouth.

1458
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:13,978
And I'm hittin' her in
the stomach with the gun.

1459
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:19,549
I don't know
if that shit worked.
I just fuckin' left.

1460
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,464
It was a mess.

1461
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,426
I don't know.
I don't like hittin' women.

1462
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:29,863
I don't like doin'
that shit.

1463
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:32,257
It ain't god-like.

1464
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:34,955
Scumbags do that shit.

1465
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:38,220
I don't know why he didn't
just ask me to kill her.

1466
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:42,354
Fuckin' guy says to me,
"don't kill her,

1467
01:25:42,398 --> 01:25:45,531
because she gives
the best head
in the tri-state area."

1468
01:25:47,403 --> 01:25:49,318
He's dead serious.

1469
01:25:52,408 --> 01:25:54,323
Motherfucker better start
usin' birth control,

1470
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:56,977
because I ain't never
doin' no shit like that
again ever.

1471
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:59,197
I don't give a fuck.

1472
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:04,637
I mean, I got some kind
of ethics, right?
I'm not a fuckin' animal.

1473
01:26:04,681 --> 01:26:05,943
[Growling]

1474
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:15,431
I heard somethin' today.Yeah?

1475
01:26:15,474 --> 01:26:17,041
Yeah, I heard that Madison
had you do some dirt

1476
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:18,738
so she'd stay off my shit.

1477
01:26:22,525 --> 01:26:25,223
You wanna tell me
what that's all about?

1478
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:28,270
'Cause I find it
kind of interesting.

1479
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:30,141
Oh, yeah? Well, she was
gonna have you ended,

1480
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:34,580
and I was in a position
to make that not happen.
That's it.

1481
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:36,103
Really?yeah.

1482
01:26:36,147 --> 01:26:37,801
She was
gonna have me ended?
Yeah.

1483
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:39,890
I'll break this down
for you, all right?

1484
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:42,458
Number one, if Madison
or anyone else wants
to take a shot at me,

1485
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,416
let 'em try, all right?

1486
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,332
Number two, I don't need
you or anyone else
lookin' out for me.

1487
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:49,073
I can take care of myself.

1488
01:26:49,116 --> 01:26:51,162
And number three,
I heard that you called her

1489
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,772
lookin' for a reprieval.

1490
01:26:52,816 --> 01:26:56,428
She's already dead,
so don't worry about Madison.

1491
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:57,995
She's dead?That's right. Yeah.

1492
01:26:58,038 --> 01:26:59,170
Just like that?

1493
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,346
Exactly my point.
Just like that.

1494
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:02,913
[Snaps fingers]

1495
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:09,659
You see?
See what happens when you
fuck around with me?

1496
01:27:09,702 --> 01:27:11,530
Bad things.

1497
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,886
She say anything about me
before she, uh, left?

1498
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,410
Yeah, she did.

1499
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:24,500
She said I would be dead
before my head hit the pillow

1500
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:26,980
if I hang out with you
much longer.

1501
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:30,157
Yeah, she's smart.

1502
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:34,901
[Sighs]

1503
01:27:40,777 --> 01:27:42,518
You know,
I've been thinking.

1504
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:44,389
Maybe it's time we just
walk away from this shit,

1505
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:47,000
because things are
getting a little stupid.

1506
01:27:47,044 --> 01:27:49,655
Walk away?
This is just like you.

1507
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:51,309
Let me tell you
somethin', Ronnie.

1508
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,877
All right,
when it's my time to go,
I'm gonna go.

1509
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,358
There's nothin' you
or anybody else could do
about that shit.

1510
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:59,317
I'm at peace with that.
You should be at, too.

1511
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:01,232
See, that's the beauty
of criminal life, Ron.

1512
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,582
There's no, uh, questions.
Only orders.

1513
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:05,628
That's bullshit, man.What do you mean
it's bullshit?

1514
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:10,241
We have a choice.We don't got no choice,
all right?

1515
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,895
We really don't.

1516
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:17,161
You'll see what I mean
in a minute.

1517
01:28:17,204 --> 01:28:19,511
You sure you don't want
anything to eat?

1518
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,731
Nothin'? A wonton,
some spare ribs, anything?

1519
01:28:21,774 --> 01:28:23,341
You got any aspirin?

1520
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:26,431
I got a fucked-up headache.
Had it all day.

1521
01:28:26,475 --> 01:28:29,304
No, I can't help you
with that, bro.

1522
01:28:35,092 --> 01:28:37,573
You see the news today?

1523
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:42,491
Married senatorial candidate
Simon baltz shot dead

1524
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:45,537
while getting head.

1525
01:28:45,581 --> 01:28:49,280
That senator
turned out to be backin'
a friend of ours.

1526
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,456
Nicky caputo is pissed off.

1527
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,197
Ever hear of him,
Ronnie?

1528
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,982
He's really pissed off.

1529
01:28:56,026 --> 01:28:59,072
People gotta go down
for this one.

1530
01:28:59,116 --> 01:29:01,466
Where were you
this afternoon?

1531
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:09,387
I caught a movie.Oh, yeah?
What'd you see?

[Mimics buzzer]

1534
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:22,008
See, I wish
you were tellin' me
the truth, Ronnie.

1535
01:29:23,923 --> 01:29:25,969
But I know you ain't.

1536
01:29:31,148 --> 01:29:33,150
Are you?

1537
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:44,683
You know what's
goin' on here, right?

1538
01:29:48,252 --> 01:29:50,559
Yeah, I know
what's goin' on.

1539
01:29:58,088 --> 01:30:00,133
You don't have
to do this, you know that.

1540
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:02,309
Yes, I do.
It's my job.

1541
01:30:02,353 --> 01:30:05,617
It's your
fuckin' job, too.

1542
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:08,272
What, all of a sudden
you're innocent, huh?

1543
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:12,668
You never killed
nobody, huh?

1544
01:30:12,711 --> 01:30:14,278
This is great, huh?

1545
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:16,672
I get paid
to kill somebody,

1546
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:19,414
somebody pays you
to kill me.

1547
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,332
What are we doin', man?

1548
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,987
I don't want to do this.

1549
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:32,818
I know.

1550
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:36,605
You know, there's
a way out for--
for both of US.

1551
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:38,607
Yeah? Tell me.

As always.

1554
01:30:48,747 --> 01:30:50,662
We could shoot each other.Oh, yeah?

1555
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:54,666
I could shoot you.
We could shoot each other.

1556
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:57,713
I could kill you,
and you kill me.

1557
01:30:57,756 --> 01:30:59,715
But I'm gonna kill you,
Ronnie. I have to do it.

1558
01:30:59,758 --> 01:31:02,282
There's no way around that.

1559
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:04,763
But if we kill each other,
we could still be friends.

1560
01:31:04,807 --> 01:31:08,637
We'll be dead.Whatever.

1561
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:12,075

what her fuckin'
fortune cookie says.

I knew you'd do
the right thing.

Okay. Me, too.

1576

I don't want to be lying
on the floor while 911 tries
to save my sorry ass.

01:32:13,745 --> 01:32:16,269
Okay.all right?

What did you do?

1587
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,714
You lied to me.

1588

You fuckin'--
you lied to me.

1589
01:33:12,978 --> 01:33:15,372
You said
you would do it.

1590

You can't leave me
by myself.

[August] We could have
gone out together.

1602
01:34:36,932 --> 01:34:38,760
It doesn't matter

1603
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:41,937
