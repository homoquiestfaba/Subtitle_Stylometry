01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:43,480
I have 11 people
 willing to go.

898
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:44,581
If you can make more.

899
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:46,951
How many can go?
 No.

900
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,053
Mary, not you.

901
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,257
I'm as strong
 as anybody here.

902
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,193
Papa? You'll still
 have help, Mama,

903
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,595
and you won't
have to feed me.

904
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,431
And I'll be
 with Papa and...
 And Mr. Stanton.

905
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:03,900
Six days walking,
 I estimate.

906
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:05,402
Six days.

907
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,572
They'll be in California

908
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:10,374
and they'll all come back
 with your Papa.

909
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:36,633
(GRUNTING)

910
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:55,019
What is that?

911
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,154
Oh. Shh.

912
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,456
It's a surprise.

913
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:00,224
Don't you tell
 the other children.

914
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,026
I won't, what is it?

915
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:03,693
It's some food.

916
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,330
I put it here a month ago.

917
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:07,697
It's for tonight.

918
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:09,466
(GASPS) Really?

919
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:11,335
Shh, yes.

920
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,438
We have rice
 and white beans.

921
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,507
VIRGINIA:
 And dried apples.

922
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,342
And bacon, mama!

923
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,411
It's Christmas.

924
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:22,346
You children can
eat all you like.

925
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,482
(LAUGHS)

926
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,286
Friends,

927
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,322
as you know,
 I've invited you here
 on this Christmas Day

928
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,423
to meet a man who has
 come to speak to us.

929
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,326
And he's come far.

930
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,428
He's fought in
 battle beside us,

931
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,330
and we should listen
 to what he has to say.

932
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:41,698
Mr. James Reed.
James.

933
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,674
Some of you
 know already that I've

934
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,509
come from an emigrant party
 still trapped in the Sierra.

935
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,547
I have a wife, 
 and four children 
 with them.

936
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,385
There are many 
 children with them.

937
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,089
I tried to go back 
 and the blizzard 
 stopped me.

938
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:08,492
And then the war 
 with Mexico stopped me.

939
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:13,363
Now the war is 
 all in the south and

940
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,498
we can try again 
 to reach them.

941
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:18,668
I am their voice.

942
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:25,709
And when you hear me
 ask you for help,
 hear them.

943
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:31,515
When you hear me
 ask for money for

944
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,284
mules, and food,
 and clothing,

945
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,486
don't look at me.

946
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,390
Try and see them 
 if you can.

947
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,093
All we wanted...

948
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:48,064
All they want 
 is to come here

949
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,234
and be a part of you.

950
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,469
Part of this.

951
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:57,207
They're Californians, too,

952
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:59,809
in their dreaming
 and in their coming
 this far.

953
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,180
They're just like you.

954
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:05,215
So, please,

955
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:08,752
help them.

956
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:13,790
Dear, Papa.

957
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:27,571
Let us all think of Papa

958
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,207
and wish him our love.

959
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:33,177
Bring him to us.

960
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,227
You still waiting for him?

961
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:25,562
(CHUCKLES)

962
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,497
Oh, he's fine.

963
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:30,300
He's fine.

964
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,237
He's fine and happy
 in California.

965
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,575
Don't expect for him
 to come back into the cold.

966
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,447
Once they get warm,
 they don't come back.

967
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,584
Mmm-hmm.

968
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,453
Once they get the food,

969
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:51,321
they forget us.
 They forget us!

970
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:52,922
Shut up!
Just shut your mouth.

971
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,692
No.
 Leave us alone!

972
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:56,460
Mama, stop it.

973
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,396
Let me go.

974
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,430
Calm down. Mama!
 Leave me alone.

975
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,432
(GRUNTS)

976
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:06,636
(LAUGHS)

977
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:10,340
We're leaving.
 We're leaving.

978
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,475
James, get up. Patty!

979
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:12,942
Virginia, get Tommy.

980
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:14,644
Milt, help us.

981
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,682
Bring your blankets.
 Take everything we have.

982
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,250
We are leaving.
 We are going
 over the mountain.

983
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:21,985
MILT: Mrs. Reed...

984
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:23,520
I'm not waiting
 any longer.

985
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,388
No longer!

986
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,392
Look at my children,
 look at them!

987
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:31,661
I cannot live like this here.
 I will not.

988
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,731
The snow is too deep.
The children can't even
walk up there.

989
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:35,999
MARGARET:
 Then they'll go
 to the Breens.

990
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:36,800
The Breens will take them
 while we're gone.

991
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,270
Children,
 you'll stay at the Breens'.

992
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:42,472
(CLATTERING)

993
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:43,873
Let's go.

994
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,410
Out. Out.

995
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:48,712
Out. Out.

996
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:51,381
You're going where?

997
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,583
Away from here. Out!

998
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:56,185
ELIZABETH:
 On the mountain?

999
01:10:58,488 --> 01:10:59,456
Going on the mountain?

1000
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,358
You're crazy.

1001
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,860
You should know, Elizabeth!

1002
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,408
Patrick, will you
 take them?

1003
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:19,843
Will you take my children?
 I'm going over.

1004
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:23,380
Going over?
 Yes.

1005
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,782
Milt and I will start today,
 if you'll only keep them.

1006
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:27,584
I... I'll bring back help.

1007
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,019
I'll bring back food
 for all of us.

1008
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:31,321
Charles says
 it's only six days.

1009
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:35,925
If it's just six days walking,
 why aren't they back yet?

1010
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,694
Why have they
 not sent help?
 Don't you see?

1011
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:40,464
Peggy, will you tell her?

1012
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:44,434
You can't just
walk over it, Margaret.

1013
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,470
It's death up there now.
 No.

1014
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:49,339
Here...
 Here it's death.

1015
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:51,641
I can't take my children
 back in there.

1016
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,611
Please,
 we have a hide to boil.

1017
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,681
It should keep them
 for a while.
 They won't be a burden to you.

1018
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:00,049
Please, won't you
 take them?

1019
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:03,086
It's too dangerous,
 Margaret, you'll freeze.

1020
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,087
Milt will make us
 fires at night.

1021
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,491
Your children
need you with them.

1022
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:09,926
Your children, Margaret.

1023
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,035
I can't take them
 back at that place.

1024
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:20,904
(EXHALES)

1025
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:23,907
We'll see.

1026
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:26,810
Patrick,

1027
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:30,414
Elizabeth Graves is mad.
 Everyone knows.

1028
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,517
We can't send them
 back there, Pat.

1029
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,120
We have room now
 that the snow shoe party
 has left.

1030
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,826
But we can't feed them.

1031
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,661
They have a hide.

1032
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,963
A hide won't
 keep them alive.

1033
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:47,831
Now, will you
 listen to me?

1034
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,366
I'm trying
to keep us alive.

1035
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,671
I'd feed every one of them
 if I could, but I can't,
 and that's that!

1036
01:12:58,442 --> 01:12:59,809
It's her husband's folly
 that led us here.

1037
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:03,680
And you hold that against
 her and the children?

1038
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,848
That's that, I said.
Did you hear me?

1039
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:06,983
Yes, I did.

1040
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,028
Come children,
you'll stay with us.

1041
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:25,902
You're welcome to shelter.

1042
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:30,707
Thank you, Peggy.

1043
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:37,981
You go.

1044
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:40,517
I'll stay with the Murphys.

1045
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,161
PATRICK:
 Dear merciful God,

1046
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:53,162
bless us and keep us.

1047
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,733
Give us the strength
 until food can reach us.

1048
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:01,671
Give us the strength
 to see the spring come.

1049
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:05,909
And bless the sick,
 Almighty God.

1050
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:09,646
Our Edward

1051
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:12,749
needs your special
 kindness tonight.

1052
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,955
And bless those

1053
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,457
that are departed from us.

1054
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:24,961
And bless...
 MILT: Hello.

1055
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:26,796
In the Breens Cabin.

1056
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:45,749
It's Milt Elliot.

1057
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,224
Milt, come in
 by the fire.

1058
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,226
No.

1059
01:14:58,895 --> 01:14:59,796
I can't stand up.

1060
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,701
I know I'm dying.

1061
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:07,503
No.
 It's okay.

1062
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,542
I'll just go to sleep.

1063
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:14,911
But...

1064
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:18,047
I didn't want
 to be over there

1065
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,685
with them.

1066
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:23,119
No, please.
 Please don't go, Milt.

1067
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:27,891
Mrs. Reed.

1068
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:32,161
Margaret.

1069
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:35,131
You know, sometimes...

1070
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,703
Sometimes I dreamed
we were married.

1071
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,740
Please stay with us.

1072
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:46,610
And that the children
 were our children.
