[footsteps]

3
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,152
Mmm.

4
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:56,558
[moaning]

5
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,550
[panting]

6
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,816
[moans]

7
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,553
[screams]

8
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,925
Read all about it!

9
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,229
Killer strikes again!

10
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:09,664
Read all about it!

11
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,101
Killer strikes...

12
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,039
We've got another one.

13
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,109
Amelia, good.
You're here.

14
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,780
The body was found
early this morning.

15
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,282
If I had to guess,

16
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:30,520
she was probably killed
only a few hours before that.

17
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:33,322
As of the moment, no witnesses.

18
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,823
Of course.

19
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,132
Red hair.

20
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,335
The guy definitely has a type.

21
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:54,110
The wound matches exactly
what we've seen before.

22
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,578
I see we've got some
blood splatter here,

23
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,848
the angle of which suggests

24
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,883
he was on top of
her when it happened.

25
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:04,652
She saw it coming.

26
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,358
Not sure if that makes
it better or worse.

27
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,031
It's fairly small amount of
blood for how much she's lost.

28
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,365
We won't know that for sure

29
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,367
until Seward gets a look
at her back at his lab.

30
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,339
I think it's time that
we face the facts

31
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:26,309
that we might
be dealing with a...

32
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,579
Spit it out, Van Helsing.
Trepidation doesn't suit you.

33
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,280
Mass murderer.

34
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,648
This is one of those occasions
where I hate to say it.

35
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,817
I agree.

36
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,254
And we're not alone.

37
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,623
Are they still on about this?

38
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,092
Unfortunately, yes.

39
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,128
They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

40
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,198
It's lazy sensationalism.

41
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,634
Like you said, sells papers.

42
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,303
You gotta admit.

43
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,706
A century-old mass murder case
that ended at a creepy castle,

44
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,708
the kind of stuff
that whets the appetite.

45
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,946
Yeah, if you believe in myth and
ghost stories and not in facts.

46
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,849
Besides, see,
they didn't mention

47
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:08,284
that we did our due diligence,

48
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:10,586
did a sweep of the castle
and found nothing.

49
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,589
Why let facts get in the way?

50
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,993
I can't have the press
interfering with my case.

51
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,461
What are we gonna do?

52
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:21,130
We aren't.
I will.

53
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,598
What you need to do
is get to work

54
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,334
and solve this before it
gets even more out of hand.

55
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,444
What could even do this?

56
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,986
Well?

57
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:47,857
Well, every time
I find something

58
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,392
that I think is conclusive,

59
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,760
I find something
that contradicts it

60
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,329
and makes me doubt myself.

61
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,665
Renfield seems to think that
the relatively recent nature

62
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:58,901
of this one's passing might
help us answer questions.

63
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,570
Oh, Renfield, the good captain,

64
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:03,406
doesn't seem to understand that
to be able to accomplish that,

65
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,374
you have to have
somewhere to start.

66
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,411
And this... this just
doesn't make any sense!

67
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:12,481
What do you mean?

68
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,319
Well...

69
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:19,188
all the bodies died from
a massive amount of blood loss,

70
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,823
right, brought about
from a neck trauma?

71
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:24,493
And though these slashes
are serious,

72
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,163
they're just not congruent
with your

73
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:29,831
regular jugular slash
or throat cut.

74
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,435
You know what I mean.

75
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,904
There's gotta be
something we're missing.

76
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,239
Impossible problems...

77
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:39,575
Have probable solutions.
Yes, I know, I know.

78
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,777
Maybe we just have to look
at the facts we have.

79
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,416
We know that the lacerations
and trauma caused by the wounds

80
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,586
severed the jugular,
leading to death.

81
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,855
And it was done with
relative efficiency.

82
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,490
Yes, yes, yes, but the
tearing of the epidermis

83
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:57,226
around the punctures
is not done by any bladed weapon

84
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,694
that I know of.

85
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,095
It's almost like it's...

86
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,232
like a bite.

87
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,800
Could it be a bite?

88
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,637
They just don't match,
the spacing

89
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,907
and our canines are just not up
to that level of efficiency.

90
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,510
And then there's
the blood, right?

91
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:17,947
This body is a dried husk.

92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,083
If all the blood is gone,
where does it go?

93
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,486
Well, that's' the question,
isn't it? That's the kicker.

94
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,787
Of the blood that's left,
do we have a sample?

95
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,392
Uh, yes, yes.

96
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,995
I ran some tests to see
if the killer used any kind of

97
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,697
a sedative or
an outside chemical

98
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,831
to sort of subdue the victims.

99
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:39,902
But... I ran it a
couple of times,

100
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,504
I couldn't find anything.

101
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,538
Can I have that?

102
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,275
I don't usually let
evidence out of the lab.

103
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,579
Where are you going?

104
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:52,982
I want to see if Harker
can turn anything up.

105
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,350
Oh, I knew it.

106
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,686
He's a brilliant
chemist, Jack.

107
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:59,388
And we look at details
as they pertain to the case.

108
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,991
He looks at them
in a scientific puzzle.

109
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,426
Yes, yes.

110
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,261
And he's able to turn
things up we often miss.

111
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:08,130
Yes, yes, he's been very
helpful in the past, I agree.

112
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,500
You bring my blood back.

113
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,535
I'll see what I can do.

114
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,470
Let you know if
we turn anything up.

115
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:16,372
And you owe me a dinner
for all this!

116
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,007
I'll tell Mina
you're coming over.

117
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,308
Maybe she'll make
you that roast again.

118
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,476
Ooh, roast.

119
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,457
[footsteps]

120
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,232
I didn't expect you so soon.

121
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,434
Do you have what I require?

122
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,470
Yes...

123
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,411
Master.

124
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,885
So you're telling me
there was no blood

125
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,552
anywhere else in the room?

126
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,421
Seems impossible, right?

127
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,289
That vial is what
Seward managed

128
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,457
to extract from the body,

129
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:44,827
And this was it?

130
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,228
More or less.

131
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,132
How curious.

132
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,433
Sort of why I'm here.

133
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,536
You know I always appreciate

134
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,304
when you bring me
a puzzle to solve.

135
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,640
Unfortunately, it's not
like when we were kids.

136
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,442
I suppose.

137
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,477
Bigger challenges,
bigger stakes.

138
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,045
That's one way to put it.

139
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,447
You think you can analyze it?

140
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,784
I believe I can.

141
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,020
In fact, I have several
texts around here somewhere

142
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,923
which might actually
provide some clues...

143
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:15,825
I came to you as
a chemist, Jonathan,

144
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,393
not because of your hobbies.

145
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,129
The study of occultism
is no mere hobby.

146
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,831
It provides insight into
things we have yet

147
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,299
to even begin to comprehend.

148
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,168
I appreciate the interest,
but the study of magic

149
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:28,872
and ghosts is
no comparison to facts.

150
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:33,175
And, quite frankly,
that's what I need right now.

151
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,744
There are those that
believe that magic

152
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:38,981
is merely science
we don't understand yet.

153
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,217
There is a very
real mass murderer

154
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,619
stalking the streets
right now.

155
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,421
I came to you
because you're able

156
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:49,692
to put scientific bits
of the puzzle together.

157
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,327
I admit that
there are some cases

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,595
we couldn't have
cracked without you.

159
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,901
That's the Jonathan
I need right now.

160
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,936
If there's something in that
blood that shouldn't be there,

161
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,303
I'll find it.

162
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,205
I just need some time.

163
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,107
Thank you.

164
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:08,010
Don't take too long, though.

165
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,779
Seward was already on edge that
I had to borrow his evidence.

166
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,214
Oh, Jack.

167
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,482
What did you have to
bribe him with this time?

168
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:14,650
Dinner?

169
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,318
How'd you know?

170
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,020
His pride won't allow
him to admit this,

171
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,424
but he lets me bring you things
'cause he knows you get results.

172
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,626
Prove us both right, yeah?

173
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,696
Tell you what.

174
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,966
If I don't bring you
back something,

175
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,767
I'll make dinner
for all of you.

176
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,036
Things are bad enough
out there as it is.

177
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,637
Let's not make it worse.

178
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,254
Hey!

179
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,156
Amelia? I didn't expect
you home so soon.

180
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,325
Didn't mean to scare you.
It's just been a long day.

181
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,994
I figured I'd grab
a bite to eat.

182
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,461
How are you doing, beautiful?

183
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,763
What's the occasion?

184
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,264
I didn't miss
anything important, did I?

185
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:03,532
No, you're off the hook.

186
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:05,601
These actually aren't for us.

187
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:06,802
We have company.

188
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,270
We do?

189
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:09,772
You know how I've been
hoping that the firm

190
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,640
would eventually let me
handle an account on my own?

191
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,476
But it just felt like they
were making me wait forever?

192
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,379
Mina, tell me what
I think you're gonna say.

193
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:19,015
Well, a new account
just came in...

194
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,051
and this foreign dignitary
who's looking for some

195
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,251
real estate here
in the city...

196
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,353
and they assigned me
to help him.

197
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,487
That's amazing!

198
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,690
Thank you.
It's a big deal.

199
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,558
If I can pull this off,
then I might just be able

200
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:32,494
to prove that I can make it as
a successful solicitor yet.

201
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,097
They're not gonna
know what's hit them.

202
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,098
And the wine?

203
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,833
Oh, that's the thing.

204
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,736
The dignitary, the man
that I'm helping find a place,

205
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,605
he's here.

206
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,839
He is?

207
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,445
- It's late.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,714
And I just thought that maybe as
a get to know you gesture

209
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,950
- that I should...
- Absolutely.

210
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,851
You've celebrating to do!
Go, go, go!

211
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,574
[sighs]

212
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,230
Miss Mina!
I didn't realize we had company.

213
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:42,765
Yes.

214
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:45,734
This is my girlfriend,
Amelia Van Helsing.

215
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,670
She arrived here while
I was getting our drinks.

216
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,439
Amelia, this is Count Dracula.

217
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,280
[laughing]

218
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:34,050
You know,
I don't drink wine often.

219
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,684
But this has been lovely.

220
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,654
So glad you were able to
join us, Miss Van Helsing.

221
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,991
Mina didn't tell me she
had such a charming partner.

222
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:44,194
Amelia, please.

223
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:46,795
And of the two of use,
Mina is the charming one.

224
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:48,965
Far too many people
grumble at my presence

225
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,499
to think otherwise.

226
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,902
It's just nice to
have her home for a bit...

227
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,303
what with everything.

228
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,905
Ah, yes.

229
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,873
I've read some of the
garish details in the papers.

230
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,778
Don't take everything you read
in the local rag at face value.

231
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,481
I rarely do.

232
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:08,450
Thought I must confess,
when I read the name

233
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,786
of the investigator
in charge of the matter,

234
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,889
I never expected
to be dining with her

235
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:15,225
later that evening.

236
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:17,093
Strange coincidence, isn't it?

237
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,995
The world is full of them.

238
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:22,664
It's comforting
to know the police

239
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,699
are working so diligently
on the matter.

240
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,807
So, are you looking
to relocate permanently

241
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,943
or just acquiring properties?

242
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,345
It all depends on what
the lovely Miss Mina shows me.

243
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,218
A little bit of both, I suspect.

244
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,753
A number of years ago,
I spent a little time here.

245
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,924
There was just something
about it that felt like home.

246
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,560
I think that's lovely.

247
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:55,297
Just a feeling
of certainty one gets.

248
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,534
I've been traveling
abroad for a great while.

249
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:02,771
Somehow I always knew
what I wanted was here.

250
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,309
Well, then must
find him a good place.

251
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,012
Dinner party
etiquette demands it.

252
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,915
I have utmost faith
in Miss Mina's acumen.

253
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,983
When I visited
the solicitor's office,

254
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,820
I saw her and knew
she'd be the one to help me.

255
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:22,825
I didn't realize that
my assignment was by request.

256
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:27,129
I made the suggestion and the
partners at your firm obliged.

257
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:34,703
I wanted someone who sees
the city a little differently.

258
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:45,380
I had an instinct
and I followed it.

259
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,917
And my instincts
are rarely wrong.

260
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:52,222
I... don't know what to say.

261
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,324
I'm truly honored.

262
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:55,390
I won't let you down.

263
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't know about you,

264
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,427
but this seems like the perfect
excuse for another toast.

265
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:02,698
[knocking]

266
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,733
Who could that be at this hour?

267
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,939
[knocking continues]

268
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,674
Jonathan, what's...

269
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,910
It's too terrible
to consider, Amelia!

270
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,111
But when
the evidence suggests...

271
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,545
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

272
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,579
The improbable is probable,
we must, we must!

273
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:18,680
Could you keep it down, please!

274
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:19,949
Mina's having a work dinner.

275
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:21,817
I don't need to
cause unnecessary alarm.

276
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,886
Sorry.

277
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,255
I just... I think
I found something.

278
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,421
With the blood?

279
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,891
Potentially.

280
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:30,525
And if I'm right,
it's something awful.

281
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,793
Let's talk outside.

282
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,034
What's going on?

283
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,502
There were trace amounts
of saliva in the blood.

284
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,437
But the more
significant thing is

285
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,705
what that can
potentially represent.

286
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:45,074
I don't understand.

287
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,976
The punctures,
the absence of blood,

288
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,778
the calculated kill crossed
with the primal violence.

289
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:52,748
It all felt too familiar
to be coincidence.

290
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,386
So I started cross-referencing
some of my texts.

291
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,521
And all signs
point to Nosferatu.

292
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,792
I think we may
be dealing with a vampire.

293
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:04,928
A what?

294
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:06,129
The vampire is a
perceived mythological creature

295
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,163
of undead origin...

296
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,999
I know what
a vampire is, Jonathan.

297
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,734
But if you recall,
I explicitly asked you

298
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,204
to stick to science on
this one, no fairy stories.

299
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,639
I know, but it could
explain so many of

300
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,640
the unknown variables
of the case:

301
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,143
[phone rings]

302
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,912
The irregular wound,
the loss and absence of blood.

303
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,613
You and your colleagues
missed certain details

304
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,849
because they were things you
didn't even know to look for.

305
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,450
Are you hearing yourself?

306
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,852
There's a very
real serial killer

307
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,354
stalking the streets
and murdering women.

308
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:34,523
I need something that is
going to help me find him now!

309
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,725
I appreciate your reticence,

310
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:39,262
but I said it before
and I'll say it again.

311
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:42,098
Sometimes the things
we consider fantastical

312
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:44,067
are merely truths
we're not yet

313
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,935
allowing ourselves
to understand.

314
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,004
I'm sorry, Jonathan,
but I just...

315
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,109
You just got a call.

316
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,845
They need you.
There's been another...

317
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:57,579
There's been another murder.

318
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,151
Mina, please see Count Dracula
out and lock the door.

319
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:06,255
I'm coming with you.

320
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,890
Like hell you are.

321
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,769
Ah, Amelia.
It's good you're here.

322
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:25,208
Oh, surprise.
Look who you brought.

323
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,443
- Jack.
- Jonathan.

324
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:30,013
I thought you'd be out
chasing ghosts or something.

325
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:33,615
Nope. I've been too busy
doing your job for you.

326
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,785
Boys... play nice.

327
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,788
I'm surprised to see
you out of the lab.

328
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:43,359
Renfield had more
important things to do.

329
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,661
And he suggested that
if I showed up at the scene

330
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:49,065
I might be able
to glean something

331
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:53,002
out of the body's natural
habitat, so to speak, you know.

332
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,172
And?

333
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:59,442
Well, fits our pattern.

334
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:02,778
Red hair,
trauma to neck.

335
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:05,081
Cause of death,
massive blood loss.

336
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,648
But the difference here
is that this body's

337
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:09,285
been here for two,
maybe three, days.

338
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,262
When the guys got here,
they had to open the windows

339
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:22,164
because the neighbors were
complaining about the smell.

340
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,701
Was anyone seen
coming or going?

341
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,970
They're out
canvassing the neighborhood,

342
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,906
but I don't think so.

343
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,408
How does someone come in,

344
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,243
do something like this,
and no one notices?

345
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,546
Well, that's
the kicker, isn't it?

346
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:38,914
It's not just getting in.
How did he get out?

347
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,984
What do you mean?

348
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:44,753
When we got here,
they had to use a prybar

349
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,557
to open the door, all right?

350
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,792
Because everything:
windows, doors, everything,

351
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,395
was locked from the inside.

352
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,197
What about a key?

353
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,899
She lived alone,

354
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,733
has all the keys
in her possession

355
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,303
and they're accounted for.

356
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:03,339
And the landlord says that
no one else has any others.

357
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,809
So you're telling me

358
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:10,446
the perpetrator
entered a locked room

359
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,048
without forced entry,

360
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:16,018
viciously murdered a woman
and disappeared without a trace?

361
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,921
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

362
00:21:18,954 --> 00:21:21,823
I just... for someone
to be able to do that,

363
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,359
they'd have to be...

364
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,960
Capable of the impossible.

365
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:28,763
Impossible is an illusion

366
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,300
that's created when
you have the advantage.

367
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,636
And right now,
our killer has it.

368
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,172
But he's only one person

369
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:39,275
and what he's
not banking on is us.

370
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,389
Good.

371
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,157
You're awake.

372
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,267
Do you understand
the implication here?

373
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,670
It essentially proves
there's merit to my theory.

374
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:42,572
What's he talking about?

375
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:44,073
Don't start on this again.

376
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:46,943
You said you wanted facts.

377
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,111
Maybe it's time to start looking
at the ones you already have.

378
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,580
The assailant is biting throats

379
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:53,149
and somehow getting into
impossible rooms with ease.

380
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,451
What does that
sound like to you?

381
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:58,154
I have no idea.

382
00:22:58,187 --> 00:22:59,821
There's a strong
chance the perpetrator

383
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,823
is in fact a vampire.

384
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,159
Oh, how clever!

385
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:04,560
Forget the
mythological connotations!

386
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,063
Exsanguination
is found in several instances

387
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:08,264
in the animal kingdom.

388
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:09,865
It's therefore,
entirely probable

389
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:11,300
that there's
a human equivalent!

390
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,169
I get you're trying
to be helpful, Jonathan.

391
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:16,738
But what you're suggesting
is not supported by reality.

392
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,609
I would buy that the killer
thinks they're a vampire.

393
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,044
But as for the real deal,
there's no such thing.

394
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:24,880
Stories of vampires exist
in almost every culture.

395
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:28,618
The jiangshi of China,
the sasabonsam of Ghana,

396
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:30,253
the shtriga of Albania...

397
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,688
all variants on
the same concept.

398
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,991
If it was only folklore,
then how did all of those

399
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:37,426
very different and
very distant places

400
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,195
all arrive at
the same conclusion?

401
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:42,064
Sociologically,
that's a wonderful argument.

402
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,200
But real science
does not support it!

403
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:49,138
Besides, vampires are supposed
to be dead, aren't they?

404
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:49,939
Undead.

405
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,574
Oh, well, there I have you.

406
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,643
Bio-matter starts to decompose
almost immediately at death.

407
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,978
So reanimation?
That's almost impossible.

408
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,947
It's like a roll
of the dice, isn't it?

409
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,348
Maybe that's why they
need to drink blood.

410
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,350
Drink blood?
Bathe in blood!

411
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:05,421
Those kind of unsciences, they
died in the Neolithic period!

412
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:09,959
The point is, there's a very
logical explanation, Jonathan.

413
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:12,528
The collection of blood
was cited in a number of

414
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:16,265
very human, very real,
serial killer cases.

415
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:18,601
And in each circumstance,
it was just a matter

416
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:22,705
of figuring out which method
and tool was used to do so.

417
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:23,706
I just think that...

418
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:25,308
People are dying!

419
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:27,476
The public are
demanding answers!

420
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:32,348
I can't tell them
a vampire did it.

421
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:37,253
And it would be great
if I could have you

422
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:40,122
and your resources available

423
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:41,490
to help me find
out who did.

424
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,894
Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.

425
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:48,297
Thank you.

426
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:51,400
So what now?

427
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:54,470
Well, you said you found some
saliva in the blood sample.

428
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:56,939
You found something?

429
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:59,208
We're talking miniscule traces.

430
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,710
I missed it on
my first two passes,

431
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,678
so I can understand why
you guys didn't catch it.

432
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,013
Still, it could be something.

433
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,281
And if it's our killer's saliva,

434
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:07,516
it means that
he could be interacting

435
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,654
with his victims in an up close,
possibly fetishistic way.

436
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:13,055
Anything we can
glean from that?

437
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:16,292
I don't know.
What do you think?

438
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,861
Could you two compare notes and
tell me if you find anything?

439
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,330
- Yeah, we could do that.
- Of course.

440
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:22,431
Yeah.

441
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,033
I'll do a little more
research tonight

442
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,701
and drop off whatever
I have in the morning.

443
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:30,306
Yes, which reminds me, I've got
a couple more bodies to look at.

444
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:32,375
I'll probably be there
well into the morning.

445
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:34,510
All right, I'll be on my way.

446
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:36,379
Good luck.

447
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:38,849
No. Let's find a more nurturing
way of saying goodnight

448
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:41,484
like "I'll see you later."

449
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:42,918
Bye.

450
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:47,390
What about you?

451
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,225
It's late.
I should go check in on Mina

452
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,927
as I made an unceremonious exit
from dinner with her guest.

453
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,429
In the chaos of everything,

454
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:55,164
I didn't even get a
chance to ask about that.

455
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:56,766
Sounds like things are
going well for her with work?

456
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,200
Yeah.

457
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,669
She landed a big client,
a foreign aristocrat type.

458
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:02,838
He's looking for
property in the city.

459
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,273
It's a real boost for her.

460
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,941
You know how reserved
she can be.

461
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,410
- That's great.
- Yeah.

462
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:08,978
So long as I didn't
scare him away

463
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:11,580
when I ran out of the house
in pursuit of a murderer.

464
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,982
Well, I'd like to think
that's fuel

465
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,283
for a lively
dinner conversation.

466
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,085
No. He's a little posh.

467
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,220
Not the type
to want gritty details.

468
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:20,923
Well, I guess they can't
all be ghouls like us.

469
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,859
Guess not.

470
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,995
Jonathan,
we gotta find this guy.

471
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:28,531
Every day that passes while
we're grasping at straws

472
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:33,569
is another opportunity
for him to kill again.

473
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,805
I've always known you to be
a dedicated investigator.

474
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:39,341
But... and don't take
this the wrong way...

475
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,143
I can't help but feel
you're a little bit more

476
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:43,012
on edge about
this one than usual.

477
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:45,581
Our killer is singling out
women with specific attributes

478
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,750
and greeting them
with violence.

479
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:50,152
I can understand why that
would strike a nerve.

480
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:51,787
But as one of your
oldest friends,

481
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,590
I wanna make sure you don't
internalize this too much.

482
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:56,992
It wouldn't be good for you...
or the case.

483
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:00,396
It's a little too late
not to internalize it, Jonathan.

484
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,164
Someone is out there
othering women

485
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,999
and killing them
for their otherness.

486
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:05,501
For reasons of my existence,

487
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,804
I find that a little hard
not to take personally.

488
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,005
Of course.

489
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:13,375
Look at that saliva.

490
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:15,744
Get back to Jack with
anything you find.

491
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:17,881
I'm gonna go home
and check in on Mina

492
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:20,015
and go over all my documents.

493
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,817
All right.

494
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,218
You get some sleep, okay?

495
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,556
No more dead women
on my watch.

496
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:28,691
Got it?

497
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:29,758
Got it.

498
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,183
Mina?

499
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:14,436
Hey!

500
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:06,822
Amelia?

501
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,090
Baby.

502
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,026
Are you okay?

503
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,327
Yeah, I'm okay.

504
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,896
What happened?

505
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:14,496
There was someone in the house.

506
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:15,631
What?

507
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,266
- Are they... are you?
- I'm fine.

508
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,301
They got away, though.

509
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:20,703
My God, Amelia...

510
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:24,439
Shh. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here.

511
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,343
I don't understand.

512
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,812
Who did this?

513
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,179
It's him.

514
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,850
Him?

515
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:36,518
The Count said the papers
mentioned me by name.

516
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:39,889
What are you talking about?

517
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:41,858
The killer from my case.

518
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,392
He knows who I am.

519
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:45,427
And tonight he wanted
to send me a message.

520
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:49,297
He knows where we live.

521
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,839
Well, how did they get in?

522
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:58,641
Did they have a key?

523
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,877
And you're sure
you found no significant

524
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,778
evidence of forced entry?

525
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:03,779
No.

526
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,180
You know I know what
to look for.

527
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,816
And you know I have to ask.

528
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,251
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:12,088
It's just...
he came into my home.

530
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:14,223
What if I hadn't been here?

531
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,026
And Mina...

532
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,292
She's fine.

533
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:20,462
Not fine, but she'll be okay.

534
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,197
Just a bit startled.

535
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,800
It's gonna be a rough night
sleep for both of us.

536
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,535
Understandable.

537
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,771
Did you at least get
a good look at him?

538
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,106
No.

539
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,573
Credit where credit's due,

540
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:35,011
he knew to move fast
and stick to the shadows.

541
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,512
If I didn't know any better,

542
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,081
I would have thought
he was familiar with the house.

543
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:39,214
Is that possible?

544
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:40,850
Not likely.

545
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,053
Besides Jonathan Harker and a
few women from the social club,

546
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,354
we don't really have guests.

547
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,355
Though there was Dracula.

548
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,926
Dracula?

549
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,294
A foreign Count that Mina
is helping

550
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,097
acquire property in the city.

551
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,597
He was here earlier for dinner.

552
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,068
You don't think...

553
00:30:58,101 --> 00:30:59,501
No.

554
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:01,770
Most aristocrats are not
known for their subtlety.

555
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:05,207
So I doubt a stealthy
breaking and entering

556
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,143
is in his repertoire.

557
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:09,012
I suppose you're right,

558
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:11,313
and he was vetted by
the partners in Mina's firm.

559
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,582
And kind of glad he's here.

560
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:17,386
It provides her
distraction from all this.

561
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,389
You don't have
to say it, Amelia.

562
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,757
I'm behind you.

563
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,029
You do whatever it takes.

564
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:27,663
Thank you, Captain.

565
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:28,932
Of course.

566
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:30,934
Well, I'm gonna
get these guys out of here

567
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,634
so you can get some sleep.

568
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:20,150
Are they gone?

569
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,583
Yeah.

570
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:23,518
The last officer just left.

571
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,355
And?

572
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:29,457
And I wish
I had answers for you,

573
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:33,528
but I don't... not yet.

574
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:38,100
This isn't supposed to happen.

575
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,871
This shouldn't
be coming to our door.

576
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:44,306
I'm supposed
to take care of you.

577
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,776
Honey, you do take care of me.

578
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,046
But tonight...

579
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,050
Tonight, when danger came
looking, you chased it away.

580
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,153
You went straight into battle
without a second thought.

581
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:00,789
And that's the woman I know
and that's the woman I love.

582
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:03,159
Mina...

583
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,527
You take care of me, Amelia.

584
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,130
You do so much.

585
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:10,132
You take care of so many people.

586
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:16,638
Sometimes you need to
let me take care of you.

587
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,747
Baby...

588
00:33:26,848 --> 00:33:29,018
Shut up and let
me take care of you.

589
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:57,206
[knocking]

590
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,573
Jonathan!

591
00:34:58,606 --> 00:34:59,641
Are you here to see Amelia?

592
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:00,842
I haven't seen Amelia for a day.

593
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,078
But I heard what
happened last night.

594
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:03,545
And I just wanted to stop
by and check...

595
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,882
Oh, sorry. I didn't
realize you had company.

596
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,919
Oh, sorry, yes.

597
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,057
Jonathan Harker,
this is Count Dracula.

598
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,159
We're currently working
together to, hopefully

599
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:18,060
find him a permanent
residence here in the city.

600
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,830
It's an honor
and a pleasure, Count.

601
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,336
And might I say,
with Mina here,

602
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,072
I'm sure you'll get everything
you want and then some.

603
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:31,174
The pleasure
is mine, Mr. Harker.

604
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:34,609
And on the subject
of Miss Murray, we agree.

605
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,080
She has been truly impressive.

606
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:38,281
The Count and I
are going to look

607
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:39,882
at a couple properties soon.

608
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:42,986
And there's an old Abby
on the Carfax which, I think,

609
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,222
with a little renovation, could
be quite a private residence.

610
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:49,158
I know the place.
It's spectacular.

611
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,128
Though isn't it getting a bit
late for property showings?

612
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:54,263
That's my fault, I'm afraid.

613
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:56,665
Much of my days are eaten up...

614
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:57,967
Business matters.

615
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,768
And so I had
to see it at night.

616
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:02,604
I'm a bit of a night owl.

617
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:04,606
Miss Murray was
incredibly kind to offer her

618
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,242
time out of regular hours.

619
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:07,609
It really was nothing.

620
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:09,278
Jonathan, why don't you go
and have a seat

621
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:11,347
and I'll let
Amelia know you're here?

622
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,814
Don't have to tell me twice.

623
00:36:25,127 --> 00:36:28,797
So, you're a colleague
of Miss Van Helsing?

624
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,334
Yes, I suppose so.

625
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,870
Amelia and I have actually
been friends since childhood.

626
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:37,907
She used to keep me out of trouble and
I used to distract her from her studies.

627
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,010
Which is funny, 'cause now she's the
one always running towards trouble

628
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:43,711
and I'm the one who always
has his nose in a book.

629
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:46,548
Do you have an area of research?

630
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,451
I'm a chemist, actually.

631
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:50,752
I consult frequently
with Amelia and her colleagues

632
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:53,923
on cases of specific
scientific curiosity.

633
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:57,692
I do not envy
scientific research.

634
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:00,296
A lot of dry reading there.

635
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:05,600
I much prefer an evening sitting
with one of the classics.

636
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,170
I can appreciate that.

637
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:10,306
And definitely get the need
for more vibrant material.

638
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:16,112
The bulk of my personal reading
is actually into occultism.

639
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:17,880
How curious.

640
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:19,215
Does that study
not contradict

641
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:22,218
the steadfast rules
of your profession?

642
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:23,618
Not really.

643
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:25,321
In a lot of ways,
it informs it.

644
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:28,590
Sometimes folklore and
myth can fill in the blanks

645
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,326
when science can't.

646
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,228
I find that exciting.

647
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:35,697
I assume not all of your
colleagues share that sentiment.

648
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,833
Sadly, no.

649
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:40,369
But scientists who aren't
open to the unknown

650
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:43,139
aren't really all that good
of scientists, are they?

651
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:45,841
Hmm.

652
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:47,977
For someone I just met,

653
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,515
I must say you're quite
admirable, Jonathan Harker.

654
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:54,783
Thanks.

655
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,385
Amelia's just
finishing something.

656
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:57,453
She'll be right out.

657
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,554
Oh, great.

658
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:00,755
Thanks, Mina.
Shall we depart?

659
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:02,958
Yes, let's.
That'd be great.

660
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,440
[grunts]

661
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:19,008
I gotta get some sleep.

662
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:25,780
You know what?

663
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:28,217
Jonathan is quite good
at what he does.

664
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,085
Do you know that?

665
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:30,752
I don't give him enough credit.

666
00:38:32,054 --> 00:38:34,223
There are some
interesting things.

667
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:40,462
I mean, it doesn't explain
you or the killer or...

668
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:44,266
Or why I'm talking
to dead bodies again.

669
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,537
Shit.

670
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,339
I should get myself
a small dog to run around here

671
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,007
or maybe a canary...

672
00:38:56,778 --> 00:38:58,414
Wait a minute.

673
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,384
[grumbles]

674
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:16,065
I thought we agreed
you were gonna cool it

675
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:17,533
with this paranormal
stuff for a bit.

676
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,435
He didn't have
a reflection, Amelia!

677
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:20,536
And?

678
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:21,971
And that doesn't concern you?

679
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,705
Especially based on lore
and what we talked about?

680
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,274
No!

681
00:39:25,307 --> 00:39:26,775
Because I think you're seeing
things you want to see.

682
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,876
I don't want to see it!
I did see it!

683
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:32,515
You were on the couch, right?

684
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:33,949
Sit down.

685
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,788
If the mirror is at
an angle from where you are,

686
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:42,124
you can see me now, right?

687
00:39:42,157 --> 00:39:43,758
Yes.

688
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:47,762
And now?

689
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:51,433
Jonathan?

690
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:55,371
No.

691
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:56,738
Exactly.

692
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:00,710
You were seeing ghosts and
ghouls where there are none.

693
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:03,446
You're right.
I'm sorry.

694
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,548
I just really want this
to go well for her.

695
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:08,251
It's the first time
I've seen Mina this excited

696
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:09,352
about anything.

697
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,819
That's true.

698
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:13,222
She did seem to have a little
more pep to her step tonight.

699
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:15,757
It's more than
just the work assignment.

700
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,426
Ever since Mina was younger,

701
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,429
she was bulled so relentlessly
for being different.

702
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,465
Whether it her hair
or the way she dressed,

703
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:25,134
she spent so many years
trying to change everything

704
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,704
about who she was to be who she
thought people wanted her to be.

705
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:30,406
And here's a circumstance

706
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,275
where she's being valued for
who she is and what she does.

707
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:33,442
Exactly.

708
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,378
I always knew she had
a tough time of it.

709
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:38,080
But I guess I never
really thought through

710
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:39,915
how those things
tend to hang on.

711
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:41,483
Be glad you never had to.

712
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,588
So you said
you dropped off some new data

713
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:47,290
to Jack on the way home?

714
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:48,624
Yes.

715
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,260
The saliva present in
the blood sample you provided,

716
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:52,827
upon further investigation,

717
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,097
showed the slightest trace
of a chemical anticoagulant.

718
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,599
Like a blood thinner?

719
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:58,401
Yes, more or less.

720
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,703
That would explain
the extraction of that amount

721
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:04,273
of blood without the body
attempting to clot to stop loss,

722
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:07,176
but that leaves the question:

723
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:09,844
how is the killer
administering it to his victims?

724
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,449
And where has
all the blood gone?

725
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:14,684
I don't know.

726
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:17,053
That's more your
and Jack's department.

727
00:41:17,086 --> 00:41:18,554
I can identify the chemical,

728
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:21,724
but how and why of it
might be above my pay grade.

729
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:23,292
[phone rings]

730
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:26,529
Hello?

731
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:27,763
Amelia, it's Jack!

732
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:29,031
Speak of the devil.

733
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:31,534
No. Speak of the bat!

734
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,703
I have some very interesting
things to tell you.

735
00:41:33,736 --> 00:41:35,404
When can you get here?

736
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:37,106
- We're already on our way.
- Excellent!

737
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:49,485
Seward?

738
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:50,753
Oh, Captain...

739
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:52,788
I got your message to come down.
What's going on?

740
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:55,291
Well, we had an amazing
development this morning.

741
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:57,460
From some of the blood
of one of the victims,

742
00:41:57,493 --> 00:42:00,162
we were able to find
the presence of saliva.

743
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:02,631
And in the saliva,
there was an anticoagulant.

744
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:03,866
Okay.

745
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,302
Well, it reminded me something
that Amelia said.

746
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:09,138
Amelia said something
about animals and stuff

747
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,207
and I thought, well, there
are only certain animals

748
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,142
that have the anticoagulant.

749
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:16,946
And if you look here,
that would be bats...

750
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:19,181
Oh!

751
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,222
[grunts]

752
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,461
Why?

753
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:34,630
[groans]

754
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:05,494
Jack?

755
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:08,964
Jack? We're here.

756
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:11,400
Oh my God. Jack?

757
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:13,436
Jack!
What happened?

758
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:14,437
Jack!

759
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,604
Get help!

760
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:16,639
Jack?

761
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:17,706
Re...

762
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:19,542
I don't understand!

763
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:22,111
Helps on the way!

764
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,746
Stay with me, Jack, please!

765
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:24,747
Please!

766
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,615
It was... Renfield.

767
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,463
Renfield!

768
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,742
Looks like
he's fled the scene.

769
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:56,278
Doesn't convince me
of his innocence.

770
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:00,749
What are you doing?
Isn't this a crime scene?

771
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:02,618
Yes. And if you recall,

772
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,753
I'm the lead
investigator on the scene.

773
00:44:04,786 --> 00:44:07,022
And considering the fact
that we have a friend

774
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,724
in critical
condition downstairs,

775
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:11,059
I'm not inclined
to follow protocol.

776
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,729
So if you don't mind...

777
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:18,067
Locked.

778
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,568
Ah-ha.

779
00:44:20,636 --> 00:44:21,570
What is this?

780
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:31,514
Oh, my God!

781
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:32,949
What?

782
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:37,219
These files...
they're records, passports,

783
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:40,322
Licenses,
personal information...

784
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:42,558
All of women matching
the killer's target type.

785
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,629
Red hair...
all women with red hair.

786
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:51,133
This doesn't prove
anything, right?

787
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:54,436
The captain of the police would
have files on murder victims.

788
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:57,739
Yeah, which is why
I recognize the first few.

789
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:01,710
The problem is,

790
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:06,850
a lot of these women
aren't victims... yet.

791
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:09,785
This isn't paperwork
after the fact.

792
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:11,888
It's a hit list!

793
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:13,088
- Where are you going?
- I'm going after him!

794
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:14,423
Amelia, look!

795
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,158
I understand, but
we should call someone

796
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,560
like Interpol or something!

797
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:21,865
Maybe, but we don't
have time for red tape.

798
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:23,900
- Right, but...
- Look!

799
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:26,268
Jack found something that
incriminated the murderer,

800
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:28,304
and Renfield tried
to kill him for it!

801
00:45:28,337 --> 00:45:31,106
That tells me that
Renfield is either

802
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,642
the man responsible
or knows who is.

803
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:36,712
And every second we waste
puts someone else in danger.

804
00:45:36,745 --> 00:45:38,247
- I'll come with you.
- No!

805
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,916
I'll check his house.

806
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,151
I may be able to reason with
him, but only if I go alone.

807
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:43,686
Take those files to your office

808
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:45,788
and see if there's
anything we've missed.

809
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:47,991
Amelia...

810
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:49,324
Be careful!

811
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:56,231
Renfield!

812
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:14,483
If you're gonna pull
that trigger,

813
00:46:14,516 --> 00:46:18,387
you better be damn certain
you do it faster than I do.

814
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,755
Why'd you do it, Captain?

815
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,359
Your cover's blown.

816
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:25,194
At least help me understand.

817
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:27,897
You could never understand.

818
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,901
It is knowledge that is not
meant for the likes of you.

819
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:34,737
You attacked Jack...

820
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,008
and those women
are dead because of you!

821
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:42,411
You've perverted everything
we're supposed to stand for!

822
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:45,648
And what if everything
we stand for is irrelevant?

823
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:49,218
Because the truth
of what's really out there

824
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,921
is too terrible for
us to comprehend.

825
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,025
You're sick!

826
00:46:55,058 --> 00:46:56,993
No, Van Helsing.

827
00:46:57,026 --> 00:47:03,265
For the first time in my life,
I'm finally aware.

828
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,169
What happened to you?

829
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:10,172
The inevitable.

830
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:13,342
And it will
happen to you, too!

831
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,810
[gunshot]

832
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,456
You told me to catch
the killer at any cost...

833
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,726
And I did.

834
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,585
[sighs]

835
00:48:27,482 --> 00:48:29,018
Sorry, Amelia.

836
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:46,835
A familiar...

837
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:48,470
Of course!

838
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:50,039
Renfield's not the killer.

839
00:48:50,072 --> 00:48:52,909
He's harvesting victims
for the killer.

840
00:50:15,258 --> 00:50:17,559
I hoped I'd find you here.

841
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:19,162
Good guess.

842
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,529
Not really.

843
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:21,898
You're still the better
detective.

844
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:23,900
I tried your house first
and the station.

845
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:26,401
Finally, dispatch told me
this is where I should look.

846
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:28,704
They're not supposed to do that.

847
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,273
I'd like to tell
you some...

848
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:32,507
I killed him, Jonathan.

849
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,176
My own superior officer.

850
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:37,881
A man that I looked up to.

851
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:40,884
A man that I thought I knew.

852
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:44,486
What would bring someone
to do something like this?

853
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,421
He killed all those people

854
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:50,392
and came to work every day
pretending to look for himself.

855
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,460
It's deranged.

856
00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:55,899
I think it's more than that.

857
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,432
What are you talking about?

858
00:50:57,465 --> 00:50:58,600
I don't know that Renfield
was acting entirely

859
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:01,271
of his own accord.

860
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:03,306
You see, there's this
thing called a "familiar"

861
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,706
where a vampire entrances you...

862
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:07,709
Jonathan, I asked you...

863
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:11,281
I begged you not to go there!

864
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:14,683
Do you understand that
I had to kill a man tonight?

865
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:19,155
A man that I looked up to
and always trusted

866
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:21,024
- to do the right thing.
- It doesn't add up, Amelia,

867
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:22,892
and you're a good enough
detective to know that!

868
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,694
Renfield may
have attacked Seward.

869
00:51:25,727 --> 00:51:27,796
But that in no way matches
any of the other murders.

870
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:29,198
It doesn't explain
the neck wound

871
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:30,599
or the anticoagulant

872
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:33,468
or what exactly Jack
found that set him off.

873
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:34,770
But the file...

874
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,406
Oh, I think
he's gathering a list...

875
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:40,209
for someone else,
someone who could tear throats

876
00:51:40,242 --> 00:51:41,945
and make them bleed
without clotting,

877
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:43,712
someone who would gladly
take a tailored list

878
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:46,015
provided by the one person
who could give him one.

879
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:47,283
I just...

880
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:50,052
A tailored list that
includes the woman you love!

881
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:00,062
[bat screeching]

882
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:17,313
[gasps]

883
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:20,116
[muffled scream]

884
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:22,452
Seward stumbled onto
something that caused Renfield

885
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:23,987
to attack in a state of panic.

886
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,154
And that just
doesn't fit the pattern

887
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:26,923
up to this point,
and you know it.

888
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:29,892
Your killer's shown nothing
but cool calculation,

889
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,260
not to mention the fact
that you knew

890
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:32,862
the victim profile matched.

891
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,096
Mina.

892
00:52:43,538 --> 00:52:44,974
She's gone!

893
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,181
Okay, panicking
won't help us find Mina.

894
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,884
We have to think
about this logically.

895
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,551
I just don't understand.

896
00:52:56,584 --> 00:52:59,821
If Renfield's dead, that
means that you might be right

897
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:02,225
in the fact that
he could be providing

898
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:05,128
information to the killer.

899
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:06,561
Oh, my God.

900
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:08,931
That means that the intruder
that I thought was here for me

901
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:11,533
was actually here for Mina

902
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:13,835
because they know about her.

903
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:15,138
Why didn't you say
anything

904
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:17,106
about the fact she
matched the profile?

905
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:19,409
I didn't say anything because
I didn't think anyone knew.

906
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:21,911
She didn't want anyone to know.

907
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:23,179
When she was bullied
when she was younger,

908
00:53:23,212 --> 00:53:24,713
they teased her
about her red hair.

909
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:25,982
That's awful.

910
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:28,017
She didn't want
to change her core.

911
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,452
But she could change
her hair and she did.

912
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:33,423
because it gave her that
small measure of control.

913
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:37,160
Jonathan, I have to find this
guy and I have to find him now!

914
00:53:37,193 --> 00:53:38,428
Okay, but how?

915
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:39,795
Where do we start?

916
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:42,198
The crimes followed
a distinct trajectory

917
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:44,233
until Renfield was presented
with something

918
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:47,136
that spooked him enough
to deviate from the pattern.

919
00:53:47,169 --> 00:53:48,837
Right.

920
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,839
And when he attacked Jack,
that cast enough

921
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:52,308
suspicion of guilt
in his direction

922
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:54,776
and I went after him
on intuition.

923
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:56,512
But that triggering evidence
is still out there

924
00:53:56,545 --> 00:53:59,949
and could be the key, which
means we need to talk to...

925
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:00,983
Jack!

926
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:03,618
Jack, are you sure
you're up to this?

927
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:04,954
Oh, that's not the worst thing

928
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:06,655
that's happened
to me this evening.

929
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:07,789
Okay, so...

930
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:09,459
No, no, no.

931
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:15,164
The anticoagulant in the saliva,
it's not an external agent.

932
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,768
What I mean is,

933
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:23,106
whoever or whatever that
saliva belongs to,

934
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:28,111
they're biologically secreting
the anticoagulant themselves.

935
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:30,079
It's not a drug
or a stimulant

936
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,714
that they've purchased
and they've ingested.

937
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:35,985
It's literally
being manufactured

938
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,154
inside them naturally.

939
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:40,022
Is that something
people can even do?

940
00:54:40,055 --> 00:54:45,660
Science would say no, but
there are specific animals

941
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:49,764
that can secrete
this anticoagulant

942
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:53,002
- and yes, most of them are...
- Bats.

943
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:54,971
- like you said on the phone.
- Exactly.

944
00:54:55,004 --> 00:54:58,307
They secrete the anticoagulant
so that they can feast

945
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:02,345
on much larger animals
at will uninterrupted.

946
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:06,282
They slash the flesh and
then they have their fill.

947
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,017
And, uh...

948
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,322
Sometimes when the prey
is much smaller than them,

949
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:17,894
the end result is not unlike
our poor young ladies.

950
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:21,264
Okay, but...

951
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:25,034
Once I made
the saliva connection,

952
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:28,670
I did some research based on
the bite pattern on our victims.

953
00:55:28,703 --> 00:55:32,141
And I was able to find a match.

954
00:55:32,174 --> 00:55:33,943
And what breed of bat was that?

955
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:35,744
Oh, don't be so smug!

956
00:55:35,777 --> 00:55:38,347
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

957
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,714
Vampire.

958
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:43,386
Okay.

959
00:55:43,419 --> 00:55:46,589
But there's no such thing
as a human-sized vampire bat.

960
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:48,024
Well...

961
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,792
There are centuries
of vampire myths and lore,

962
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:53,062
which our killer
could be relying on

963
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:55,298
to perpetuate his crimes.

964
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:57,133
And since you've been able
to look at this case

965
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,768
in a way I haven't,
I need to know what's next.

966
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,504
- I...
- I want to be clear.

967
00:56:01,537 --> 00:56:05,241
I'm not saying that
I think it's a vampire.

968
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:07,043
But based on what we're seeing,

969
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:08,911
it is possible that he's
convinced himself that he is.

970
00:56:08,944 --> 00:56:10,379
And he's using that illusion...

971
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:14,716
No. That would not explain
the presence of the...

972
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:16,185
The anticoagulant
in the saliva.

973
00:56:16,218 --> 00:56:17,553
Exactly.

974
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:20,223
Yeah, but if I have to think
that way to get Mina back,

975
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:22,424
then I need to know what now?

976
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:29,966
Well, we'd have
to consult my texts.

977
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:32,501
Then that's what we'll do.

978
00:56:32,534 --> 00:56:34,270
Jack, thank you.

979
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:38,407
Amelia...

980
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,842
Get this son of a bitch.

981
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,177
Bring her back.

982
00:56:48,651 --> 00:56:49,851
[groans]

983
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:02,431
Anything worthwhile?

984
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:03,733
I don't know.

985
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:05,167
Maybe.

986
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,369
At the very least,
I think I may have

987
00:57:06,402 --> 00:57:08,904
fleshed out my theory
about Renfield.

988
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:10,172
You remember
how I said I thought

989
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:12,942
he might be a "familiar"?

990
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,977
Lore suggests that it's
a common practice

991
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,246
for the undead to entrance
a living servant

992
00:57:17,279 --> 00:57:19,048
to provide them with
what they need,

993
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:22,585
often unbeknownst to
the entranced themselves.

994
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:24,253
Doesn't make me feel better.

995
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:26,322
Well, what it suggests is
that whoever's behind this

996
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:28,157
knows exactly
what they're doing.

997
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,026
Not only were they able to
get a direct bead

998
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,361
on potential victims
via Renfield's access,

999
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:34,063
but also who better than
the head of

1000
00:57:34,096 --> 00:57:35,264
the police department
to help control

1001
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:36,932
the tide of information
about the case?

1002
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:38,467
Credit where credit's due.

1003
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,936
And if that's true,
that means they were able

1004
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:42,138
to bring the papers on
a wild goose chase

1005
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,140
about this
being a copycat killer.

1006
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:45,608
Well, I mean, it makes sense.

1007
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:47,476
What better way to
misdirect than point everyone

1008
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,212
in an absolutely
preposterous direction?

1009
00:57:50,245 --> 00:57:51,180
Right.

1010
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:53,515
Unless...

1011
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,485
Unless?

1012
00:57:56,518 --> 00:58:00,323
Unless that's exactly
what they want us to think.

1013
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:03,259
What if the best place
to hide is in plain sight?

1014
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:07,763
Present something as impossible,
make it seem sensationalized?

1015
00:58:07,796 --> 00:58:12,101
And those who value the truth
won't even consider it.

1016
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:13,669
And why would you think that?

1017
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:15,604
Because I didn't.

1018
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,740
And if this person
thinks they're a vampire,

1019
00:58:17,773 --> 00:58:20,309
they may also believe
that they're carrying out

1020
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:21,911
the killings of
the original killer.

1021
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:25,748
Or they think that they are
the original killer themselves.

1022
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:27,650
You may be onto something.

1023
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:29,285
Present something so plainly,

1024
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:31,520
people dismiss it outright
for being too obvious!

1025
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,689
Like how you and Jack
dismissed my vampire theory!

1026
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,059
Okay. To be honest,
vampires as an answer

1027
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,494
is the exact
opposite of obvious.

1028
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:41,364
What are you getting?

1029
00:58:41,397 --> 00:58:43,332
Now I'm assuming,
because you're a good detective,

1030
00:58:43,365 --> 00:58:45,434
that even though you
dismissed it as a possibility,

1031
00:58:45,467 --> 00:58:47,603
you still looked into the
murders from a century ago?

1032
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:49,605
The police reports
didn't have much, to be honest.

1033
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:53,042
Something about a trail
of bodies and a land dispute

1034
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,444
and the castle
outside the city.

1035
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:57,646
It didn't make sense
to connect it to this case.

1036
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,684
That's because you were relying
on fact and not on legend.

1037
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:05,221
Now, I'm not overly familiar
with this particular story.

1038
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,023
But I do remember some
of the broad strokes.

1039
00:59:08,056 --> 00:59:10,059
Something about a prince
or a nobleman

1040
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,394
who absolutely lost it
on his wedding day

1041
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:13,462
and went on a killing spree.

1042
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,330
Kind of standard basis
of haunting stuff.

1043
00:59:18,634 --> 00:59:19,870
Oh, here we go.

1044
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:21,337
I was right.

1045
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,939
According to this,
an aristocrat was set

1046
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:26,942
to be married to the love
of his life.

1047
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:28,744
But due to an
unfortunate illness,

1048
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:32,681
she died the same day
they were due to be wed.

1049
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:34,917
How terrible...

1050
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,786
Apparently, the tragedy
led him slipping

1051
00:59:36,819 --> 00:59:38,187
into a deranged madness.

1052
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,156
And he started
lashing out and killing anyone

1053
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,557
who reminded him
of his lost love.

1054
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:45,261
I don't think
there are any photos.

1055
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:47,963
But... the family name is...

1056
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:51,600
Dracula.

1057
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,068
Oh, wow!

1058
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:54,837
I knew I didn't
see his reflection!

1059
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,172
Amelia, you don't think...

1060
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:57,473
Okay, all right.

1061
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,541
There's no pictures of him.

1062
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:04,480
But there is a painting
of his dead fiancé.

1063
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:08,984
We have to find Mina now!

1064
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:10,453
We have to wait
until the morning!

1065
01:00:10,486 --> 01:00:11,855
Dracula will be
much weaker then!

1066
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:13,556
I can't wait until then.

1067
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:16,091
Who knows what will happen
to her if we wait that long?

1068
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:17,459
Let's move.

1069
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,709
Hotel Le Carmilla.

1070
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,744
This is the place
Renfield had a key to.

1071
01:00:43,218 --> 01:00:44,553
I think this is it.

1072
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:47,756
Maybe we should
call in backup.

1073
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,358
Can't call in backup.

1074
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:52,828
Besides, we're here based
on circumstantial evidence

1075
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,965
of a giant vampire bat.

1076
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:56,465
For some reason,
I don't think

1077
01:00:56,498 --> 01:00:58,534
they're gonna
spare the resources.

1078
01:00:59,768 --> 01:01:01,470
And what if we find him?

1079
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:04,373
If Dracula is the descendant
of the mad aristocrat...

1080
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:06,041
Or the aristocrat himself?

1081
01:01:06,074 --> 01:01:09,712
Then he's either finishing
the work of his family

1082
01:01:09,745 --> 01:01:12,181
or he knows who is.

1083
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:14,349
Either way, that can
lead us to Mina.

1084
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,520
So we're gonna go in there
and ask nicely.

1085
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:23,927
And if he doesn't cooperate,
not so nicely.

1086
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,527
That's what I was afraid
you were going to say.

1087
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:38,740
I think it's this one.

1088
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:45,147
I thought there'd be more
security or something.

1089
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,918
Guards would draw attention.

1090
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:52,956
This is exactly like the copycat
case, hiding in plain sight.

1091
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:56,191
People won't suspect something
that looks totally normal.

1092
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:59,861
But be ready when we
get in Dracula's room.

1093
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:29,658
[slurping]

1094
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:45,942
What do we do?

1095
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:47,409
I don't know...

1096
01:02:51,246 --> 01:02:52,748
Amelia.

1097
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,386
You're here.

1098
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:01,356
[hissing]

1099
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:10,000
Renfield?

1100
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:12,267
That's impossible.

1101
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,402
[snarls]

1102
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:22,544
Hey! Put her down!

1103
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,881
[screams]

1104
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:31,553
What is this place?

1105
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:33,589
What did you do to these people?

1106
01:03:33,622 --> 01:03:35,892
You should never have
come here, Amelia!

1107
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:38,627
I killed you once
and I'll do it again.

1108
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,066
[grunts]

1109
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:44,233
[hisses]

1110
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:47,103
You were a good
detective, Amelia.

1111
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:49,973
But chase death enough,

1112
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:53,542
eventually you'll find it.

1113
01:03:53,575 --> 01:03:58,247
And now it's time to become

1114
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,885
an officer of
a different rank...

1115
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,752
Hey, Captain!

1116
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:05,487
[screams]

1117
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:11,427
What was that?

1118
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,761
Holy water.

1119
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,329
Believe me now?

1120
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:17,632
[snarling]

1121
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:22,371
Blood!
They smell it!

1122
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,506
No!
No, that won't work!

1123
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:26,375
Here, hit their hearts.

1124
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,443
Don't get bit!

1125
01:04:27,476 --> 01:04:28,878
Oh, is that all?

1126
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,378
[grunts]

1127
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:44,894
[bat squeaks]

1128
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:49,264
Thank you, doctor.

1129
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,403
[wings flap]

1130
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:57,940
Hello?
Is somebody there?

1131
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:03,445
Dr. Seward, I presume?

1132
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:07,050
Yes. That's me.

1133
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,986
It's a shame we should meet
under these circumstances.

1134
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:11,754
As I've been told,
you're actually

1135
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,158
quite a brilliant man,
unfortunately.

1136
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:18,794
Brilliance is often
an impediment to what I do

1137
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:21,630
and I don't like loose ends.

1138
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,398
[shouts]

1139
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:37,779
[snarling]

1140
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:40,716
If you give me your blood,

1141
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:43,920
I can give you pleasure
beyond your wildest dreams!

1142
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,554
[snarling]

1143
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,891
Jonathan!
Get clear!

1144
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:52,527
Ah!

1145
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,398
Are you okay?

1146
01:05:59,035 --> 01:05:59,969
Yeah.

1147
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:02,337
You?

1148
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,540
Yeah. I...

1149
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:06,875
[bats squeaking]

1150
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:10,947
You!

1151
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,648
I could say the same.

1152
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:21,623
Ah!

1153
01:06:21,656 --> 01:06:23,491
- [groans]
- Jonathan!

1154
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:28,430
Where's Mina?

1155
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:30,532
What did you do with her?

1156
01:06:30,565 --> 01:06:34,170
Miss Murray is no longer
your concern, Detective.

1157
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:38,107
I appreciate you looked
after her all these years.

1158
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,843
And for that, I had
considered letting you live.

1159
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:46,448
But you have made
a pest of yourself,

1160
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:48,650
killed my servant.

1161
01:06:48,683 --> 01:06:51,353
And that's not very
amenable to me.

1162
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,654
Sorry to put a crimp
in your evening.

1163
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:55,325
And I'm sorry
to put one in yours

1164
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,295
but your interference ends
in my affairs tonight.

1165
01:06:59,328 --> 01:07:01,898
You surely must have known,

1166
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,600
once you've
discovered the truth,

1167
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:07,136
there'll be no going back.

1168
01:07:07,169 --> 01:07:10,472
A fact your dear Dr. Seward

1169
01:07:10,505 --> 01:07:12,808
unfortunately learned
the hard way.

1170
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:13,742
Jack!

1171
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:14,810
What did you do to him?

1172
01:07:14,843 --> 01:07:16,678
You already know the answer.

1173
01:07:16,711 --> 01:07:19,148
Now it's your turn!

1174
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:20,415
[gunshot]

1175
01:07:21,284 --> 01:07:23,818
So reliant on your toys.

1176
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:27,656
I'm not like the others.

1177
01:07:28,556 --> 01:07:31,560
They were young, weak,

1178
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,729
dependent on
the pitiful modernity

1179
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:36,498
that's coursed
through their veins.

1180
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:39,668
I am old, powerful,

1181
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:42,437
enriched by
the blood of centuries.

1182
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:47,776
It's foolish to think
that after all these years,

1183
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:52,282
I'd give her up
to the likes of you.

1184
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:53,448
You're him!

1185
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:56,718
You're not a descendant.

1186
01:07:57,954 --> 01:08:00,588
You're the nobleman
whose fiancé died.

1187
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,493
I'm sorry for your loss.

1188
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:08,663
But killing all those women
doesn't make you sympathetic.

1189
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,668
It makes you a monster!

1190
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:15,305
And it wont bring her back.

1191
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:17,439
They're not her.

1192
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:19,241
Mina's not her.

1193
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:22,644
You can't cheat death.

1194
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,882
Then explain me.

1195
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:27,950
[screams]

1196
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:33,923
[groans]

1197
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:45,567
[wings flapping]

1198
01:08:56,644 --> 01:08:58,580
What are you going to do to me?

1199
01:08:58,613 --> 01:09:00,016
Do to you?

1200
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:07,822
My dear, I've searched
for you across the years.

1201
01:09:09,824 --> 01:09:12,462
Now that I've found you,

1202
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:14,629
why would I put
that in jeopardy?

1203
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:19,701
You're not going to kill me?

1204
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:25,141
Not yet, and not permanently.

1205
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:29,379
But the others...

1206
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:34,317
Pale imitations that
tarnished your legacy,

1207
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,186
cruel reminders of
what was no longer.

1208
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:39,889
They had to go.

1209
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:46,228
But you... you stand apart,

1210
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:51,167
a mirror's reflection
of the woman I know,

1211
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,302
the woman you are.

1212
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:58,941
Of all of them, only
you are her exact likeness.

1213
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:05,048
When I saw you, I somehow knew,

1214
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:10,186
but I had to be sure,
needed to see for myself.

1215
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:14,756
Luckily, the partners
at your firm obliged.

1216
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:19,328
It was all a lie?

1217
01:10:19,361 --> 01:10:22,331
It was a necessary means
to find the truth.

1218
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:27,203
You may not remember
who or what you are...

1219
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,039
but you will.

1220
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,674
No... No.

1221
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:35,744
I've been so very patient,

1222
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:38,181
but it is time
our courtship ends.

1223
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:42,318
There's only a few more hours
left of night you will rest.

1224
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:44,454
And before the sun rises,

1225
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:50,159
I will restore you to be by
my side once again forever.

1226
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:54,530
But for now...

1227
01:10:54,563 --> 01:10:56,198
my dear Miss Murray...

1228
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:00,802
sleep.

1229
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:23,292
Jonathan?

1230
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:24,393
[groans]

1231
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:40,376
[grunts]

1232
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:43,246
Jonathan...

1233
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,414
I'm okay. Oh!
All right, maybe not.

1234
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,388
We need to figure out
our next steps.

1235
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:57,993
I just don't
know where to begin.

1236
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:01,397
That's because you
are relying on fact!

1237
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,932
And not on legend..

1238
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:05,134
They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

1239
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:07,702
You've got to admit, a
century-old mass murder case

1240
01:12:07,735 --> 01:12:09,704
that ended at a creepy castle,

1241
01:12:09,737 --> 01:12:12,707
that's the kind of stuff that
whets the appetite...

1242
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,909
The castle...

1243
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:18,014
We should get help.

1244
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,814
No. We can't wait that long.

1245
01:12:19,847 --> 01:12:21,217
We have to find her
before he does

1246
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,952
whatever he intends with her.

1247
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:28,457
My study. We can get
everything we need there.

1248
01:12:32,827 --> 01:12:34,230
It's all right.

1249
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:56,145
Which way?

1250
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:58,581
There should be a staircase off
the main chamber that leads...

1251
01:13:58,614 --> 01:13:59,948
[bats squeaking]

1252
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,452
You shouldn't have come.

1253
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:08,124
While I admire your conviction,

1254
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:10,893
and am impressed that
you survived our meeting

1255
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:14,597
earlier this evening, know
that it will not happen again.

1256
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,863
[growling]

1257
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:19,902
- Do you...
- I see them.

1258
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:22,071
It's pointless to resist.

1259
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:25,107
You're profoundly injured,
Mr. Harker.

1260
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,613
And, Amelia, my dear,
your blood betrays you.

1261
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:34,517
If you are so sure, come and
fight me yourself, you coward!

1262
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,154
Such taunts are beneath you,
Miss Van Helsing.

1263
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:41,757
And I grow tired of
your distractions.

1264
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,592
Where's Mina?

1265
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,461
She was yours.

1266
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:46,995
Now she's mine.

1267
01:14:47,896 --> 01:14:51,567
Then again, she always was.

1268
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,803
Time to let go.

1269
01:14:53,836 --> 01:14:57,606
Of course, I'm happy to help
with that process.

1270
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:00,442
Finish them!

1271
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,745
[hissing]

1272
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:04,180
Don't let him get away!
I'll hold them off!

1273
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,248
- I'm not leaving you!
- Go!

1274
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:22,631
Come and face me, you monster!

1275
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:26,602
[squealing]

1276
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:43,152
[wheezing]

1277
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:49,458
[growling]

1278
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:57,299
[grunting]

1279
01:16:01,703 --> 01:16:03,372
[groans]

1280
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:15,484
[thunder]

1281
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,191
Mina?

1282
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,694
Mina?

1283
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,729
Baby, it's Amelia.

1284
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:30,366
Mina...

1285
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:31,902
Mina?

1286
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,269
Mina, wake up!

1287
01:16:35,737 --> 01:16:37,573
Oh, thank God!

1288
01:16:37,606 --> 01:16:41,376
I'd ask that you refrain from
using that name in my house.

1289
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:52,923
Don't you think
we've had enough

1290
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:55,458
of this charade,
Miss Van Helsing?

1291
01:16:55,491 --> 01:17:00,529
It was a noble effort, but now
it's time to accept your defeat.

1292
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:03,031
Like you did?

1293
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:08,304
You stalked across a
century, maybe even more,

1294
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,272
looking for your love lost,

1295
01:17:10,305 --> 01:17:13,542
killing every woman
that resembles her

1296
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:16,111
only to kidnap the woman
that I love

1297
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:19,548
in some deluded desire
that, what?

1298
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:23,452
She's the reincarnated
version of your fiancé?

1299
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:25,889
And you have the audacity
to tell me

1300
01:17:25,922 --> 01:17:28,357
I don't know
when to give up?

1301
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:33,529
You dare speak to
me with such insolence!

1302
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:34,563
Jonathan!

1303
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:36,332
Your insistence on
interrupting

1304
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,534
when I'm speaking
to Miss Van Helsing

1305
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:41,437
has grown tiresome,
Jonathon Harker.

1306
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,340
I would urge that you
learn from your mistakes...

1307
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,175
if it weren't your last.

1308
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,709
[screams]

1309
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,481
What did you do to him?

1310
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:53,448
[grunts]

1311
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,425
We have done that
already, remember?

1312
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,166
Stop!

1313
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,835
Mina, no!

1314
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:14,536
Mina...

1315
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,773
Let her go.

1316
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:23,112
Please, if you let her go,
I'll stay with you.

1317
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:26,281
You'll stay
with me, regardless.

1318
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:29,251
Maybe.

1319
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:33,489
But I'm telling you,
if you let her go,

1320
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:35,624
it would be
because I chose to.

1321
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:38,093
Me.

1322
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:40,964
And I know that there's a
part of you that wants that,

1323
01:18:40,997 --> 01:18:42,664
to know that I chose you, too.

1324
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:01,350
I'm not interested
in bargains.

1325
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:05,320
You know very well that
I can make you choose me.

1326
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:09,291
I do.

1327
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:14,830
But I'm telling you
I'll do it willingly

1328
01:19:16,531 --> 01:19:18,567
before you turn me
into what you are.

1329
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:25,741
And while I still have
a will of my own...

1330
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:29,678
I will stay with you.

1331
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,595
I'll be her.

1332
01:19:49,966 --> 01:19:52,735
You are her!

1333
01:19:52,768 --> 01:19:55,604
You are my wife!

1334
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:04,279
Actually...

1335
01:20:06,049 --> 01:20:07,382
I'm her wife.

1336
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:09,818
[screams]

1337
01:20:11,954 --> 01:20:13,355
Amelia!

1338
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:16,059
Amelia, how are you?
Baby?

1339
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:17,426
Are you okay?

1340
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:19,628
I'm supposed to be rescuing you.

1341
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:27,402
Fools!

1342
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:32,541
I will kill you both...

1343
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:39,281
[shouting]

1344
01:20:42,118 --> 01:20:45,787
[screams]

1345
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:02,738
Jonathan? Jonathan?

1346
01:21:02,771 --> 01:21:03,872
Are you okay?

1347
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,810
Well, I'm alive.

1348
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:12,347
[groans]

1349
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:18,955
Let's go home.

1350
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:43,079
Can we just stop a second?

1351
01:21:43,112 --> 01:21:44,613
Are you okay?

1352
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:45,814
Yeah.

1353
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,250
Well, no, actually,
no, not at all.

1354
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,552
I just wanna see it.

1355
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:57,026
Do you really think
he thought I was her?

1356
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,627
I think he hoped so.

1357
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,430
Love makes us hope
for impossible things.

1358
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:02,731
Well, he was an
impossible thing.

1359
01:22:02,764 --> 01:22:04,599
Makes sense
he'd believe in another.

1360
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:07,971
So it's over?

1361
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:10,940
You saw him burn into
dust just like I did.

1362
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:12,608
Well, there are
certain blood rituals

1363
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,543
one could use to resurrect...

1364
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:17,512
Not today, Jonathan,
not today.

1365
01:22:45,407 --> 01:22:48,111
Do you think Jonathan
will be okay?

1366
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:50,512
Thee doctor's said they need
to keep him for a few days.

1367
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:53,016
I think it'll be slow-going.

1368
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:56,785
But if I know Jonathan Harker,
he'll bounce back.

1369
01:22:58,787 --> 01:23:00,322
I hope so.

1370
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,091
He will.

1371
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:05,027
He just needs time, and rest.

1372
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:07,930
We all do.

1373
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:11,399
Speaking of, when are
you coming to bed?

1374
01:23:13,069 --> 01:23:14,403
I'll be there soon.

1375
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:15,537
Good.
