1
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,308
Things have been going well.

2
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,411
I've been working
with these sick kids,

3
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:49,214
kids who've been
diagnosed with cancer.

4
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,617
And chemo when you're
twelve, like, sucks.

5
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:57,155
But...I mean, chemo
sucks in general,

6
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,725
but twelve sucks It's
when it happens.

7
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,259
When what happens?

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,862
Are you girls ready to order?

9
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,765
Oh, I'll get the Cobb
Salad, with the... oh,

10
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,302
no chicken, no bacon, no
cheese and no avocado.

11
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,472
Mm... I'll get the
burger and fries.

12
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,275
but maybe with her
bacon and her cheese,

13
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,711
and do not bring
me a dessert menu.

14
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,680
I already know I
want the cheesecake,

15
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,548
the brownie cheesecake.

16
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,651
I'm so glad you're not on
that stupid diet anymore.

17
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,287
It was making me
a miserable person.

18
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,825
So, I have some news.

19
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,635
What are you doing right now?

20
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,503
Just like your
typical Sunday morning.

21
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,937
It's Monday and it's
like noon in L.A.

22
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:48,673
Uh, how do you know that?

23
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,440
You don't even
fuckin' live here.

24
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:52,778
Okay. Well... you don't
even know my day right now.

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,546
I was having lunch with Becky.

26
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,546
We went to that place,

27
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,815
Fucker!

28
00:01:58,816 --> 00:01:59,919
I haven't started the story yet.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,519
No. Ugh.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,522
I just realized that the
guy I slept with sucks.

31
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,891
Would you stop thinking
about yourself

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,592
and your weird little
life for five seconds?

33
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,429
I was having lunch with Becky...
I have some news.

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,833
My point is, imagine
chemo on top of twelve.

35
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:19,269
It really makes you
appreciate what we have.

36
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,805
Yeah, it does.

37
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,573
So, things have been
getting pretty serious

38
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,976
with Dale and I, and I
haven't really told anyone

39
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:26,944
Can I say something?

40
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:27,977
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

41
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,213
I gotta conference in Katie.

42
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,317
Oh, for Chris sakes!
Tell her later.

43
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,382
No.

44
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:33,549
This story is so
fucking long already,

45
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,685
I'm not gonna
remember any of it.

46
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:35,788
So just hold on.

47
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,655
Welcome to Club Monaco.

48
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:38,957
That's totally cute.

49
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,492
We don't have like anything
that cute in the store.

50
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,693
Okay.

51
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,463
Well um, hey, why don't
we try folding stuff?

52
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:47,265
Hello?

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,832
Katie!

54
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,002
Oh. I gotta take this.

55
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,269
It's work.

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,236
You're at work.

57
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:53,303
Hey, what's up?

58
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,240
I don't know. It's like...
some drama with Becky.

59
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,008
Tell me everything.

60
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,446
I haven't really told
anyone Can I say something?

61
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,579
And I'm only saying this because

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,749
you're my friend and
I really care about you.

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,884
Do I have something on my face?

64
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:09,853
Guys like Dale,
born wealthy guys,

65
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:12,357
they hate going public

66
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,325
And if he doesn't
want to be with you,

67
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,561
it's because he's an asshole,

68
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,263
not because you're... .
..one-eighth Jewish.

69
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,898
I mean, she's our friend.

70
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,500
I love her.

71
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,568
She has a pretty face.

72
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,303
Do you remember in high school,

73
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,572
all the boys used
to call her Pig Face.

74
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,541
Everybody called her
Pig Face in high school.

75
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,042
I mean, behind her back.

76
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,978
We've been friends since we
were little girls, Becky.

77
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,447
I want you to be with someone
who shouts it from the rooftops.

78
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,382
I know.

79
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:42,419
That's why I can't really
keep it a secret anymore

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,062
Dale asked me to marry him.

81
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:54,066
Oh... - That's insane.
- That's insane.

82
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,033
Okay. Back me up here.

83
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,601
I like, was...
totally gonna be the

84
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:58,834
one to get married first.

85
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,439
Yeah. He's also like
super good-looking.

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,708
I Googled him like
a-a few months ago.

87
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,410
Like, it's alarming.

88
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,479
I wanna date a
guy who has a job.

89
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,644
You know, we're all gonna have

90
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,049
to be in this wedding now.

91
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,549
Silver lining.

92
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,882
We're gonna get to throw
a bachelorette party

93
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,483
We're gonna get to
dress up and be cool.

94
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:15,719
It's gonna be just like prom.

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,620
I don't need to parade
around a bunch of people

96
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,855
that I used to know.

97
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,057
Clyde's gonna be there.

98
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,327
I'll probably go.
I've gotta go to work.

99
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:22,827
Yeah, shit.

100
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,629
I'm fired by now.

101
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,430
I've gotta go read some
books to these cancer kids.

102
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,766
Love you Beeeeees!

103

00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,722
Are you so excited
for your big night?

119
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:26,789
I'm so excited.

120
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,694
I've been waiting for this for like...
...six months.

121
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:30,828
No...longer.

122
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,929
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

123
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,999
I've just been wanting
something to happen,

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,535
and now it is, and
all the Bee-Faces

125
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,035
are gonna be back
together again!

126
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,504
And I had a spray tan!

127
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:41,105
Ooh!

128
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:42,874
So excited! Hey!

129
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,141
Hey.

130
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,642
Um, do you think I
can get away with this,

131
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,613
or do I look like I'm
just one of the help?

132
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,583
No, you look really cute.

133
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,521
Did you just make a face?

134
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,055
Uh, no. No, she-she's retarded.

135
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,523
Uh, I mean sh-she

136
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,522
uh, Asper- Asperger's.
She has Asperger's.

137
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:00,759
She can't control her face.

138
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,259
LooVery fucking professional.

139
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,763
Okay. Now, I gotta
get on the train.

140
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:06,495
You got the deets for the
Bachelorette party?

141
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,064
Affirmative.
Deets, check.

142
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,169
Oh... Just in case.

143
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,669
Mm, you think of everything.

144
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,537
I do.

145
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:14,505
Wish me luck!

146
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:15,672
Good luck!

147
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:16,908
The dress is really nice!

148
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,708
Fuck you!

149
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:19,843
Now don't wear boots.

150
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:20,512
Fucking cogs!

151
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:22,712
Just get it together fast, okay.

152
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:23,016
Don't you dare miss this flight.

153
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,917
God, stop yelling at me, okay?

154
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,483
I'm not the one
getting fucking married.

155
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,952
What are you even
doing right now?

156
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:29,988
You're such a competent and

157
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,823
calming maid of honor, Regan.

158
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,024
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

159
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,525
Easy on the sugar.

160
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:35,028
She still has to fit
in her dress tomorrow.

161
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:36,028
Oh, Chinatown,

162
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,195
I need a limo to JFK.

163
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:39,230
Do you understand that?

164
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,033
And I need um, champagne
sent up to my suite.

165
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,569
Wait,

166
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:44,802
No.

167
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:46,504
Plans have changed, okay?

168
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,204
The bride wants a
bachelorette party now.

169
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh, okay...Well, why
am I the last to know?

170
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,808
I can't believe you
get paid for this,

171
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,146
and I'm just a good friend.

172
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:57,016
about blowjobs,

173
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,017
if you want to hear it.

174
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,518
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

175
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,221
Yeah?
It's very interesting.

176
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,155
All right.

177
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,255
I-I personally think
that blowjobs are

178
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,555
an extremely delicate thing.

179
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,923
You know, like if you're..

180
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,091
if you're ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10,

181
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,560
1 being I'm blowing it kisses

182
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:13,830
and 10 being I'm, you know,
choking on just semen,

183
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:16,766
vomit just everywhere.

184
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:20,804
I think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s.

185
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,607
Like just enough so the...
so that you know that

186
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,275
I know exactly what I'm doing,

187
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:27,111
but with zero enthusiasm.

188
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,145
I'm giving you nothing,

189
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,579
because then you're
gonna be like

190
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,282
all right, fine. I'll
just fuck her, you know?

191
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,284
'Cause if I start off with
a 10, I got nowhere to go.

192
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:36,286
I mean, why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me?

193
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:37,553
You just came all over my face.

194
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:38,154
So you start off small, right?

195
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,055
But you build.

196
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,158
I'll give you a 6

197
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,793
after a fight, when
we're making up.

198
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,195
And then an 8

199
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,196
when you spend a
shitload of money on me,

200
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,732
or get me something
that's like a sweet...

201
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,201
gift or whatever,
I'll do full 8.

202
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,537
But then, I circle it back.

203
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,140
Back to the 3s, the 4s, and
the 5s, because that shit,

204
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,543
every time, without fail,

205
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,845
makes the guy's
dick alarm go off.

206
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,148
You know what I mean
when I say dick alarm.

207
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,215
Right?

208
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,615
And you're gonna be like,

209
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:07,286
"Hey, baby.
What's wrong with you?

210
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,586
You're acting funny.

211
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,854
Why so sad?"

212
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,821
When really what you're
telling me is, "God dammit,

213
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,160
just like suck my dick harder."

214
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,064
So... um... let's just
say um, like, what...

215
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,900
what would merit a 10?

216
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:23,767
What's an example?

217
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,970
I don't know,
you're like on a...

218
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:30,607
on an airplane, you're going
to a wedding of this girl

219
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,575
that you went to
high school with.

220
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:33,278
Uh, two more?

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,811
Sure.

222
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:37,848
And your ex-boyfriend uh...

223
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,718
Your ex-boyfriend who
ruined your fucking life

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,886
is gonna be there.

225
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:42,887
That jerk.

226
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:45,755
All this pent-up frustration,

227
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,758
sitting next to some dude
you're never gonna see again.

228
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,059
That would warrant a 10.

229
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:56,667
Well... How about this guy?

230
00:08:56,668 --> 00:09:00,037
Oh, no. I feel like I'll
definitely see you again.

231
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,354
Oh, my goodness.

232
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,187
Bee!

233
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,189
Look at her!

234
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,356
Bee-Face.

235
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,623
Aw, Bees!

236
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,657
We're together again!

237
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:22,028
Everything's okay, you guys.

238
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,095
All right.

239
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,097
How are we gonna get through
the next twelve hours?

240
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,398
Gena brought cocaine!

241
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, my god.

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,335
Let's use our indoor voices, about it...
you know...

243
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:33,369
Here's the deal, though.

244
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,405
We need to do some before
the bachelorette party.

245
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,308
Uh, it's not that
kind of a party.

246
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,843
Hear me out.

247
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,678
We don't want to share our
coke with rando bridesmaids.

248
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,713
It's for us.

249
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:43,680
It's true.

250
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,682
Bee-yatch-faces!

251
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,951
Ah-hah!

252
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:51,755
Woo!

253
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,892
I'm so excited, I
could buy a gun.

254
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:58,696
You guys are all
here, at my wedding.

255
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,364
Me... Isn't it just crazy?

256
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,933
Did Regan tell you guys
just how excited I am?

257
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:04,969
Yeah.

258
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,004
I see Regan all the time.

259
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:06,004
I'm sick of her.

260
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:07,905
Yeah. Feeling's mutual.

261
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,739
I'm so sick of you.

262
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,043
I'm sick of you, too.

263
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,077
There's my sick, running
down your shoulder.

264
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,979
Yuck!

265
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,149
You are the first
Bee-Face to get married.

266
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,187
Oh.

267
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,186
I'm gonna cry.

268
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,889
No, don't cry, 'cause
then I will cry too.

269
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,391
Like when we all watched

270
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,126
Princess Di's funeral
together, you remember that?

271
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,293
Too soon.

272
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:31,863
That was like fifteen
years ago, pal.

273
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,898
Uh, that was like
four years ago.

274
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,832
It was fifteen
years ago, Katie.

275
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,368
It was five years ago.

276
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,004
I think I know
when Lady Diana died.

277
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,472
Did Regan explain to you
about the par-tay tonight?

278
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,874
I was just trying to
tell them that, yes...

279
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,909
Well, okay. It's a little
last-minute,

280
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,481
- but... We are having champagne...
-  Ooh!

281
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,981
...and ice cream,

282
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,417
in our suite after
the rehearsal dinner.

283
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,485
Great!

284
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,255
And then we're gonna
like, party, right?

285
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,224
Like ah... like woo!

286
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,292
Like mm... Oh.

287
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,194
I know.

288
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,862
Yeah, boring.

289
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:05,464
Right.

290
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,431
Old, boring, almost-married
lady right here.

291
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:12,103
Yeah, it's just that uh,
a lot of the bridesmaids

292
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,403
came from out of town,

293
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,906
so I just had to keep
it really low-key.

294
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,808
And besides, I'm not a
big partier anymore.

295
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,379
Not like some people.

296
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,080
These two.

297
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:25,348
So... all right, well... I
think our car is waiting,

298
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,283
so let's all go.

299
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,350
Oh. Let's go.

300
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:32,790
Byeee... We're totally gonna
keep it low-key, too.

301
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,123
That's what we
were talking about.

302
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:35,460
Just keeping it low-key.

303
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,496
That's the kind
of girls we are.

304
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,764
Let's do some coke.

305
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,898
Yes!

306
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:48,038
Look at these people,

307
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,776
just desperate,
terrible, all of them.

308
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,243
They want to be like, in
what, legalized slavery?

309
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:55,512
That's what it is,

310
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,282
it's like a Jane
Austen novel on crack.

311
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,916
That's exactly right.

312
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,085
Should we do some more coke?

313
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,019
If you do anymore coke,

314
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,787
somebody's dick is
gonna get sucked.

315
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:11,195
Oh... #

316
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,830
Here we go.

317
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,830
To you and your
beautiful daughter.

318
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:15,466
Yes, indeed.

319
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,901
Victoria,

320
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,200
are you feeling
confident about tomorrow?

321
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,937
Your walk down the aisle
was a little bumpy.

322
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:20,937
Was it bumpy?

323
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:21,006
I don't remember it being bumpy.

324
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:22,006
Are you kidding? Best man,

325
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,806
mother of the bride?

326
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,042
We got this on lockdown,
don't we, Victoria?

327
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,378
He's handsome and funny.

328
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,513
Are you married, Trevor?

329
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,181
No.

330
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,079
Oh. Yeah. No, no.

331
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm trying, though.

332
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,182
I'm just, you know...

333
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:34,219
haven't found the
right girl yet.

334
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,585
Hey.

335
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,254
You know how Becky
wanted to keep it low-key?

336
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,290
Well... I got a stripper for
the bachelorette party.

337
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,326
Stop your lies.

338
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,994
You don't know any strippers.

339
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,095
I do.

340
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:48,032
I know a freelance stripper.

341
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,570
That sounds amazing.

342
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,139
What's going on?

343
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:23,300
I just don't know...
how to do it.

344
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,970
Like in a bathtub,
with rope... I just

345
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,871
I gotta go do something.

346
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,971
Okay.

347
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,073
Please don't leave me alone.

348
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,044
Now honey, why can't you...

349
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,176
- ...find a nice man like this?
- Hmm?

350
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,143
Oh, come on.

351
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,078
Frank is never
gonna commit to you.

352
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,946
Frank? Who's Frank?

353
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:36,979
Her boyfriend.

354
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,147
He's doing his residency.

355
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,315
He'll be here tomorrow.

356
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,249
Yeah... Wow.

357
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,217
I bet he's busy a lot.

358
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,484
Tough to commit that way.

359
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,488
Let's just say
hi to Aunt Janey, okay?

360
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,255
You don't want to be rude.

361
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,264
If you get bored,
I'll be right here.

362
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,197
Can I get you anything?

363
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,032
I'm-I'm good, actually.

364
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,272
- Hey.
- Hey.

365
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,408
Joe.

366
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,975
Joe... Barnes?

367
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:08,412
From back in the...
we went to...

368
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:09,278
high school together...
Do you...?

369
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you have a job?

370
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,480
A job? Like out- like a...

371
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,248
yeah, I have a job um,
uh, in the world.

372
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,619
computer programming, actually.

373
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,420
Like a Steve Jobs
kind of thing?

374
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,255
Uh, hmm, kind- err, no.

375
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:20,624
Not at all, actually.

376
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,091
I didn't found Apple.

377
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:22,160
You don't remember me, do you?

378
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,527
Ah... The honeymoon
is a total surprise.

379
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,298
I haven't told her yet, but
I'm gonna blow her mind.

380
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,365
Boar hunting?

381
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,402
We're going to central Germany.

382
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,275
It's incredible. We should...
Gena?

383
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,010
Hi...

384
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,045
Hi, Clyde.

385
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,648
I haven't seen you since...
...that thing.

386
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,618
...since that thing I
grew up next to Becky,

387
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,454
so I was kind of around a lot.

388
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,286
We would hang out
a little bit, and then

389
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:52,267
into high school, we were

390
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,325
in French class together.
Wait. I took French?

391
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,589
Yes.

392
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,195
You actually used to
copy my homework.

393
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,595
But no, it's-it's good.

394
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,465
I just wanted to say hi, and...
and uh...

395
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,100
say the hellos.

396
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:04,500
I-I sold you pot.

397
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,638
Oh, Joe!

398
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,671
That's-that's me.

399
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,573
You've got bangs!

400
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:11,141
Yeah, new bangs.

401
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,609
Do you have some?

402
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,546
Remember how I was telling you
about the Bee-Faces,

403
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,846
Becky's friends?

404
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,448
This is Gena Myers,
she's one of them.

405
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,581
Oh, hi.

406
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:20,384
Gena, this is my
sister, Stefanie.

407
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,051
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Myers.

408
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,355
Oh, no. I'm not married.

409
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,623
And um, I'm not an
adult, either, so...

410
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:27,726
Excuse me for a second.

411
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,326
The natives are
getting restless.

412
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:33,597
Oh... You two know each other from...
...high school.

413
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:34,897
...since I was your age.

414
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,470
All right. I'm gonna go
sit down, but um... Okay.

415
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,438
...will you come
sit next to me?

416
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,142
Uh, well, whatever those
little place-cards say, okay?

417
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,380
Bye...

418
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,048
What?

419
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,182
I didn't say anything.

420
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:54,784
That is a... dress?

421
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,487
No, this is a T-shirt.

422
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,156
I'm glad to see you're still
fighting the good fight

423
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,123
against the tyranny of pants.

424
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,290
I also thought maybe

425
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,791
this would help you
get a head-start.

426
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,629
Maybe I'm looking
for a challenge.

427
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,630
Oh... is that why...

428
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:10,133
you're trying to
fuck a small child?

429
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:11,268
Good one.

430
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,602
You know what you should do?

431
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,705
Save the zingers for
the speeches, Genny.

432
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,076
Okay.

433
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,277
Our seventh-grade field trip

434
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,545
to Six Flags is
coming to a close.

435
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:23,782
We're all piling on
the bus to go home.

436
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,516
Dale lags behind,

437
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,452
'cause he just has
to ride the Freefall

438
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,819
at the last minute.

439
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,388
So he's running like
hell to catch up to us,

440
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,122
and he just bites it.

441
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:35,359
Wipes out completely, spills
what must be two liters

442
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,562
of Dr. Pepper all over his
shorts,

443
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,695
just epic.

444
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:41,329
So later, he and I are sitting
in the back of the bus,

445
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,536
and I get a whiff of
Dr. Pepper and piss.

446
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,305
And I say, "You know,
it'd be pretty funny

447
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:52,075
if you pissed your
pants riding Freefall,

448
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,845
and then spilled Dr. Pepper
all over yourself

449
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,180
to try, cover it up."

450
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,450
And he turns to me, and he
goes, "Yes, it would be.

451
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,251
But it would also
be kinda genius.

452
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,153
Classic Dale.

453
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:06,556
Classic Dale.

454
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,191
Thank you, Trevor.

455
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,259
You weren't supposed
to make your speech

456
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,629
'til tomorrow, but... it's fine.

457
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,498
Now we have a special surprise

458
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:15,633
from the bride's cousins.

459
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,243
This is gonna be good.

460
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,144
Yo, Becky?
Say what?

461
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:28,710
Yo, Dale?

462
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,679
Say who?

463
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,481
Guess what?

464
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,547
What who?

465
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,483
You getting married!

466
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:40,156
United you stand,
divided you fall!

467
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,861
Becky and Dale,
you only get one shot!

468
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,633
Magic.

469
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:52,136
Okay, now

470
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:53,872
how about we hand it over

471
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,707
to one of our bridesmaids Gena?

472
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,880
Why don't you start us off?

473
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,547
Hey, welcome to the wedding.

474
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:04,413
Right?

475
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:10,754
Hey... Um... so, Becky.

476
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,422
I love you.

477
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:16,326
Uh, we met in the
high school bathroom.

478
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,194
You remember that?
Woo...

479
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:18,929
Yeah.

480
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,331
Yeah, I was in there um,
like, eating my lunch,

481
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:21,332
'cause I was kind of a loser.

482
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:25,269
And uh, she was in there...

483
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,740
That was just for like a-a...

484
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,547
she did that for like a w-...
a week.

485
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,951
Gena...

486
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:40,452
You guys...

487
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,455
I just want to make, actually,

488
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:48,959
a really important announcement.

489
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,826
I've lost my cell phone,

490
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:53,498
and last time I saw it,
actually it was...

491
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,933
it was back there, and I
feel like somebody took it.

492
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:57,667
All right.

493
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,369
Thank you.

494
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,403
Wow.

495
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,953
Gena and Katie.

496
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:16,788
Having fun?

497
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,822
Yes.

498
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:19,757
Nice, isn't it?

499
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,958
Yeah.

500
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,396
Um, Katie and Gena... seem a little...
or... No... No.

501
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,331
Oh, your mom's
gonna give a speech.

502
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:31,468
Ladies, I would
like to give a toast.

503
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,369
So if you'd all
just gather 'round.

504
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,571
I want some fucking champagne.

505
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,275
I'd like to make
a toast to my little girl.

506
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,844
To Becky.

507
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,711
To Becky! And Dale!

508
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:42,844
To Becky and Dale!

509
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,881
To Becky and Dale!

510
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,524
I'm sorry, but you
aware of the complaints

511
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,461
we've been getting
about the noise

512
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,761
coming from this room?

513
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,796
Uh, I'm so sorry.

514
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,699
We're just uh, we'll
keep it down.

515
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,767
I just... I'm getting
married in the morning.

516
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,270
Oh, I'm sorry, but... I'm
gonna have to search you.

517
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,440
Hey, wait a minute here.

518
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,844
What's going on?

519
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,911
He's not a real cop.

520
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:16,047
He's not a real cop.
Show me what you got,

521
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,780
breeders!

522
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:39,336
Come on, Pigface.

523
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,371
Let's get crunk!

524
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:42,439
No. Whoa.

525
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,846
What did you just call me?

526
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,950
What happened?

527
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,818
Why would he say that?

528
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,522
Because... because
it was just a j-... I mean,

529
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:00,555
he was joking around, you know.

530
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,657
It's fine, it's fine.

531
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:02,691
you're not Pigface, Becky.

532
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:03,659
Yeah... Nah.

533
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,494
Nobody calls
you Pigface anymore.

534
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:06,562
We're all having a good time.

535
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:07,863
Yeah, it's really funny.

536
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:08,833
Like how you told
everyone I was bulimic.

537
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,800
What the hell was that?

538
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:11,534
No.

539
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:14,938
Not like... not like that. Um...

540
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,540
not like that at all,
because that wasn't funny.

541
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,975
How would you like it,

542
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,678
if I just told everyone
some of your shit.

543
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,612
Yeah, that would be awesome.

544
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,515
You know what,
how about everyone goes,

545
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,784
you know? Like let's just...
take a rest

546
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,089
No. No. You know what?

547
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,758
Don't bother coming tomorrow,

548
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,861
unless you're gonna
act like normal people.

549
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,630
Of course.

550
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,134
Done.

551
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,402
Have a good night.

552
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,136
It was nice to meet you.

553
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,517
Come on, sweetie.

554
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:02,554
What do you call a bachelorette
party without a bride?

555
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,055
Friday?

556
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,095
Man... I really hate weddings.

557
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm so glad you're here.

558
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,567
All right.

559
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,536
So like, let's assess
the situation.

560
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:20,471
Me! Me!

561
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,739
Becky's vagina's magic,
and she used it to

562
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,642
nab a perfect human being.

563
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:26,741
Magic's not real, right?

564
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,811
Magic is not real.

565
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,445
Yeah? How do you think I feel?

566
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:31,479
I've been planning this shit
for six months straight.

567
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,517
I'm ready to murder someone.

568
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,616
I believe it.

569
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,650
But wait,
what's her dress like?

570
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:35,619
I bet she looks beautiful.

571
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,721
Oh, my god.

572
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:38,788
Go get it.

573
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:39,789
Go get it!

574
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:41,623
Your mind's gonna be blown.

575
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:43,428
It's in there, it's
in the closet.

576
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,428
Bust it out.

577
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,898
You know what I
just keep thinking?

578
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,698
What?

579
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,134
I did everything right.

580
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:52,935
Yeah.

581
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,573
I went to college.

582
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,441
I exercise, eat like
a normal person.

583
00:22:58,442 --> 00:22:59,543
Yeah.

584
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,748
I got a boyfriend
in med school.

585
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:07,787
And nothing... is happening...
to me.

586
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:10,688
Are you all right?

587
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,756
No! I just told you.

588
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,223
I'm fucking miserable.

589
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:15,925
Yo, coke whores.

590
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,094
Pippa Middleton is here.

591
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,929
Ah!

592
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,529
She put it on her body!

593
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,730
Oh, my god!

594
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,498
Guys, two people
could fit in this.

595
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:24,533
You know what you should do?

596
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:25,567
You guys should both get in it,

597
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,169
and then I'll take a picture
and put it on Facebook.

598
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,205
We can tag Becky.

599
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,506
Oh, my god.

600
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:30,106
That's a genius idea.
Do it! Do it!

601
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,808
Do it! Oh god!

602
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,143
Take the picture.

603
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,612
Oh, my god!

604
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,881
If we fit in this,
I am gonna pee my pants.

605
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,582
You know I'm gonna fit in it.

606
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,716
No, we're not.

607
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:40,887
We're gonna fit in it.

608
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:44,955
Oh, god.

609
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,823
It's like we're one person.

610
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:48,124
Yeah.

611
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,059
Oh, now we're in the circus!

612
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,860
Oh!

613
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:54,797
It-it's totally ruined.

614
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:55,832
Oh, my god!

615
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,168
Take it off... Just take it off.

616
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,536
Oh, my god!

617
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,104
Just... step out slowly.

618
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:05,009
Oh, my god.

619
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:07,111
Tell me this is okay.

620
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,144
Tell me she can
still wear that.

621
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:10,212
It's okay.

622
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:11,647
She can still wear it.

623
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:12,182
It's not okay.

624
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:14,050
that's unfixable!

625
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:15,751
We're fucked!

626
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:17,053
Okay. We- you know what?

627
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:18,654
We're just gonna hide it.

628
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,025
We're gonna have to make it
look as if somebody just,

629
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,123
you know, they broke
in and they stole it.

630
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:24,125
No... We're gonna make it look

631
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:25,193
as if the place is ransacked.

632
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:26,130
What are you doing?

633
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,564
Watch out!

634
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,264
What the fuck are you doing?

635
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,067
Stop!

636
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,102
Burglars!

637
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,701
Stop it! Stop it.

638
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:33,938
Everybody just calm down.

639
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,772
Okay?

640
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:36,941
We need to fix this.

641
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,141
All right?

642
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:38,142
I thought you said
that was unfixable?

643
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,278
Well... I have done so much coke

644
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,812
that I should be dead, okay?

645
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,548
I should have died
like ten minutes ago,

646
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,217
so perhaps we should get a
second opinion.

647
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:48,651
This is an emergency.

648
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:49,617
It's an emergency.

649
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:50,619
An emergency.

650
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,622
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

651
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,988
Well, what are we
paying you for?

652
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,159
We're not paying her, Katie.

653
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,625
Somebody is paying her.

654
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:57,593
That's true.

655
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:58,192
Somebody is paying you.

656
00:24:58,193 --> 00:24:59,327
Woo! Not enough.

657
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,564
You're supposed to
help the guests of the hotel

658
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:02,765
Are you a volunteer?

659
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:03,899
What kind of false
economy is this?

660
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,102
Are y'all high?

661
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:07,070
Come over here.

662
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:08,805
Yeah.

663
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,041
I don't think she speaks
English that well.

664
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,777
You're not coming
to the wedding?

665
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,144
Oh, my god.

666
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:16,813
Your residency,
my ass, Fuckface!

667
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,847
You knew about this for months!

668
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,815
Shit is going down!

669
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:20,619
I need you here.

670
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,156
Frank... Frank... Frank...

671
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:28,057
Regan!

672
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:29,357
We have a bit
of a catastrophe here.

673
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:31,194
You wanna help us fix the fucking dress?
How's Frank?

674
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:32,799
Fuck Frank!

675
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,668
Okay... please?

676
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,237
There's gotta be
something you can do here.

677
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:44,074
This is housekeeping, not
Project Runway.

678
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,674
You need a tailor.

679
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,777
Tailors don't work
in the middle of the night.

680
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:49,143
Okay. Girlfriend to girlfriend,

681
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:51,080
you gotta be able
to work this out. Come on.

682
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,715
Bring it back first
thing in the morning,

683
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:53,683
and I can clean it for you.

684
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:54,817
Clean it?

685
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:56,252
It doesn't need to be cleaned.

686
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:57,386
Oh, my god!

687
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:58,887
Who's bleeding?

688
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:00,156
Wait... I'm not...
Am I bleeding?

689
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,758
Am I bleeding?

690
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,725
Oh, my god!

691
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:03,659
You're bleeding!

692
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,727
You're bleeding!

693
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,028
What, I'm bleeding?

694
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,363
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

695
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,266
Girl, you bled on the
dress,  you moron!

696
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,935
Oh, god!

697
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,237
Okay. What we need right now

698
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,305
is like an epically
brilliant plan, you know?

699
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,672
That's what we need.

700
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:17,640
So are you ready?

701
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:18,673
One, two, three, go!

702
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:19,741
Leave the country!

703
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:21,945
I'm gonna call Melissa, the
girl we got the dress from.

704
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:24,278
Jesus H. Macy, that's a
brilliant fucking plan!

705
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,413
How much cash you have?

706
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,082
I got five maxed
out credit cards.

707
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,118
I have a twenty-dollar...
I ripped it.

708
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:29,817
I got nothing.

709
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:30,721
That sums up your lives.

710
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:38,060
Whoa!

711
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,296
Caught in the act.

712
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,729
Oh, shit.

713
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,899
Busted. Hah-hah.

714
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,000
Looks like you guys caught us

715
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,334
in route to a gentleman's club.

716
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:46,802
Are you sure you're
gonna get in,

717
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:47,938
'cause I don't see
any gentlemen here.

718
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,042
Becky, I-I uh... I know
it's a little on the nose

719
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:54,075
that I'm going to strip club

720
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:55,179
the night before my wedding,

721
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,712
but you know, I'm fine with it

722
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,046
because the commitment
we're about to make,

723
00:26:58,047 --> 00:26:59,280
that's what it's about.
Look... you're okay.

724
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:00,882
I want you to see me,
warts and all,

725
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:01,950
and yeah I'm going
to a strip club...

726
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:02,819
Becky's not here.

727
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,187
She's not here. Okay?

728
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,756
And nobody blames the
dude with the blindfold,

729
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,989
so relax.

730
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,325
I am also not really into this.

731
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,893
Yeah, you weren't blindfolded,

732
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,293
so that's hard to believe.

733
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:13,430
Where's your mascot?
Sick. She's dead.

734
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,398
Is that what we call Kate where is Katie?
She is dead. Sick.

735
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,702
Would you ladies be interested

736
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,170
in joining our little soiree?

737
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,804
That was not part
of the deal, Trevor.

738
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,040
No, because we gave up
strip clubs for lent, so...

739
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,075
And we have
bridesmaid's duties...

740
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,342
In the middle of the night?

741
00:27:27,343 --> 00:27:28,209
That's interesting.

742
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,113
All right. Let's go.

743
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,447
Limo's waiting.

744
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,214
I'll text you.

745
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,382
Please don't.

746
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:33,851
Um, if you guys
do see Katie though,

747
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,884
let her know that I have pot,

748
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:37,452
'cause we had talked
about it at the thing,

749
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:39,994
but there were adults...
Your limo's waiting.

750
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,365
Oh hey, Clyde...

751
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:51,800
I just wanted to tell you that

752
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,437
if you strike out
with the pros,

753
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:56,342
you know you can
always call me, right?

754
00:27:58,342 --> 00:27:59,742
Right.

755
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:03,781
Well... I deleted your number.

756
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:05,581
Right.

757
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,787
That's impressive.

758
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:11,989
In the middle of
all this chaos,

759
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,823
you had time for a crotch rub?

760
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,525
Paid off, though!

761
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,759
Ba-bam!

762
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,765
Oh, my god!

763
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,031
You guys?

764
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:25,802
I know I'm on
drugs, but I swear,

765
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,505
that room you
just pushed me into?

766
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,904
It was moving.

767
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:32,976
#we don't need not
wookie tokie#

768
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,042
Objectifying?

769
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,277
We're paying their rent!

770
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,378
I feel like I'm
travelling backwards.

771
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,213
Can I take the blindfold off?

772
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,213
Joe's never...
you've never been

773
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,315
to a strip club, have you?

774
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:41,085
Have I been to a strip club?

775
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:41,885
Yes.

776
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,919
You have.

777
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:43,019
Joe's never been
to a strip club.

778
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:44,921
I have been.

779
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,089
Hence why I know
that for a fact,

780
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:48,222
once you get in there.

781
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:49,290
You never know what
exactly to do.

782
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,459
It's weird getting a lap dance

783
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,561
in front of other people.

784
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:52,862
Oh, my god.

785
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:53,862
There's no reason
to get outraged

786
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:54,830
and use words like "hence."

787
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm with Joe on this one.

788
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh. Dale,

789
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,267
I will not let you kill fun
on your own bachelor party.

790
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:00,538
This is like negative fun.

791
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,970
You don't get it.

792
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:03,337
When you meet the right girl,

793
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,174
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

794
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:05,873
You're adorable.

795
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:06,842
Uh, I beg to differ.

796
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:09,277
I met the right girl, I did
everything to screw it up.

797
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,246
So why don't you
do something about it?

798
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,516
Like apologize?

799
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,851
Well, never got the chance.

800
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:17,586
Oh, I smell a new profile pic.

801
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,588
You know what I want to smell?

802
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:20,025
I want to smell
that burning bush

803
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,459
I want to smell that
fucking red snapper,

804
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,827
what's her name?

805
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:25,427
Is he talking
about Katie again?

806
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:27,563
Katie'd be like shooting
a helpless animal.

807
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:28,265
Exactly.

808
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,265
Guys... Joe has a decade-long

809
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,267
hard-on for the prom
queen, so take it easy.

810
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:33,235
Oh, what about
the maid of honor?

811
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:34,070
I'll take her down, then.

812
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,940
Mm... It's not a good idea.

813
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,940
Why, what do you mean?

814
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,210
So you know how there are
like serial killers,

815
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,845
and then there's
Hannibal Lector?

816
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:42,912
Yeah?

817
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:46,182
There are girls,
and there's Regan.

818
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,918
Hide it.

819
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:50,553
Hide it in the bag.

820
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:53,355
After tonight, no more coke.

821
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:54,891
None. No more coke.

822
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:55,925
I'm having like one of those

823
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:57,460
moments of clarity right now.

824
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,560
Yeah.

825
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:59,395
You know what I'm saying?

826
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:00,529
Yeah.

827
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,330
Where is this
Melissa chick, Regan?

828
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,430
I'm calling her.

829
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:03,599
I've got it
under control, okay?

830
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,900
Go back to your
little intervention.

831
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,633
It's not an intervention.

832
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:06,502
We're gonna get a dress.

833
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,136
A whole new dress!

834
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:09,537
What are you talking about?

835
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:10,473
Why don't we
fix this dreThat's a great idea!

836
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:11,509
Hey, Melissa!

837
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:14,276
Hi.

838
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,480
Yeah, we're out... we're just
outside the bridal shop.

839
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,547
Melissa!

840
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:18,984
Melissa!

841
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,117
Hello.

842
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:23,184
Oh, look. Look.

843
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:24,454
It's the maid of honor from hell

844
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,154
that has landed on my doorstep.

845
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:27,025
No, I'd much rather
be here with you

846
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,325
and your skanky friends

847
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,192
than maybe getting
touched by my husband

848
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:32,096
Thanks. I can't wait.

849
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:34,163
Chill out.

850
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,534
You're beautiful.

851
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:40,470
Okay. You're being nice,
and it's scaring me. Stop.

852
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,672
What do you need?

853
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,672
Well, our lovely bride decided

854
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:45,308
she didn't want
to wear her dress.

855
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,308
I'm sorry.

856
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:47,508
I was just in my brain,

857
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:48,012
and I was just
really hurting you.

858
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,445
What did you just say?

859
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,286
Ba-bam!

860
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,420
If I am still working in retail

861
00:30:57,421 --> 00:31:00,656
by the time I'm 40,
I will kill myself.

862
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:04,192
I know you guys think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

863
00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:07,261
I will take a shotgun,
and I will blow...

864
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:08,097
Woman... chillax.
my... head off.

865
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:09,633
Please.

866
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,933
Seriously, you guys.

867
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:12,067
Okay.

868
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:13,268
All right.

869
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:14,238
Fun, fun, fun.

870
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,570
Oh!

871
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:18,009
This is all I have,

872
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,510
and it's still a
size too small.

873
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:22,611
Is this pretty?

874
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:23,545
Or is it ugly?

875
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,513
It's gorgeous.

876
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:25,713
It's the dress you wanted

877
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:27,983
to get married in, ever since
you were a little girl

878
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:28,719
I mean, it would look
so much better on you,

879
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,118
but it's gorgeous!

880
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,221
Everyone wants this cut.
I mean, not in this size,

881
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:32,955
obviously.

882
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:33,656
But this is so popular.

883
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,223
Everybody wants it.

884
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,458
No.
Okay, we want it. Yeah.

885
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,592
WrapNo. up!

886
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:38,261
Wrap it up. Hang it up.
Pigface!

887
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:39,562
No!

888
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:40,700
Over my dead body.

889
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,598
Regan!

890
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,499
Bee!

891
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,634
What the fuck?

892
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,236
Come on, that was our solution!

893
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:50,105
This is the problem... Becky
can't wear that dress!

894
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:51,073
Becky can't wear that dress.

895
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,140
What? Okay, listen to me.

896
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:53,277
This is clearly like some girl

897
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,777
shit that I don't understand,

898
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,247
so may I just be very,
very diplomatic

899
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,114
and say let it fucking go?

900
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:00,283
No!

901
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:01,784
I'm not gonna
watch Becky Archer

902
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,620
walk down the aisle
in my dream dress.

903
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:06,056
I'd rather lick this sidewalk.

904
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,155
Great!

905
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,556
Lick the sidewalk,
then, please.

906
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:09,992
I'm gonna lick it, too.
Don't be ridiculous.

907
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:10,994
You don't lick the sidewalk.

908
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,098
You lick the sidewalk,
I'll let it go.

909
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:15,098
A little lick.

910
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:16,733
Like a cat lick.

911
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,477
Like a cat lick.

912
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,376
Ugh.

913
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,077
Be encouraging.

914
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,747
I'm mentally preparing myself.

915
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,181
Just do it fast, please.

916
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:34,218
Like you're ripping
off a Band-Aid

917
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,718
Like anal sex.

918
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,421
Becky can't wear that dress.

919
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,123
A-a biased cut would
look awful on her.

920
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,456
It utilizes the
stretch of the fabric

921
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,794
in a diagonal direction,
accentuating body lines.

922
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,733
It would fit her like a silk
stuffed sausage casing.

923
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:51,702
Rain man?

924
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:55,570
How did you know all
that stuff, just now?

925
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:57,076
I spent a semester at F.I.T.

926
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:00,777
- Katie? Katie?
- Yes?

927
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,812
Do you know how to sew things?

928
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:03,548
Oh.

929
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:07,452
Of course I know how to sew.

930
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,185
Oh. Okay.

931
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,199
Are you ready to Betsy Ross

932
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,288
- the shit out of this dress?
- Yes.

933
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:13,756
Good.

934
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:14,424
This tastes like gasoline.

935
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,691
Good.

936
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:16,492
'Cause you love
the smell of gasoline.

937
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:17,492
It's perfect.

938
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,661
We should get some magic
markers while we're here!

939
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:20,362
Oh, wait.

940
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,330
I know a guy who can
get us marijuana.

941
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:22,432
Ted.

942
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,499
Joe.

943
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,565
You should throw
that guy a bone.

944
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:25,301
Who, Ted?

945
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,402
Joe!

946
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,203
I bet he's super good in bed.
What?

947
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,770
Yeah.

948
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,770
Why would you say that?

949
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,172
Have you ever fucked a guy

950
00:33:31,173 --> 00:33:32,207
who like never got
laid in high school?

951
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,507
But how would I know that?

952
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:35,443
Oh, 'cause they're just
really good at it.

953
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:36,710
They're really good at sex,

954
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:37,845
'cause they had to wait
for it for so long.

955
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:39,115
It's like a total
Krakow situation.

956
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,516
Krakow?

957
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:42,586
Brian Krakow, from
My So Called Life.

958
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,853
Come on.

959
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,421
Okay, listen to me.

960
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:46,824
There are two different
types of guys in bed.

961
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:47,856
Mm-hmm.

962
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:49,157
Number one, Brian Krakow.

963
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,795
Didn't have sex 'til
college, super grateful.

964
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,396
Literally makes
a home down here,

965
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,432
sets up shop, wants
to live in it.

966
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,334
Number two, Jordan Catalano.

967
00:33:58,335 --> 00:33:59,634
Won't go near the area.

968
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:00,501
Terrified of it.

969
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:02,703
Very good looking, but you
know, not worth the time.

970
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,639
If you ask me-...
What are you doing?

971
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,242
Why do you have the baby
out of the garbage bag?

972
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:08,844
I'm matching the thread
color to the dress.

973
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,278
Uh, it's a wedding dress.

974
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,380
I think maybe it's white.

975
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,616
Oh, actually...it's ivory.

976
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,817
Actually, it's pearl.

977
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:16,717
Okay. You know what?

978
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:18,552
Knowing stuff like that does
not make you guys cool.

979
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,255
It makes you... Amazing?

980
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:20,790
Gorgeous?

981
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,890
Incredible?

982
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,360
God blessed me
with perfect tits.

983
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,361
It's only right that
people should know that.

984
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,297
I was gonna say
makes you stupid.

985
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:30,832
This Trevor guy
keeps texting me.

986
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,302
He wants us to go to
that strip club.

987
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,371
Oh! Guys, we have to
go to a strip club.

988
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,303
Please?

989
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,470
Guys, it's like 2 a.m.

990
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:37,907
She wakes up in five hours.

991
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,142
Okay. How fast can you sew?

992
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,878
It'll be faster if I
had a sewing machine.

993
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,346
Oh, my god.

994
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,748
You know who could
get us a sewing machine?

995
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,281
Catalano.

996
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:48,851
No. More like looks like Krakow

997
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,386
and treats you like Catalano.

998
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,587
#free your ming and
the rest will follow...#

999
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:55,357
I'm the President
of the United States.

1000
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,624
Totally kidding.

1001
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,793
You want a dance, handsome?

1002
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,930
Oh, I'm-I'm good. Err, uh,
I mean, I'm not- help...

1003
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,766
what are the parameters
gonna be, for such a dance?

1004
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,834
Jesus Christ almighty.

1005
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,368
He said you're not his type.

1006
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,304
Okay, I'm talking
to the retard here.

1007
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,571
Snap!

1008
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,674
Here's twenty dollars.
Leave us alone.

1009
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:14,275
Look, it's just like
taking a woman on a date.

1010
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:18,247
You just have to make her
feel terrible about herself.

1011
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,349
Same goes for strippers.

1012
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,750
I am so sorry

1013
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,919
that he's referring to you
in-in such a manner.

1014
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,286
Does it look like
it bothers her?

1015
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:25,222
She's doesn't give a shit.

1016
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,756
Here you go.

1017
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,558
That was unique and special.

1018
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:30,258
Thank you very much.

1019
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,195
That was terrible.

1020
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:33,796
Oh, shit!

1021
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:35,262
I got a text from Hannibal.

1022
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,898
Looks like some
sluts are on their way.

1023
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:37,965
Becky's friends are coming here?

1024
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,235
Wait, is Katie with them?

1025
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,335
Yes.

1026
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:42,270
Relax.
I'm out of here.

1027
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,537
Keep the limo I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Dale, come on.

1028
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,307
I got a table booked downtown.

1029
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,675
What are you doing? We've got bottles
Where are you going?

1030
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:48,642
I've got wedding
photos in the morning.

1031
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:49,744
That is a dick move.

1032
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:50,945
This is like a classy place.

1033
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,447
I've got a wedding tomorrow!

1034
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,682
This is like the
Harvard of strip clubs.

1035
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:54,916
Hey, Joe. I'm gonna
make sure Lector

1036
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,318
brings your drunk
prom queen for you,

1037
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,385
'cause I'm gonna
make it my mission

1038
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:58,420
to get you in that tonight.

1039
00:35:58,421 --> 00:35:59,755
That's awesome, but I-I-I...

1040
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,756
can we stop referring
to her as a "that"?

1041
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,226
All right. You in, Clyde?

1042
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,563
No, I got something
else going on here.

1043
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:09,599
No, no, no. No females
without a male escort.

1044
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,533
What?

1045
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,766
That's really sexist,
and homophobic,

1046
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,538
because you don't...
you don't know us.

1047
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,836
We could be lesbians.

1048
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:16,838
These are my girlfriends.
What the fuck?

1049
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:17,507
All right. Down the street.

1050
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:18,007
Did you...

1051
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,277
just call us prostitutes?

1052
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,444
Did you just call
us prostitutes?

1053
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,380
Down the street.

1054
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,648
Listen, I got a
scholarship to Princeton.

1055
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:28,884
Hey, Dale! Dale, Dale,Dale!

1056
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:30,986
Can you get us in?

1057
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,822
I didn't know you
guys were coming down.

1058
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,890
Place is kind of gross.

1059
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,291
It's okay. They're with me.

1060
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,425
Hey, you don't have
to pay for it.

1061
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:39,496
What is this, misogyny night...
...at Scores?

1062
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,030
We can vote.

1063
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,531
I have never voted.

1064
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:43,832
Have fun in there.

1065
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,869
You guys'll fit right in.

1066
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,772
Guys... It's in this one!

1067
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,907
It's not even in a
white bag, Katie!

1068
00:36:53,908 --> 00:36:54,945
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1069
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:55,745
Okay.

1070
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:57,312
We got it. Done.

1071
00:36:58,347 --> 00:36:59,714
What are you doing?

1072
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:00,815
What are you fucking doing?

1073
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:01,883
Don't drop it in the garbage.

1074
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:02,952
I'm stepping on it.

1075
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:05,520
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

1076
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,588
Katie!

1077
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:07,690
Okay! I found it...

1078
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:10,826
#Rock n Roll Hoochie Co...#

1079
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:13,428
This must be what it feels
like to go to the Oscars.

1080
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:14,695
Ew... it's like Iran in here.

1081
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:15,896
Okay, so I'm gonna
go find the bathroom,

1082
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:17,032
and I'm gonna clean
off the dress.

1083
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,066
Okay, we'll find Clyde.

1084
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,036
She's not a stripper, right?

1085
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,303
She's on a pole.

1086
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,503
Let's rock the red carpet.

1087
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:23,773
Listen, if I'm not
out in five minutes,

1088
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,841
you should probably
claim the body.

1089
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:27,777
I'm serious.

1090
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,487
Hey, can I have some money?

1091
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,654
No.

1092
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:40,588
We're waiting
for Gena and Clyde,

1093
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:42,624
and then we're leaving
Pull this dress up,

1094
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,758
you don't work here!

1095
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:44,925
Can I have some money, please?

1096
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,096
Yeah, definitely.

1097
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,529
Thank you.

1098
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,929
They're just all
such beautiful dancers,

1099
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,000
I can't pick who
to give money to.

1100
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,433
That's so sweet.

1101
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,800
I always ask them
their stories, too.

1102
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:54,538
'Cause you never know
like where they... Oh.

1103
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,439
She's gonna be so happy.

1104
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,805
Her son's gonna
have the gift of sight!

1105
00:37:57,806 --> 00:37:59,106
Why don't you ask her
to smoke pot with you?

1106
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:00,010
Why is that
actually a good idea?

1107
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,410
Is that cool to do?

1108
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:03,610
Please. I need a
break from "that".

1109
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:04,778
We're not calling her "that".

1110
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:05,914
We're trying
not to call her "that".

1111
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:07,355
I called her "that" earlier.

1112
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,619
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1113
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,825
Your security guy's- the security's...
Thank you.

1114
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,993
That was amazing, but
I'm a little bored now.

1115
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:21,096
Hey, is there
anything you can do

1116
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:23,098
to help Joe score with Katie?

1117
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:23,899
No.

1118
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,368
Why?

1119
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,635
I'm a completely
powerless figurehead.

1120
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:28,604
I'm like Truman at Geneva.

1121
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:30,705
You mean Truman at Potsdam?

1122
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:35,778
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

1123
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:38,781
Truman inherited the presidency
because Roosevelt died.

1124
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,383
Poor fuck got sworn in,

1125
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,884
flown to Potsdam to deal
with Stalin and Churchill,

1126
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,088
figure out what the fuck to do
with post-war Germany

1127
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,654
and all of Europe.

1128
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,790
Geneva conference is
completely different thing.

1129
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,560
So I think you meant
Truman at Potsdam.

1130
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:55,564
Oh. I switched it, 'cause
I'm a little drunk.

1131
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:56,697
It wouldn't have
made sense anyway,

1132
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:59,935
because Truman had the trump
card, he had the Bomb.

1133
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:02,744
So really, he was in
control the whole time.

1134
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:10,846
Oh, do you believe in magic?

1135
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:13,149
Yes, I do. That's... abso- yes.

1136
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,783
Do you believe in
a magic vagina?

1137
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:15,018
A magic vagina?

1138
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,554
It would bewitch
you with its magic.

1139
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,754
I've been bewitched
by vaginas before.

1140
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,091
It's scary, actually.

1141
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,725
I think I might be stupid.

1142
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,161
Why would you say
that about yourself?

1143
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,729
I don't understand anything

1144
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,863
anyone is talking about,
most of the time.

1145
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:29,000
That has nothing
to do with intelligence.

1146
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,667
It's like this...

1147
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,135
there's lots of different
kinds of smart,

1148
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:34,537
you know, and you just

1149
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,573
have to discover
which smart you are.

1150
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,976
See, I-I don't understand
what you just said.

1151
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,743
That's okay, neither do I.

1152
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:44,580
Be honest, would you
marry a stripper?

1153
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:50,118
Um... Shh... shh...
shh... shh...

1154
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,754
There's no touching allowed.

1155
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:52,888
Okay.

1156
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,556
Did you know that?

1157
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:58,128
I... did- hadn't really...
We're not allowed to touch.

1158
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,562
Okay. Well, I'm not...

1159
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,864
I mean, my hands
are down. I'm not...

1160
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,598
Mm-mm... But if you
wanted to, you could.

1161
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,835
I'm confused. It's not
allowed, but I can?

1162
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:09,538
If you wanted to
touch me, you could.

1163
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,239
I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay.

1164
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,107
Okay.

1165
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:13,210
Just... all right.

1166
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,846
Mm-hmm. That's $200.

1167
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:17,847
That's $200?

1168
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:18,814
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,116
That's $200?

1170
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,651
Two-zero-zero.

1171
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:26,056
Okay. Well, I-I mean, I
feel like that's a...

1172
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:30,764
that's a-a pretty good...
deal...

1173
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:36,034
Oh, Genny.

1174
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:38,876
These guys suck.

1175
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:48,676
Hand full of splooge.

1176
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:49,845
Been there.

1177
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:51,145
Is it your first night?

1178
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:54,283
No... but pretty rad

1179
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,887
that you think I'm
hot enough to work here.

1180
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:58,822
You okay?

1181
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,154
No. Because...

1182
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,825
my stupid ex-boyfriend's
in the back right now,

1183
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,926
getting humped by some skank.

1184
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:05,896
No offense.

1185
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,896
We are skanks.

1186
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,030
It's so dumb.

1187
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:09,230
Like honestly,

1188
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:10,932
I don't even know why I'm
freaking out about it.

1189
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:12,599
I should be fixing the dress,
not obsessing over him,

1190
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,936
Look, the only reason why Romeo
is back there is because

1191
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:16,606
he knows he's not
getting laid tonight.

1192
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:17,772
It's true.

1193
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:19,010
Yeah. I mean, if he thought
he had a chance with you,

1194
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,244
he would be all over your ass,

1195
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,747
like a fat kid eating cake.

1196
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,881
Thanks.

1197
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:26,983
Yeah. Men are all
sorts of fucked.

1198
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,817
They feel insecure
for one second

1199
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:30,553
and they need
to go feel powerful

1200
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,686
for a couple of hours.

1201
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:32,854
Women feel shitty
about themselves

1202
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,621
and they just go
cry in the bathroom.

1203
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:35,293
Yeah.

1204
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:40,095
Or they stab each
other in the back.

1205
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,264
Yeah, I guess
there's that, too.

1206
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,765
Yeah.

1207
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,066
Oh, that's good.

1208
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,201
Yeah.

1209
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:48,336
I should like,
do this more often,

1210
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:50,239
come to these
bathrooms, you know.

1211
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,743
So much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist.

1212
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:55,710
Yeah!

1213
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,946
All right!

1214
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,182
That's great. Thank you.

1215
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,918
Regan!

1216
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,053
Whoa, we're still having...
What is that?

1217
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:05,054
I need to talk
to her for a second.

1218
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,221
Where's Katie?

1219
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,590
I don't know. This place
is like a fucking maze.

1220
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:09,324
Okay. Well, we gotta
get out of here

1221
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,260
if we're ever gonna...
We need to find Clyde...

1222
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,860
No to get the sewing machine.

1223
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:13,862
No, it's a change of plans.

1224
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,101
Do you think they'd
let me work here,

1225
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,935
if I take my clothes off?

1226
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,802
Oh, my god. You
let her smoke pot?

1227
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,037
I can't control her.

1228
00:42:23,038 --> 00:42:24,106
You can't control her.

1229
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,640
That's hilarious.

1230
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:26,309
Why are you talking about
me like I'm not here?

1231
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,743
I'm calling Becky,

1232
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:28,876
and I'm telling her
about the dress,

1233
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:30,110
'cause I can't
handle this anymore.

1234
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:31,345
Hah! So you can be
the big fucking hero?

1235
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:32,713
No! I'm the only
one doing anything!

1236
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:33,882
You don't handle shit!

1237
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:34,984
I handle shit.

1238
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,786
...and I handle shit...
What's the plan, Gena?

1239
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,087
It doesn't matter!

1240
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,653
I'm just telling her
about the fucking dress.

1241
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:40,287
What happens when all the
fucking responsibility

1242
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:41,190
comes down on you?
You're gonna call me...

1243
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:42,690
No.

1244
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:43,391
Yeah, you are.

1245
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,693
You're gonna call me, and
I'll fucking handle it

1246
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:46,894
Just like I handled
your abortion,

1247
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:48,168
because I had to
fucking drive you.

1248
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:58,073
You guys had an
abortion without me?

1249
00:42:58,074 --> 00:42:58,074
Okay.

1250
00:42:58,775 --> 00:42:59,242
I'm sorry.
No.

1251
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,343
Gena, stop.

1252
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,845
What is that shit?

1253
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,315
I-I didn't even get to come?

1254
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,680
Clyde, I need you to help me.

1255
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:07,384
Security!

1256
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,817
Clyde! Come on.

1257
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,220
No, he can't leave.
He owes me $200.

1258
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,321
See this?

1259
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:13,655
It's worth a lot
of money, okay?

1260
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,157
So don't blow it
all in one place.

1261
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:19,828
See you later.

1262
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:20,829
Whatever.

1263
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,066
Wait, Gena!

1264
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,433
Fuck you!

1265
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,102
You're a bad-ass.

1266
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,170
Wait! No, no, no, no.

1267
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,671
Oh, no.

1268
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,906
We're not getting on
the floor tonight. Nope.

1269
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:33,874
We're going... Do I
still look okay?

1270
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,045
We're going home now, okay?

1271
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,712
She really goes
from 60 to zero.

1272
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:37,746
No, you're not going home.

1273
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,281
You said you needed a break.

1274
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,180
That was before.
You're not going home.

1275
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:41,384
Joe, take Katie home.

1276
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,951
Whoa. Who is Joe?

1277
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:43,684
He's right behind you.

1278
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:44,251
I'm Joe.

1279
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:45,420
Hello.

1280
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:46,354
Here's what's happening.

1281
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:48,255
You're staying with
me, call your friend,

1282
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,458
as soon as she picks up
I'll take you right to her.

1283
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:51,425
The most efficient
way of handling it.

1284
00:43:51,426 --> 00:43:53,395
Wait, wait, wait. Um... Sorry.

1285
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:57,231
Think I'm gonna be sick...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1286
00:43:57,232 --> 00:43:58,134
She's good!
I'm good.

1287
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,368
Okay.

1288
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:02,471
Aw... Young love.

1289
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:03,306
All right. Okay.

1290
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,372
Okay.

1291
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:05,773
You wanna throw up?

1292
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:06,374
Here, let me take
you to throw up.

1293
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,307
Uh-uh, I'm good.

1294
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:08,143
No, come on. Let's go.

1295
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:09,444
Joe, come here.

1296
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,811
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1297
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:11,412
I'm trying to get
you alone with her.

1298
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:12,282
She's GTG, man.

1299
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,881
What's GTG again?

1300
00:44:13,882 --> 00:44:14,715
Good to go!

1301
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:15,751
She's good to go!

1302
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:17,486
Take her home and slip it in.

1303
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:18,820
I'm not gonna slip it in.

1304
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,155
She is wasted,
that'd be like rape.

1305
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:21,723
Slipping it in to a girl

1306
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:22,990
that's about to pass out...?

1307
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:24,327
I'm telling you, take these.

1308
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,060
That'll help.

1309
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:27,163
What are these? Are these...

1310
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,098
dude, are these
date rape drugs?

1311
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,000
They're fucking Xanax,
dude, for you.

1312
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,001
You're fucking paranoid.

1313
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,036
You smoked too much.

1314
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,736
Would you relax?

1315
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,037
What am I doing?

1316
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,773
All right.

1317
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:40,510
I like to see you man up.

1318
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,146
Now, do you want Regan,
or do you want Katie?

1319
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,148
You can take her.

1320
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:47,180
Katie's hotter.

1321
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:48,018
Yeah. Good call.

1322
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:49,018
Look, she's throwing
up right now,

1323
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:50,920
that's not so hot.

1324
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,955
What is wrong with you?

1325
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:53,523
I don't know.

1326
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,225
Hey.

1327
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:56,226
Thank you, Joe.

1328
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,860
All good?

1329
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,861
All right. Yeah. Yeah.

1330
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:00,394
so Joe's going with Katie...
You're going with Joe.

1331
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:01,229
Great. Yeah.

1332
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,365
We're GTG, we're good to go.

1333
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:04,665
Okay. Perfect

1334
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:07,136
GTG?

1335
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,135
Yeah, GTG what?

1336
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,103
Why you stealin' my shit?

1337
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:10,139
I didn't hear you say that.

1338
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,506
That's my line.

1339
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:13,945
This is the best night
of my life, you guys!

1340
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:17,946
How can you not
have a Metro card?

1341
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:20,482
Uh, because I live
in Los Angeles?

1342
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:23,451
Yeah, but you've been
here for like a day.

1343
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:26,053
Thank you, Gena, for
helping me get out of

1344
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:28,357
that sticky situation
with that wasted stripper

1345
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,058
that I could not pay for.

1346
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,124
Oh, you're so welcome, Clyde.

1347
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,325
Are you kidding?

1348
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:33,429
I could have paid
for the stripper,

1349
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,934
if you hadn't taken my wallet.

1350
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:39,003
How long are you gonna

1351
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,202
pretend to be mad at me, Gena?

1352
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:42,403
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

1353
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:43,373
Listen to me.

1354
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,941
I've got like mere hours

1355
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:48,343
to get this dress
fixed and cleaned,

1356
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:50,313
and make sure nothing
else happens to it,

1357
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,447
so I am so sorry, Clyde,
that your feelings are

1358
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:54,483
not at the top of my list

1359
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:56,417
of things to give a shit about.

1360
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:58,554
Wow, so you're
actually mad at me.

1361
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,494
That's interesting.

1362
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:08,397
You know what You got
pregnant a long time

1363
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,198
- years ago.

1364
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:12,032
And I felt bad
about it ever since.

1365
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:13,003
And you know,
there's this thing,

1366
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,872
it's called life, and we
have to get on with it.

1367
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:18,406
We got pregnant.

1368
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,875
I took care of it.

1369
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,110
You made mix tapes about it.

1370
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,312
I-I was 18.

1371
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,613
I was 15.

1372
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,422
You were 16, and
we were in love.

1373
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,857
Remember Fast Times?

1374
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,625
Fast Times?

1375
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,991
You remember that movie?

1376
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:38,193
Do you remember
who the bad guy was?

1377
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:39,528
It was Damone.

1378
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:43,931
The asshole didn't show
up for the appointment.

1379
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:44,601
That's you, mother fucker.

1380
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,368
I am not I am not Damone!

1381
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,438
I'm not Damone!

1382
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,759
I can't believe you cannot
see that you are Damone.

1383
00:46:50,794 --> 00:46:53,079
Don't call me... dude, don't
call me fucking Damone...

1384
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,311
What do you want me
to do about it now?

1385
00:46:57,312 --> 00:46:59,246
I just want you to
help me fix the dress.

1386
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:00,483
I don't want to
have this conversation.

1387
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,523
I just want to fix the dress.

1388
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:10,892
And chemo when you're 12 sucks.

1389
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:11,561
Yeah, it's gotta suck.

1390
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,297
I mean, 12 sucks in general,

1391
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,899
especially when you're a
girl That's when it happens.

1392
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,102
When what, when what happens?

1393
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,270
You start hating yourself.

1394
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:24,506
Ah, I can't believe
Gena isn't texting me back!

1395
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:25,505
Hey, you know what?

1396
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:26,440
I got an idea.

1397
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:27,342
Why don't you just relax?

1398
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:28,910
Put the phone away.

1399
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:30,411
Doesn't sound like your
friend needs you, anyway.

1400
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:31,412
No, this was a mistake.

1401
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,148
I gotta go.

1402
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,247
No-no-no-no.

1403
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:34,950
You're not going.
Stay. Come on.

1404
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:36,085
I want to hear about this.
Why do you start to hate yourself?

1405
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:39,553
'Cause, I, I don't know.

1406
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:40,422
Uh, you wouldn't understand

1407
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:44,092
Well, I think,

1408
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:45,028
I think you're unhappy

1409
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,260
and you have no reason to be,

1410
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:48,498
and that's what makes
you hate yourself.

1411
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:51,433
Let me guess, psych major.

1412
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,603
Psych major with a
lucrative advertising job.

1413
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,470
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1414
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,038
Belittle me.

1415
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,141
Is that what you
do to your boyfriend?

1416
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,509
Does that work for him?

1417
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,443
Not really.

1418
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,478
I shouldn't have brought it up.

1419
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,147
Yeah, but you did.

1420
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,048
So probably I would tell
you that you're beautiful

1421
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:09,516
and what you're doing with
retarded kids is amazing.

1422
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:10,219
They have cancer.

1423
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,219
Whatever.

1424
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,690
I like to compliment a woman
because she deserves it,

1425
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,190
not because
she needs attention.

1426
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,627
I don't need attention.

1427
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:20,729
Ooh, got off some steam there.

1428
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,461
You're mad.

1429
00:48:21,462 --> 00:48:22,329
I'm not mad.

1430
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,298
Are you kidding me?

1431
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:26,033
You're fucking livid.

1432
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,335
Oh, don't do that.

1433
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:29,336
Just want to give
you what you want.

1434
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,674
What do I want?

1435
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,478
You want somebody to
put you in your place.

1436
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:36,678
Where's that?

1437
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,113
Where do you want it?

1438
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:41,515
Ah! Harder!

1439
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:44,553
Uh, harder!

1440
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,489
Shut the Fuck Up
Shut the fuck up.

1441
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,325
Yeah, you shut the fuck up.

1442
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:57,232
Yeah, shut the fuck up cunt.

1443
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:02,303
Shit! Shit, shit.

1444
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:04,305
Fuck. Shit, shit.

1445
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:05,374
Hey.

1446
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,307
Hey, this is Becks.

1447
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:07,474
Can you come to my room?

1448
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:08,441
Oh yeah.
I'm not doing anything.

1449
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:09,610
We need to talk.

1450
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:10,711
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

1451
00:49:10,712 --> 00:49:11,612
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

1452
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:12,481
Okay.

1453
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,314
Okay.

1454
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:13,315
Bye.

1455
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,552
Bye.

1456
00:49:17,552 --> 00:49:19,257
Don't cum on my dress.

1457
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:22,125
I can't believe
we're doing this.

1458
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,559
I can't believe I
gave all my coke

1459
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,127
to your filthy stripper.

1460
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:28,329
Do me a favor and
don't mention that

1461
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,599
in your recap of the evening.

1462
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,533
Aw, that's my
favorite part, though.

1463
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:33,802
Clyde?

1464
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,169
Hey, Mom.

1465
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,405
I thought you
were at a wedding.

1466
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,040
You remember...?

1467
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,241
Gena?

1468
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,476
I don't think you've eaten

1469
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,676
since the last time I saw you.

1470
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:44,111
We need your help.

1471
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:45,112
Yeah.

1472
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:48,183
Oh my Lord.

1473
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:49,785
It's a really long story

1474
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,456
without much of a payoff, so...

1475
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:54,487
I've seen worse.

1476
00:49:54,488 --> 00:49:55,557
When do you need it?

1477
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:56,725
Three hours.

1478
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:59,593
It's a miracle you need, not me.

1479
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:02,262
Sheila, you made every
one of the costumes

1480
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:03,264
for all the schools plays

1481
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:06,100
and you made my prom
dress from scratch!

1482
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,672
You can do it.

1483
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:13,542
Clyde, make us some
coffee and food.

1484
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,342
Gena?

1485
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:15,243
Yeah?

1486
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:18,784
I'll get you some pants.

1487
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:25,157
Why are doors so heavy
in this place? Uh-oh.

1488
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,492
I don't think
this is your room.

1489
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,524
No, no.

1490
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:32,294
This is definitely my room.

1491
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,465
But somebody has moved
the furniture around.

1492
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,399
They put a pool right in
the middle of my room.

1493
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,376
This is fucking fantastic!

1494
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:48,478
Wait, are you coming?

1495
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,750
Yeah. I am.

1496
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,884
Oh!

1497
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:58,587
It's beautiful!

1498
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,788
You okay?

1499
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,323
It's beautiful.

1500
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,159
Moments like these, I think to myself,
my parents have no idea

1501
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:04,561
where I am right now.

1502
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:07,428
Ah.

1503
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:09,196
I'm so awake now.

1504
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,633
Watch me do a handstand!

1505
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,373
Be careful, it's
three feet deep.

1506
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:19,175
You're seriously making
pancakes right now?

1507
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,709
I am.

1508
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,612
Yours has a sad face made
out of chocolate chips,

1509
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:28,885
because the world is an asshole
and it's gonna get you.

1510
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:32,854
Why are you on your phone
at 4.30 in the a.m.?

1511
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:37,597
Don't worry about it, you know?

1512
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:46,901
And... I am totally tagging
you in that photo.

1513
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:49,840
You totally stalk me
online, don't you?

1514
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,777
Maybe.

1515
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:56,282
Sometimes.

1516
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,684
Weekly.

1517
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:02,884
Pervert.

1518
00:52:02,885 --> 00:52:04,886
Who are you calling?

1519
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:05,686
Who are you calling?

1520
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:06,789
You're so nosy.

1521
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,624
I'm calling my friend's dealer,
okay, so I can get some

1522
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,929
cocaine for tonight, so
I can make it through.

1523
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,596
Give me my phone back.

1524
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:16,931
Give it back to me.

1525
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,799
Give it to me.

1526
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,733
What are you doing?

1527
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:20,835
Why did you do that?!

1528
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:22,236
Oh my God!

1529
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:23,570
I can't believe that
you just did that!

1530
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,407
Believe it.

1531
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,308
Why did you do that?

1532
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,483
It's not cute anymore, Gen.

1533
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:48,931
Hey.

1534
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:51,436
What's up?

1535
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,840
I think we need to talk.

1536
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,344
I wanted to... Look, Beck...
What? What?

1537
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:03,277
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1538
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:04,449
Oh, no. You go first.

1539
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,751
I called you 'cause
I feel really bad

1540
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:11,251
about what happened earlier.

1541
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,388
I overreacted.

1542
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:16,725
Emotions were
running really high.

1543
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,292
You've been a trooper.

1544
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:20,496
And I know that this
Maid of Honor stuff

1545
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,796
must have been,like,
really hard for you.

1546
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:24,797
Yeah, but I'm really
happy for you.

1547
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,438
Regan.

1548
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,874
I shouldn't have
blown up like that.

1549
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,744
I mean, I wanted
to see the stripper

1550
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,278
go the full thing.

1551
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,312
Yeah.

1552
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:41,982
It would've been great to
see one more dick before,

1553
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:47,589
before I see Dale's for the
rest of my life, but...

1554
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,856
you've just done so much work

1555
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:50,960
for this wedding, just
put your own shit

1556
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,296
aside in order
to do everything.

1557
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,964
So..

1558
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:58,570
thank you.

1559
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,574
I have to pee.

1560
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:09,743
Oh, '94 talent show.

1561
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:12,647
Your leotards are phenomenal.

1562
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:13,449
I won that shit
every single year,

1563
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:15,049
right?

1564
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,418
Yeah, but '94 was special.

1565
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,919
That was the year
you got a bra.

1566
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,854
Which you stole.

1567
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:21,623
I could find it if
I looked for it.

1568
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:23,960
Please do not do that.

1569
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,998
You know what was
great about us?

1570
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,068
What?

1571
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,706
We were friends.

1572
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,943
Everyone else, they
had so much ...drama.

1573
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:42,079
But we were like...

1574
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:44,079
We were friends.

1575
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:45,680
Yeah.

1576
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:46,481
Yeah.

1577
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,050
What happened?

1578
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,789
I mean, I kinda needed you
to drive me that day.

1579
00:54:54,790 --> 00:55:00,030
I needed you to go with me
and you didn't show up.

1580
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,430
I couldn't.

1581
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:03,972
Why couldn't you?

1582
00:55:09,972 --> 00:55:11,719
I was too sad.

1583
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,019
This is awesome.

1584
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,756
Did I puke on you?

1585
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:30,158
No. Well, yeah.

1586
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,158
Not directly.

1587
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,160
You puked on Regan, though.

1588
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,662
Okay, once, I was so stoned,

1589
00:55:35,663 --> 00:55:36,032
I thought I was in an episode

1590
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,466
of 90210

1591
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,868
and I kept yelling, "Dylan!"

1592
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:42,504
That's fucking awesome.

1593
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,738
I got so fucked up
once off 'shrooms

1594
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:46,808
that I started a
fight club with my cats.

1595
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,076
Okay, okay.

1596
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:51,913
I once got so wrecked
that I woke up naked

1597
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:54,582
next to a hamburger
and I was like,

1598
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:55,985
did I just have
sex with a hamburger?

1599
00:55:56,985 --> 00:55:58,685
Good for that hamburger.

1600
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:02,055
Okay, once I slit my wrist
with a broken bottle.

1601
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:02,056
Holy shit.

1602
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:03,857
Yeah.

1603
00:56:03,858 --> 00:56:04,657
When did that happen?

1604
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:05,664
Like a year ago.

1605
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:11,567
I sh-shouldn't
have told you that.

1606
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,600
No, no.

1607
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:13,135
You can say stuff like that.

1608
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,601
No, no, I, it was an accident.

1609
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:17,706
I, really, I party too hard.

1610
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,706
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

1611
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:29,951
I'm sorry, that, I, I
shouldn't have done that.

1612
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:31,054
No.

1613
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:33,587
So, Genny, I think it's time

1614
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:34,954
we have a serious conversation.

1615
00:56:34,955 --> 00:56:35,960
You look different.

1616
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,197
I got you to smile.

1617
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:42,030
How many things

1618
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,967
do you need to show
me in your closet?

1619
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,935
This is getting
a little strange.

1620
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,669
Oh, wait a second.

1621
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,937
Oh my God.

1622
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:50,744
What is that?

1623
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:57,221
You are going to find out.

1624
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:09,524
Oh my God.

1625
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:13,828
#When I wake up#

1626
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:15,663
#well I know I'm gonna be#

1627
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:19,234
#I'm going be the man who
wakes up next to you#

1628
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,870
#when I go out,
Yeah I know I'm gonna be#

1629
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:26,573
#I'm gonn be the man
who goes along with you#

1630
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:29,012
#If I get drunk,
well I know I'm gonna be#

1631
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:31,947
#I'm gonna be the man who
get's drunk next to you#

1632
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,649
Can you turn this off

1633
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,152
#And if I haver,
hey I know I'm gonna be#

1634
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,555
Genny?

1635
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:42,958
#But I would walk 500 miles#

1636
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:47,861
Don't call me that Genny

1637
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:51,098
Nobody calls me that anymore, okay?
Don't.

1638
00:57:58,806 --> 00:58:00,274
Genny

1639
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:02,910
#I'm gonna be the man
who's working hard for you#

1640
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:08,116
#And when the money comes
in for the work I do#

1641
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,183
#I'll pass almost
every penny on to you#

1642
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:14,187
#When I come home,
Oh I know I'm gonna be#

1643
00:58:14,188 --> 00:58:17,692
#I'm gonna be the man
who come back home to you#

1644
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:21,095
#And if I grow old,
well I know I'm gonna be#

1645
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:25,133
#I'm gonna be the man
who's growing old with you#

1646
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,236
#But I would walk 500 miles#

1647
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:32,172
#And I would walk 500 more#

1648
00:58:32,173 --> 00:58:36,578
#Just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles#

1649
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,212
#To fall down at your door#

1650
00:58:39,213 --> 00:58:42,951
#Da d-da da, da d-da,
da d-da, da d-da#

1651
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,620
#Da-da-da dun-diddle
un-diddle un-diddle a dada#

1652
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:50,191
#Da d-da da, da d-da,
da d-da, da d-da#

1653
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,927
#Da-da-da dun-diddle
un-diddle un-diddle a dada#

1654
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:53,962
You know what?

1655
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,062
I'm so sorry.

1656
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:57,000
Um, w-what if

1657
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,134
we did this another night?

1658
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:01,301
Well, why?

1659
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:03,871
I just, my dick is really
cold right now and ...

1660
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:04,973
Come on.

1661
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,106
I'm giving you what you want,

1662
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:07,041
so let's just get it over with.
No, I... Katie, please.

1663
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:11,145
I just, I can't. I...
But why not?

1664
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,114
You're drunk and that's fine.

1665
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,647
You've been drunk all night

1666
00:59:13,648 --> 00:59:16,385
and I don't want y- I'm drunk,
there's drunk going on,

1667
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,752
and it just doesn't,

1668
00:59:17,753 --> 00:59:19,054
I don't like the way it's happened.
I'm so stupid.

1669
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:20,789
No, no, no.

1670
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,090
I like you s-Katie,
I like you so much.

1671
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:25,258
Then why don't you
want to have sex?

1672
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:26,325
Why don't you come
back with me?

1673
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:27,360
'Cause I like you.

1674
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:28,130
That's what I'm telling you.

1675
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,633
It does-this, this is,
this, hopefully, will...

1676
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,666
it just doesn't... I
don't like the way it's

1677
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:34,635
happened right now. It's not...

1678
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:36,168
But I'm just telling
you that I don't care.

1679
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:37,039
Katie, that's fine.

1680
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,172
I, I do, though.

1681
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:41,408
It's just, it's not fair to me.

1682
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:44,044
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

1683
00:59:44,045 --> 00:59:46,314
Do you even care that it's me?

1684
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:50,852
I mean, do you even know... Fuck

1685
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,927
Do you even know my name?

1686
00:59:58,927 --> 00:59:59,894
But wait, I do,

1687
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,268
Bob?

1688
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:09,005
Starts with a 'b'?

1689
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,104
You know what this is like?

1690
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:12,171
It's really just
like high school,

1691
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:15,176
but instead of French
homework, it's my dick.

1692
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,914
Well that's not true because
French was actually hard.

1693
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,887
[Hey, you've reached Gena.

1694
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:28,988
Oh my God, Gena.

1695
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:29,956
I'm freaking out.

1696
01:00:29,957 --> 01:00:30,891
I'm with Becky right now.

1697
01:00:30,892 --> 01:00:32,161
I don't know what to do!

1698
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,928
I-I-I can't do this anymore.

1699
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:35,929
Call me back.

1700
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:46,307
What are you doing?

1701
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,341
Nothing.

1702
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,111
I thought you'd stopped.

1703
01:00:50,112 --> 01:00:52,212
I haven't done
this in years, okay?

1704
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:55,183
I'm just stressed
out and I needed,

1705
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,783
I needed something for myself.

1706
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,925
And I needed to
feel better, okay?

1707
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,727
Remember when we'd
skip AP English class

1708
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,228
and hang out in the bathroom?

1709
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:10,997
We'd like bitch
out those smokers

1710
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:12,865
so that we could have
the really cool stall

1711
01:01:12,866 --> 01:01:13,503
at the end.

1712
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:17,306
The disabled toilet.

1713
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:20,908
Then we'd just
like talk and talk

1714
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:24,278
for like 90 minutes
the entire period.

1715
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:26,214
I really miss that.

1716
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,247
Just that.

1717
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:29,849
Like all day, I'd seriously
look forward to it.

1718
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:35,522
Then the Vice
Principal found us.

1719
01:01:35,523 --> 01:01:37,228
And she said she was
gonna tell your parents

1720
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:42,330
that you were
throwing up on purpose.

1721
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,399
And I said, "No, it was me.
I was, like, doing it.

1722
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,069
I, it was totally my problem.

1723
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,506
And then everyone found out

1724
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:54,442
and they were like "Eh, Becky.

1725
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:56,276
She can't even
throw up properly.

1726
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,278
She's so fat.

1727
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:58,313
Take a laxative!"

1728
01:01:59,947 --> 01:02:01,816
And then I was crying.

1729
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:03,350
And what did you say?

1730
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:06,956
I said, "Fuck everyone."

1731
01:02:07,956 --> 01:02:09,357
Yeah.

1732
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,957
You don't know how many times

1733
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:14,796
I've said that to myself And

1734
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,364
that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

1735
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,265
Becks?

1736
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:21,134
I need to tell you something.

1737
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:23,471
What?

1738
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,540
I did something terrible.

1739
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,244
Oh, what is it?

1740
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,879
What's going on?

1741
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,814
Is everything all right?

1742
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:34,948
Yeah.

1743
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:36,050
Well, hair and makeup is

1744
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:37,584
gonna be in your
room in an hour.

1745
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:41,122
So we need to get going, okay?

1746
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:43,124
Holy shit.

1747
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,059
It's time.

1748
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,227
It's time.

1749
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:50,931
Oh, it's time... It's time.

1750
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:52,576
Fuck my life.

1751
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:01,509
Oh.

1752
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,983
You still do that.

1753
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:09,481
Fuck!

1754
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:10,351
Wedding!

1755
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:11,356
Shit!

1756
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:16,402
Oh, dress!

1757
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:29,304
She's coming!

1758
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,904
Look alive, people.

1759
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:32,472
Oh, do you have a second?

1760
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:33,305
I'm on the phone.

1761
01:03:33,306 --> 01:03:34,175
Okay, but... the wedding dress?

1762
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:37,353
We can't find... Assholes.

1763
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:46,155
Okay.

1764
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:49,223
Jesus Christ, perv!

1765
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:50,356
What are you doing in here?

1766
01:03:50,357 --> 01:03:51,525
I was j-it's Katie.

1767
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:53,326
Oh, what now?

1768
01:03:53,327 --> 01:03:54,427
Sh-I'm a little worried.

1769
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,595
I came back here to...

1770
01:03:55,596 --> 01:03:56,929
she's locked herself
in the bathroom.

1771
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:57,900
I don't know what to do.

1772
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:58,966
Oh, great!

1773
01:03:58,967 --> 01:03:59,900
And I wasn't spying on you.

1774
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:02,136
They let me in 'cause I
was looking for Katie.

1775
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:03,405
Can someone get a Mimosa
ready for the bride?

1776
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,272
Sure.

1777
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,139
Time check?
7.10.

1778
01:04:05,907 --> 01:04:06,907
Good, great.

1779
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,010
It's probably fine,

1780
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:12,617
but it is just... she hasn't
been responding, and...

1781
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,484
Katie!

1782
01:04:17,485 --> 01:04:19,318
You can't lock yourself
in the bathroom

1783
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,556
when it isn't your wedding.

1784
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:22,590
Open this door.

1785
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:24,091
What do you think...how?

1786
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,090
You're a genius.

1787
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:27,294
Didn't you invent
iPads or something?

1788
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:29,369
Why does everyone
think I invented the iPad?

1789
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Keep trying this number

1790
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:40,644
until you get Gena.

1791
01:04:43,644 --> 01:04:44,416
Why is your face like that?

1792
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,151
Here she is! Yay!

1793
01:04:54,655 --> 01:04:56,724
I'm so excited, I
could kill myself.

1794
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,529
Oh, don't make any promises.

1795
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:04,332
You said that you would
clean it if I fixed it.

1796
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,737
I fixed it!

1797
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:10,237
She's still not answering?

1798
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:14,541
What is that?

1799
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:16,743
Ow!

1800
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:18,645
I was just about to go check.

1801
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:20,080
How 'bout some music?

1802
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:21,016
Yeah.

1803
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:24,385
Thanks,

1804
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:26,387
Well, what's going on in there?

1805
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,622
Maybe I should
call the front desk.

1806
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:29,690
Should I go in, do you think?

1807
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,994
No, she's got it under control.

1808
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:34,227
Knock it off!

1809
01:05:34,228 --> 01:05:35,362
We need to call a locksmith.

1810
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:36,729
No, she's being a fucking baby.

1811
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,731
I'm not gonna draw any
more attention to her.

1812
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:38,001
But knocking down the door?

1813
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,166
That's real fucking discreet.

1814
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,103
Regan?

1815
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,636
Oh, fuck me.

1816
01:05:42,637 --> 01:05:44,105
One second, Becks.

1817
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,474
If that bitch finds
out that that bitch

1818
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:48,109
is pulling some seventh
grade tantrum bullshit,

1819
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,110
we're dead.

1820
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,747
And I've lost
the wedding dress.

1821
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:53,547
Regan?

1822
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:54,749
No, I didn't.

1823
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,649
What is it?

1824
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,516
It's for you.

1825
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,217
I don't want any.

1826
01:05:58,218 --> 01:05:59,154
It's Gena.

1827
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,620
Move, move, move, move!

1828
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:01,521
Where the fuck are you?

1829
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:02,755
Where the hell is it?

1830
01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:03,722
Why aren't you
picking up your cell?

1831
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:06,093
I'm downstairs, it's
being dry-cleaned,

1832
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:07,030
and I threw it out a window.

1833
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,397
Dry-cleaned? How long?

1834
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,698
They said 40 minutes.

1835
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,332
Fine. Get a new phone.

1836
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,734
Okay. What? How?

1837
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:14,469
Regan?

1838
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:16,608
Steal one.

1839
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:20,640
Um, Regan.

1840
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:21,777
This isn't what I ordered.

1841
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,310
This isn't what she ordered!

1842
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:24,476
I said peonies.

1843
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:25,744
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1844
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:28,348
What is that?

1845
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:30,085
They're doing maintenance
in the bathroom.

1846
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,383
This hotel's disgusting.

1847
01:06:31,384 --> 01:06:33,088
Honey, I think those
roses are gorgeous.

1848
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,724
But it's just not... what
we planned, you know?

1849
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,259
Fuck this. You get peonies.

1850
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,392
Downstairs.

1851
01:06:39,393 --> 01:06:40,459
Centerpieces for the reception,

1852
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,530
take some peonies from there,

1853
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,733
new bouquet up here,
40 minutes.

1854
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:45,768
I love you.

1855
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:49,569
Relax!

1856
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,739
Are you excited?

1857
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,772
Oh my God, yes!

1858
01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:55,117
Ask them...

1859
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:04,151
Go make yourself useful.

1860
01:07:04,152 --> 01:07:05,659
Go pick some peonies!

1861
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:13,764
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1862
01:07:16,764 --> 01:07:20,503
Oh my...oooh, shit!

1863
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,636
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1864
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:27,207
Katie, you stupid
fucking idiot.

1865
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,414
Come in, shut the fuck...
oh my God.

1866
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:34,481
Just fucking go!

1867
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:35,184
She's on the floor.

1868
01:07:37,184 --> 01:07:39,153
Well, wrap her up!

1869
01:07:39,154 --> 01:07:40,287
Come on!

1870
01:07:40,288 --> 01:07:41,521
What did you do to her?

1871
01:07:41,522 --> 01:07:42,289
Nothing!

1872
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,389
We, I mean, we were
i-in the pool area ...

1873
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,525
Wrap her up! Wrap her up!

1874
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:46,726
I'm gonna get some water,

1875
01:07:46,727 --> 01:07:47,594
we're gonna sing
her her favorite song!

1876
01:07:47,595 --> 01:07:49,697
Well, shouldn't we,
like, get an ambulance?

1877
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,698
No. She does this
every weekend.

1878
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:53,466
Why is she in the bathtub?

1879
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:54,902
Well, isn't that what you do?

1880
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:57,769
No. Just pour the water
on her and sing the song.

1881
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:58,507
Like this.

1882
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,573
What song?

1883
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:04,561
#These dreams are...
#when I close my eyes.

1884
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:09,549
Every second of the night,
I live another life.

1885
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,483
Hurry the weddings in an hour.

1886
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:13,420
I, I really, I, I
need the dress.

1887
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:14,321
Now!

1888
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,356
They're working on it.

1889
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,689
I am going home.

1890
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,893
What's your name?

1891
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:19,627
Theresa.

1892
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:20,894
Theresa!

1893
01:08:20,895 --> 01:08:22,428
I know that you hate
me from yesterday.

1894
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:23,532
I hate fucking hate
me too from yesterday.

1895
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,200
Can we start fresh today?

1896
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:27,737
New leaf, please?

1897
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,438
Yeah, all right.

1898
01:08:30,438 --> 01:08:31,438
Really?

1899
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,872
You'll stay?

1900
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:34,408
I really have strong
feelings for you right now.

1901
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:35,576
Take it easy.

1902
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,945
#The further I'm
away, #further I'm away.

1903
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:39,746
#There's something out there...

1904
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:41,415
Why aren't you waking up?

1905
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,350
It is very
surprising at this point

1906
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:47,188
'cause your lips are
literally fucking blue, now.

1907
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,323
Okay, now I'm getting
really scared.

1908
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:49,755
Come on.

1909
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:50,656
Let's laugh about this.

1910
01:08:50,657 --> 01:08:51,493
When you passed out?
PLEASE WAKE UP!!!

1911
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
Come on.

1912
01:08:57,298 --> 01:08:58,098
Look!

1913
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,201
It's not fucked up anymore!

1914
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,501
It's a miracle!

1915
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:02,637
Yay!

1916
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:05,438
It's finally happening.

1917
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:05,439
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1918
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,308
Don't cry.

1919
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,575
we need the other bridesmaids.

1920
01:09:08,576 --> 01:09:09,810
Where are the other two girls?

1921
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:12,212
Uh, Gena and Katie
are on their way.

1922
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:13,412
Okay, and why don't we

1923
01:09:13,413 --> 01:09:14,347
get the bride in her
dress so we can...

1924
01:09:14,348 --> 01:09:16,585
Yeah, okay, yeah, that's
what I was gonna do.

1925
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:17,585
Yeah.

1926
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,385
I need to get my dress on.

1927
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:21,755
I need to get my dress on.

1928
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:23,323
Yes, very- I don't know.

1929
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:24,257
She was definitely breathing.

1930
01:09:24,258 --> 01:09:25,424
Why aren't you singing?

1931
01:09:25,425 --> 01:09:26,360
I'm on the phone
with the paramedics.

1932
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:27,861
She's always like this.

1933
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:28,697
What is this?

1934
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,230
It's Xanax.

1935
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:31,430
Trevor gave them to me.

1936
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:32,701
They must have
fallen out of my pocket.

1937
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:33,666
Trevor?

1938
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:34,933
Yes. Five-five minutes.

1939
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:35,902
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

1940
01:09:35,903 --> 01:09:36,005
It's Manhattan on Saturday.

1941
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:37,005
Five minutes is like
30 minutes.

1942
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,974
Get her out of the tub.

1943
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,244
Just a minute!

1944
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:44,811
Yeah?

1945
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:48,648
Um, we're just missing
Katie and Gena.

1946
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:49,616
I guess we found Katie.

1947
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:50,750
Why are you here?

1948
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:51,985
Becky's asking for her dress.

1949
01:09:51,986 --> 01:09:52,854
Do you, like, know where it is?

1950
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,886
With Gena.

1951
01:09:53,887 --> 01:09:55,256
Both will be here momentarily

1952
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:58,424
But the itinerary said that
we were supposed to...

1953
01:09:58,425 --> 01:09:59,491
Reviving a fucked-up bitch

1954
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:01,697
wasn't on the itinerary
either Cover for me.

1955
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:03,833
Okay.

1956
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:06,835
Give her to me.

1957
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,568
Okay.

1958
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:09,337
All right, Katie.

1959
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,670
Come on.

1960
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:12,371
What are you do...
you're hurting her!

1961
01:10:12,372 --> 01:10:13,408
I'm helping her.

1962
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,408
she can take it.

1963
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,978
There it is. Good job!

1964
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:19,580
Get it all out.

1965
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:23,416
Good job. Good job.

1966
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:26,319
Good job.

1967
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,688
Why would you ever
do that to yourself?

1968
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:30,061
I wanted to be beautiful.

1969
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:36,295
Thank you! Thank you!

1970
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:37,530
Where is Regan?

1971
01:10:37,531 --> 01:10:38,598
Let me fucking go.

1972
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:39,734
Oh, she's here.

1973
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,435
Regan, what's going on?

1974
01:10:42,436 --> 01:10:45,438
I just...
What is on your dress?

1975
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,541
Oh, I...sorry.

1976
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:49,443
Well, where is her dress?

1977
01:10:49,444 --> 01:10:51,745
Uh, it's being steamed.

1978
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:54,447
I-I can't leave here
without my dress.

1979
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:55,449
I don't believe this!

1980
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,050
Let's just...

1981
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:58,550
I don't know what's going on
with the steaming or whatever,

1982
01:10:58,551 --> 01:10:59,785
but I don't care.

1983
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:01,055
I want the dress right here,
on my daughter immediately.

1984
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:05,459
She can't wear the dress
in the car, Victoria Silk?

1985
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,094
Plus sitting in traffic?

1986
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,698
What does that equal?

1987
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:12,066
Sweat wrinkles.
Exactly, thank you Oh my God.

1988
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,666
You think of everything.

1989
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:15,036
That's why she's Maid of Honor.

1990
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,036
Let's go.

1991
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:20,074
Don't close your eyes.
Just talk to me now.

1992
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:21,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1993
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:22,942
What happened to her?

1994
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:23,778
I'm taking her to the hospital.

1995
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,877
What?

1996
01:11:24,878 --> 01:11:25,880
Somebody vomited
in the bathtub.

1997
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,980
She kinda o'd'ed on Xanaxes.

1998
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:28,848
You fucking...!

1999
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:29,615
They weren't mine!

2000
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:30,118
Whose? Whose?
Trevor!

2001
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,365
Trevor.

2002
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:45,432
What do you want?

2003
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,367
Wait. You actually...

2004
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:49,536
Car Five, are we ready? Good!

2005
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:51,139
You can't just barge in here like that.
Oh.

2006
01:11:51,706 --> 01:11:53,506
Hey.

2007
01:11:53,507 --> 01:11:55,142
Holy shit!

2008
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:56,011
What the fuck are you doing?

2009
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:58,978
Why the fuck did you do that?

2010
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:01,915
Ah! Come here.

2011
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:07,688
You motherfucker!

2012
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:08,720
It's me! It's me, it's me.

2013
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:09,755
Where are you?

2014
01:12:09,756 --> 01:12:10,822
We're getting into the car.

2015
01:12:10,823 --> 01:12:11,960
Okay, I'm on my way.

2016
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,460
All right. Meet me there, ese.

2017
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,130
Oh, God.

2018
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,868
Okay, let's get to the wedding.

2019
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,777
Fuck!

2020
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:29,675
Hey.

2021
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:30,743
How is she?

2022
01:12:30,744 --> 01:12:31,611
They're saying she's fine.

2023
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:32,646
You okay? You okay?

2024
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:34,981
Okay, I'll go, I'll go
with you to the hospital.

2025
01:12:34,982 --> 01:12:36,148
No, she wants us to
go to the wedding!

2026
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,583
She keeps saying
go to the wedding.

2027
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:38,918
They don't even have
to pump her stomach.

2028
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:39,686
They're just checking
her as a precaution.

2029
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:40,621
Really?

2030
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,853
Regan saved her life.

2031
01:12:41,854 --> 01:12:43,121
That woman is fucked
in the head, but...

2032
01:12:43,122 --> 01:12:44,091
She's a good friend.
Yeah, I know.

2033
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:45,992
Okay.

2034
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:46,661
I'll see you at the wedding!

2035
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:47,595
Okay.

2036
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,935
Taxi!

2037
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:56,670
Hey, Gena.

2038
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:57,738
I need to talk to you.

2039
01:12:57,739 --> 01:12:59,572
No. No. Clyde.

2040
01:12:59,573 --> 01:13:01,041
Get in the cab!

2041
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:01,042
Isn't that dress supposed to
be on the bride right now?

2042
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:03,880
Yes! Get in the car!

2043
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,681
Sir! S... I will suck your dick

2044
01:13:08,682 --> 01:13:09,818
if you get us
there in two minutes.

2045
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:12,518
Look, I... I think we might
be meant for each other.

2046
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:14,220
And I'm not kidding
Scratch that.

2047
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:14,221
This guy will suck your dick.

2048
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:17,757
Look, and it's not just
because we have like,

2049
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:19,627
the greatest sex I...whoa!

2050
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:20,760
Whoa!

2051
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,030
See, I, your body
looks so great.

2052
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,030
Shut up.

2053
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:25,532
I love your body so much.

2054
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:27,599
Oh my God, you cannot
just fuck things

2055
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,668
into being better.

2056
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:29,472
Then tell me what I should do.

2057
01:13:31,472 --> 01:13:33,206
I'm getting married.

2058
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:34,876
I'm getting married
in my pajamas.

2059
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,876
Honey, you've just
got to calm down.

2060
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:38,544
I don't think she's
got the dress.

2061
01:13:38,545 --> 01:13:40,481
Honey, just don't
pay any mind to it.

2062
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,148
It's all fucked up.

2063
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:44,118
I'm gonna walk in
wearing my pajamas

2064
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,719
like I'm fucking
Michael Jackson.

2065
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,988
It's like I've been
at a fucking concert

2066
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:49,888
for the past decade.

2067
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:50,725
A concert?

2068
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,991
Yeah, it's a, it's a metaphor.

2069
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:55,828
Okay? It's like I've been
at a concert... Okay.

2070
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:56,928
And I'm swaying back and forth

2071
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:57,729
and somebody
passes me something,

2072
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,733
and I drink it or smoke it...
Smoke it?

2073
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:02,103
...you know, it doesn't matter!
Shut up!

2074
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:03,805
I hate you!

2075
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,138
And I hate you!

2076
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:06,907
I hope you fucking die!

2077
01:14:06,908 --> 01:14:09,675
It's gonna be waiting
for us there, right?

2078
01:14:09,676 --> 01:14:11,277
I'm right about that,
aren't I, Regan,

2079
01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:12,514
so quiet in the back.

2080
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,081
Come on, Gena, you can do this.

2081
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,149
Take a left here.

2082
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,782
In the past 24 hours,

2083
01:14:16,783 --> 01:14:18,750
I've realized that I don't
even like the concert.

2084
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,818
I don't like the music.

2085
01:14:19,819 --> 01:14:20,952
I don't like the band.

2086
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:21,788
None of it.

2087
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:25,057
I-I... And like, maybe,
if I had just picked

2088
01:14:25,058 --> 01:14:26,226
a different fucking band,

2089
01:14:26,227 --> 01:14:29,763
maybe I woulda had a better
time at the concert.

2090
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:31,533
I really think I'm
in love with you.

2091
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,800
Oh my God, if you
take Park Avenue,

2092
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:36,305
I will fucking end
you I will end you!

2093
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:38,839
Of all the things you've done

2094
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,574
in the entire time
we've known each other,

2095
01:14:40,575 --> 01:14:42,041
this is the worst.

2096
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,577
You fucking blonde cunt!

2097
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:46,979
This is shit!

2098
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,080
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

2099
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:49,250
I saved the day!
I saved the day!

2100
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,184
Okay, okay.

2101
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:52,219
Let's do this!

2102
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,555
Okay. Okay.

2103
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:55,557
All right,
let's get this shit on.

2104
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:57,625
Now, put your arms up!

2105
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:58,961
Got it?

2106
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:01,698
let me get the veil,
so it doesn't...

2107
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:04,599
We got the dress!

2108
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,737
Yeah! Yeah! Heck yeah!

2109
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,339
Wa-wa-wa-wait-wait.

2110
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,942
What happened to it?

2111
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,011
What happened there?

2112
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:18,911
Tell me. Tell me!

2113
01:15:18,912 --> 01:15:20,980
It's just,
there's a little rip.

2114
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:22,049
The stitching.

2115
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,083
'Cause it ripped a little bit.
And that's just like a tin...

2116
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:27,821
like a little blood
and, and semen.

2117
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:29,221
What?

2118
01:15:29,222 --> 01:15:30,091
I don't know if it's semen.
It might be semen.

2119
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,291
you ruined it!

2120
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:32,357
Shh. It's okay.

2121
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:33,728
No, you don't see it. I swear.

2122
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:43,703
Oh fuck.

2123
01:15:43,704 --> 01:15:45,272
I can't do this.

2124
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:46,339
Rebecca Archer!

2125
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,607
You're going to walk down that

2126
01:15:47,608 --> 01:15:49,746
aisle and you are going to
marry the man down there.

2127
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:54,781
Everyone thinks I'm
too fat for him.

2128
01:15:54,782 --> 01:15:55,820
Fuck everyone!

2129
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,787
Right!

2130
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:03,657
Fuck everyone!

2131
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:04,824
Yeah! Fuck everyone!

2132
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:05,027
I like ice cream!

2133
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:08,761
Fuck everyone!

2134
01:16:08,762 --> 01:16:09,296
Yes!

2135
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:10,335
Okay. Flowers.

2136
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:16,702
You're beautiful.

2137
01:16:16,703 --> 01:16:18,677
Give me a hug.

2138
01:16:23,677 --> 01:16:25,946
Wait, uh, you go-going?

2139
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:27,346
No. I have vomit on me.

2140
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:29,394
Okay. Right. Okay.

2141
01:17:15,095 --> 01:17:16,698
I would like to close this
ceremony with a blessing.

2142
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:20,233
But it is as timeless and
enduring as love itself.

2143
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,335
Now you will feel no cold,

2144
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:25,304
for each of you will
be warm to the other.

2145
01:17:25,305 --> 01:17:27,974
Now you will feel no loneliness,

2146
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:31,211
for each of you will be
a companion... Wait.

2147
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:33,212
Are you crying?

2148
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:35,247
Come on.

2149
01:17:35,248 --> 01:17:37,854
You haven't cried since Thomas J.
Died in My Girl.

2150
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:41,154
It's a perfect wedding.

2151
01:17:48,462 --> 01:17:49,773
Are we gonna be okay, you guys?

2152
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:01,774
Let's toast to something, okay?

2153
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:02,510
All right.

2154
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,876
What should we drink to?

2155
01:18:03,877 --> 01:18:05,278
To the EMT crew.

2156
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:06,247
Sure.

2157
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:10,416
To never doing any
of that ever again.

2158
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:11,822
Cheers.

2159
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:17,057
Oh, fuck it, let's
just get a drink.

2160
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:17,857
Yes!

2161
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,364
How, how are you
feeling...I mean,

2162
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,398
you drank quite a bit.

2163
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:28,268
I really like you a lot.

2164
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:30,804
Well, I like you too.

2165
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:32,172
But I don't know what to do

2166
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:33,874
when I'm around
somebody I like,

2167
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:38,344
except for sleep with
them or get really drunk.

2168
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:40,913
I-I mean, you can
just be nice to them.

2169
01:18:40,914 --> 01:18:42,550
I'll be nice to you,
you be nice to me.

2170
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,550
Really?

2171
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:45,117
that's what people do, yeah.

2172
01:18:45,118 --> 01:18:46,885
Thank you for letting
me copy your homework.

2173
01:18:46,886 --> 01:18:47,021
You're welcome.

2174
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:49,990
Thank you for,
for not dying today.

2175
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,191
Mm.

2176
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:52,126
It's kinda blowing my mind.

2177
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,528
I feel like, like for
the last decade,

2178
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:58,531
I've been at like, at a concert.
Right? Just kinda...

2179
01:18:58,532 --> 01:19:00,467
Oh please take your
self- actualization

2180
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:01,934
somewhere else.

2181
01:19:01,935 --> 01:19:03,235
I'm trying to sleep.

2182
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,880
Oh, hey, you guys.

2183
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,478
Hello.

2184
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:14,548
Is this working?

2185
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,849
Uh, testing, testing, testing.

2186
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,286
Sibilance, sibilance.

2187
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,188
Tom Hanks,SNL.

2188
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:24,357
Um, uh, Becky and Dale.

2189
01:19:24,358 --> 01:19:27,493
Such a beautiful wedding.

2190
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:32,898
Yeah. A gorgeous wedding.

2191
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:34,335
I think we all felt
like stars tonight

2192
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:38,604
in the sky of your love Yeah!

2193
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:41,507
So, Dale, you said something
to me last night.

2194
01:19:41,508 --> 01:19:43,442
You said that when you
find the right girl...

2195
01:19:43,443 --> 01:19:44,878
Did you go out last night?

2196
01:19:44,879 --> 01:19:48,514
When you, when
you got it uh, good,

2197
01:19:48,515 --> 01:19:52,219
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

2198
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:57,556
But for some people, um,
and I'm one of them,

2199
01:19:57,557 --> 01:19:59,392
I think you have to screw it up

2200
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:03,095
uh, before you realize
that you've got it good.

2201
01:20:03,096 --> 01:20:05,898
I-I I'm just excited
because Gena and I,

2202
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,334
we had sex last night.

2203
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,468
What the fuck?

2204
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:09,968
We did, but like
who cares, right?

2205
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:10,604
I-I can say that.

2206
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,205
Can I say that?

2207
01:20:12,206 --> 01:20:16,943
But the thing is, is when
we're having sex, it's fine,

2208
01:20:16,944 --> 01:20:23,416
I put my penis uh, into um,
Gena's vagina... Please.

2209
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:25,385
And then I took it out.

2210
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:28,487
And then I, I put it in again.

2211
01:20:28,488 --> 01:20:29,788
And then I took it out.

2212
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:33,359
And then it just kinda went
on like that for a while.

2213
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,595
And I, what I realized

2214
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:37,197
was I wanted to
just keep doing that

2215
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,233
for the rest of my life.

2216
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:44,437
That's kinda where
I am at right now.

2217
01:20:44,438 --> 01:20:45,907
Uh, but that's not the only
reason I'm up here.

2218
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:52,178
I'm also um, here to,

2219
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:55,515
When I wake up,
well you know I'm gonna be,

2220
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:59,251
I'm gonna be the man who
wakes up next to you.

2221
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:00,586
Stop it! Stop it!

2222
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:03,555
When I get out, well
you know I'm gonna be,

2223
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:07,161
I'm gonna be the man who...
yeah, really? Okay.

2224
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,395
No, I can't sing.

2225
01:21:09,396 --> 01:21:11,464
But you understand what
I was trying to do?

2226
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:13,066
Yeah.

2227
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,299
Yeah? All right.

2228
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,403
Well, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna pass it off...

2229
01:21:21,641 --> 01:21:24,978
#When I wake up, well
I know I'm gonna be...#

2230
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:26,446

2231

#I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you.#

2232

2235
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:43,529
