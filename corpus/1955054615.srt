00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,282
I know you've gotten attached
to Beethoven. I mean, we all have.

178
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,454
But I just don't think
there's enough room in this household...

179
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,456

for a dog like Beethoven.</i>

183

Sorry, Mom. Time's up.

184
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:37,054
I guess that concludes the family meeting!

185
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,686
I love these intimate family gatherings.

SARA: What do you think Mom meant
by the house not being big enough?

187
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:53,862
BRENNAN: Well, I think it means she's
thinking about getting rid of Beethoven.

188

<i>Come on. Get over it.
I mean, he's not even our real dog anyway.</i>

189
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,536
I know. You don't have to remind me.

190
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,582
Maybe now's a good time
to hit 'em up for a new pet.

191
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,251
Something a little smaller, like a cow?

SARA: I wish we brought Beethoven.
BRENNAN: Oh, no, the gate.

195
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,602
BRENNAN: Beethoven!
SARA: Beethoven, help!

196
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,781
Brennan! What do we do?

197
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,620
Look.

201

BRENNAN: Okay, okay. Give me a couple
of days, and I'll think of something.

202
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:15,485
That's okay. I was finished.

203
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,239
Guess what, Sara.
I'm about to put the cookies in the oven.

204
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:24,076

RICHARD: Oh, no!

207
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,335
Who let the dog in?

208

You're not helping your case here, pal.

SARA: So, did you think of a plan?

211
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,107
It's only been three days. Give me a break.

212
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,277
Besides, I'm really behind
on my math homework.

213
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,113
I knew you wouldn't have a plan.

214
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:03,490
So, here, I do have a plan.

BETH: Beethoven!
BRENNAN: Oh, no!

00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:33,270
Beethoven barfed all over me!

How gross is that?

223
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:42,070
Okay, my math homework, one semester.

224
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,365
A whole semester? Forget it, then.

225
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,913
Fine. See you, Beethoven.

226
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,917

That's fabulous. All right.

230
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,760
I'll let you know. Okay.

231

-They gonna take him?
-Well, if we want to.

232
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,600
They're really gonna miss him.

233
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,352
He was never gonna be able
to stay with us forever.

234

-Sooner or later, they'll have to miss him.
-I guess.

Beethoven will have chickens to chase...</i>

00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,619
He'll be in heaven.

240
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,458
You're right, as usual.

241
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,043

So, I suppose you're looking for Richard.

Well, I think I might be able to find him...

251

...for you around here somewhere.

252
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,126
So, I'll do that.

Why? Richard!

he was coming next week.

remember the stall-your-boss part.

1039
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,196
Madison, I'm sure the agents will find him.

1040
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:26,866
You don't even really care.

1041
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,786
He's just some investment to you.

1042
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,913
I heard you tell Daddy.

1043
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:37,127
<i>Michelangelo loves me more
than anybody else in the world.</i>

1044
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,047
Maybe even more than you.

1045
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,883
Madison, that's not true.

[Slow instrumental music]

1047
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,810
It's just that we've forgotten
how to show it.

1048
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,666
Michelangelo?

1049
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,543
Michelangelo!

1050
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,363
May I have the leash for him?

1051
01:28:50,741 --> 01:28:55,454
"What is it about this dog," you may ask,
"that merits this honor?"

1052
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:02,378
I can sum it up in one word. A: discipline.

1053
01:29:03,712 --> 01:29:05,840
<i>Two: obedience.</i>

1054
01:29:07,716 --> 01:29:10,594
<i>And D:</i>

1055
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:15,599
Overlooking any temptations
that may pass right in front of his nose.

1056
01:29:16,725 --> 01:29:19,186
-Sgt. Rutledge--
-At ease, son. I'm on a roll.

1057
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,271
-But I got--
-Just--

1058
01:29:22,314 --> 01:29:23,565
RUTLEDGE: Just remember.

1059
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:27,403
Until your dog is properly trained, never...

1060
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:30,155
...let go of the leash.

1061

[Rutledge screams]

1062
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:40,499
Beethoven!

1063
01:29:43,418 --> 01:29:46,797
His old self again.
What a card this'll make.

1064
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,966
That's our dog!

1065
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:51,134
<i>Beethoven!</i>

1066
01:30:08,026 --> 01:30:09,111
No.
