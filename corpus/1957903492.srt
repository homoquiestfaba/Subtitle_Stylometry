1
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,101
Do you think we got it?

2
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,802
Yeah.

3
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,839
- Yeah, we got it.
- Awesome!

4
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,387
- We got it.
- It means I can do this.

5
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,577
Jack, this cake is a miracle.

6
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,913
The rule is you take a photo,
I take a photo.

7
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,116
Except the difference
is my photo will be good.

8
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,350
No.

9
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:52,796
I'll have my mouth hanging open,
or one eye shut.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
But, Jen, you look great!

11
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,455
She hates
seeing pictures of herself.

12
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,691
It's the visual equivalent
of the sound of my own voice.

13
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,362
Okay, thanks for that.

14
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,431
That's good for my ego.

15
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,199
I got to get to the store.

16
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,846
Jack, thank you so much
for loaning us your space,

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,003
and your Yule log is glorious...

18
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,104
I could post a photo,

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,005
maybe it'll drive
a little business.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,473
Well, it's my pleasure,

21
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,019
and the least I can do
after you decorated the bakery.

22
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,010
It looks amazing in here.

23
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,612
And for your sister.

24
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,714
She's gonna be overjoyed.

25
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,350
That cake will be long gone
by the time Jen gets to Ali.

26
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,684
Unsupervised, not my fault.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I don't blame you.

28
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,121
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!

29
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:30,157
Bye-bye!

30
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,560
You want to do
something tonight?

31
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:38,164
I was thinking pizza
and holiday-movie marathon?

32
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,632
As much as I would love to see

33
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,501
the riveting tale of how
a postman becomes Santa Claus...

34
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,803
We could watch something else.

35
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,671
You say that,
but it never happens.

36
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,784
And I'm gonna be
in Portland tonight, anyway.

37
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:47,907
Okay.

38
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,375
I'm shooting a spread
for Buzzyfood.

39
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,677
I know. I know.

40
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,845
You love Buzzyfood.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,146
Judge me all you want.

42
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,681
Whatever.

43
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,361
I just did this quiz to tell me
which holiday cookie I am.

44
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,751
No, hold on.
All right, all right.

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,854
Okay, don't tell me...

46
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:02,889
peanut-butter cookie.

47
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,357
Liked by many, but...

48
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,827
...a tad nutty.

49
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:08,972
It's terrifying
that you know that.

50
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:09,996
How did you know that?

51
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,264
I know you.

52
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,165
You wanna know
which one you are?

53
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,333
Yeah, come on.

54
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,368
You're a sugar cookie.

55
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,581
The old reliable standby,
really?

56
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,938
Yeah...

57
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,506
You're sweet, you smell good,

58
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,607
and everybody loves you.

59
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,688
But when I'm right, I'm right.
Right?

60
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,045
You might be...

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,758
if I took quizzes to tell me
what kind of food I was,

62
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:28,914
but I don't.

63
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,182
That's really more of

64
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,495
a peanut-butter-cookie
personality trait, so...

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,751
You're above that, huh?

66
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,220
A little bit.

67
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,055
- Sugar cookies are.
- Have a great trip.

68
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,568
Sorry.

69
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,369
Reed just fell asleep.

70
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,260
Brad and I were up
all night with him...

71
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,617
and I mean...

72
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,454
...all night.

73
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,489
This'll help.

74
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,157
- Sugar!
- Yeah.

75
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,205
Hey, did you see the photos
Max took of the bakery?

76
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,829
Yeah, they looked amazing!

77
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,497
I was thinking for a hashtag,

78
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:23,235
how about #YuleBeSorry?

79
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:26,238
Aggressively cheesy,
but you always get it right.

80
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,439
I'll do the decor stuff.

81
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,475
Pithy hashtags...
all you.

82
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,912
And by pithy hashtags,
you mean marketing?

83
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,114
And, what? Financials?
And legal? And...

84
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,460
Can we not, like,
get in the weeds on...

85
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,995
- ...inventory?
- ...on the... on our roles?

86
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:38,951
- Okay then.
- Love you.

87
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,486
- I'll post it.
- Thanks.

88
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,689
- My gosh, Jen!
- What?

89
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,435
Have you seen
what HyggeAtHome posted today?

90
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,760
- No, why?
- Come here right now.

91
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:48,961
Okay.

92
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,365
<i>Happy holidays, Hygges.</i>

93
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,934
<i>- Zoe...
- ...and Charlie here.</i>

94
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,246
<i>We're doing something
a little different</i>

95
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,336
<i>this holiday season.</i>

96
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,704
We know
the HyggeAtHome community

97
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,839
has so many talented
designers and decorators,

98
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,641
and we want to see
what you've got.

99
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,642
So we're hosting a campaign.

100
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,010
<i>For this first round,</i>

101
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:06,046
<i>all you have to do</i>

102
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,046
<i>is upload a video</i>

103
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,347
<i>telling us about you</i>

104
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,660
<i>and how you make
your family holiday</i>

105
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:10,950
<i>look perfect.</i>

106
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,385
Then tag it
with both @HyggeAtHome

107
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,287
and the hashtag
for your holiday.

108
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,989
We'll narrow it down
to 20 finalists,

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,357
then 10, then three.

110
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,725
<i>With one lucky winner</i>

111
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,394
<i>receiving a brand crossover
with us,</i>

112
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,129
<i>a year of monthly spreads
in our magazine,</i>

113
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,131
being featured
in our social platforms,

114
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,667
and working as
a resident designer

115
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,703
for HyggeAtHome.

116
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,136
<i>So post those videos</i>

117
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,339
<i>and let's see
your perfect Hygge Holidays.</i>

118
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,955
- Jen, you have to do it!
- I'm not doing that.

119
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,145
I belong behind the camera.

120
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,213
Their whole campaign

121
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,182
is, like, the "perfect holiday",

122
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:47,186
and my entire brand
is not perfect.

123
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,354
And, still beautiful.

124
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,001
And that is exactly
why they will love you,

125
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,425
because you have
a fresh perspective.

126
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,494
Okay, we could submit
a video of the store...

127
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,529
or my decor.

128
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,730
They want a face.

129
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:58,931
They want a story.

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,177
You've got a face and a story.

131
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,433
You do it.

132
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,835
Yeah, I've got a face

133
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,736
that tells a story of not having
slept in six months

134
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,771
because I have a baby.

135
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm not doing it.

136
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,509
I'm not the influencer here.

137
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,112
Jen, look, you've been
obsessed with Hygge forever.

138
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,580
I know.

139
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,655
And imagine if you won.
It would launch your career.

140
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,261
It would be amazing
for the store.

141
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,997
And, the bigger we get,
the bigger our costs.

142
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,365
We, kind of, need something
to keep ahead.

143
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,788
All right.

144
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,723
We've got
the big Christmas sale,

145
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,291
and then there's the...

146
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,693
the stand at the market.

147
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,772
And there's two weeks
'til Christmas,

148
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,030
so people still have
time to shop.

149
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,865
And our numbers
are gonna skyrocket.

150
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,066
I promise.

151
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,037
We need customers.

152
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,393
Is that my fairy godmother,

153
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,228
come to make
all my wishes come true?

154
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,598
Maybe.

155
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,968
Found a peanut-butter cookie
at a bakery in Portland, and...

156
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,503
yeah, I couldn't help myself.

157
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,971
You're lovely, thank you.

158
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:13,972
My pleasure.

159
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,274
How was the shoot?

160
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,775
- It was good.
- Yeah?

161
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,812
It was a "twist on
Christmas dinner set-up"?

162
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,246
What was the twist?

163
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,315
Everything was made
with microwaveable finger food.

164
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,650
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

165
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,118
A lot of pizza rolls.
It was good.

166
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm on board.
Not proud of it, but on board.

167
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,188
It's okay.

168
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,496
Do want to stay, watch a movie?

169
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,927
Is this hour five
of you watching a fireplace?

170
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,328
Okay, never mind.

171
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,630
I was gonna decorate
the baby tree for Reed's room,

172
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,666
give it to Ali and Brad.

173
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,634
Baby tree
means baby candy canes.

174
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,702
Yeah. Jen, let's do it.

175
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,637
Awesome.

176
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:48,340
Hey, are you still okay
to come to the store on sale day

177
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,341
and take pictures?

178
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,676
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

179
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,711
Thank you.

180
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,693
- That's for you, right there.
- Thank you.

181
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,456
Well, there's a sugar cookie
in here, too.

182
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,384
Yeah, that one's for you, too.

183
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,689
Thank you.

184
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,459
This is truly the epitome
of the Christmas spirit.

185
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,560
It's terrifying.

186
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,011
You...

187
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,046
you don't have to do that,
Reed is with Brad today.

188
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,316
Did you get any sleep?

189
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,417
Thank you.

190
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,685
What does it look like?

191
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,087
I mean...

192
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,689
But, being up all night

193
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:38,725
gave me a lot of time

194
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,119
to think about
that Hygge campaign.

195
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,672
The deadline to submit
a video is tonight.

196
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,508
Then we should submit the video,
just not of my face.

197
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,331
Okay?

198
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay, new topic.

199
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,795
What do you wanna do
for Christmas?

200
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,372
Anything we want,

201
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,275
because Mom's going
to be in the Bahamas.

202
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,410
Because you wouldn't commit
to plans with her.

203
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,878
I didn't know my schedule.

204
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,448
Jen, every year,
you avoid Christmas with Mom.

205
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,383
Sometimes, you don't know
your schedule,

206
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,784
sometimes, you go away,

207
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,097
sometimes, you're suddenly sick.

208
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,520
I know, but here...

209
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,389
I'm here,
ready for the festivities,

210
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,890
so what do you wanna do?

211
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,261
Honestly,

212
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,175
split some Chinese food
on Christmas Eve sounds amazing.

213
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,032
That sounds magical.

214
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,600
But it's Reed's first Christmas.

215
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,779
Do you wanna have,
like, photo regret.

216
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:23,769
What about the photo ops?

217
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,437
Well, you and Max
can do photo ops.

218
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,206
That's not...

219
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,241
That's not a bad idea.

220
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,210
We are open.

221
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,277
Are you ready

222
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,245
for the biggest sale day
of the year?

223
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,214
I hope so.

224
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,764
Thank you very much.
Have a great Christmas.

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,899
And don't forget to tag us.

226
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,302
Happy Holidays.

227
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,838
Deb... it is so good to see you.

228
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,073
Thank you for being here.

229
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,744
Hey!

230
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,890
Thank goodness, you're here!

231
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,180
- It's busy.
- Yeah!

232
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,348
Do you still want photos,

233
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,349
or do you need help
on the floor?

234
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,283
I could really use the help.

235
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,284
I got it.

236
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,319
You're the best.

237
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,193
Say "Dada".

238
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:23,862
Say "Da-da."

239
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,765
Reed, say "Mama".
Say "Ma-Ma."

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,133
Say "Auntie Jen".

241
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,168
"Auntie Jen".
Do it.

242
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:31,371
Okay, I'm finished.

243
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,306
Verdict?

244
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,774
It was a good day of sales,

245
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,649
it's just not enough
to keep us out of the red.

246
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,323
Don't worry,
it's your first year.

247
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,347
Second.

248
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,547
Rounding down.

249
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,815
Thank you.

250
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,851
What are we doing wrong?

251
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,618
You guys have
a good thing going.

252
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,288
Jen, you're
an amazing decorator.

253
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,822
But, it's like
Ali's been saying,

254
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,003
you know, brick and mortar...
it's just not enough anymore.

255
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,326
You need more eyeballs on you,

256
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,695
a bigger digital presence.

257
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,996
Well, the store has a page,

258
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,752
it just doesn't have
a lot of followers yet.

259
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,801
You know,
the HyggeAtHome campaign

260
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,869
would take care of that.

261
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,070
Exactly.

262
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,184
Okay, I see it all the time
with clients I consult.

263
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,841
Exposure from a major brand

264
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,637
takes your online presence
to the next level.

265
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,745
See?

266
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,858
All you have to do
is make a video.

267
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,081
People are gonna love you.

268
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,685
Except that they won't!

269
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,190
Okay...

270
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,225
let's get you cleaned up.

271
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,527
Yeah.

272
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:36,902
What's the deal?

273
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,003
Why are you so upset?

274
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,038
I'm not upset.

275
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,384
You keep saying they'll like me,

276
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,607
and they won't like me.

277
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,376
This contest is not
for people like me.

278
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,922
Except that it's
for decorators and designers,

279
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,079
and isn't that you?

280
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,514
Yeah, but there's
this whole package thing.

281
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,916
You gotta have all the pieces.

282
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,284
There's...

283
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,886
First, you have to be
a runway model.

284
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,556
Then a husband,
preferably with a man-bun.

285
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,124
Children you could
introduce to royalty

286
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,926
without being
horribly embarrassed.

287
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,295
And you need to have
100,000 followers

288
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,874
that HyggeAtHome
can turn into subscribers.

289
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,299
Okay, or maybe they want you,

290
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,568
and you just have
to believe in yourself.

291
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,704
They don't want Jen.

292
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,039
Have you met me?

293
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,242
They want "Jen T:
successful business woman".

294
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,610
They want aspirational,

295
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,611
inspirational...

296
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,879
unobtainable.

297
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,150
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:28,120
So, if you don't want
to do it as Jen...

299
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,888
do it as "Jen T".

300
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,757
Look, we can still make it
our brand.

301
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,793
We can show that even "Jen T"
doesn't have it all figured out.

302
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,171
What have you got to lose?

303
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,634
Get a few followers.
Make a few sales.

304
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,969
Do it as a joke.

305
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,181
Yeah, but where am I gonna get
a husband and a baby?

306
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,678
You're so cute.

307
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,900
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, it's not a big deal.

308
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,791
- Okay.
- All right.

309
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,903
Max, just pretend
you're really good-looking,

310
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,927
and remember
to hit those angles.

311
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,273
How do you know
if you're doing that?

312
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,808
Your chest hurts
and you feel like an idiot.

313
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,964
Yeah.

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,699
I'm definitely
hitting my angles.

315
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,435
All right.

316
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,269
And go.

317
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,870
Hi, I'm Jen T,

318
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,106
owner of "Jen-uine Decor"
in Astoria, Oregon.

319
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,275
I am a wife, a mother,
a decorator,

320
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,845
but I am not afraid to admit
that I'm a complete mess.

321
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,346
Now, I'm very lucky.

322
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,781
I married the man of my dreams,

323
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,528
and our child could double
for the Gerber baby,

324
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,329
but it doesn't mean that
there aren't sleepless nights,

325
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,353
bickering over dishes,

326
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,887
and 2:00 a.m. doom-spiraling.

327
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,290
There's plenty
of doom-spiraling.

328
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,157
The thing is,

329
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,392
I'm not here to pretend

330
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,461
that our life or our holidays
are flawless,

331
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,863
because everybody knows
that they're not.

332
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,465
Life is not a highlight reel.

333
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,866
Exactly.

334
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,468
And part of the human experience

335
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,069
is being flawed,

336
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,282
and that's what makes it
beautiful,

337
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,039
especially during the holidays.

338
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,675
So, we choose to bless this mess

339
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,009
and keep it real,

340
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:58,877
because over here,

341
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,879
we are "Jen-uine".

342
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,681
Merry Christmas from me, Jen T.

343
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,249
And loving husband me, Max.

344
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,750
And little baby,
Leo Ansel, here.

345
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,667
Okay, you can delete that now.

346
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,224
What was that?

347
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,725
That was "Jen T",

348
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,926
and, apparently,

349
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,139
she's a social media
babble generator.

350
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,697
And our son is now Leo?

351
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,499
Excuse me, Leo Ansel.

352
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,901
Leo was inspired
by her star chart.

353
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,569
And Ansel's
his favorite photographer.

354
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,505
His too.

355
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,672
Sweetie.

356
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,374
Okay, that was
relatively painless.

357
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,709
I'm gonna go.

358
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:31,744
All right, and...

359
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,512
posted: @JenuinelyJenT!

361
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,252
Very silly.
Luckily, no one will see it.

362
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,253
Bye, hubby.

363
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,621
Later, wife-o.

364
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,622
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye.

365
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,723
Love you guys.

366
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,401
How's the campaign going?

367
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,203
I finally let
the social team go home,

368
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,938
but submissions keep pouring in.

369
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,473
Anything stand out?

370
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,975
A few so far,

371
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,755
but mainly people waxing
about their perfect families.

372
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,146
But an interesting one
just got posted.

373
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,915
A decorator in Oregon.

374
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,449
Great.

375
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,152
So, are you finishing up?

376
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,287
No, I'm going to be late.

377
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,802
I have to pick
the last few finalists.

378
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,258
Then I guess
I'll see you at home.

379
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,663
All right, goodnight.

380
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,465
Goodnight.

381
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,982
You're one of the 20 finalists!

382
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,517
No, "Jen T"
is one of the 20 finalists!

383
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,986
May I remind you

384
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,120
that we got there

385
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,199
by making a fake video
about being real,

386
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,543
which is getting
really confusing.

387
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,461
Okay, but what is fake
and real, really?

388
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,641
You wanna know
what's really "real"?

389
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:32,809
The followers
of our store's page

390
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,166
quadrupled overnight,

391
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,737
and we made $2000 in sales
while we were sleeping.

392
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,706
- Really?
- Yeah.

393
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,876
Jen, HyggeAtHome
has an incredible reach.

394
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,478
This could be a game changer.

395
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:51,650
And all we have to do
is make one more video.

396
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,386
And the prompt is "Hygge Host".

397
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,531
So, they just wanna know
about you...

398
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,855
your background.

399
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,067
I can't make another
fake video, it's not right.

400
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,858
I can't do it, nope.

401
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,192
Nope.

402
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,327
Okay...

403
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,263
Well, what if...

404
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,732
What if we make it
to the final ten?

405
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,668
Look, we need this.

406
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:10,835
Without a big push,

407
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,504
this business doesn't last
another year.

408
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,940
And, like, not to lay on
the guilt even thicker,

409
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:20,111
but I left a really secure
corporate job

410
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
to help you build your brand.

411
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,748
Is this you
not laying on the guilt?

412
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,216
'Cause you're doing it wrong.

413
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,284
Listen...

414
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,287
...we make one more video.

415
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,755
You know,
get a few more followers,

416
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,757
make a little bit of a buzz...

417
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,059
that's it.

418
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,360
And then, in a week from now,

419
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,128
this is just
a really, really funny story.

420
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,198
What do you say?

421
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,771
Hashtag XMAS!

422
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,076
Come on, honey.

423
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,078
We have to hurry
or we're gonna miss the flight.

424
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,980
<i>I'm a wife, a mother,
a decorator,</i>

425
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,126
<i>- but I am not afraid...</i>
- Oh, my goodness!

426
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,484
<i>To admit
that I'm a complete mess.</i>

427
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,819
<i>Now, I'm very lucky.</i>

428
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,420
<i>I married
the man of my dreams...</i>

429
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,456
Jen had a baby!

430
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,456
<i>...and have a little baby.</i>

431
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,058
How? I just saw her
last year!

432
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,895
Maybe they adopted.

433
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,442
Adopted a baby
that looks just like Reed?

434
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,966
The cousins could be twins!

435
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,468
And she married Max...

436
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,269
not that I didn't
see that coming.

437
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,505
But we didn't get
an invitation to the wedding!

438
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,807
I'm just playing
devil's advocate here,

439
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,075
but, you know,

440
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,744
you didn't invite her
to our wedding.

441
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,613
Because we eloped!

442
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,515
And Jen made it very clear,

443
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,916
after the last two,

444
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,085
that she didn't want to attend
another one.

445
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,621
Liz, honey, try to calm down.

446
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,425
Or do your thing.

447
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,960
I...

448
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,362
I'm just sure that there's
a reasonable explanation here.

449
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,631
There is
a reasonable explanation...

450
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,766
Jen just doesn't like me.

451
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,100
No.

452
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,168
Honey, no, no.

453
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,836
She doesn't not...

454
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,304
not like you,

455
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,141
she's just taking some space.

456
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,878
Enough space to get married

457
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,514
and have a baby
without telling me?

458
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,283
How much space is that, Pete?

459
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,518
Outer space?

460
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,354
Honey, you're right.

461
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,124
I just think that you should
respect her wishes.

462
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,060
You're right.

463
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,228
I will.

464
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,164
I will respect her,

465
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,467
and show her just how valuable
I am to her life.

466
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,546
That's not quite
what I had in mind.

467
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,069
Oh, but I will.

468
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,172
Because I am her mother,

469
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,506
and Leo is my grandson.

470
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,677
Pete, unpack the swimsuits

471
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,579
and find our boots and mittens,

472
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,415
because we're gonna spend
Christmas with my family!

473
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:44,789
- All right.
- Okay.

474
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,358
And... action.

475
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,993
Hey, everyone, it's Jen...

476
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,961
and that was awful.

477
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,262
I'm Jen, and...

478
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,330
Hang on. Okay.

479
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,998
Baby. Husband.
White-picket...

480
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,178
Could we have
a white-picket fence?

481
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,501
- We could, yeah.
- Okay.

482
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,203
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jen T.

483
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,772
And I'm Max,
her hubby/photographer.

484
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,207
It's his job
to make me look good.

485
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,775
It's not a hard job, honey.

486
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,109
Well, anyways,

487
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,012
thank you so much
for putting us in the top 20.

488
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,714
We're just...
We're so honored.

489
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,116
And, again, a reminder...

490
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,819
please take our videos
with a grain of salt, okay?

491
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,955
Nothing is as it seems
on social media.

492
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,223
Or in real life.

493
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,391
This little guy was crying
ten minutes ago,

494
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,771
and look what a little angel
you are right now.

495
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:22,961
Thank you.

496
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,830
So, let's not compare
ourselves to others,

497
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,867
because comparison
is the thief of joy.

498
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,535
- Well said.
- Thank you.

499
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,970
Come here, big guy.

500
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,405
- Go to Daddy.
- Here, come here. Yeah.

501
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,474
I just wanna eat you.

502
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,042
All right,
let me show you around.

503
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,478
This is me
and my sister Ali's store,

504
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,813
and it is...

505
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,748
it is the light of my life,
my dream come true.

506
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,049
I just...

507
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,295
I live to make things beautiful,

508
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,853
and, it's what
I've always wanted to do.

509
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,189
I... I went to art school,
I studied interior design,

510
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,423
and actually worked

511
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,426
out of a pretty big design firm
in Miami,

512
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,562
where I was mostly pairing

513
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,508
leopard-print throw cushions
with Grecian columns.

514
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,199
It hurt her soul.

515
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,867
Not a high point.

516
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,102
So...

517
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,504
a few years later,
I moved home to Astoria,

518
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,072
and teamed up

519
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:12,677
with my powerhouse
business-savant sister, Ali.

520
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,712
That's me!

521
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,348
And you know what, folks?

522
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,384
It's not easy.

523
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,419
Ali and I... we...

524
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,921
we fail, we flail.

525
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,689
We fight. We stress...

526
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,891
constantly. But...

527
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,359
we get to do it together.

528
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:32,430
And we love each other so much.

529
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,431
And that, my friends,

530
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,567
is what I would call
"Jen-unine".

531
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,639
- Cut.
- Yeah!

532
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,810
- It's so weird!
- I cannot get enough of "Jen T".

533
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,712
Thank you.
She's, kind of, like me,

534
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,815
just more bubbles,
less self-awareness. Yeah.

535
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,417
Yeah, exactly.
She's great.

536
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,542
Photo for photo, I see you!

537
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,097
I almost got away with that.

538
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,265
Really impressive.

539
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,935
This contest
has a lot of spillover.

540
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,170
What do you mean?

541
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,938
Since you tagged me
in that first video,

542
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,907
my followers have doubled.

543
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,075
Awesome.

544
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,643
I got a DM inquiry this morning

545
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,078
for a House & Home shoot.

546
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,390
I love them.
You're gonna do it, right?

547
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,282
I mean, that'd be amazing
for my career.

548
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,650
It's in Portland, though.

549
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,352
Which, I'm there a lot.

550
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,987
Maybe I have to move back
some day.

551
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:29,988
Well, you got
a wife and a kid now,

552
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,063
you gotta make a decision.

553
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,758
Wait...

554
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,159
you're that couple, aren't you?

555
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,362
I just saw your video
for that HyggeAtHome contest.

556
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,197
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's us! Hi!

557
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,665
You two are the cutest.

558
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,166
Just like Zoe and Charlie.

559
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,701
A true inspiration.

560
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,269
Thank you.
You're very kind.

561
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,505
It seems like you have it all.

562
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,608
No, our whole thing is
that no one has it all.

563
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,543
Seems like you do, though.

564
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,848
Okay, we gotta stop.
This is wrong.

565
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,017
Jen! Jen!

566
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,351
Excuse me. Sorry.

567
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,020
Jen, check your phone.
Check your phone!

568
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:06,624
<i>And here she is!</i>

569
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,459
<i>Jen Taylor from Jenuine Decor,</i>

570
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,795
you are one of
our top-ten finalists!

571
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Congratulations!

572
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,165
Hi.

573
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,966
<i>We'll send out
the theme for the next post,</i>

574
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,034
and then we'll select

575
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,429
three finalists
for the last round.

576
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,537
I... I can't believe it.

577
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,240
And we just wanna say

578
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,875
how much
we're enjoying your videos.

579
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,143
Keep up the hard work.

580
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,544
Thank you?

581
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,712
Bye, everyone!

582
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,193
You wanna cut...
cut the live? Thanks.

583
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,383
Do you wanna get lunch?

584
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,659
No, I'm going to answer emails.

585
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,019
I'll see you at home.

586
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,055
Thank you.

587
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,697
I'm not making any more videos.

588
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,234
Jen,
you have 50,000 followers now.

589
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,537
And I just came from the store,
sales have doubled.

590
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,038
This is the dream, Jen.

591
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,074
Yeah, but it's a lie!

592
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:00,078
The husband and the baby
are debatable,

593
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,113
but the rest is true.

594
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,781
And, okay, so imagine this.

595
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,894
One day, you get married,
you have a kid.

596
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,050
But I won't.

597
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:07,785
But if you change your mind.

598
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,020
That's a large "if".

599
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,756
Okay, well let's just imagine
that you do.

600
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,935
Then this becomes less of a fib

601
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,725
and more of an exercise
in manifestation.

602
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,530
Say yes.

603
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,033
Come on, Jen,
you've come this far.

604
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,134
Sixty...

605
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:24,635
60,000 followers now.

606
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,282
Why do I feel like this is
going to spiral out of control

607
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,538
to my detriment?

608
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,407
Because you feel that way
about everything?

609
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,110
A certain amount
of existential dread is healthy.

610
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,945
Okay, true,
but this... this...

611
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,947
this is good.

612
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,449
It's good for us.

613
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,817
We're not hurting anybody.

614
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,263
All we're doing is driving
people's attention to us.

615
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,087
They are buying our products
on their own.

616
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,467
All right,
but I can't help wondering

617
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,923
how it's gonna get worse.

618
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,391
Guess who's home for Christmas?

619
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,639
You got married and had a baby

620
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,663
without telling me?

621
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,765
- Hey, Max.
- Hi, Liz.

622
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,468
Let's just take this outside.

623
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,771
You could have sent an email.
You could've called, written.

624
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,006
Okay, mom, mom, mom.

625
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,774
Look, Jen isn't married,

626
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,510
she doesn't have a baby.

627
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,279
It was all just
sort of a joke gone awry.

628
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,947
Deeply, deeply awry.

629
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,683
We made a joke video
to enter a contest,

630
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,230
and didn't expect
anything to come of it,

631
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,786
but now we're top-10 finalists.

632
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:19,590
So, you're thinking this is
all, sort of, like theater?

633
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,092
Yes! Exactly...

634
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,760
theater.

635
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,329
See?
You are more like me.

636
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:26,330
Don't forget
that I was in theater.

637
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:27,665
In high school.

638
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,500
Once a thespian,
always a thespian.

639
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,102
Okay, we know.

640
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,937
They just sent
the other prompt in.

641
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,605
#HyggeHolidayTraditions.

642
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,543
We could do a video
of a holiday activity.

643
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,345
We could bake
gingerbread houses.

644
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:42,313
Or make wreaths.

645
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,881
Oh, "we"?

646
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,884
Yes. Why not "we"?

647
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,219
This is an opportunity

648
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:49,765
for us all to spend
Christmas holidays together.

649
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,821
Can we stop pretending

650
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,457
that you don't just want
your 15 minutes?

651
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,060
No, I just want
my 15 minutes with you.

652
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,630
Just one Christmas activity.

653
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,666
That's all I ask,

654
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
then I'll give you your space.

655
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,169
All right,
10:00 a.m., back here.

656
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,404
We're making wreaths.

657
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,872
This is going to be so much fun!

658
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,642
Okay.

659
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,449
And... action.

660
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,850
Hi, all, it's Jen T again.

661
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,420
With a Jen-uinely
special guest...

662
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,789
me, Jen's Mom...

663
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:25,990
Liz Taylor.

664
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,758
No, not that Liz Taylor,

665
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,428
although I have had
almost as many husbands.

666
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,097
Anyway, today,
my Mom and I are making wreaths.

667
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,465
They're DIY.

668
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,811
They are breathtaking,
but they're also simple.

669
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:38,769
And have a lot
of sentimental value,

670
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,105
because Jen used to love
making wreaths with her father.

671
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,776
Isn't that just perfect?

672
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:46,944
Anyway, folks,

673
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,779
today is going to be
a short video,

674
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,348
but just to say,

675
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,617
if you have struggled
with making wreaths in the past,

676
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,286
please know, you are not alone.

677
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,321
Wreaths, like life,
holidays, and family,

678
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,322
can be tricky...

679
00:25:58,358 --> 00:25:59,490
difficult, even...

680
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,625
and never quite turn out

681
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,994
exactly like
you thought they would.

682
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,229
And yet, they're always
just beautiful

683
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:06,530
exactly as they are.

684
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:09,800
And cut.

685
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,349
Wasn't it was a great way
to button the scene?

686
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,472
Okay.

687
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:15,973
Hey, Mom,
do you wanna go outside?

688
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,152
Do you wanna go find baby Reed?

689
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,377
I do!
Is he saying "Mama" yet?

690
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,345
No.

691
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,749
- Hey, thank you, again.
- Yeah, sure.

692
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,017
How did the framing look?

693
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,685
I think it looked good.

694
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,153
You look great.

695
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,188
As always.

696
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,490
Thank you.

697
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:33,925
Can I help you ladies
with anything?

698
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,894
Thank you.

699
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:44,902
I come bearing pie!

700
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,071
We each get
our own pizza? Yeah.

701
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,346
Yeah, I spent the day with Mom.

702
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:50,753
I'm surprised
we don't have three, then.

703
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,543
- Yeah.
- Here, try this.

704
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,544
Let me take this.

705
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:54,579
Thank you.

706
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,614
It's so pretty.

707
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:00,351
It's really good.

708
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,520
What's wrong?

709
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,122
Yeah, I've said it before.

710
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,069
I think fighting with your mom's
a waste of time.

711
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,893
It's not fighting, though,
at this point,

712
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,895
it's self-preservation.

713
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,063
She meddles in my life,

714
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,931
she makes a mess,
I have to clean up.

715
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,399
It's always about her.

716
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:16,467
You know, like,

717
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,437
there's not really
room for me there.

718
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,938
And even when Dad died,

719
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,640
we weren't even allowed
to grieve.

720
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,786
It was just her grief
that mattered.

721
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,976
That's how some people mourn.

722
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,213
I know.

723
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,316
But then she remarried
three times,

724
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,652
and moved Ali and I three times,

725
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,731
and we were little children,

726
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,887
and we needed our mom.

727
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,223
And she was chasing love

728
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,825
when she could've
just been loving us.

729
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,961
I get it.

730
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,665
I just know
that when my mom passed,

731
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,800
my grievances didn't feel
so important anymore.

732
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,282
I wish I would've
just loved and appreciated her

733
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,605
for who she was.

734
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,862
You know you were
really good to her, right?

735
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,745
Right.

736
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,517
Ali must have made another post.

737
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,518
I tagged you in another one.

738
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:09,487
Yeah, it's been helpful.

739
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,821
I've actually got

740
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,234
a few more messages
about job inquiries already.

741
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,291
- Great.
- Thank you.

742
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,960
What? What is it?

743
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,329
My Mom just commented:

744
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,365
"@HyggeAtHome, come make wreaths
with me and Jen."

745
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:24,769
You know what,

746
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,704
that's taking up
way too much mental bandwidth.

747
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,806
I'm on digital hiatus
until noon.

748
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,541
Well, good luck with that.

749
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,144
In the meantime, eat pizza.

750
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,612
Thank you.

751
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:35,880
Are you gonna eat a whole one?

752
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:36,992
Because I might be eating
my feelings this evening

753
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,048
and just get...

754
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,517
I was gonna eat both of those.

755
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,293
I'm heading home.

756
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,395
Think maybe you could finish
early tonight?

757
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,699
I'll make us pasta carbonara.

758
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,301
I have a ton left to do.

759
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,336
But...

760
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,206
I just had a wild idea.

761
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,553
We're going to be working with
whoever wins for an entire year.

762
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,310
What if we visited them?

763
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,578
Visited?

764
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:09,013
Yeah.

765
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,359
The point of this campaign
is to engage our community

766
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:14,018
and have us
step out of our ivory tower.

767
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,086
We could spend

768
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,332
a little of their holidays
with them

769
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,023
and get a real sense
of who they are.

770
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,358
That's a lot of planning

771
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:22,874
that would have to happen
immediately.

772
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,396
Yeah, you're right.

773
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,075
And we probably couldn't get
all the staff to travel.

774
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:33,270
So, no work, no staff,
no late nights, or meetings?

775
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,673
It'd just be you and me?

776
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,074
Yeah, I suppose so.

777
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,512
Then let's do it.

778
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,583
- Let's do it?
- Yeah.

779
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,690
Where have you been?

780
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,125
I tried calling you
a million times!

781
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,354
Digital sabbatical 'til noon.

782
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:58,395
What's so important?

783
00:29:58,431 --> 00:29:59,431
Thank you.

784
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,099
Only just this...

785
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,634
<i>Hello, everyone!</i>

786
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:06,537
<i>We're excited to announce
our final three decorators!</i>

787
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:07,683
<i>And even more excited
to announce</i>

788
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:08,973
<i>that we'll be spending</i>

789
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,941
<i>a portion of the holidays
with each one.</i>

790
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,776
We'll be celebrating
Happy Holidays

791
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,079
with @DwellbyDell,

792
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,481
Chanukah
with @HousebyHadassah...

793
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,650
...and Christmas
with @JenuineDecor!

794
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,818
It's you! It's you!

795
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:21,552
We'll let you know <i>how it goes!</i>

796
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,553
<i>Until next time,</i>

797
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,588
it's Zoe and Charlie!

798
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,657
Oh... no.

799
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,092
No, no, no, no, no.

800
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,260
No. No, no, no.

801
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,427
No, they... they can't...

802
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,540
they can't just
show up here, right?

803
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,641
They've gotta ask permission.

804
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,065
They can't just come here.

805
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,468
You gave them permission,
didn't you?

806
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,003
- You didn't answer your phone!
- Ali!

807
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,437
It's only for four days.

808
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:42,072
They are arriving in four days.

809
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,274
You...
You're joking.

810
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,475
You... You're joking.

811
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,843
- You're joking.
- And...

812
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,789
just so you can get
all the rage out beforehand...

813
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,013
You're not joking.

814
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,347
So they told me that the idea

815
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:54,318
came from a comment
Mom left on your post.

816
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,587
"Come make wreaths
with me and Jen."

817
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,622
That's the one.

818
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,158
Okay.

819
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,260
Okay, is there anything else
you haven't told me

820
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:06,964
about this absolute,
hot garbage fire

821
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,265
that you've dropped us in?

822
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,678
Could you just please
lay it on me right now?

823
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,801
Tell me now... now.

824
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,236
Okay, so it's so funny
that you ask,

825
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,171
because...

826
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,040
So, when they called me
and they...

827
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,519
they asked about
where they could stay,

828
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:22,513
I said that we would
be delighted to host them,

829
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,548
of course.

830
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,322
You done?

831
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,058
Okay, I won't touch you.

832
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,698
All right, so Zoe and Charlie

833
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,667
are staying with you and me
and little baby Leo Ansel

834
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:44,902
for four days.

835
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,271
And how are we pulling this off?

836
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,906
Excellent question.

837
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,375
I'm sorry!
We'll figure it out.

838
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,854
I know this throws
a little wrench in things.

839
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,545
It's not a wrench,
it's a wrecking ball,

840
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,046
because I live in a very small,

841
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,748
one-human-habitant apartment,

842
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,949
and I like it that way.

843
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,517
And my bathroom
doubles as a darkroom.

844
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:01,719
That a little awkward?

845
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,387
Well, we're gonna
have to use your joint.

846
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,522
I'd love to,

847
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:07,891
but, Brad's family
is staying for the holidays.

848
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:08,927
I'm so sorry.

849
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:11,862
Well, where are gonna find

850
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,297
a picture-perfect house
to do the...

851
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,135
Well, well, well...

852
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,284
you need something from me.

853
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,538
You have full access

854
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:23,807
to this home
that we rented for the holidays,

855
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,043
as long as I can be involved
in everything.

856
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,277
Not manipulative at all.

857
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,879
I think it's lovely

858
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,559
that you want to participate
in this charade.

859
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,782
That's not helping.

860
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,384
But I don't see it as a charade,

861
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,786
I see it as a chance for us all
to be together for Christmas

862
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,222
for the first time in years.

863
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,817
Okay, so in this farce,
who do you play?

864
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,627
I'm the shockingly-young
live-in Grandma,

865
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:45,129
acting as the glue

866
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,132
to this totally functional,
multi-generational family.

867
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,801
- Okey-dokey.
- So...

868
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:51,836
do we have a deal?

869
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,913
Mom, no.
What happened?

870
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,682
Who did you let in here
to do that?

871
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,088
Well, you know, it was
so last-minute coming here,

872
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,803
we kinda had to take
whatever we could get.

873
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,259
Well, it's got great bones.

874
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,996
Just zero Christmas decorations.

875
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,297
I mean, least of our concerns,

876
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,865
- but I could bring some over.
- Okay.

877
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,667
I have a couple special things.

878
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,038
Complete redesign

879
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,441
and decorating for
social media-level Christmas.

880
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,777
Lift and lift.
Okay.

881
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:34,778
That's heavy.

882
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,013
Thank you, guys.

883
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,092
Make sure you give that thing
a proper burial.

884
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,615
Put it down.
Just wait a second.

885
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,718
Here!

886
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:41,719
Great job, everyone!

887
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:42,720
Jen...

888
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:43,832
I gotta get back to the store

889
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,722
to meet Brad's niece...

890
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,857
she's covering for you.

891
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,292
That's right,
kind of hug the space.

892
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,897
It's Dad's.

893
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,641
And that's not all.

894
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,316
The tree topper...

895
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,081
...from the woodworking phase
that lasted five minutes.

896
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,159
Yeah, it works
in the right light.

897
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,351
I didn't even know
you still had these.

898
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,479
I thought you got rid of them.
I haven't seen them for decades.

899
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:33,103
Well, of course,
I still kept them.

900
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,012
And now it's time
for you and Ali to keep them.

901
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,343
Thank you.

902
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,012
Yeah.

903
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,751
I present to you...

904
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,386
freshman year Halloween.

905
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:52,924
I see that.

906
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,358
I raise you...

907
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:55,859
graduation,

908
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:56,794
and you and bright-pink hair.

909
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,061
Oh, no!

910
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,777
It was a happy accident
and I made it work.

911
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,901
Kinda weird, huh?

912
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,104
Like, I know it's fake,
and everything, but...

913
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,801
...you know... you know,
it feels kinda real, in a way.

914
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:13,744
Yeah.

915
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,127
If we're gonna convince
anyone we're actually married,

916
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,250
we need rings.

917
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,718
I didn't even think of that.

918
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:23,153
Yeah.

919
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,255
I can borrow my dad's,
but with you...

920
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,962
...the old switcharoo.

921
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,143
Pete's our hero.

922
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,945
He cut down a tree!

923
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,746
But he's thrown
his back out, though.

924
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,081
I did not throw out my back.

925
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,518
Help me.

926
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:11,835
Can you say "Da-da"?

927
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:15,706
Say, "Da-Da".
Say, "Daa... daa".

928
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:16,940
"Da-da."

929
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,108
Honey?

930
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,344
I birthed that baby
for 14 hours,

931
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,489
so you'd better pray
night and day

932
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,513
his first word is "Mama".

933
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,183
Say "Ma-Ma".

934
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,118
Holy! Jen!

935
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,953
What?

936
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,456
We just reached
100,000 followers!

937
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,458
Great.

938
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,827
Have you ever read the comments
on those things?

939
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,363
Like, you get ten good ones,

940
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,797
and then the one bad one,

941
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,165
and that's the one you remember.

942
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,500
Forget all of it.

943
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,569
- Eyes on the prize.
- Okay.

944
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:49,973
Okay, everyone,
I think the tree is done.

945
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,208
What do you wanna put up top?

946
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,743
I brought a couple options.

947
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,024
Wasn't quite sure
what your vibe would be.

948
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,347
Mom gave me something.

949
00:36:58,684 --> 00:36:59,983
Okay.

950
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:04,054
You remember?

951
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,224
Dad.

952
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,494
Yeah.

953
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,573
You want me
to put it up for you?

954
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,430
Yes, please.

955
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,671
And...

956
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,272
done.

957
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,540
Thank you.

958
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,210
- I love you.
- I love you.

959
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,448
And I love you both.

960
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:43,093
Thank you very much.

961
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,028
Thank you.
Have a great night.

962
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,197
Thanks.

963
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,512
Thank you for coming for a walk.

964
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:51,880
I really needed
to get out of there.

965
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:53,704
Of course.

966
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,039
Are you ready?

967
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:57,975
Tomorrow, the madness begins.

968
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,744
Can you pretend
to be in love with me?

969
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,747
I mean, yeah,
I could probably manage.

970
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,752
Hey, what's wrong?

971
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,422
What's wrong?

972
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm scared.

973
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,798
The more I think about
being "Jen T",

974
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,433
the more I know people are...

975
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,569
they're gonna love her.

976
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,304
And I'm the exact
opposite of her.

977
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:30,907
No, Jen...
Jen, come on.

978
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,809
What makes you so sure
you're unlovable?

979
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:40,650
Come on,

980
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,986
I'll walk you back "home".

981
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,865
I thought we agreed

982
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,244
that this trip
would be just for us.

983
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:57,667
I just want one videographer

984
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,302
to get behind-the-scenes
footage.

985
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,520
Brad, I see you.
Don't you do it!

986
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,476
Straighten up the mantel.

987
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,011
Cookies... table.
Eggnog... pitcher.

988
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,486
...they're here!

989
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,082
- Places, everyone!
- I'll get the baby!

990
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,025
Zoe...

991
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,894
...do you think
we should talk a minute

992
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,962
before we go in there?

993
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:29,032
Let's just keep it together
through this final visit,

994
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:30,779
and then we'll deal with
everything when we get back?

995
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:34,037
So, more sweeping it
under the rug?

996
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:37,207
No, just try to enjoy.

997
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,744
Just smile and try to enjoy.

998
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,246
Okay.

999
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,051
Out the front door.

1000
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:49,586
Unbelievably, yeah.

1001
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:55,058
All right.

1002
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,326
Mom, just here.

1003
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,165
Wave and smile, everyone.

1004
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:03,921
Everybody, smile
and try to enjoy ourselves.

1005
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,735
Welcome!

1006
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,242
Of course, you know.

1007
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,510
Howdy?

1008
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,045
And this is baby Leo Ansel.

1009
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,182
And this is my sister, Ali,
and her husband, Brad.

1010
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:20,218
Huge fan.

1011
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,888
And you may recognize
my mom, Liz, from our videos.

1012
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,556
We're honored to have you here.

1013
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,824
Thank you.

1014
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
And I'm the butler.

1015
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,361
Or am I?

1016
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,562
He's not.

1017
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,264
He's my Mom's husband.

1018
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,033
But please, come inside.

1019
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:38,668
Right? Come on!

1020
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,743
Your house
is absolutely perfect.

1021
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,546
We could shoot every room as is.

1022
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,015
We actually
just finished redecorating.

1023
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,784
I'm really drawn
to the mantelpiece.

1024
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,120
Look.

1025
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,856
This piece really stands out.

1026
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,258
Is it yours, Max?

1027
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,792
That...
that was my dad's.

1028
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,395
Reed, what's wrong?

1029
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,430
"Reed"?

1030
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,233
Yeah, it's our nickname for him.

1031
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,469
My... my father's name was Reed.

1032
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,871
That's his stocking
you're looking at.

1033
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,640
Why didn't you just
name the baby "Reed"?

1034
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,610
It's one of his middle names.

1035
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,078
Leo Ansel Hudson Reed.

1036
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:23,213
...Faison-Taylor.

1037
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,482
Taylor-Faison, but yeah.

1038
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,383
Oh, sweetie.

1039
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:27,484
Buddy.

1040
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,486
What's going on?
What's happening?

1041
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,635
What's... What's happening?

1042
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,890
I think maybe he's tired.

1043
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,993
Probably, it's been a long day.

1044
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,161
Oh, honey.

1045
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,062
Brad and I
should be going, so...

1046
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,630
Okay, bye.

1047
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,767
I'm gonna get, Ansel to bed.

1048
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,435
We would love
to see the nursery.

1049
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:48,738
You know, we don't actually

1050
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,308
have a quintessential nursery,
so to speak.

1051
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:55,111
We... we, kind of,
try to let him stay in a...

1052
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:57,347
in a decorative-neutral place.

1053
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,315
Thank you.

1054
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,516
It's a... It's a...

1055
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,586
It's better for
his cognitive baby brain.

1056
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:03,621
Science.

1057
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,155
Yeah, right.

1058
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,490
Make yourselves comfortable.
I will be right back.

1059
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:09,359
Goodnight, son.

1060
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,700
You think this is funny?

1061
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,134
It's hilarious, yes.

1062
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,603
Come here, bubba.

1063
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:20,971
All right.

1064
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,138
Hi, little boy.

1065
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:26,209
Okay, just...
just to note,

1066
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:27,589
where we officially
crossed the line

1067
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:28,656
is where we passed your baby
through this window.

1068
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,791
Yeah, I don't love
my parenting style

1069
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:31,181
right now either,

1070
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,161
but hey, Reed is back
with his real mom and dad now.

1071
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:34,185
Let's go.

1072
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,825
I'm obsessed with this decor.

1073
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:45,155
Liz, I cannot stop eating
these cookies you baked.

1074
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:47,797
You baked?
Mom, you've never baked...

1075
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,232
...since
earlier this afternoon.

1076
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:52,002
So, Max, how did you meet?

1077
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:55,338
We met in college,
at art school.

1078
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:56,906
I just remember thinking

1079
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,377
she was both the most normal

1080
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,979
and the most extraordinary
person I'd ever met.

1081
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,683
If that makes sense.

1082
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,588
Yeah, it makes sense.

1083
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,369
We dated briefly
in our senior year.

1084
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:16,426
Not so briefly.

1085
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:18,828
Six months is an eternity
when you're 22.

1086
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:20,944
Right. We just decided
we'd be better off as friends.

1087
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,869
So, when did you
get back together?

1088
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,106
We lost touch for a few years,

1089
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,341
and then Max's parents

1090
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,909
moved from Portland
back to here,

1091
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,377
where I grew up.

1092
00:43:34,413 --> 00:43:35,211
And then, when my Mom got sick,

1093
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,579
I came home to help,

1094
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,580
and Jen and I reconnected.

1095
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,215
The rest is history.

1096
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:40,450
It's a sweet story.

1097
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,519
And I'd love to see
wedding photos.

1098
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:44,587
Me too.

1099
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,223
We'll just...

1100
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:48,391
You know what?

1101
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:49,693
We'll dig those up for you...

1102
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,194
Do you remember where those are?

1103
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,029
I couldn't put my hand
on them right now,

1104
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,097
but I can look for them.

1105
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,243
In the meantime, you should have

1106
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,267
some more of my Mom's
delicious cookies

1107
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,868
that she baked all by herself.

1108
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:00,103
Cookies.

1109
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,239
Cookies.

1110
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:08,044
Thank you so much.

1111
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,913
We wanted to briefly reiterate
why we're here.

1112
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,729
Of course,
we wanna get to know you...

1113
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,396
...but we're also looking
for some cross-branding posts

1114
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,486
between us

1115
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:17,954
centered around
the Hygge Holidays.

1116
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,567
And we're hoping for more
than just crafting and baking.

1117
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,725
We want food, fun,
philanthropy, family.

1118
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,992
We believe

1119
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,472
a Hygge ambassador
should be able to do it all.

1120
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,729
Like, for example,

1121
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,964
@HousebyHadassah
threw a latke-making party,

1122
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,566
then a dreidel-off,

1123
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,134
then a four-generation
family reunion

1124
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,729
that raised money
for a local preschool.

1125
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:35,972
Talk about sleeping on the job!

1126
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,440
Well, we are so excited

1127
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:39,776
about the events
that we have planned for you,

1128
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,822
but we should probably
call it a night.

1129
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:41,811
The baby wakes up early.

1130
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,847
Let's go to our room.

1131
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,983
Yes, where we both sleep,
as husbands and wives do.

1132
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,121
Let us show you to your room.

1133
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,624
I'm the most awkward
creature on the planet!

1134
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,761
Thank you so much.

1135
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:58,928
Okay, now we're safe.

1136
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:01,692
I can't believe
you got roped into this.

1137
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,514
I can't believe
I got roped into this.

1138
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,483
Is it weird that
I'm kind of enjoying it?

1139
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:09,507
Yup.

1140
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,541
I thought so.

1141
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:12,876
This is exhausting.

1142
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,880
But it's kind of fun,
though, right?

1143
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,983
There is something about it
that's liberating.

1144
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,452
Like, I don't have to worry

1145
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:23,765
about what my life
is gonna be anymore,

1146
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,789
'cause it kinda
just suddenly is.

1147
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,858
I think... I think
it's more for me, though.

1148
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,796
There are times

1149
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,364
where I actually forget
this is fake.

1150
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:36,966
Like, I... I feel like

1151
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:38,279
I'm looking at a version
of my life

1152
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,336
that I could actually have
some day.

1153
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:44,073
You still want all that,
don't you?

1154
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:49,212
You know, find "the one",
get married, have babies.

1155
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,348
Yeah, I do.

1156
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,385
That's nice.
You'd make a great dad.

1157
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,893
Are you telling me
that somewhere deep down there,

1158
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,428
you don't want the same thing?

1159
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,600
I don't know how.

1160
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:13,844
It's not really
in my blueprint, you know?

1161
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,742
When we lost Dad...

1162
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:24,347
I watched my mom's heart just...

1163
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,115
shatter.

1164
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,688
Then she went
chasing after love so hard,

1165
00:46:31,723 --> 00:46:32,963
trying to put it back together,

1166
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,058
that she kinda lost herself,
you know?

1167
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:38,928
It was hard to watch...

1168
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,864
It made being her daughter.

1169
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,901
Difficult,

1170
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,436
and messy, and...

1171
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,875
...sometimes just ugly.

1172
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:56,357
The thought of inflicting that
on another human being

1173
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,614
is terrifying to me,

1174
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,148
so I'm all set.

1175
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,653
Yeah, but that messy stuff...

1176
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:06,623
that's what makes life
worth living sometimes.

1177
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,558
"Life is not a highlights reel."

1178
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,426
That's my best
impression of you.

1179
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:13,229
You don't say?

1180
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:16,099
Yeah, just...

1181
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:17,100
It would've been nice

1182
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,968
if it wasn't
a total blooper reel

1183
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:21,271
that wasn't even funny.

1184
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:27,944
By the way,

1185
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,323
about our Christmas presents
this year, I...

1186
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,758
We already talked about it,
we're not doing that.

1187
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,493
- I know we talked about it.
- We said no gifts.

1188
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,150
But I found
the perfect idea for you.

1189
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,385
It... It's not quite done yet,

1190
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,986
but trust me, when you see it,

1191
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,022
I think you're finally gonna...

1192
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,856
I'm not sleeping!
I'm awake! I'm gonna...

1193
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,325
It's morning.

1194
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,697
This is so much fun.

1195
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:23,232
Okay, Ali's gonna be
here soon, come on.

1196
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,602
Right, Ali.

1197
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,003
Let's go.

1198
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,371
Morning, hon.

1199
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:37,680
Hey.

1200
00:48:37,716 --> 00:48:38,881
Get in here.

1201
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,394
The coast is clear,
they're still asleep...

1202
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,251
- I think.
- Okay.

1203
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,886
Speaking of which,
did you get any?

1204
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,722
No. No.

1205
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,190
But Reed was up all night

1206
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:50,026
saying something
that vaguely resembled "Ma",

1207
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,761
so I think he's working
his way to "Mama".

1208
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,696
Potential victory.
Good job.

1209
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:55,798
Hey, Ali.
Morning.

1210
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,467
Hi.

1211
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:01,371
Hey, you'd better get changed.

1212
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,438
Thanks.

1213
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:03,606
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.

1214
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,214
How'd it go last night?

1215
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:13,816
Complicated...

1216
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:14,962
but not the kind of complicated
you're thinking,

1217
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,119
the kind of complicated

1218
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,398
where I have to host
three events,

1219
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,388
and I didn't say that I would,
but I am anyway,

1220
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:19,423
for some reason.

1221
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,556
Sorry!

1222
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:21,702
But also, don't worry about it,

1223
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,459
because I have everything
taken care of.

1224
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:24,761
Today, we're throwing

1225
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:25,906
a gingerbread-house-making party
at Jack's bakery.

1226
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,397
I can't.

1227
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:28,672
I... This is getting untenable.

1228
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,277
I've hardly been in the store
at all this week.

1229
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,934
This is the best thing
for the store...

1230
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,002
and your career.

1231
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,117
I gotta get ready.
Thank you for bringing him over.

1232
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,141
Of course.

1233
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,344
Hi. Where have you guys been?

1234
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:42,945
Well, Z and C were up early,

1235
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,448
so I just gave them
a tour of the property.

1236
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:50,286
And we just did
a little TikTok at the firepit.

1237
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,923
This place
is the definition of "hygge".

1238
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:54,991
Thank you.

1239
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,859
What actually does "hygge" mean?

1240
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:58,261
Well, it's a Danish word

1241
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:00,296
that doesn't have
an exact English translation,

1242
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,764
but "cozy" comes close.

1243
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,032
It's kind of a state of mind.

1244
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,168
You take
the everyday and the mundane,

1245
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,537
and you make it
beautiful and joyful.

1246
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,672
Well, that is Jen's forte.

1247
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,374
Thanks, Mom.

1248
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:12,443
Your Mom's fantastic.

1249
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:15,022
She was telling us
all about her time on Broadway.

1250
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,713
When I was the ingénue
at Les Mis.

1251
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,317
Zoe! Charlie!

1252
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,785
Let's...

1253
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:23,386
Let's whip up some breakfast
so we can go to the store.

1254
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:24,520
Yeah.

1255
00:50:24,556 --> 00:50:26,355
And we're rolling.

1256
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,458
And action.

1257
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,827
Sweet. Laid-back. Refreshing.

1258
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,663
Warm but cozy minimalism.

1259
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,398
Not bad.

1260
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,866
That felt good, guys.

1261
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:37,901
Good job. Nice work.

1262
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,981
I'll be right back,
in a minute, okay?

1263
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:42,138
Yeah.

1264
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:43,239
Incessantly ruminating

1265
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:45,074
over the comments
on your posts, I see.

1266
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,075
I know.

1267
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:48,144
I've just never been called

1268
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:50,680
"a decorator
of anyone's Jen-eration",

1269
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,882
or "Jen-uinely inspiring".

1270
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,684
That's gotta feel pretty nice.

1271
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,185
There are some mean ones.

1272
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,353
And there's this one troll

1273
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,733
who keeps calling me
"Jen-uinely blonde".

1274
00:50:58,757 --> 00:50:59,834
Not really sure
how to take that.

1275
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:00,890
Yeah, but, Jen,

1276
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,258
we have 120,000 followers now.

1277
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:03,760
If we keep having sales

1278
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,108
like we have
these past few days,

1279
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:06,803
we can keep going
straight on 'til summer.

1280
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,732
Yeah.

1281
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:10,900
So who cares

1282
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,012
what a few strangers
on the Internet say?

1283
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,336
You know, I don't care.

1284
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,005
You seen the memes, though?

1285
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,040
They're kind of rough.

1286
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,841
- I'm keeping this.
- Okay.

1287
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:20,543
This is amazing.

1288
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,844
You like that?

1289
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,224
- Totally, hands down.
- Thank you.

1290
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,348
Jack, this is gorgeous.

1291
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:26,427
Thank you, I'm pretty proud.

1292
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,750
You should be.

1293
00:51:27,786 --> 00:51:30,353
- Yeah.
- Look at this!

1294
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,522
This is exactly
what we're looking for.

1295
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:36,726
Someone who can make it all
look effortless and stunning.

1296
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:37,761
Thank you so much.

1297
00:51:37,796 --> 00:51:40,096
That's Jen T!

1298
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:41,297
Yes.

1299
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:43,266
Honey,
can I have a minute with you?

1300
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:44,367
- Yeah.
- Just a second.

1301
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:45,434
Sorry. Sorry.

1302
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,402
Of course, of course, of course.

1303
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,437
Okay, we're gonna get in.

1304
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,042
That was supposed to be

1305
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,388
an opportunity
to showcase my dad.

1306
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,646
I know, it's like
"Jen T" just kind of jumped out.

1307
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,815
Jen, you are "Jen T".

1308
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,211
Zoe and Charlie
are ready for the next video.

1309
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,720
Okay, I'm gonna fix it.

1310
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:06,122
I'm gonna tag him
in the next post.

1311
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,157
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1312
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:09,792
For some reason,

1313
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:11,294
we all think

1314
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,406
that our gingerbread house
is supposed to look like that,

1315
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,098
when in reality,
they look like that one.

1316
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,000
And the reason for this

1317
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,436
is because
this gingerbread house

1318
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,139
was made by the baker
at Kooben Cafe.

1319
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,909
That is @KoobenCafe.

1320
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:28,244
Please follow him.

1321
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:30,479
He is a genius
and Max's wonderful father.

1322
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,517
The house I made...

1323
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,586
that guy right there.

1324
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,087
And I'm good with it.

1325
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,990
Honestly,

1326
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,458
I don't think it really matters

1327
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,693
what your house looks like.

1328
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,931
Maybe what matters more
is how you felt making it.

1329
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,537
Jen, that was

1330
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:56,305
a slightly different
tone for you.

1331
00:52:58,977 --> 00:53:02,178
Well, we contain multitudes,
and I...

1332
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,494
I think it's really important
that our followers see that.

1333
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,861
Either way,
we already posted a few stories

1334
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:08,017
and our followers love it,

1335
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,118
so thank you.

1336
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,720
Great!

1337
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,655
And we're looking forward
to the dance next?

1338
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,223
Dance?

1339
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,224
The Christmas dance
we're throwing

1340
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,525
for the whole town.

1341
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:17,727
Whole town?

1342
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,161
And it was your idea

1343
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,008
to have all the ticket sales
go to local charities.

1344
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,298
- How altruistic of me.
- Very.

1345
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,200
I have to say, I'm impressed.

1346
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,168
This sounds like
a massive undertaking.

1347
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:34,143
What are they talking about?

1348
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:35,211
It seemed like

1349
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,490
a really brilliant idea
at 3:00 a.m.

1350
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,025
when I couldn't get
Reed back to sleep.

1351
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,215
Oh, Ali.

1352
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,351
How are we gonna pull this off?

1353
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:44,887
I don't know.

1354
00:53:44,923 --> 00:53:45,888
But you remember

1355
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:47,056
how you said

1356
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,658
that you were getting
the feeling

1357
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,660
that this all might just
spiral out of control?

1358
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,495
Yeah.

1359
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,863
I'm starting to feel it, too.

1360
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:56,866
Well, this is spectacular.

1361
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,436
Go get 'em.

1362
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:05,609
Max!

1363
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:08,344
Thank you.

1364
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,612
I'm so sorry.

1365
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,047
No, thank you so much.
I know.

1366
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:13,115
Oh, look!

1367
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:15,117
Jen and Max
are under the mistletoe!

1368
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:52,455
We kissed?

1369
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1370
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:54,957
Yeah.

1371
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:56,459
- It was fine.
- Yeah.

1372
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:58,005
No, no, yeah, it was...
it was fine, it was good.

1373
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,261
Not a big deal.

1374
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,198
Not a big deal at all.

1375
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,800
But maybe...

1376
00:55:04,836 --> 00:55:06,469
maybe it opens up

1377
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,982
a conversation
we should have, though.

1378
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:09,305
Sure.

1379
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,842
What exactly would that
conversation look like?

1380
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:16,145
I think...
No, no, it's fine.

1381
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,213
We... We kissed before.

1382
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,347
Yeah.

1383
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:19,493
-Yeah,
-Yeah, a long time ago.

1384
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,650
Yeah. It was good then,
it was good now.

1385
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,454
It wasn't a real kiss, though.

1386
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,190
It was
a social-media kiss, right?

1387
00:55:28,226 --> 00:55:30,393
It was "Jen T" and hubby Max,

1388
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:34,030
and so many people
watching that.

1389
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,532
Maybe we should kiss more?

1390
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:37,567
Would you like to?

1391
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,736
More than anything.

1392
00:55:41,973 --> 00:55:43,572
We could get
more followers and likes.

1393
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:48,689
I gotta wash my hair
for tomorrow,

1394
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:49,745
and get ready,

1395
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:50,913
and it takes a while to...

1396
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,503
- Goodnight.
- Okay, goodbye.

1397
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,160
It's a barn.

1398
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,995
It's a cute barn.

1399
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,696
It's an empty
and undecorated barn,

1400
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,232
which has to become the epitome
of holiday magic by tomorrow.

1401
00:56:10,268 --> 00:56:14,036
Well, luckily, this is
exactly what you excel at...

1402
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:16,238
taking the ordinary
and making it extraordinary.

1403
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,375
What if I can't do it this time?

1404
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,177
You can.
You will.

1405
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,845
You always do.

1406
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,280
And we'll help!

1407
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,085
Mason jars everywhere.

1408
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,520
Absolutely not.

1409
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,399
I just cracked
400,000 followers.

1410
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,568
Congratulations.

1411
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,483
I got a bunch of job offers
for decorating, too.

1412
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:51,640
You have 50,000 followers?

1413
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:52,608
Why did you not tell me?
That's amazing.

1414
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,410
Yeah. And a...

1415
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:57,580
a big agency just reached out
about representing me.

1416
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,815
But...

1417
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,128
they want me
to move to Portland.

1418
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:02,585
Well, obviously, you can't go.

1419
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,321
Well, why not?

1420
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:08,390
Like, what's keeping me here?

1421
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,870
Just your friends,
your family, your roots,

1422
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,060
me.

1423
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,662
In what capacity, Jen?

1424
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,736
I found the box of lights,
but they're all tangled.

1425
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:24,840
I will help you
with making them not tangled.

1426
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:34,483
Looked like you needed saving.

1427
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:35,559
But I am not gonna meddle.

1428
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:39,655
I am not gonna say a thing.

1429
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:42,491
I'm respecting your space.

1430
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:43,425
Say it before you explode.

1431
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,194
Yeah!

1432
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:46,462
What's going on with you two?

1433
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:49,465
It's...

1434
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:52,968
...different.

1435
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:54,615
It's the contest
and everything around it.

1436
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,039
And the incident
with the mistletoe

1437
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:59,275
really didn't help.

1438
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,171
It was kind of perfect
before then.

1439
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,948
What?

1440
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,449
You know, honey,

1441
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,451
the issues that you and I have

1442
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:11,720
aren't so different
from you and Max.

1443
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,958
You want me close,
but you push me away.

1444
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,195
I know you love me,

1445
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,030
but you just don't
fully show it.

1446
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:29,972
I'll finish these myself.

1447
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,520
She okay?

1448
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,858
Occasionally,
the atmosphere on planet Liz

1449
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:50,826
is somewhat charged.

1450
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,428
Jen, I...

1451
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:53,829
I don't know you so well,
but I...

1452
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,342
I think that you and your mom
might be more alike

1453
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,499
than you're willing to admit.

1454
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,401
And... And for all her antics...

1455
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:02,104
...she's a good woman.

1456
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:04,373
She defends us fiercely.

1457
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:07,109
She... She wears
her heart on her sleeve.

1458
00:59:07,178 --> 00:59:08,444
She keeps things interesting.

1459
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,392
Yeah, you should've
been there for my childhood.

1460
00:59:12,183 --> 00:59:14,617
Look, all she really wants
is to be loved.

1461
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:17,953
So cut her some slack.

1462
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,042
Okay, that was great.
Let's do one more.

1463
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,533
What if we did
this one off camera?

1464
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,603
Did it just to do it together,

1465
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,538
the way we used to.

1466
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:37,940
We need that.

1467
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,541
And then we can give
Alex the time off.

1468
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,712
Sure, let's do that.

1469
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:51,420
- Hey.
- Hey.

1470
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:52,888
Where is everyone?

1471
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:53,956
Out.

1472
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,224
Bummer, right?

1473
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,759
So you can sneak off
if you want.

1474
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,060
Nah, I'm just...

1475
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,396
I'm gonna hang out
and stay for a little bit.

1476
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,497
All right.

1477
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:02,398
Well, our fake baby is sleeping

1478
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,632
and the influencers

1479
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:06,135
are ice-skating
with your in-laws. So...

1480
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,736
Okay, so...

1481
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:12,908
so a quiet date night in
for Mr. and Mrs. Faison-Taylor.

1482
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,176
Taylor-Faison.

1483
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:15,411
I heard Faison-Taylor.

1484
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:16,645
It's actually a really...

1485
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:18,580
a good opportunity for me
to give you...

1486
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:24,620
We said no gifts.

1487
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,922
No, you said no gifts.

1488
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,291
I think this is something
that you could use.

1489
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:30,492
Here, have a seat.

1490
01:00:38,336 --> 01:00:39,668
Thank you.

1491
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,640
Oh, no.

1492
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,642
Oh, yeah.

1493
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:47,643
No!

1494
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,611
Why?

1495
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,613
You always say you hate
seeing yourself in photos.

1496
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:52,981
Yeah.

1497
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,317
I thought maybe
this would change your mind.

1498
01:00:55,353 --> 01:00:57,653
Help you see yourself...

1499
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:58,688
the way I see you.

1500
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,030
Thank you.

1501
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,799
It's lovely.

1502
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,878
Jen, what are we doing?

1503
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:24,046
Trying to win a contest.

1504
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,893
But what if we forget
about the contest

1505
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,016
and make this real?

1506
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,019
Give ourselves another shot.

1507
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:36,692
Max, I...

1508
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:39,695
...you're my best friend.

1509
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,531
I love you.

1510
01:01:44,235 --> 01:01:45,501
It broke before

1511
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:47,936
because we didn't want
the same things.

1512
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:51,106
It wouldn't have been fair.

1513
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,442
I'm not sure that's changed.

1514
01:01:56,881 --> 01:02:00,382
You're not sure?

1515
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:01,950
Or maybe you're just afraid?

1516
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:18,000
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas.

1517
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,446
You guys would be
such a great couple.

1518
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,680
I mean,
you pretty much are already,

1519
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,115
and you guys would have
the cutest kids.

1520
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,038
But I don't want any of stuff.

1521
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:24,339
I don't want the...

1522
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,307
the picket fence or the...

1523
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:26,642
the family.

1524
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:28,437
Could you run cash
for just a second, please?

1525
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:30,946
Thank you.

1526
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,519
And you're still
so sure about that?

1527
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:40,700
...apparently not,
and that's a problem,

1528
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,291
because I just...

1529
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,393
I just spent the last three days

1530
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:46,361
in my pretend perfect house,

1531
01:02:46,397 --> 01:02:49,531
with my pretend perfect baby,

1532
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:53,168
with my pretend
perfect husband...

1533
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,336
and suddenly,

1534
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:55,971
I would very much
like for it to be real.

1535
01:02:57,675 --> 01:02:58,675
And it could be.

1536
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:02,979
Oh, Jen.

1537
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:05,915
So are you here to work or...?

1538
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,361
I would like to be here to work,

1539
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,419
but since we posted
about the party online,

1540
01:03:10,488 --> 01:03:12,254
the buzz has kind of
gotten out of control,

1541
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:13,689
so I have to go work on that.

1542
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:14,990
Already apologized for that.

1543
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,560
Love you.

1544
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:19,027
Do we have enough?

1545
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:20,229
I have no idea.

1546
01:03:21,432 --> 01:03:23,165
I think so. Why not?
We can get more.

1547
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,335
Listen, millions of people
make dinner every day,

1548
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,170
how hard can it be?

1549
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,105
Right.

1550
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:32,007
What's happening here?

1551
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,275
Groceries.

1552
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:35,745
For Christmas Eve dinner.

1553
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,714
You're cooking?

1554
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:41,561
Mom, you... you don't...
you don't cook.

1555
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:43,452
You've never cooked.

1556
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:45,087
Okay, I'm sure
it's gonna be lovely.

1557
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,022
If you need help, just scream.

1558
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:49,024
I've gotta go
talk to the caterers.

1559
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,219
Have you...
Have you seen Max?

1560
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:52,694
I'm not your husband's keeper.

1561
01:03:58,736 --> 01:03:59,902
What about this?

1562
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:20,722
Hey!

1563
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:21,758
Cheers!

1564
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:22,792
Cheers.

1565
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,227
Hey, will you take him?

1566
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:26,562
Yeah.

1567
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:27,597
Hey, buddy.

1568
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:28,664
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

1569
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:29,898
So, I crunched the numbers.

1570
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:33,602
It turns out we raised
$27,000 for charity.

1571
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:34,836
Can you believe it?

1572
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,505
No. Oh, my goodness. Wow.

1573
01:04:36,574 --> 01:04:38,073
Look at us.

1574
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,108
Total self-actualization
of the Taylor sisters.

1575
01:04:40,144 --> 01:04:43,078
I gotta tell you, I...

1576
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:46,515
despite my doubt and,
you know, baseline rage,

1577
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:47,661
I'm just so grateful to you.

1578
01:04:47,685 --> 01:04:48,929
I couldn't have
done this without you.

1579
01:04:48,953 --> 01:04:50,786
And it all worked out.

1580
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:53,622
Look, Zoe and Charlie
are leaving tomorrow,

1581
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,657
and then we're in the clear.

1582
01:04:55,693 --> 01:04:57,092
Yeah, then
we just gotta figure out

1583
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,760
what to do
with my online persona

1584
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:00,629
moving forward, forever.

1585
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:02,631
Problem for future us.

1586
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,865
Okay.

1587
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,468
Thank you so much.
It was nice to meet you.

1588
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:07,436
Oh good, you're here!

1589
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,937
Wanna do a story?

1590
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:10,172
Or... we can dance.

1591
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,640
Okay, let me just find Alex.

1592
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,108
She can sit this one out.

1593
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:29,658
You did good, hon.

1594
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:30,693
Thank you.

1595
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:34,463
And exciting news.

1596
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,632
Zoe and Charlie can stay
for Christmas Eve dinner.

1597
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,068
You invited them?

1598
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,805
Well, I floated the idea.

1599
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:46,241
I thought they could do
a big story about it.

1600
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,409
That's why you're cooking.

1601
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:53,148
It is about you.

1602
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,995
I don't know why I thought
it could be about anything else,

1603
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,151
honestly.

1604
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,020
It's really classic you, Mom.

1605
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:00,889
What's that supposed to mean?

1606
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:03,425
Now I have to keep
this charade up even longer.

1607
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:09,031
Mom, do you realize

1608
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:12,734
you just do whatever you want
all the time?

1609
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,835
You never consider

1610
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:14,881
how it might affect
somebody else...

1611
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:16,071
how it might affect me.

1612
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,706
Ever. It's...
It's just...

1613
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,207
It is all about you.

1614
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,677
And...

1615
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:23,512
I gotta ask...

1616
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:27,949
have you ever thought about,
just for once...

1617
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:29,885
just being my mom first? Ever?

1618
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,554
Well, I've tried, Jen...

1619
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,423
for years...

1620
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,624
but you won't let me.

1621
01:06:35,693 --> 01:06:37,173
'Cause you taught me
to do without it.

1622
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,430
I don't need it now.

1623
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,266
I really could've used it

1624
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,741
back then
when I was a child, though.

1625
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:48,604
I don't know what to say, Jen.

1626
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,273
I made mistakes.

1627
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,144
I wish I would've done
some things differently.

1628
01:06:56,213 --> 01:07:00,649
And I really, really hoped
that we could heal...

1629
01:07:00,718 --> 01:07:01,983
but...

1630
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,152
I think...

1631
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:07,422
it's not really about me...

1632
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,491
it's just that
you don't like who you are.

1633
01:07:15,566 --> 01:07:17,466
Nice.

1634
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:27,454
Let's just have them shoot
a little B-roll of us dancing.

1635
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:28,478
Seriously?

1636
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,581
Zoe, can we have
a single moment just for us?

1637
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:35,016
Yes, but we have
public personas.

1638
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:36,429
And we also have a marriage
that's failing

1639
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,298
because we'd rather
perform the role of happy couple

1640
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:39,482
than actually try to live it.

1641
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:41,657
So what, Charlie?

1642
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:42,824
What do you think?

1643
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,092
That a few good moments lately

1644
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:45,648
are going to repair
the last few years?

1645
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,498
No, I don't...

1646
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,533
think that, but...

1647
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:55,103
...maybe I hoped it.

1648
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,141
Charlie.

1649
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,344
Charlie!

1650
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:04,714
You guys okay?

1651
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:05,981
Yeah, we're fine.

1652
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:07,716
No, we're not.

1653
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:11,219
Jen, you might be working

1654
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:12,788
with Zoe and me
in the coming year,

1655
01:08:12,823 --> 01:08:14,523
and if so,
you deserve the truth.

1656
01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:18,728
Zoe and I are separating.

1657
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:22,284
We'll be making the announcement
in the new year.

1658
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:27,068
I am so sorry.

1659
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:29,985
I thought you guys
were the perfect couple.

1660
01:08:31,008 --> 01:08:32,288
There is no perfect couple, Jen.

1661
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:34,543
After all,

1662
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:37,045
you're the first to say
nothing's perfect, right?

1663
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,686
There you are.

1664
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:45,754
Hey.

1665
01:08:45,823 --> 01:08:46,823
Where have you been?

1666
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:48,356
I met with
the agency in Portland.

1667
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,159
And?

1668
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:54,029
They think moving there
would be better for my career,

1669
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:55,096
and they're right.

1670
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:00,101
But I stayed here for you, Jen.

1671
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,572
I'd hoped we'd...

1672
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,679
Are we gonna
do this together, Jen?

1673
01:09:14,852 --> 01:09:16,451
We still don't want
the same things.

1674
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,202
Zoe and Charlie
want to go back to the house,

1675
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:24,426
so they're asking
to do the speech for the story.

1676
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:25,894
They want us all on stage.

1677
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:29,030
Okay.

1678
01:09:29,066 --> 01:09:30,699
The big, happy family.

1679
01:09:35,072 --> 01:09:38,573
Check, check.
Can I have your attention?

1680
01:09:40,077 --> 01:09:42,410
Hey, everyone.
Merry Christmas.

1681
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:47,582
Merry Christmas, friends!

1682
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:49,050
It is so wonderful...

1683
01:09:49,086 --> 01:09:51,253
"Jen-uinely" wonderful
to be here with you tonight.

1684
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,721
We are livestreaming.

1685
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:54,656
What a special occasion.

1686
01:09:58,929 --> 01:09:59,929
Mama.

1687
01:10:01,098 --> 01:10:02,898
- Mama.
- What did you just say, Reedy?

1688
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:03,999
Mama.

1689
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:06,167
Yes, Leo, Mama's right here.

1690
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:12,418
Leo Ansel just seems to be
a little confused.

1691
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,942
Mama!

1692
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,645
No, he's not. He's...

1693
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,179
We... We gotta stop.

1694
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:20,916
Ali, we gotta stop.
You take him.

1695
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:21,917
Okay.

1696
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:23,952
Hi.

1697
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,620
Hi.

1698
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,992
Everyone, I...

1699
01:10:31,028 --> 01:10:32,294
I gotta tell you something.

1700
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,931
We've been lying.

1701
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,666
I... I've been lying.

1702
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,038
He's not my baby.

1703
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:44,472
Max is not my husband.

1704
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:47,008
That is not my house.

1705
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:48,276
And that whole perfect

1706
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,355
mother-daughter
relationship thing

1707
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:53,982
is absolutely
100% not the thing...

1708
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,884
I'm not "Jen T".

1709
01:10:57,854 --> 01:10:59,187
I'm not inspirational.

1710
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,656
I'm not aspirational.

1711
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:02,958
I am a bus crash,

1712
01:11:02,993 --> 01:11:04,826
and a train wreck,

1713
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,228
and everything that you've seen
over the last few days...

1714
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:09,665
...it wasn't me.

1715
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:14,869
Jen,

1716
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:17,138
what is going on here?

1717
01:11:17,174 --> 01:11:18,494
Is this, like,
an elaborate stunt?

1718
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,810
I can't be "her" anymore,
I'm sorry.

1719
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:26,748
Did you get that?

1720
01:11:26,817 --> 01:11:27,817
- Yes.
- Cut it, cut it.

1721
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,590
Max!

1722
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,036
- Max, I'm sorry!
- Just stop, Jen. Just stop.

1723
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:37,892
I'm so sorry!

1724
01:11:37,928 --> 01:11:39,527
I'm sorry,

1725
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:41,596
because now I realize
this is all...

1726
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:43,898
everything
was just a lie to you.

1727
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:45,867
For me, it wasn't.
I...

1728
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,369
Look, I know it was fake,

1729
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:49,237
but it...

1730
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,272
it felt real to me.

1731
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,774
And that was stupid, though,

1732
01:11:52,843 --> 01:11:55,083
because you don't even realize
what your biggest lie was.

1733
01:11:55,946 --> 01:11:57,545
What do you mean?

1734
01:11:57,581 --> 01:12:00,081
When Charlie and Zoe
asked us why we broke up...

1735
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:03,529
...it wasn't because we thought
we'd be better as friends,

1736
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,687
it was because you walked away.

1737
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:08,623
Max...

1738
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:09,958
we'd been dating six months,

1739
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:11,693
and it was moving so fast.

1740
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:12,794
And I respected that.

1741
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:15,541
I realized something
the last few days...

1742
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:17,132
and...

1743
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,134
or maybe I've known it
all along and I...

1744
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:20,279
I didn't want
to risk our friendship

1745
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:21,236
after we ended things...

1746
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,737
but, Jen...

1747
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:28,376
...I have never...

1748
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:29,644
not loved you.

1749
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:33,882
Max...

1750
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,650
Jen, just...

1751
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,252
just stop, just stop it.

1752
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,790
I can't do this anymore.

1753
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,160
Love me?

1754
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:47,295
No.

1755
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,600
Be your friend
and pretend I don't.

1756
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,970
I think I saw
a tumbleweed go by.

1757
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:32,207
Yeah, the angry mob
that is social media

1758
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:33,775
didn't really love
your outburst.

1759
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,810
Yeah, I can imagine.

1760
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:37,278
I've been staying off it.

1761
01:13:37,314 --> 01:13:38,780
Let's just say

1762
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,015
you don't really wanna see
what they did with the memes.

1763
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:44,853
I'm so sorry, Jen.

1764
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:45,987
It's all my fault.

1765
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,455
I... I pushed and I pushed.

1766
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,457
No, I went with it.

1767
01:13:49,493 --> 01:13:51,793
It's not your fault.

1768
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:57,499
I actually kinda...

1769
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,967
kinda liked some of it.

1770
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:02,170
I liked "Jen T".

1771
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,972
I liked...

1772
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:06,662
...feeling like
I had my life together.

1773
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,879
I liked liking myself.

1774
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:14,516
You do realize
you were being you...

1775
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:19,053
...just plus confidence
and minus self-doubt.

1776
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,690
Yeah, well, maybe.

1777
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,860
Maybe it wasn't exploding
my life over, but...

1778
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,662
maybe I needed to...

1779
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,268
...let go
of who I thought I was to...

1780
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:36,004
become who I was always
meant to be...

1781
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:37,205
or something.

1782
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,179
Now, that is a message

1783
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:45,534
that would ring out
as "Jen-uine".

1784
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:57,458
Hey, everyone,

1785
01:14:57,527 --> 01:14:58,693
it's Jen.

1786
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,695
Actual Jen.

1787
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,264
This is my actual apartment.

1788
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,066
And I... I'm doing this live,

1789
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,402
'cause I...

1790
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:09,971
desperately wanna be real
with you all.

1791
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,646
I... I know...

1792
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:21,115
that no one's really
very fond of me right now.

1793
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:23,585
And I get it.

1794
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,053
It's okay.

1795
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,199
I've spent
the vast majority of my life

1796
01:15:26,223 --> 01:15:27,722
not being very fond of me, too,

1797
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:28,990
so I understand.

1798
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:32,994
But it's Christmas,

1799
01:15:33,063 --> 01:15:37,665
and I think Christmas
is a time for goodness,

1800
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:41,002
<i>and honesty
is a huge part of that.</i>

1801
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,472
<i>And I owe you
an enormous apology.</i>

1802
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,944
I pretended to be "Jen T"

1803
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,247
'cause I...

1804
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,982
couldn't love Jen.

1805
01:15:55,485 --> 01:15:58,186
And...

1806
01:15:58,255 --> 01:15:59,954
because I couldn't
love myself...

1807
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,793
...I couldn't let
anyone else do it either.

1808
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,932
Zoe and Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1809
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:14,302
<i>I know you trusted me,
you opened up to me,</i>

1810
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,937
<i>you believed in me.</i>

1811
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:17,105
And I...

1812
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,006
I realize there's
no coming back from this,

1813
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:18,873
it's a mess.

1814
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:21,776
I am... I'm a mess.

1815
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:25,947
But...

1816
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:29,517
actually,
I'm kind of okay with that,

1817
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:32,987
because, you know,
"bless this mess" or whatever.

1818
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:36,057
<i>Anyway, I just...</i>

1819
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:38,226
<i>I wanted to wish everyone
a happy holiday,</i>

1820
01:16:38,295 --> 01:16:40,194
<i>and that we all have a holiday,</i>

1821
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,195
<i>where we know</i>

1822
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:42,964
nothing's perfect

1823
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,966
and we don't
have to compare ourselves

1824
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:46,834
to anybody else.

1825
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:47,802
And where we realize

1826
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,837
that our family

1827
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:50,873
is pretty much

1828
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,540
<i>just doing their best,</i>

1829
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:53,575
<i>and embrace that.</i>

1830
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,011
And, most importantly,

1831
01:16:57,047 --> 01:17:04,686
where we can be
exactly who we are...

1832
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,321
and that be okay.

1833
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:10,725
So, I am sorry.

1834
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,364
And I say this "Jen-uinely",

1835
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:17,999
from the bottom of my heart.

1836
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,370
Happy holidays, everyone.

1837
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:23,671
Thanks.

1838
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:46,194
You want some help
cooking dinner?

1839
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:47,695
I don't know,

1840
01:17:47,731 --> 01:17:50,365
I haven't so much as microwaved
a tater tot since 1994.

1841
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,534
I need all the help I can get.

1842
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:03,745
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Pete.

1843
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,981
So, I saw the video.

1844
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:09,584
Pretty powerful stuff.

1845
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:12,253
Did you hear from Max?

1846
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:14,656
Mom, I'm okay.

1847
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:15,656
Let's not...

1848
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,058
Look, honey,

1849
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:19,794
I know that you think
that I'm obsessed with love,

1850
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:21,295
because I know that it works.

1851
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:23,731
I want you to know that, too.

1852
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:26,768
All right. Well, I...
I haven't spoken to Max.

1853
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,247
But I saw he took
that job in Portland,

1854
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:29,637
so I guess he...

1855
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:30,738
he's moving there,

1856
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:32,073
and I'm really happy for him.

1857
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,641
Honey, you've gotta
fight for him.

1858
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,678
I saw the way he looked at you.

1859
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:41,616
It's the same way that
your dad used to look at me.

1860
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:43,852
And more importantly,

1861
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,354
it's the same way
you look at him.

1862
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,258
I just need...
give me a second.

1863
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:16,951
I love you, Mom.

1864
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:18,386
I love you, too.

1865
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:20,621
I gotta...

1866
01:19:20,657 --> 01:19:21,956
I'll be back, okay?

1867
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:22,991
Bye, Jen.

1868
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:34,669
You're still in town! Hi.

1869
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:37,171
We were just about to leave
when we saw your story

1870
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:39,040
and thought
we'd come by the store.

1871
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,842
Jen, we obviously

1872
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,354
have to disqualify you
from the contest,

1873
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:43,544
if only to set precedent.

1874
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,912
We were touched by your video,

1875
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:48,049
because, despite everything,
we enjoyed being here.

1876
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:50,151
We enjoyed you.

1877
01:19:51,688 --> 01:19:53,821
And, oddly, it took us
being around the fake

1878
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:55,490
for us to get real.

1879
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,860
We're going to keep trying.

1880
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:00,995
But actually
put in the work this time,

1881
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,741
and we'll be in touch
about a collaboration.

1882
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:04,332
We've got a slot
in our spring issue

1883
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,333
just for you.

1884
01:20:05,368 --> 01:20:06,334
But as Jen.

1885
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:07,201
We only want Jen.

1886
01:20:07,237 --> 01:20:08,237
Yeah.

1887
01:20:10,073 --> 01:20:11,172
Thank you so much.

1888
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:13,274
Yeah, I gotta go.

1889
01:20:13,343 --> 01:20:15,376
Last-minute emergency
Christmas gift thing,

1890
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:16,489
so you have a beautiful day.

1891
01:20:16,513 --> 01:20:17,513
Thank you.
Thank you.

1892
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,383
That's Jen.

1893
01:20:32,462 --> 01:20:33,594
Put that on the thing.

1894
01:20:35,365 --> 01:20:37,965
Okay, turkey's almost ready!

1895
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,367
So, did you hear from Max?

1896
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:40,735
Did he respond?

1897
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,810
Continuing to ask me that
is not helping my anxiety.

1898
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:46,574
Mom!

1899
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:53,247
Pete!
Move, move!

1900
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:55,617
Can I help?

1901
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,086
I'll set the table.

1902
01:21:18,808 --> 01:21:19,907
Hey...

1903
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:21,242
Hey.

1904
01:21:23,513 --> 01:21:24,745
Thanks for coming.

1905
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,249
I would invite you in,

1906
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:29,517
but...

1907
01:21:29,586 --> 01:21:31,130
there's a captive audience
in the hallway

1908
01:21:31,154 --> 01:21:32,954
that thinks I don't know
they're hiding there.

1909
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,290
This is for you.

1910
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:37,925
I thought we agreed no gifts.

1911
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:38,961
We did,

1912
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:40,361
but it's important.

1913
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,769
The same present back to me?

1914
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:51,305
I'm classy like that.

1915
01:21:51,341 --> 01:21:53,381
I just thought it was
the best way to say thank you.

1916
01:21:58,314 --> 01:21:59,825
I was too chicken
to look at the one you gave me,

1917
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:01,382
because...

1918
01:22:01,451 --> 01:22:04,385
I think I knew when I did,

1919
01:22:04,454 --> 01:22:05,786
I'd see it.

1920
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:11,025
The photos you took are...

1921
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,226
they're beautiful.

1922
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:16,831
And I look happy.

1923
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,066
And glowy.

1924
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,735
And like a version of myself

1925
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:23,004
I thought I'd lost...

1926
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,238
a really long time ago.

1927
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:29,677
And in all of them,
I'm looking at you.

1928
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:34,482
You are my best friend
in the whole world.

1929
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:38,319
You know me better than anyone,

1930
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:40,154
so you probably know
I'm terrified right now,

1931
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:41,522
but...

1932
01:22:43,393 --> 01:22:44,992
...Max, I love you.

1933
01:22:46,496 --> 01:22:47,662
I have never not loved you,

1934
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:49,363
and I will always,
always love you.

1935
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,220
What are you doing?

1936
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:14,755
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

1937
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:15,956
I just gotta...
I gotta...

1938
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:17,591
this is really important.
