Your mom's coming in ten minutes.

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,845
- Hey, were you messing with this?
- No.

5
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,948
No! Bet you were.

6
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,858
I bet you were fooling around.

7
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,862

Hello.

Hi, Jane.

- Sure.

- Here you go.
- Yeah, no problem.

OK. See ya.

No! It means I take you instead.

Nice try, tiger.

18
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,855

- Yeah.

This could be wrong. I'll do another one.

32

- Let's tell Mike he's getting a brother.
- Wait.

33
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,872
I'll do another test and then see the doctor.

00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,879
Could you take Mikey for the weekend?

172
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,247
Yeah, of course.

173
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,583
Maybe... maybe a little longer.

174
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,881
As long as you want, John.

175
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,837
We're gonna go lay the floor now.

176
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,317
- When are you gonna bring them?
- They'd like to see you this week.

177
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,116
Sure. Fine, it shouldn't be any problem.

178
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,021
Whoops.

179
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:06,656
You brought me here
just to do that, didn't you?

180
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,429
No, I didn't.
Let me see what I can do here.

181
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,872
This is where you tell me
you're running over budget, right?

182
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,174
Shit. Keep doing that!

183
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,944
I'm sorry, I didn't...

184
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,495
Ask them if they have a light.

185
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,838
- You guys OK?
- We are now.

186
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,568
Yeah.

187
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,271
I trust you'll fix this
before Mr. Cunningham arrives.

188
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,622
Anna?

189
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,300
'Jonathan.'

190
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,188
'You have one message.

191
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,668
'Message received Wednesday 23rd,

192
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,192
'2:30am.'

193
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,605
'Jonathan.'

194
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:12,242
'End of message. You have no messages.'

195
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,944
'You have no messages.

196
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,385
'You have no messages.'

197
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,891
Oh! Please, come. How nice.

198
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,367
- Hello.
- Hi.

199
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,465
- Look, er...
- I was just about to finish with someone.

200
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,603
- I can come back.
- No, it won't take long.

201
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,773
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.

202
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,976
- Thank you.
- This is Sarah Tate.

203
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,247
Let me introduce you to Mr. Rivers.

204
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,221
Sorry, I'm a little...

205
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,225
We've had a breakthrough today.

206
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,419
It's incredible.

207
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,257
It truly is.

208
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,090
- This is ridiculous.
- Stay awhile.

209
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,534
I should get these boxes back to the store.

210
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,004
Sarah, there's no need to hurry.

211
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,030
Make yourself a cup of tea.

212
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,201
I suppose. Thank you.

213
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,135
Would you like one?

214
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,477
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

215
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,244
Thank you.

216
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,815
Mr. Rivers, please.

217
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,289
Oh, er... Excuse me. Please, sit here. Sit.

218
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,827
So, have you heard of E.V.P., Mr. Rivers?

219
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,268
No.

220
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,637
I'm not surprised.
Those that have call us cranks.

221
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:19,371
E.V.P. Stands for
electronic voice phenomenon.

222
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,404
- I'm listening.
- Well.

223
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,611
I'm not a clairvoyant, I'm not a medium,

224
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,312
I don't contact the dead,

225
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,480
the dead contact me.

226
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,648
And, with E.V.P.,

227
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,593
I can hear them,

228
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,255
I can see them, and...

229
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,931
I can record them.

230
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,077
'... I understand... '

231
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,595
'... you shouldn't be... '

232
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,908
- And they are...
- That's right.

233
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,007
People that have passed over.

234
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,663
Is this your job, or a hobby, or what?

235
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,138
I think obsession
would be more appropriate, to be honest.

236
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,231
Now, I wonder where... Ah!

237
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:01,075
Here we are. They don't always appear visually
the first few times.

238
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,913
We tend only to pick up their voices
and people can find that frustrating.

239
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,815
But when it works,

240
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,755
and you see the faces of the people
that you're able to help, like Sarah,

241
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,455
nothing, believe me, nothing comes close.

242
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,131
Mr. Rivers, do you want to hear your wife?

243
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,240
Yes.

244
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,060
'Jonathan.

245
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
'Jonathan.

246
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,965
'Find him.

247
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,241
'Jonathan Rivers.

248
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,267
'Find him.

249
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,945
'Jonathan... Jonathan...

250
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,848
'Rivers...

251
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,445
'Find him, please.'

252
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,138
The frustrating thing about E.V.P.
Is it's not live.

253
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,908
You need to make the recording

254
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,713
and you'll only know
if you've got results when you play it back.

255
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,413
Here. It has milk.

256
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,251
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Excuse me for a moment.

257
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,326
It's an amazing feeling, isn't it?

258
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,591
Er...

259
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,123
It's indescribable.

260
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,194
It took me a few visits to get used to it
but it's addictive.

261
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:10,037
I'm here all the time. He's really helped me.

262
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,478
I try to help him when I can,
so I keep some of this stuff at the store.

263
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,175
- What store?
- I have a bookstore.

264
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,447
Your wife was a wonderful writer, Mr. Rivers.

265
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,024
Yeah.

266
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,363
- So what made you come here?
- My fiancé.

267
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:41,634
He died eight months ago. We've had trouble
deciphering what he's been saying

268
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,607
but this afternoon we cracked it.

269
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
Only two words - "Sarah, yes."

270
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,545
Because, before he died, he promised me
that if it was like they say it is

271
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,848
that he would find a way of getting to me

272
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,878
and letting me know that he's happy.

273
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,958
So, "Sarah, yes."

274
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,661
Oh.

275
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,962
Raymond thinks we probably won't
see him again now but that's OK.

276
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,966
And I've heard what I wanted to hear.

277
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,710
Anna...

278
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,815
this is John.

279
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,887
If there's any way you can hear me...

280
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,520
will you please let me know?

281
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,532
Please.

282
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,093
Just any kind of... Just any kind of sign.

283
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,567
Please.

284
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,160
'Susie.'

285
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,434
'Susie.'

286
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,347
'Susie, I... '

287
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,029
I recorded this a few hours ago.

288
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,736
It's quite faint, so I had to save it as a sound
file on the computer to enhance the sound.

289
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,272
So, um...

290
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,180
- she knows that I visited?
- I believe so.

291
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,911
- So will I get to see her this time?
- No.

292
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,476
This will just be sound. I'm sorry, John,

293
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,351
we have to be a little patient.

294
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,021
Trust me, John,
this is just the beginning. Sit, here.

295
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,723
Now...

296
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,658
If you want to hear it again,
just press that key.

297
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,692
I'll be back in a moment.

298
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,784
'Tell him... because I love him.'

299
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,519
'Tell him... because I love him.'

300
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
'Bastard. Bastard.'

301
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,859
'Bastard.'

302
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,232
What was that?

303
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,135
It's OK, it's OK.

304
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,266
We do have some very bad people out there.

305
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,242
You just have to press that...

306
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,270
and they're all gone.

307
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,807
We've had a step towards visual contact
with Anna. Let's celebrate that.

308
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,978
Here.

309
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,982
They can't all be nice,
they can't all be Anna.

310
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,245
'Susie Tomlinson... smile.'

311
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,350
'Susie Tomlinson... sm... '

312
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,767
Hello.

313
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,503
- 'It's Raymond. Something's happening.'
- Really?

314
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,341
- 'Get over here.'
- I'm on my way.

315
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,949
Hello?

316
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,529
Raymond?

317
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,797
So you'll tell me whatever you find out?

318
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,997
I can't tell you any more
than you'll read in the papers.

319
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,109
Yeah, thanks.

320
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,263
Thank you for coming to the service.
It would've meant a lot to him.

321
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,064
Oh. Thank you for doing this for me.

322
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,336
I'm not sure where to start.
He was working off a disk, so...

323
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,867
Maybe Anna's original tapes
might be in one of these boxes.

324
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,640
You all right?

325
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,575
I still can't believe he's gone.

326
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,147
Well...

327
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,917
- Maybe he'll be in touch.
- I don't know.

328
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,222
Said he'd made enough of a nuisance
of himself when he was alive.

329
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,589
Just doesn't make any sense.
He was helping people.

330
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,963
Wow.

331
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,730
- These go back years.
- 23, to be precise.

332
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,529
"Carol should know."

333
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,100
"Tell Thomas he should."

334
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,169
"Men in the room."

335
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,978
Oh, here's one - "500 dollars still there."

336
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,246
- That's the kind of message I like.
- Yeah.

337
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,199
There we go.

338
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,031
Why do we got so many?

339
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,301
So you can watch your favorite show
and I can watch my favorite show.

340
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,041
Yeah.

341
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,839
OK... Um...

342
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,849
They're showing me something.

343
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,441
It's...

344
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,145
It's, uh...

345
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,652
Willow Avenue.
They're showing me Willow Avenue. Yes?

346
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,423
No. No. No.

347
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,725
Oh. OK.

348
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,168
It's no problem. Sometimes it happens.

349
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,445
Your wife, she passed over recently.

350
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,643
Yeah.

351
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,456
Her passing was difficult.

352
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,318
Yeah.

353
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,918
She was, um...

354
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,061
She's a writer. She was a writer.

355
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,531
Yeah, her words are important.

356
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh...

357
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,103
I'm sorry, the light is way too bright.

358
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,408
It's... it's like these tiny, noisy, little pinpoints.

359
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,118
It's making it hard to see anything at all.
Can you...

360
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,666
- It's electronic voice...
- I know what this is.

361
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,603
- I've been making tapes...
- You shouldn't.

362
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,906
You shouldn't try this by yourself,
it's not safe.

363
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,971
It's like homemade Ouija boards
and teenage séances at Halloween.

364
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,643
E.V.P. Is not good.

365
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,917
We spend years developing
our relationships with our guides

366
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,456
so that we can protect you.

367
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,786
- From what?
- From the ones who like damage.

368
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,154
Cos they are out there and they will find you.

369
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,600
If you're gonna
keep insisting on meddling, then...

370
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,797
Anna, my wife, she sent me a sign.

371
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,137
No. No. Not Anna.
You are misreading everything.

372
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:15,271
Listen, it is one thing to contact the dead,
it is another to meddle,

373
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,610
and you are meddling.

374
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,323
- I just came cos I wanted some help.
- I know, I can help you.

375
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,484
It's just that they are urging me
to tell you to stop.

376
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,461
Right. Thank you.

377
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,529
Mr. Rivers...

378
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,969
Willow Avenue. Are you sure?
They keep showing me Willow Avenue.

379
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,564
No.

380
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:49,705
No Willow Avenue,
no Willow Street, no Willow Terrace.

381
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,982
Mr. Rivers. She was pregnant. Yes?

382
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,694
'We play every day.'

383
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,231
'He says you are happier now.'

384
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,063
'Did I die? '

385
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,772
'Susie.

386
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,572
'Susie Tomlinson...

387
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,276
'smile.

388
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,155
'Susie Tomlinson.

389
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,889
'Smile'

390
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,689
Excuse me. Are you Susie Tomlinson?

391
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,861
- Yeah.
- My name's Jonathan Rivers.

392
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,666
- Hi.
- May I speak to you?

393
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,318
My mother died giving birth to me.

394
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,686
And my grandmother, she tried for years
to make contact with her.

395
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,216
You know, with candles,
darkness and smoke...

396
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,559
- Séances?
- Yeah.

397
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,031
All of that, she tried everything.

398
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,070
She used to tell me...

399
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,968
that when she died she'd let me know
if she found her, if she...

400
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,207
if she found my mother.

401
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,853
Whenever I was sad,
she nagged me to cheer up.

402
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:22,450
She would say, "Susie Tomlinson,
look on the brighter side."

403
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,221
"Susie Tomlinson, lighten up."

404
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,597
"Susie Tomlinson, smile."

405
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,127
They've found each other.

406
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,933
Haven't they?

407
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,642
That's what she wanted me to know.

408
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,426
It's like she didn't really die.

409
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:12,932
I get the call from my father and then, what,
like two days later you come by?

410
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,604
It's like she just carried straight on.

411
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,276
Susie, I don't understand.

412
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,150
I've been getting messages
from your grandmother for a week.

413
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,644
No, that can't be.
She just passed away two days ago.

414
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:51,636
'They are ruling nothing out in the case
of missing mother of two, Mary Freeman.

415
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,673
'It's been nine days since
she left her house... '

416
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,373
- Where are we gonna eat now?
- On our laps.

417
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,820
There you go. It works.

418
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,389
What's that, Dad?

419
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,025
That means it's time for us
to go pack up your gear. Come on.

420
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,967
One, two, three... Hoi!

421
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,833
That's it.

422
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,040
Next week, can I watch a video
and you watch a video like you said?

423
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:57,012
Yep, but only if you're good, and ready
for when your mom comes to pick you up.

424
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,708
OK.

425
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,810
- Daddy.
- Yeah.

426
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,152
Are you gonna be OK?

427
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,632
Yeah.

428
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,898
I promise.

429
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,212
'John.

430
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,949
'John.

431
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,563
'John, my love.

432
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,805
'John. John.'

433
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,478
Anna.

434
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,616
Anna, baby.

435
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,316
'John, my love.'

436
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,450
'Please, get my...

437
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,145
'Please... '

438
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,476
'John.

439
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,753
'John.

440
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,790
'Go.'

441
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,351
- 'Please! '
- 'I know.'

442
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,217
'John, my love.'

443
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,849
'Go.'

444
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,222
'John, my love.'

445
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,257
'Willow Avenue.'

446
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,630
'Go. Go.

447
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,534
'Go now.

448
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,278
- 'Please, John.'
- 'Willow Avenue.'

449
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,815
'Please, John.'

450
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,843
'Willow Avenue.'

451
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,099
Please! Please, get my baby!

452
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,898
Please.

453
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,236
Get my baby. Please.

454
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,100
Please.

455
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,088
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

456
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,929
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, sure.

457
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,198
How's he doing?

458
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,035
He's good. Gets a little better every day.

459
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,331
How are you?

460
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,980
I should...

461
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,212
- Sorry. Thanks again.
- Yeah. OK.

462
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,450
- Mr. Black.
- John...

463
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,823
Mr. Black.

464
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,658
Uh...

465
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:05,327
This is gonna sound strange
but I need to tell you. I went to Willow Avenue

466
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:09,600
because she reached out to me,
she asked for help.

467
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,903
That's the thing. She wanted help.

468
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,477
I am grateful for what you did, Mr. Rivers.

469
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:21,040
My son wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So thank you.

470
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,852
- But now I'd like you to leave us alone.
- Mr. Black...

471
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,584
Carol may have believed
your bullshit but not me.

472
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,626
So you and your sick friends,

473
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,720
you stay the fuck away
from me and my family, you understand?

474
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,755
You stay away.

475
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,446
Number one, they're not dead.

476
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:56,513
When I see them, they're not dead.
She shows me things that haven't happened.

477
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,747
- Things that haven't happened?
- Right.

478
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,517
Number two, she's showing me things
that are here,

479
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,923
not somewhere else where I can't do anything.

480
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,761
She doesn't show me an earthquake in India
or some bomb in the Middle East,

481
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,131
they're here in this city
where I can maybe do something.

482
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,797
I've seen things that haven't happened yet.
You understand?

483
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,238
I can see how you're putting it together.

484
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,435
Putting it...? Putting it together?
What do you mean?

485
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,038
She wants me to help.

486
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,998
I couldn't help Carol Black.

487
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,435
But I can help them.

488
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,297
- 'Jonathan Rivers' office.'
- Karen, cancel my appointments

489
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,701
- for the next few days.
- 'Are you all right? '

490
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,729
I need a few days.

491
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,965
- 'Take care of yourself.'
- Yeah, I will.

492
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,080
'It hurts.'

493
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,281
'Stop.

494
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,744
'She's ours.'

495
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,858
'She's ours.'

496
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,315
'John, my love.'

497
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,615
'Willow Avenue.'

498
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:26,125
'Stop, you pig. Willow Avenue.'

499
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,020
It's the same voice.

500
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,400
When I was at Raymond's,
he had been receiving messages,

501
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,499
angry, violent messages.

502
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,533
Now I'm getting the same thing, Sarah.

503
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:44,375
- But from whom?
- I don't know.

504
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,922
Sarah.

505
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,985
Edith Tomlinson, 207.

506
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,193
I was getting messages
from Susie Tomlinson's grandmother.

507
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,260
She was trying to reach her dead daughter,
Susie's mother.

508
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,434
"Edith Tomlinson. Daughter died
giving birth, tapes 200 to 208."

509
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,278
Susie's grandmother.
She was visiting Raymond.

510
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,112
Probably just a coincidence.

511
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,845
Look for Carol Black, the woman in the car.

512
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,423
Remember what her husband said?

513
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:36,056
"My wife might have been
into that shit but I wasn't."

514
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,598
"Carol Black.

515
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,506
"General interest, tape number 231."

516
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,875
Raymond had lists of clients.
You've seen only two.

517
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,352
I've seen hundreds of faces.
It could be the same with all of them.

518
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,220
I'm in there, you're in there,
Edith, Carol, they're just two people...

519
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,351
- There's too much else.
- It's a coincidence.

520
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:16,095
Mary Freeman. The missing woman.

521
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:21,174
She's on my tapes.

522
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,201
I've seen her.

523
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,237
She's on my tapes.

524
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,882
First they visit Raymond.

525
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,785
Then I see them.

526
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,930
Then they die.

527
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,569
- What are you doing?
- If she's alive, Anna will show her to me.

528
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,906
We don't know
that everyone you see is alive.

529
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,310
Susie's grandmother, Carol Black.

530
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,246
- What about Anna?
- Anna's different.

531
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,181
She's helping me.

532
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,845
- We don't know what's happening here.
- I do.

533
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:09,017
If Mary Freeman's on these tapes, she might
be alive and we might be able to save her.

534
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,312
Sarah! Sarah, come here!

535
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,583
Look at this. Come here.

536
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,461
Come here. Look at this.

537
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,030
Hear that?

538
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,564
That's her.

539
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,004
Oh, my God.

540
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,409
She's alive.

541
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,741
'Go. Go now.'

542
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,215
- Go where, baby?
- John...

543
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,243
Anna, go where?

544
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:15,518
'Please, John. Go! '

545
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,025
Go... go where, baby?

546
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,392
- 'Go now! '
- Go where?

547
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,436
Go where?

548
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,142
Damn it! She's gonna die.

549
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,979
- You don't know that.
- She's on the tape.

550
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,284
She's on the tape. She's gonna die.

551
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,663
'John.

552
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,057
'John.

553
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,515
'It hurts.'

554
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,088
Oh, my God.

555
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,562
Oh, my God.

556
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,174
- What if I don't wake up?
- You will.

557
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,501
I promise you will.

558
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,828
You will stay with me?

559
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,769
Sure.

560
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,266
Sure.

561
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,173
- Promise?
- Promise.

562
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,939
Thank you.

563
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,900
Sarah?

564
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,251
God.

565
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,215
It's as much as we can say.

566
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,484
There's a 30, 40% chance
she might pull through.

567
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,323
Let's hope she's OK.
Thanks again for your help.

568
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:00,794
Mr. Rivers.

569
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:05,061
Neighbors say they saw you on the balcony
when Miss Tate fell. Is that true?

570
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,000
I was trying to stop her.

571
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,798
From falling?

572
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,237
Well, she was on the balcony.

573
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:14,333
Any idea why she was on the balcony?

574
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,776
I don't know. I don't know.

575
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:21,146
All right. I'll give you some time
but we'll need a full statement from you.

576
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,809
Are you heading home soon?

577
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:30,158
I'm not leaving town,
if that's what you mean.

578
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,193
OK. I may come by later then.

579
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,370
John.

580
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,707
Hey.

581
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,012
You're gonna be OK.

582
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,109
You're gonna be fine.

583
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,780
It hurts.

584
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,696
It hurts.

585
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,603
'John.

586
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,410
'Go.

587
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,751
'Go now, John.

588
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,861
'Go.

589
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,057
'Go now.

590
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,796
'Please, John.'

591
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,508
No.

592
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,173
Mr. Rivers?

593
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,991
- Hello.
- 'This is John Rivers.

594
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,961
- 'I think I've found Mary Freeman.'
- Hello.

595
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,162
I'm at pier 16. Can you hear me, Smits?

596
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,762
Damn it.

597
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,160
Oh, my God!

598
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:32,022
'John.

599
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,365
'John, my love.

600
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,794
'John.'

601
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,206
Anna.

602
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,551
Anna, you have to help me, please.

603
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:03,287
- 'Go.'
- Anna, you have to help me find Mary.

604
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,494
'Please, John.

605
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,703
'Please, John.

606
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,764
'Go now.

607
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,268
'Go now.

608
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,890
'Please, John.'

609
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:36,556
'Go now.

610
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:23,364
They talk to me, John.

611
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,431
This was their idea.

612
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,808
All their idea.

613
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,361
She was beautiful, John.

614
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,064
I brought her to them.

615
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,197
They were very pleased with me.

616
01:27:57,138 --> 01:28:00,198
'... Argyle Avenue,
suggests she may have slipped... '

617
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,438
'Damage to the head, the break to the arm... '

618
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,173
Anna!

619
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,682
This was their idea.

620
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,544
You guys OK?

621
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,160
No!

622
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,657
She's ours!

623
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,196
Men in the room.

624
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,310
Sir?

625
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,721
O God of grace and glory,

626
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:43,232
we remember before You this day
our brother Jonathan.

627
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:47,298
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life

628
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,400
so that in quiet confidence...

629
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,810
'I'm sorry.

630
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:12,218
'I'm sorry.

631
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,623
'I'm sorry.

632
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,727
'I'm sorry, Mikey.'

633
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:29,304
Let's go.

634
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,143
We commit the body to the ground.

635
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:15,053
From earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

636
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,090
dust to dust.

637
01:33:54,895 --> 01:33:57,090
# Last time I talked to you

638
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,827
# You were lonely and out of place

639
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:03,870
# You were looking down on me

640
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:06,873
# Lost out in space

641
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:09,603
# Laid underneath the stars

642
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,976
# Strung-out and feeling brave

643
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:15,882
# Watch the riddles glow

644
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:18,783
# Watch them float away

645
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:27,586
# Down here in the atmosphere

646
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,256
# Garbage and city lights

647
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:34,024
# You gonna save your tired soul

648
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:37,003
# You're gonna save our lives

649
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:39,563
# Turned on the radio

650
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:42,167
# To find you on satellite

651
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:45,911
# I'm waiting for the sky to fall

652
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:48,346
# I'm waiting for a sign

653
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:51,317
# And all we are

654
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:55,152
# Is all so far

655
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:59,091
# You're falling back to me

656
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:03,460
# The star that I can't see

657
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,158
# I know you're out there

658
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:08,032
# Somewhere out there

659
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:11,095
# You're falling out of reach

660
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:15,575
# Defying gravity

661
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:17,167
# I know you're out there

662
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,236
# Somewhere out there

663
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:33,419
# Hope you remember me

664
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:36,395
# When you're homesick and need a change

665
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:39,225
# I miss your purple hair

666
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:43,127
# I miss the way you taste

667
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,536
# I know you'll come back some day

668
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,064
# On a bed of nails I wait

669
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:52,441
# I'm praying that you don't burn out

670
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,710
# Or fade away

671
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,650
# And all we are

672
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:00,848
# Is all so far

673
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:05,291
# You're falling back to me

674
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:09,763

676
