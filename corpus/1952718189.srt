1
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:08,459
Whoa! Hey, hey! Whoa!

2
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:14,173
Doggone it! Get this piece of junk out
of here, unless you're prepared to drown!

3
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,467
Officer, I'm trying. It's stalled.

4
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:19,512
Put your vehicle in neutral.
Turn your wheel left.

5
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,473
It's a friggin' mess down here.

6
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:26,352
So, are we all gonna die?

7
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:30,523
Yeah, we're all gonna die. Just not yet.

8
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,488
But I am gonna have to let out more.

9
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,867
My worst was sweet 16. I had mono.

10
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,828
What was your worst birthday, Wayne?

11
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:48,082
Are you kiddin'? Could I possibly
have had a birthday worse than this?

12
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:52,128
- What kind of loser do you think I am?
- Don't answer that, Phil.

13
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:56,466
Hank's gonna open a gate. We expect
another surge. Let's move these cars.

14
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:03,556
Well, hello, gentlemen!
Hey, Wayne. Happy birthday.

15
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:08,811
Mike, what you're doin'...
I don't know if I'd be here, considerin'.

16
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:13,232
You would if you wanted the last two
paychecks some bastard owed ya.

17
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:17,028
I want you to know, I think
the people here made a big mistake.

18
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:19,363
The people?
You're the one who screwed him.

19
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,035
Mr Mayor, as much as I'd like to stand
here talkin' about how great I am,...

20
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:27,371
..if you don't move,
I'll have to haul your ass off to jail.

21
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,540
OK, OK. I'm goin'.

22
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:32,251
Keep up the good work, boys.
It's appreciated.

23
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,547
Asshole.

24
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:40,802
What do you say we torch that son of
a bitch's house and blame it on looters?

25
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:44,013
Or how about puttin' a dead cow
in his living room?

26
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,893
He comes back after it's been in water
a couple of days... Hello!

27
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,522
You know the best way to get revenge
on the mayor and his boys?

28
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,858
You do exactly what we're doin'...
you protect the town.

29
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:05,243
- Think you could go a little faster, pal?
- I'm goin' as fast as I can.

30
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,630
Hey, wait!

31
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:22,218
- Excuse me?
- You forgot to sign.

32
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,519
Stay dry, now.

33
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,691
Watch your back.

34
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,318
For Christ's sake!

35
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:43,364
Charlie, it's a flood.
You're gonna get a little wet. Take it easy.

36
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,117
- Dispatch, this is 31.
- Go ahead, 31.

37
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:49,120
We're leavin' Huntingburg.
We'll be back in an hour.

38
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:52,957
- Ten-four. Get outta there.
- We're gone. Over and out.

39
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,712
What?

40
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,382
- Your ear.
- What about my ear?

41
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:05,011
- You got major hair growth in there.
- Shut up.

42
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:09,765
I'm serious. Somebody should get in there
with a weed whacker, clean that mess up.

43
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:11,934
Here.

44
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:16,647
You're givin' me one of your doughnuts? I
don't know what to say. I'm gettin' misty.

45
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,066
Shut your mouth and you can have 'em all.

46
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,486
I start eatin' these,
I'll never get out of this truck.

47
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:26,115
I just love how you think
you're better than all this.

48
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:28,242
What's not to like, Charlie?

49
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,997
The dashing polyester outfit
or the solid, three-figure income?

50
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:37,168
I don't believe you!
You ungrateful little shit.

51
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,295
Relax. I was kidding.

52
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,924
So that's all you think I've done, huh?
Just wasted my life away.

53
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,760
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:49,555
Buildin' a home, raisin' a family...

55
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:52,683
- That's just stupid.
- I didn't say that either.

56
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,562
You know what, Tom?
I don't give a rat's ass what you say.

57
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,081
"Thus saith the Lord: 'Behold,...

58
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,835
..waters shall rise up out of the north
and be an overflowing flood,...

59
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:22,755
..and all the inhabitants
of the land shall howl."'

60
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,966
Yes, sir. Jeremiah, Chapter 47, Verse 2.

61
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,762
You're gonna be able to afford
a hell of a lot of Bibles, Ray.

62
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:34,141
Me? First thing I'm gonna do
is to get my brother a lawyer,...

63
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:36,352
..the best that money can buy.

64
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,188
- What's he facin'?
- Thirty in.

65
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,193
- He must've capped a cop or somethin'.
- No. Security guard, in the commission.

66
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,071
He's got some piece of shit PD...

67
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,906
Kenny.

68
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,409
Kenny, take a look at 26 across.

69
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,914
- Shit, Jim. I don't do crosswords.
- Just look at it.

70
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,335
- Let me take a look at it.
- Never mind, Mr Mehlor. Kenny can read.

71
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,921
26 across.

72
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,968
"Mention money again and I'll..."

73
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,644
Did I get it right?

74
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,731
Yeah, Jim, you got it right.

75
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,943
What a dope.

76
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,005
- Jerk.
- Jackass.

77
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:52,720
- Come on. Give us a kiss, huh?
- Get outta here! Get out, ya...

78
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:58,559
- You really are a touchy old fart.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:03,022
What was that about? I'm sittin' there
and all of a sudden you go postal on me.

80
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,357
I dunno. I...

81
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,610
It's just this weather.

82
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:10,196
I just wanna get back.

83
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:14,909
I do appreciate what you've done for me.
This is a good job.

84
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:17,870
No, it's not. It stinks.

85
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,415
Puttin' your ass on the line
for somebody else's money.

86
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:34,595
- Where the hell's the road?
- It's there... somewhere.

87
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:40,392
Look, Tom, I don't care
what you end up doing.

88
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,019
Aw, Jesus, here we go.

89
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:46,190
I just think that, whatever you do,
it's time you did some heavy lifting.

90
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:48,025
- Stop.
- No, you gotta hear this.

91
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,278
- Stop the truck. We're goin' downhill!
- Oh, Jesus!

92
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,458
Wow!

93
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,173
All right, back up.

94
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,553
Slow, slow, slow.

95
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,571
Goddamn it!

96
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:39,243
- There's a dip in the road up there.
- I knew this would happen.

97
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,497
I'll go see if there's anybody around
to give us a lift.

98
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:47,459
Dispatch? Dispatch, this is 31.

99
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,628
31 calling Dispatch.

100
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,715
We're stuck outside of Huntingburg.

101
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,849
Right by a sign...

102
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,145
..saying "Welcome to Huntingburg".

103
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,902
The town's been evacuated.
We won't get help from there.

104
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,070
Dispatch can't get anyone out.

105
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:18,073
They are aware we're carrying
a shitload of money?

106
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,326
They called the National Guard.

107
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:23,996
- They'll be here in a couple of hours.
- Couple of hours?

108
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,375
Shit.

109
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,184
Henry...

110
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:49,146
I saw ya. Come on out.

111
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:54,443
Henry! I'm not leavin'
till you come out.

112
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,530
He's not comin' out.

113
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:04,244
Henry, close the door. Don't go
out there, Henry. Get back in here.

114
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,789
Why are you two still here?
Need some help?

115
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,625
- No, we're just...
- We're setting traps.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,670
That's illegal, Doreen.

117
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,591
You gonna arrest us, Sheriff?

118
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:22,888
Hell, are you even sheriff any more,
Sheriff? Didn't you lose an election?

119
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,140
I sure as hell know
I didn't vote for you.

120
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,518
- Neither did Henry.
- Doreen!

121
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,437
Look, you don't need to set traps.

122
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:34,483
That's what they said in '73.
What the bastards didn't steal,...

123
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,568
..they broke, just for the hell of it.

124
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,570
That's not happening this time.

125
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,907
- Damn right it's not!
- Look, you can't stay.

126
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:44,743
- We're goin' to my sister's now.
- Good.

127
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,705
As soon as we finish
setting the traps.

128
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,086
Well, I'm sure glad one of us
has a backbone. Leave it up to you and...

129
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:58,382
God'll understand if you have to drown her
in the basement, Henry.

130
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:05,347
- We gotta get outta here.
- What about the money?

131
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:08,976
The money's safe, we're not.
The water rose a foot in 20 minutes.

132
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:12,980
The National Guard won't be here
any time soon. You do the math.

133
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,180
Hello!

134
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,978
- Hello!
- Hello!

135
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:58,150
- You all right? Are you stuck?
- Yeah!

136
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:02,738
OK! We're gonna try and help you get out.
All right?

137
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,326
Looks like we're gonna
get outta here.

138
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:12,289
- Why'd they do that?
- Uh... Probably just to see us better.

139
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,334
So we can't see at all.

140
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:21,298
Now listen up. This is my retirement fund.
Don't anybody screw it up.

141
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:24,968
You hear me, Kenny? Kenny!

142
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,596
- Get your head outta your ass.
- Yup.

143
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,558
Only Dispatch and the National Guard
know we're here.

144
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:36,605
Come on. Anybody with a scanner from
RadioShack could've picked up our signal.

145
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,526
- Could you turn down those lights?
- Yeah! We'll bring you some rope!

146
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:43,529
We're goin' blind!
Turn down those lights!

147
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:47,157
- We're coming right over!
- Turn down your lights!

148
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:48,784
Tom! Take it easy!

149
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:49,910
Jim? Jim?

150
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,912
Get in the truck, Charlie.

151
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,209
- Kenny, what are you doin'?!
- Oh, shit!

152
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:01,421
- What did I tell you?
- He went for his gun!

153
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,549
Stop shooting!

154
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,677
Stop shooting!

155
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,223
Stop shooting!

156
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:18,188
Charlie!

157
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,692
Goddammit, Kenny!

158
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,861
Goddammit!

159
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,073
Hey!

160
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,076
Everybody all right down there?

161
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:36,832
Charlie...

162
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:40,794
Sorry, Tom.

163
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:44,464
Jesus. Oh, God.

164
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,509
Damn. Damn!

165
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,145
Hey!

166
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,774
Look, we just want the money!

167
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,986
You guys...

168
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,155
You guys walk away!

169
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,825
We won't kill ya! OK? How's that?

170
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:16,663
You got 30 seconds!

171
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,792
Walk away!

172
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:28,258
Come on, guys, the clock is tickin'!
What's it gonna be?

173
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,558
Shit.

174
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,444
Son of a bitch. Ray...

175
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,872
Your father would be real proud, Kenny.

176
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,375
- He was goin' for his gun!
- Shut up.

177
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:48,547
Mr Mehlor, I think we're gonna need
your science project.

178
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:51,592
You teach your students
how to make things like that?

179
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:55,554
Been in a high school lately? My students
taught me how to make them.

180
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,723
Come on, come on.

181
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,991
I'll be damned! Damn!

182
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:29,379
Now, why would he do that?

183
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,467
- He's tryin' to stay alive.
- What?

184
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,179
Figures as long as we don't know
where the money is, we won't kill him.

185
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,514
There could be another possibility.

186
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:43,393
He could be thinkin' about
keepin' that money for himself.

187
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,108
That is a possibility. Either way,
we're dealing with a slippery one.

188
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,278
Jim, what are we gonna do now?

189
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,948
Pretty soon this water will be
too deep for him to run in.

190
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:00,577
But it'll be just deep enough for us.

191
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,900
Mr Mehlor.

192
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,868
Whoo-hoo!

193
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,417
We should take a car too, huh?

194
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,672
Hey, Jim, what about
this big bad boy here, huh?

195
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,383
- It's got a big canopy.
- Nah, this is all we need.

196
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,678
We're stealin', Jim.
Can't we just take anything we want?

197
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,765
Water's not very deep yet. We need
something with a shallow draught.

198
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:06,727
Mr Mehlor, find us some gas.

199
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:09,688
Oh. Jim. Jim!

200
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,405
Whooo-hoo!

201
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,280
There he is!

202
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,397
Jim!

203
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:36,650
Jim, over here!

204
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,195
The window. The window's broken.

205
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:42,197
Let's get in and get him out.

206
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:45,450
But whatever you do,
don't shoot him!

207
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,078
Not till we find out
where that money is!

208
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,603
Did you see that?!

209
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,041
Where'd you go?

210
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,670
Where'd you go?

211
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,048
Hey!

212
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,596
Come back here!

213
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,538
- Ramming speed!
- Watch your step.

214
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:15,665
Aargh!

215
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:25,884
Low tide, sailor.

216
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,563
Yo! You see him?

217
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,399
- What the...? He's over here!
- Shit.

218
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:43,943
Hey, Jim! Jim!

219
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:47,614
He's over this way!

220
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,698
Yeaaaaah!

221
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,751
Damn.

222
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,873
Shit.

223
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,090
Nice driving, butt-wipe!

224
00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:32,093
- Serves you right for takin' my jacket!
- Get off me, man!

225
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,931
I'm glad you're enjoyin' yourself. But
if he's dead how do we find the money?

226
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:39,100
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

227
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:45,190
He's still alive.

228
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,952
Ray, I'm gonna need
a little inspiration, son.

229
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:04,167
"With the raging flood, He makes an end
of those who oppose Him...

230
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:07,337
..and He pursues His enemies
into darkness."

231
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:12,759
- That's from a more obscure...
- I don't mean to interrupt Bible study,...

232
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,887
..but has anybody realised
how screwed we are?

233
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:21,476
We should be back in the motel room
right now, countin' our money... Argh!

234
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,773
Nobody likes this particular
turn of events, Kenny.

235
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,735
But we have a choice.
We can deal with it or we can walk away.

236
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:33,738
It's a lot of money,
so I choose to deal with it.

237
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:36,032
You wanna go? Fine. Start swimming.

238
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,201
You wanna stay? That's fine too.

239
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,662
But stop your goddamn whining!

240
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:45,125
Loser.

241
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:59,908
- Why are you here?
- I was setting the pumps.

242
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:05,079
- I don't get what you see in that church.
- I don't expect you to, Wayne.

243
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:09,250
Karen, did you think the order was
for everyone but you to evacuate?

244
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:12,128
No. I was gonna go
as soon as I filled the pumps.

245
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,715
But the next thing I know,
I got a looter on my hands and...

246
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:21,221
Maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting
a little... I don't know... gratitude?

247
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:26,225
- I think it's great, what you did, Karen.
- That'll get you into her pants, Phil.

248
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:28,686
That's not what I meant, Wayne.

249
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:30,855
All right, all right!

250
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,399
OK?

251
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,904
What if he'd had a gun, Karen?
A lot of looters carry guns.

252
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,281
I'm not a looter.

253
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:46,871
- Jim, he may not even be in this school.
- Keep lookin'.

254
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,040
You're wasting ammo. Use this.

255
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:52,251
Kenny! If you're not dead, get up and help.

256
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:58,758
God... dammit!

257
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:12,021
- Why were you at the church?
- I told you. He was looting it.

258
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:14,315
I just said I'm not a looter.

259
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:17,235
You're the one who nailed me,
aren't you?

260
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:21,572
- What the helI'd you hit me with?
- It was a crucifix.

261
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:25,326
What? That was all that was there.

262
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:29,664
Great. People will come around the world
to see the face of Jesus on my forehead.

263
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:34,293
- Son, what were you doin' in the church?
- I was looking for a place to hide.

264
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,505
From what? Swamp Thing?

265
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,842
From the guys who killed my partner.

266
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:50,893
I work for Armoured Transports. They
must've picked up our call to Dispatch.

267
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,439
They knew exactly where we were.
Then all hell broke loose.

268
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:58,192
- How much money did you have?
- A little over three million.

269
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:02,822
The bank had us cleaning out branches
up and down the river.

270
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:06,743
- They stole three million dollars?
- No, I don't think so.

271
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:09,912
You took the money, didn't you?

272
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:15,084
Yeah, I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it
to a crypt for some guy named... Portman.

273
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:19,338
- What the helI'd you do that for?
- I don't like to carry that much cash.

274
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:23,468
Wayne, use your head for something
besides wearing your hat.

275
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:27,013
If he hadn't hid the money,
they'd have killed him too.

276
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,433
Get out two shotguns and a rifle.

277
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,187
- You got any ID?
- Uh, no. I left it in the truck.

278
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,356
Colour me surprised

279
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,944
- Do you believe him?
- Well, yes, Wayne, I do.

280
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:45,073
And even if I didn't,...

281
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:50,078
..I'd say we sure as hell have an obligation
to check it out. Don't you think?

282
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:55,166
- I'll go with you, show you where it is.
- I think you'd better stay put.

283
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,126
- That was a smart move...
- Yeah.

284
00:30:57,293 --> 00:31:00,088
We don't need
no armoured-car guy's help. Ow!

285
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:04,050
Wayne, what's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you on this job?

286
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:07,011
When old Mrs Dugan went after you
with a paint scraper?

287
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,430
This man just got shot at.

288
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,974
Phil, Wayne and I
will check out the cemetery.

289
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:16,312
Escort Slugger here out of town. Get her
to some high ground, then come on back.

290
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,397
Uh...

291
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:22,026
Um... I really have to
fill those pumps.

292
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:24,695
Not any more you don't.

293
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,241
Wayne...

294
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,409
He could still be lyin'.

295
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:38,918
Sheriff, they killed my partner
without any warning.

296
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,088
And they're gonna regret that.

297
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:48,010
- Phil, you take Karen in her boat.
- You got it, Sheriff.

298
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:07,822
You can do it, Phil. The men
of Huntingburg are countin' on ya!

299
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:12,201
Bite me, Wayne.

300
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,097
Just perfect

301
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:40,771
Phil, I don't know if you noticed
those stained-glass windows,...

302
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:44,400
..but do you know how much work
I've put into them? Do you know?

303
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:47,778
Please! It'll take five minutes
to fill those pumps!

304
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:51,324
Look, Karen. You know I'd do
just about anything for you.

305
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:56,495
But the sheriff told me to take you outta
town. I'm sorry. It's for your own good.

306
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:01,542
- What are you doing?
- If you won't take me, I'll have to swim.

307
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:06,088
- Nobody's swimming. Karen, sit down.
- Wait a minute. This is my boat.

308
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:11,677
You swim!

309
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:13,846
Karen!

310
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,647
Shit!

311
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:25,483
Goddammit! Come on!

312
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,164
Sheriff, come in.

313
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,046
Sheriff, a lot of water
is comin' your way!

314
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:19,829
Oh... God!

315
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:30,047
Hey! Look out!

316
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:54,530
Oh, no!

317
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:57,491
Help!

318
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,359
Jesus.

319
00:35:33,652 --> 00:35:35,863
Hang on, Ray.

320
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,827
Kenny! Get that jet ski!

321
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:37,967
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on!

322
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,556
Oh, yeah.

323
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:08,831
Perfect. I can drive outta here.

324
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:44,700
Wayne, you locked him in.

325
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:55,039
Come here!

326
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:05,049
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, never better.

327
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,971
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

328
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:14,933
- What happened?
- I don't know.

329
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:20,022
- Another levee must have broken.
- Ah. Great.

330
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,317
Let's get outta here.

331
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,578
It's them. Let's go!

332
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:37,831
Kenny! Go that way!

333
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:40,125
All right!

334
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,384
Whoo-hoo!

335
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:00,813
Come on!

336
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm gonna get your little punk ass!

337
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,912
Come on! Where are you?

338
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:21,375
Whooh!

339
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,378
- Tell them where the money is.
- I can't.

340
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,381
- Well, I can!
- Listen to me. Listen!

341
00:41:32,177 --> 00:41:34,221
If they know where it is, they'll kill us.

342
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:36,390
- Whooh!
- Down!

343
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:43,230
Yee-ha!

344
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:56,744
- So what do we do now?
- Just drive around till we run outta gas?

345
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,247
I spent months restoring that church.
I left it to save your ass.

346
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:02,416
So spare me, OK?

347
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,586
All right.

348
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:08,881
We'll go down here
till we find a place for you to lay low.

349
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:14,261
I'll go back to the truck and wait for the
National Guard. They should be here soon.

350
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,515
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

351
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:20,768
I think the heater just kicked in.

352
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:31,153
- At least we're out of the rain, right?
- Oh, yeah. This is real cosy.

353
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:41,872
Is he dead?

354
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:49,004
- Is he dead?
- No. Somebody must've gotten him out.

355
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:52,674
- Who?
- I dunno.

356
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:55,636
- Maybe Karen?
- Karen?

357
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:59,389
How the hell could she have?
You took her outta town.

358
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:03,060
- Well, yeah, I...
- Let's hear it, Phil.

359
00:43:04,895 --> 00:43:07,773
Well, it happened real fast. OK?

360
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:13,779
Have you ever been robbed before?

361
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:16,824
No. I've only been doin' this
a couple of months.

362
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,534
Oh.

363
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,702
Yeah, I used to... uh...

364
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,705
..sell construction machinery.

365
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,920
I was doin' all right. It just, uh...
didn't really seem right any more.

366
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:32,714
So how'd you end up doin' this?

367
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:35,384
My Uncle Charlie did me a favour
and got me in.

368
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,553
Nice favour

369
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:40,389
So what's he gonna say after tonight?

370
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:44,476
He was my partner in the truck.

371
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:47,020
Oh.

372
00:43:47,187 --> 00:43:49,106
Sorry.

373
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:51,400
Yeah.

374
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:54,319
Does she know karate or something, Phil?

375
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,614
Maybe kung fu!

376
00:43:57,781 --> 00:44:01,451
I just can't see how else
she could overpower the likes of you.

377
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:04,204
- Just shut up, Wayne.
- Shut up, both of you.

378
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:07,666
Let's go find Karen
and see if she's got him.

379
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:16,925
I wonder whose car this is.

380
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:21,847
Whoever it is,
they like Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and...

381
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:24,141
Oh. The soundtrack to Footloose.

382
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:26,059
Really?

383
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:29,062
Oh, my God.
This is my car from high school.

384
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,905
Maybe we should get outta here, huh?

385
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,481
Get your feet out of the water.

386
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:20,239
Whoo!

387
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:25,786
- Oh, shit. This thing's metal.
- Oh, God.

388
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:28,580
Let's get off!

389
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:33,961
- I got him!
- No!

390
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:39,883
- I got him!
- Listen. We gotta get...

391
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:48,600
Get out of the water!

392
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,489
Come on, get out!

393
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:05,993
Get out of the water!

394
00:46:06,618 --> 00:46:10,956
- The transformer's gonna blow!
- Hurry! It's gonna blow up!

395
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:19,381
Hurry up! Come on over here!

396
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,592
No, no, no! Over here!

397
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:25,012
Get off of that thing! It's metal!

398
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:27,097
Come on! Give me your hand!

399
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:28,890
Give me your hand!

400
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,747
Jim, down here.

401
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:53,915
What the hell is goin' on?

402
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:11,767
Oh!

403
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,152
Careful. Watch your step.

404
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,362
You so much as breathe funny...

405
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:27,199
..and your head goes out that window
without you.

406
00:47:28,408 --> 00:47:30,827
Jim! Jesus... Kenny!

407
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:33,038
Hold on. Jesus Christ!

408
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:34,915
Kenny!

409
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,583
Jim! Kenny.

410
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:42,631
- Come on, Kenny.
- Jesus Christ!

411
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:46,384
Now put your hands up real slow.

412
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:48,804
Like you were in a big jar of molasses.

413
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:55,185
- That's it.
- Doreen, haven't killed anybody, have ya?

414
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:58,605
I've got everything under control, Henry.
Go back to sleep.

415
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,108
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

416
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:04,402
Jesus, Doreen!

417
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:06,780
You caught a whole gang!

418
00:48:09,157 --> 00:48:11,993
Smells like somethin' died in there.

419
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:15,205
- Well?
- They're not there.

420
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:19,668
Where in the hell could they go?
They don't have a boat.

421
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:22,504
I don't know.
And, frankly, I don't care.

422
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:30,679
- It hurts.
- You're gonna be all right, Kenny.

423
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:34,558
Mr Mehlor knows about these things
and he thinks so.

424
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:39,896
Ain't that right, Mr Mehlor? Don't you
think Kenny's gonna be all right?

425
00:48:41,273 --> 00:48:44,276
Yeah. Yeah, Kenny,
you're gonna be just fine.

426
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:48,071
I know that you...
you didn't want me to come, Jim.

427
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:53,160
What are you talkin' about? We couldn't
have done anything without you.

428
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:02,878
The pain... is goin' away.
The pain is goin' away. I'm OK.

429
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:05,088
Ah. See? What did I tell ya?

430
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:15,682
When you said
that I was gonna be all right,...

431
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:17,851
..I thought you were shittin' me.

432
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:22,689
I wouldn't shit you, kid.
I wouldn't shit you.

433
00:49:22,856 --> 00:49:25,525
See? You... just gotta...

434
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,652
You just gotta...

435
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,532
..trust me.

436
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:47,422
Well, isn't that just wonderful

437
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:50,383
Now those bastards
are gonna want to kill us too.

438
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,012
- Why did you have to pick this house?
- We thought it was empty.

439
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:57,140
You know what?
The house next door is empty.

440
00:49:57,265 --> 00:50:00,852
What do you say we go back downstairs
and you two keep moving?

441
00:50:01,186 --> 00:50:03,522
We're not sending them out to the wolves!

442
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:07,734
Oh, we're not, are we? Well,
what's your plan, General Schwarzkopf

443
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:10,153
- I just don't think...
- I have to go anyway.

444
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,657
The National Guard will be
at the truck soon. I should meet them.

445
00:50:13,823 --> 00:50:15,825
- He can use our boat.
- Henry!

446
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:20,372
- Well, he can't swim that far.
- Henry, they are not taking our boat!

447
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:24,251
Oh, fine, then!
Why don't you give them the TV set too?

448
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:26,753
And what about the china? Or our silver?

449
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,631
- I'm Tom.
- Watch yourself, Tom.

450
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:31,967
I don't wanna have to
save your life again.

451
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:37,681
Henry! Don't you ignore me!
You get right back up here this min...

452
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:38,848
Henry!

453
00:50:42,102 --> 00:50:43,853
Here you go.

454
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:55,073
You give away our only boat
in the middle of a flood.

455
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,035
You are a genius, Henry.
A regular Einstein!

456
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,204
You wanna come with me?

457
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:06,918
Jesus, Henry! What are you waiting for...
a kiss goodbye? Get in here!

458
00:51:08,336 --> 00:51:11,047
- Thanks.
- Look at my curtains!

459
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:15,218
- Put that window down now!
- All right, all right.

460
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:21,766
Pow! Pow!

461
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:26,271
Why don't we just get him now?

462
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:30,400
Nah. If our resourceful young friend
hears us comin',...

463
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,320
..he'll electrocute us or sink us.

464
00:51:33,486 --> 00:51:35,947
Or one of you knot-heads will shoot him.

465
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:39,200
Besides, I know where he's going.

466
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,788
What I'd like to know
is where he came from.

467
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,736
Agh! Ugh!

468
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:25,121
Now, I know it's your job
to protect that money, son.

469
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:29,918
But before you try anything tricky,
there's something I want you to see.

470
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,337
Aw, shit.

471
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:35,840
You may be foolish enough
to give your life to protect that money.

472
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:39,302
The question is,
are you willing to give theirs?

473
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:43,181
I'll show you where the money is,
but you gotta let them go.

474
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:47,769
- Nah. It's better if we all stick together.
- That's the deal.

475
00:52:47,936 --> 00:52:51,272
You say all you want's the money.
Prove it. Let 'em go.

476
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:54,484
We could be safe in our home
instead of out here in this boat...

477
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:56,653
..with these lowlife scumbags!

478
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:08,540
- Let 'em go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

479
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,251
- Right this way, please.
- Out of the water.

480
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,066
Watch your step.

481
00:53:36,317 --> 00:53:40,196
- How about Karen?
- In the attic. They never saw her.

482
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,719
Faster, Henry! The bastards
might change their minds!

483
00:54:02,886 --> 00:54:06,765
Come on! Stop lily-dipping! Move it!

484
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:11,853
What are you doing?

485
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,690
I'm going to row back there
and see if he will shoot you.

486
00:54:16,024 --> 00:54:18,193
Or me. It's fine either way.

487
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:19,360
Henry!

488
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:22,739
- Do you want me to get us outta here?
- Yes, of course.

489
00:54:22,906 --> 00:54:25,325
Then shut the fuck up!

490
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:33,917
Sheriff, there she is!

491
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:51,226
- What the hell is goin' on?
- This happened in a flood in Georgia.

492
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:53,978
The ground gets soggy.
The caskets are airtight.

493
00:54:54,145 --> 00:54:57,023
Anybody who hasn't been planted too long
just pops up.

494
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,819
You teach your students stuff like that,
no wonder they kicked you out.

495
00:55:00,985 --> 00:55:02,570
All right, where is it?

496
00:55:02,737 --> 00:55:06,407
It's kinda hard to tell now
with the water so deep.

497
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:13,456
All right, all right. It's over that way.

498
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:36,062
They're not coming, son.

499
00:55:39,232 --> 00:55:44,445
- The National Guard. They're not coming.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

500
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:50,702
I know you're stalling us, waiting for the
National Guard, but they're not coming.

501
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:53,329
Did you intercept Charlie's call?
Call them off?

502
00:55:53,496 --> 00:55:56,833
Didn't have to call them off.
They never were coming.

503
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:00,920
We didn't intercept Charlie's call.

504
00:56:01,296 --> 00:56:03,423
Charlie called us.

505
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,258
What?

506
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,511
Sheriff, I'd love to help you out,
but I can't leave.

507
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:11,931
Water comes over the top again,
it's bye-bye dam, bye-bye town.

508
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:14,767
Hell, I could use
a little help here myself.

509
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:18,813
Hank! Remember when Jack Finch
was holed up in Mike Crane's barn...

510
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,690
..and said he'd burn it down?

511
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:23,526
Yeah! I got the dumb son of a bitch
to come out.

512
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:27,947
Right. And before you went in,
I deputised you, you dumb son of a bitch.

513
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:32,368
So this is not a request, it's an order:
you get down here now!

514
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:34,829
- I won't need you for long.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:36,998
Bring your gun.

516
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:40,752
We were gonna hit you
just before you got to the interstate.

517
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:45,006
- But you got stuck so we changed plan.
- Bullshit. This is bullshit!

518
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,967
Bullshit!

519
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:52,138
I knew Charlie from when we both worked
for the Johnstown Company.

520
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:56,935
His parents
liked Charlie McCarthy on the radio.

521
00:56:57,101 --> 00:57:00,104
His wife Mary died a year ago
of a heart attack.

522
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:02,815
He had a son and a daughter,
both grown with...

523
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:08,029
Son of a bitch! That was the plan, huh?
Kill Charlie, keep his share of the money?

524
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:17,830
That was an accident.

525
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:22,752
Kenny killed Charlie cos he didn't know
Charlie was on my side.

526
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:25,421
I never told him.

527
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:29,467
Kenny liked to talk.
Shouldn't even have been there.

528
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:34,555
But his father asked me to look after him.
Guess I didn't do too good a job of that.

529
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:38,893
Excuse me, Jim! I hate to interrupt,
but can we just find the money...

530
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,729
..and get the hell outta here?

531
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:44,774
Right.

532
00:57:45,775 --> 00:57:49,487
All right. Now listen.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

533
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:53,324
And before you start
bullshittin' me again, think of this.

534
00:57:53,491 --> 00:57:55,451
I've had a very frustrating night.

535
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:59,080
While I may not find the money
if I kill you,...

536
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:04,168
..I'm at the point now
where I just don't care.

537
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:12,218
All right, I'll tell you where it is but...
I don't think it's gonna do you much good.

538
00:58:21,894 --> 00:58:23,896
Go on, get it.

539
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:40,079
"At night we'd go down to the river,
and into the river we'd dive."

540
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:46,544
That's Springsteen, man. "The River."
I'm all out of Bible quotes.

541
00:58:56,888 --> 00:58:59,932
- Looks like somebody beat you to it.
- What?!

542
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:02,560
Son of a bitch!

543
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,713
Aaargh...

544
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,342
Stop! You'll hit Tom!

545
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,513
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

546
01:00:01,828 --> 01:00:05,206
I know you'd like nothing better
than to shoot me!

547
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:10,127
But, in order to do that, you're gonna
have to shoot through young Tom here!

548
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:22,140
OK.

549
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:40,700
Karen!

550
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:44,871
Karen!

551
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:50,251
That's who you thought
was comin' to rescue you?!

552
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:51,752
Karen!

553
01:00:58,593 --> 01:01:00,303
Watch your head!

554
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:24,577
Somebody mind tellin' me
what the hell's goin' on?

555
01:01:25,244 --> 01:01:27,914
Why, hello, Hank.

556
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:31,834
You know that money I told you about
from the armoured truck?

557
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:35,546
Well... we're gonna keep it.

558
01:01:37,715 --> 01:01:40,718
Three million dollars, four ways.

559
01:01:44,513 --> 01:01:47,475
750 apiece. You OK with that?

560
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:53,522
Hank?

561
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:58,277
- Are you OK with that?
- 750 thousand dollars?

562
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:02,907
You damn straight I'm OK with that!

563
01:02:04,075 --> 01:02:05,910
I don't see what we need him for.

564
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,955
I guess you ain't never
been huntin' with Hank.

565
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:15,127
OK! We got two behind that crypt.
Go get 'em!

566
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:28,307
Maybe I'm not OK with it.

567
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:35,356
- Come on now, Phil.
- You're gonna kill people?

568
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:42,154
They're looters, Phil. They come and steal
from an armoured truck in our town.

569
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:48,536
What about Tom and Karen?
They're not looters.

570
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:51,747
No... They're witnesses.

571
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:02,466
Shit!

572
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:33,748
Look at it.

573
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:41,339
- Some of these bags will be yours, Phil.
- But you're the sheriff!

574
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:51,599
Here.

575
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:59,774
- For 20 years you've looked out for...
- For 20 years, I've eaten shit,...

576
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,944
..breakfast, lunch and dinner!
Well, tonight I'm changin' the menu.

577
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,281
From now on, everything I eat
is gonna be shit-free.

578
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:26,467
Can I make it any clearer, Phil?
You want me to draw you a picture?

579
01:04:27,676 --> 01:04:30,388
- I can't let you do it.
- Oh, for...

580
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:37,603
OK, Phil. Here's how it's gonna go.

581
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,815
I'm gonna hear one of two things
come outta you.

582
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,485
Either I'm gonna hear you say
that you're in with us,...

583
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:48,739
..or I'm gonna hear a bullet
come outta that gun and go into me.

584
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:55,746
750 thousand dollars, or you kill me.
Your choice.

585
01:05:03,754 --> 01:05:05,256
There we go.

586
01:05:20,271 --> 01:05:23,149
Tom! Grab the boat!

587
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:46,714
Thanks.

588
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:51,260
We're goin' too slow.

589
01:05:53,637 --> 01:05:55,431
Take the wheel.

590
01:05:58,851 --> 01:06:00,853
Whoa! Watch it!

591
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:05,774
Come on! Come on!

592
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:21,934
Come on!

593
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:26,605
There you are!

594
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:30,609
Whoa, boy! Where you goin', huh?

595
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:36,240
Son of a bitch!

596
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:52,715
Son of a bitch!
You're pissin' me off!

597
01:08:39,053 --> 01:08:41,305
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

598
01:08:41,472 --> 01:08:43,474
Good.

599
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:47,895
Hank, go get some empty bottles.
We'll smoke 'em out.

600
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:51,106
- You got it.
- Wait. What about the dam?

601
01:08:51,273 --> 01:08:55,319
- It'll be fine.
- If it goes, it'll wipe out the whole town.

602
01:08:56,862 --> 01:08:58,322
Screw the town.

603
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,493
I'll probably get hepatitis or something.

604
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:06,205
Hepatitis? Nah.
That's the least of your problems.

605
01:09:08,707 --> 01:09:11,168
- Where you going?
- There's a room back here.

606
01:09:11,335 --> 01:09:15,172
- I'll look for something to put on this.
- You been here before?

607
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:17,341
Oh, yeah.

608
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:19,676
I saw Jesus!

609
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:32,856
Did Charlie have cancer or something?

610
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:36,026
You mean, why did he get into this?

611
01:09:36,193 --> 01:09:38,570
No, no cancer.

612
01:09:39,363 --> 01:09:42,074
Didn't you ever think about
takin' the money?

613
01:09:42,241 --> 01:09:45,202
- No.
- No? Hah!

614
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:49,790
- I'm happy to disappoint you.
- Yeah.

615
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:54,670
- What are you gonna do with it?
- As little as possible.

616
01:09:57,256 --> 01:09:59,425
- Belize.
- What?

617
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:04,263
Belize. It's a small country
in Central America on the Atlantic side.

618
01:10:04,555 --> 01:10:07,599
I know where Belize is.
What about it?

619
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:12,521
They speak English,
dollar goes a long way,...

620
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:15,149
..beautiful beaches, friendly people,...

621
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:17,943
..liberal banking laws,...

622
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,112
..very liberal banking laws.

623
01:10:20,988 --> 01:10:25,075
Nah. You never once
thought about takin' that money.

624
01:10:27,077 --> 01:10:30,247
You can't ride in that truck
and not think about it.

625
01:10:31,373 --> 01:10:34,084
Reckon that's how it started with Charlie.

626
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:05,782
- What are you doin'?
- Too many bodies with bullets in 'em.

627
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:08,952
I'll take her to her house,
make it look like she drowned.

628
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:10,829
Don't you do it, Wayne!

629
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:14,666
Saving her life might've
actually gotten you laid, Phil.

630
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,710
Don't you touch her!

631
01:11:20,339 --> 01:11:22,132
Get back here!

632
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:25,260
For Christ's sake,
just dump her here, Wayne!

633
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,888
I'm gonna kill you, Bryce!

634
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:30,349
Shit. Where the hell's he takin' her?

635
01:11:36,522 --> 01:11:41,193
Where do you think you're going?
You won't help matters by gettin' shot.

636
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,155
- They're gone. You don't know where.
- The sheriff knows. I'll ask him.

637
01:11:45,322 --> 01:11:47,908
You'd be dead
before you cross the sandbags.

638
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:50,327
They'll come for us.
Ask 'em when they get here.

639
01:11:50,494 --> 01:11:53,497
- What if they don't come?
- I wouldn't worry about that.

640
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:07,594
Whoo!

641
01:12:17,688 --> 01:12:18,647
Sorry, Karen.

642
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:33,620
Wayne.

643
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:37,082
Wayne, what are you doing?

644
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:43,630
"Dear Penthouse,
I always thought your letters were fake...

645
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,341
..until the wildest thing happened to me."

646
01:12:50,762 --> 01:12:51,930
Jesus.

647
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:55,100
- They're not comin' out.
- Fire's not catchin'.

648
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:57,269
We gotta get 'em outta there.

649
01:13:02,357 --> 01:13:07,946
"Her name was Karen, and ever since
she come back from college,...

650
01:13:08,113 --> 01:13:11,783
..she made it clear
that she was too good for us local folk."

651
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,952
"Now here she was in handcuffs."

652
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:18,332
"I said 'What the heck
is goin' on here, ma'am?"'

653
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:21,376
"And she said..."

654
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:27,925
- "And she said..."
- Get off, you psycho!

655
01:13:28,634 --> 01:13:31,011
You really think I'll play your sick game?

656
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:33,055
Why not?

657
01:13:39,686 --> 01:13:41,980
Well, that won't do.

658
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:44,232
You'll, uh... excuse me?

659
01:13:47,569 --> 01:13:49,571
You wait right there, now.

660
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:12,177
Well, I got the candle.

661
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:18,266
Mood lighting.

662
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,229
"It was cold and rainy that night."

663
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:26,817
"All I really wanted was
to get someplace warm and dry."

664
01:14:30,654 --> 01:14:32,864
Are you in the mood yet?

665
01:14:35,701 --> 01:14:36,868
No.

666
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:51,943
Oh, my God!

667
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,617
No!

668
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:00,619
No!

669
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,287
Oh...

670
01:16:02,454 --> 01:16:04,206
Come on... Come on!

671
01:16:43,703 --> 01:16:45,997
Phil! Cover that side!

672
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:19,906
Aargh!

673
01:17:23,493 --> 01:17:25,495
Shit. Shit!

674
01:17:54,024 --> 01:17:55,525
Kill him!

675
01:17:57,152 --> 01:17:58,570
Kill him, Phil!

676
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,079
Don't.

677
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,543
Wuss.

678
01:18:31,269 --> 01:18:33,271
Hey!

679
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:37,025
Where's Karen?

680
01:19:06,096 --> 01:19:08,515
Come on! Where the hell is she?

681
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:17,691
They, uh...
They went back to her house.

682
01:19:17,857 --> 01:19:20,193
Where is her house?

683
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:32,872
What the hell is that?

684
01:19:34,165 --> 01:19:37,377
- Hank?
- The dam. It's topped out!

685
01:19:44,175 --> 01:19:47,595
- How much time we got?
- Not long. It's an old dam.

686
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:53,977
Then I guess you boys
better drop your guns.

687
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:58,857
What?

688
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,736
That's the deal.

689
01:20:04,487 --> 01:20:09,200
You let me and Hank go
with a few of these bags.

690
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:12,329
Just a couple. I'm not greedy.

691
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:15,999
- And I'll tell you where to find Karen.
- Get out of the boat.

692
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:18,251
Hold on.

693
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:19,794
- Hold on?
- Yeah.

694
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:22,839
- It's the only way you're gonna find her.
- No.

695
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:24,841
- It's only a couple of bags.
- No!

696
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:27,385
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean no!

697
01:20:27,844 --> 01:20:31,014
I told you. I'm here for the money
and that's it!

698
01:20:33,725 --> 01:20:35,393
Boyd Street.

699
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,982
She lives on Boyd Street.

700
01:20:42,108 --> 01:20:44,110
Three over.

701
01:20:45,612 --> 01:20:48,865
It's a two-storey with blue siding.

702
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:55,830
Get out of the boat.

703
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:43,503
What are you gonna do?

704
01:21:44,045 --> 01:21:46,047
You're just gonna leave us here?

705
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,300
I oughta shoot you.

706
01:21:54,681 --> 01:21:57,225
Lord knows I ought to.

707
01:22:27,964 --> 01:22:29,966
Tom?

708
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:40,059
I'm handcuffed.

709
01:22:44,147 --> 01:22:46,691
Yeah, you're handcuffed. Oh, boy.

710
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:50,904
There's a saw in the kitchen,
in the cupboard next to the sink.

711
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:55,492
Is that good or bad?

712
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:57,869
That's very bad.

713
01:23:02,957 --> 01:23:05,335
You should've just killed me.

714
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,387
The dam's gone. You gotta go.

715
01:23:18,389 --> 01:23:19,891
No!

716
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:22,101
No!

717
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:25,146
No!

718
01:23:32,445 --> 01:23:33,947
Go faster.

719
01:23:40,828 --> 01:23:42,830
We gotta go faster!

720
01:23:42,997 --> 01:23:45,458
Yeah... You're right.

721
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:21,452
Oh, God!

722
01:24:43,182 --> 01:24:45,602
Aargh!

723
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:36,778
- Well, that didn't work.
- Oh, God!

724
01:25:36,944 --> 01:25:38,237
Wait. The gun.

725
01:25:38,404 --> 01:25:39,947
- What gun?
- Wayne's gun.

726
01:25:40,114 --> 01:25:42,617
- Where is it?
- Try the porch.

727
01:26:35,878 --> 01:26:38,005
Come on, Henry!

728
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:41,300
Forget about going to the light.

729
01:26:41,467 --> 01:26:44,720
Come back to me. You're all I've got.

730
01:26:47,724 --> 01:26:49,726
Oh, Henry. Thank God.

731
01:26:50,852 --> 01:26:53,813
The next time I say
"Let's evacuate",...

732
01:26:54,897 --> 01:26:56,816
..let's evacuate!

733
01:26:57,817 --> 01:26:59,819
Whatever you say, honey.

734
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,773
It's the end of the line, kid!

735
01:27:53,498 --> 01:27:55,500
No, you don't.

736
01:29:05,736 --> 01:29:07,738
You all right?

737
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:10,825
I'm really tired.

738
01:29:12,493 --> 01:29:15,246
But I guess I'll live.

739
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:18,082
Thanks for comin' after us.

740
01:29:18,249 --> 01:29:20,459
You never learn, do you?

741
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:23,212
I came for the money.

742
01:29:25,172 --> 01:29:25,798
Yeah.

743
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,645
You OK?

744
01:31:03,646 --> 01:31:08,359
This is the State Police.
Cease fire and put down your weapons.

745
01:31:12,446 --> 01:31:14,448
You better get outta here.

746
01:31:20,788 --> 01:31:22,790
What about the money?

747
01:31:23,499 --> 01:31:26,544
- Gonna turn it in?
- Gotta turn it in.

748
01:32:13,049 --> 01:32:16,469
- Do you know if my church survived?
- Ah, your church.

749
01:32:16,635 --> 01:32:21,265
Last I saw there was... a little bit of
flood damage on the inside, but...

750
01:32:21,432 --> 01:32:23,559
But what?

751
01:32:23,726 --> 01:32:25,644
I'll give you the good news.

752
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:28,355
The water from the dam
probably put the fire out.

753
01:32:28,522 --> 01:32:30,149
What fire?

754
01:32:30,316 --> 01:32:33,903
Listen. I had nothin' to do with it.
The sheriff started it.

755
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:38,908
This is the State Police. Put your hands
behind your head and remain in view.

756
01:32:41,076 --> 01:32:44,080
- Was it a bad fire?
- Bad fire?

757
01:32:44,246 --> 01:32:46,332
No, no. It was a little fire.

758
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:48,501
Some roof damage.

759
01:32:49,418 --> 01:32:53,923
They probably felt it safe to drive their
boats through the stained-glass windows.

760
01:32:54,256 --> 01:32:56,258
Rain, rain, on my face

761
01:32:58,385 --> 01:33:01,472
Hasn't stopped raining for days

762
01:33:03,057 --> 01:33:05,059
My world is a flood

763
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,062
But slowly I become

764
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:09,814
At one with the mud

765
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:13,901
But if I can't swim after 40 days

766
01:33:14,068 --> 01:33:18,113
And my mind is crushed
by the crashing waves

767
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,284
Lift me up so high that I cannot fall

768
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:24,662
Lift me, oh-oh

769
01:33:26,497 --> 01:33:28,165
Lift me up

770
01:33:28,332 --> 01:33:30,626
When I'm falling

771
01:33:30,793 --> 01:33:32,169
Lift me up

772
01:33:32,336 --> 01:33:34,839
I'm weak and I'm dying

773
01:33:35,005 --> 01:33:36,298
Lift me up

774
01:33:36,465 --> 01:33:39,009
I need you to hold me

775
01:33:39,176 --> 01:33:40,719
Lift me up

776
01:33:40,886 --> 01:33:43,222
Keep me from drowning again

777
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:44,890
Lift me, oh-oh

778
01:33:45,057 --> 01:33:47,351
When I'm falling

779
01:33:47,518 --> 01:33:48,978
Lift me, oh-oh

780
01:33:49,144 --> 01:33:51,689
I'm weak and I'm dying

781
01:33:51,856 --> 01:33:53,274
Lift me, oh-oh

782
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,776
I need you to hold me

783
01:33:55,943 --> 01:33:57,528
Lift me, oh-oh

784
01:33:57,695 --> 01:34:00,739
Keep me from drowning again
