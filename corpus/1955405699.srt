1
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,818
Hey, Ken.

2
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,388
What's up?

3
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,524
You're getting
skinnier on me.

4
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,525
Yeah.

5
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,698
Where's my money?

6
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,468
Your friend was late
four hours last week.

7
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,604
And he's late
again today.

8
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,805
So...

9
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,541
Go have a talk with him.

10
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,649
The talk is happening
right now.

11
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,518
You're going nowhere
until clive gets here.

12
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,257
Ahh.

13
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,616
Never seen no speed limit
on this road, sheriff kilbaught,

14
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,317
so I...

15
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,622
So I made a...
A modest estimate.

16
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:20,659
Never been anything modest
about your modesty, clive.

17
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,728
This truck don't go
a mile over 50, sheriff.

18
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,863
Now, you were driving
a different truck this morning.

19
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,598
I've been watching you
the last few weeks,

20
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,500
driving back and forth,

21
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,936
back and forth,
back and forth.

22
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,272
Now, we both know there
ain't nothing in this town

23
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,740
worth taking
a second look at.

24
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:34,740
Yeah.

25
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,309
That against the law
now, sheriff?

26
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,911
Okay, come on, out.

27
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:43,715
Even your mama thinks
you're a piece of shit.

28
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,785
You don't belong here.

29
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,857
You got me thinking.

30
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,358
Two trucks...

31
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,460
Hauling the same junk
in the same day?

32
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,628
I mean, what's
garbage like you

33
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,963
doing with garbage
like this?

34
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,364
Come on, open her up.

35
00:04:59,366 --> 00:04:59,364
It's the only job
i can get,

36
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:04,603
seeing as how people
are so damn discriminant...

37
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,805
Against those
who have paid their dues.

38
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,473
Discriminant?

39
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,008
Hell of a word
there, clive.

40
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,010
But it ain't your word.

41
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,781
What did you do
with the other truck, huh?

42
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,416
You're gonna
start walking--

43
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,585
hey.

44
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,455
What you got there, boy?

45
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,758
You spit that out.

46
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,959
Spit it out!

47
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,762
You spit that out!

48
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,763
Huh?

49
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,764
Come on, get up.

50
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,833
Get up!

51
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,585
What?

52
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,867
Is it the stew-maker?

53
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,538
Hear the cartel
has a guy,

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,973
dissolves people in acid,

55
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,508
puts them in a barrel,

56
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,678
makes them soup.

57
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,148
Is that who
I'm waiting for?

58
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,083
Is it you?

59
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,520
My job is to place
a call at 7:30.

60
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,655
And if you don't
make the call?

61
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,558
You get put on a list.

62
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,895
And if you get
put on the list...

63
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,897
It's unfortunate.

64
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,604
But if clive isn't here
in the next 15 minutes,

65
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:50,942
soon enough, I'll be
talking to a dead man.

66
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,578
Well...

67
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,882
If I'm already dead...

68
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,692
You're a dead man!

69
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:02,013
You ain't doing too good a job
at staying gone.

70
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,015
You know, sometimes...

71
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,684
I can't get
through an entire day

72
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,652
without hearing
all kinds of rumors

73
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,855
getting told about you.

74
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,790
Like what?

75
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,925
I don't know.

76
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,560
One of my favorite ones
is the one

77
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,229
about you getting murdered
on Indian Ridge.

78
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:20,765
Well, they have the decency
to bury me, at least?

79
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,837
Can't say.

80
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,940
Don't really keep track of
the rumors I didn't start.

81
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,143
Got any rumors about me
being made sheriff?

82
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,084
Sheriff kilbaught ain't
gonna like you coming back.

83
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:42,020
Well, he's gonna find
he ain't got much room to argue.

84
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,190
Maybe I don't
like you coming back.

85
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,730
You know I always
told you,

86
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:55,000
you deserve
better than this.

87
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,544
Marla.

88
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,280
Welcome home, Wallace.

89
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,206
Hey, how come that thing
always stayed broken?

90
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,881
Don't got a phone connection
at my ma's old house anymore.

91
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:47,619
Marla was good
about looking after it, but...

92
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,821
Use that one.

93
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,928
You ever hear anything
about me getting murdered?

94
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,731
Yes, sir,
i believe I have.

95
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,333
They shot you
in the throat.

96
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,601
- Throat?
- Yeah.

97
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,902
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,904
Heard you was mouthing off
like you used to,

99
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:09,641
and somebody just shot you
right there how you stood.

100
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,042
Well, Jerry,

101
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,212
ain't you gonna welcome me
back from the dead?

102
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,685
Asshole.

103
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,361
Armor-piercing.

104
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,396
They call them "cop killers."

105
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,965
Why is that?

106
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,267
On account of them
killing cops.

107
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,842
Do you need it for,
like, DNA?

108
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,678
Forensics lab is two weeks
and 150 miles away

109
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,847
from giving half a shit
about this town.

110
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,650
Bet you no one's
told you that.

111
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,985
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,823
Yep, don't let that
worry you none too much.

113
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,825
You know, are you lonely
for a car?

114
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,961
I get lonely
when I don't have a car.

115
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,663
But I'm not lonely anymore,

116
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:08,333
'cause at Diaz motors
I've got plenty of friends.

117
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,244
Ahh.

118
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,748
You don't got to knock.

119
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,718
I know what you're after.

120
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,153
Come on in.

121
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,356
Yeah?

122
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:43,735
You are scared shitless.

123
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,170
What did you know
about that?

124
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,771
There's just the matter
of this job

125
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,307
you come to do.

126
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,177
Six reported incidences
of harassing motorists,

127
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,112
two with brutality.

128
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,916
Then there's you,
crossing the line.

129
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,218
No, that ain't it.

130
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,187
It's been a long time
coming, Leland,

131
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,356
the way you've
been running things.

132
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,459
If you ain't scared
of what needs to be done,

133
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,028
then you ain't got
no clue why you're here.

134
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,731
I got sent here
to replace you.

135
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,832
Maybe a day too late,

136
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,333
but replace you
nonetheless.

137
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,801
You got sent here

138
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,771
because it's your
punishment, Wallace.

139
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,006
Taking your statement,
is all.

140
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,312
You fetch me some water,
would you?

141
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,980
Hmm?

142
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,184
Hm.

143
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,354
You have no idea
what that...

144
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,891
That boy clive
was threatening to bring.

145
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,029
These horrible people
doing immoral things,

146
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,765
and now they're creeping
across the border,

147
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,035
threatening to make
the boogeyman a real thing.

148
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,040
It's enough to give you
a good start.

149
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,208
It'll make you
want to wait

150
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,445
for all the bad things
to come get you.

151
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,156
I don't regret what happened.

152
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:16,094
Takes a willing hand
to punish horrible men.

153
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,797
They're building
a case, le.

154
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,965
They're gonna
lock you away.

155
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,504
You come here
to get my statement?

156
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,973
Huh?

157
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:34,279
Expecting me to say
I'm innocent?

158
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,047
I was gonna make
that boy walk.

159
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,082
I was gonna put him
on that back road,

160
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,119
leave him to the boogeyman
to rip him apart,

161
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:46,157
or return him to whatever
ungodly dirt he came from.

162
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,194
And if the road
couldn't do it...

163
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,501
I'd do it myself,

164
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,839
'cause sometimes that's
just what you got to do.

165
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,209
Well, you've done enough.

166
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,282
Ah.

167
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,361
Welcome home, Wallace.

168
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,967
Asshole.

169
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,508
Ken mersey didn't go home
last night.

170
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,512
He's been reported missing
this morning.

171
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,055
Boys need stupid
things to do.

172
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,057
That's how their mamas
wire them.

173
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,161
Well, his mama
wasn't no electrician.

174
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,098
Explains the dim bulb.

175
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,167
It's not like you
to be so funny so early.

176
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,204
Well...

177
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,006
I always figured
Ken mersey liked you

178
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,574
a whole lot more
than you liked him.

179
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,176
Maybe he just don't
want to show his face.

180
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,544
He's missing,
I'm worried.

181
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,513
It doesn't have to be
so black-and-white, Lilly.

182
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,149
For fuck's sake.

183
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,986
All I'm saying is that...

184
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,356
Maybe he's gone
because he wants to be gone.

185
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,959
This ain't hardly
about Ken, is it?

186
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,494
This is about Wallace
coming back.

187
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,564
Hey, do you want
to take care of this?

188
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,605
Oh, Jerry, you're just
aching for coffee, aren't you?

189
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,408
Here.

190
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,242
Drink up.

191
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,277
There's plenty more.

192
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,679
That's an awful shame
about kilbaught.

193
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,281
Old sheriff kilbaught
is a violent dinosaur

194
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,083
going the way of his kind.

195
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,184
How about yourself?

196
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,185
I'm good on coffee.

197
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,054
Uh-huh.

198
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,191
Spent a good five months

199
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,460
figuring out smuggling routes
up in Indian Ridge.

200
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:11,202
Kept on hearing about
peculiarities and such.

201
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:18,009
Catapults and
back-alley breast implants.

202
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,545
Even heard
about a submarine once

203
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:24,716
somebody took the time to build
by hand in their garage.

204
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,122
Mm.

205
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,095
And these brass bastards,

206
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,198
they buy fear and panic,

207
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,736
which makes them a whole lot
cleaner than money.

208
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,306
You can speculate all you want
about where they came from

209
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,441
or where they're going,

210
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,377
but the real concern here is,

211
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,412
what's gonna happen
if this bullet

212
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,415
don't make its destination.

213
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,183
So...

214
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,353
You found just the one?

215
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,553
Shit.

216
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,225
You still alive?

217
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,335
Someone's calling looking
to speak with the sheriff!

218
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,410
He sure rushed my gate
in a hurry.

219
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,278
I called you because
the plates came back.

220
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,713
They were registered
to a used car lot

221
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,849
over in your jurisdiction.

222
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,151
Diaz classics?

223
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,319
Yeah.

224
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,421
Showed up as stolen.

225
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,357
I called it in.
It took 40 minutes.

226
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,358
Anyway, they chased him

227
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,526
all the way out
to the 24,

228
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,861
lost him out there
on a back road

229
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,562
before your guy
went in after him.

230
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,431
What guy?

231
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,632
I don't know.

232
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,200
I couldn't flag him,
but I saw him.

233
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,468
I saw the tan uniform.

234
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,569
I figured I'd just
call your partner

235
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,171
in the morning
and check in.

236
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,373
Was me and the old man.

237
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,209
As of this morning,
got to be just me.

238
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:09,480
Dispatch, we have a code 32
off carrion road.

239
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,716
Burning pretty good,
by the smell of it.

240
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,357
I think I found us Ken mersey.

241
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,845
What the hell
happened to you, Ken?

242
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,848
Where'd you get off to?

243
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,895
Shit.

244
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,305
Well, that's everyone
that's come in.

245
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,873
Closest thing
to a molotov cocktail

246
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,977
these folks have seen
is a broken air conditioner.

247
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,445
Sorry about that, deputy.

248
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,447
But I don't believe
your friend is here.

249
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,283
Didn't say
he was a friend.

250
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,752
And it's sheriff.

251
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,826
Is Ken in there?

252
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,861
Is he okay?

253
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,636
Don't give me
that look, Wallace.

254
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,408
Surprising, is all.

255
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,545
Ken mersey is a good man.

256
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,714
He looks after me.

257
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,594
Oh, Wallace, stop it.

258
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:40,798
What do you know
about the truck?

259
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:40,798
He bought it.

260
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,469
He told me to fix it up
and sell it to shep.

261
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,038
You know he was
smuggling ammunitions

262
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,472
across the border
in that truck?

263
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,640
That's a lie.

264
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,008
Well, whatever
he ain't telling you

265
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,576
got him in trouble
last night,

266
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,878
got him confronted.

267
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,080
By who?

268
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:59,884
Still sorting that out.

269
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,520
But whoever that may be,

270
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,021
I ain't gonna tell you
that Ken mersey

271
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,490
don't got his own
consequences coming to him.

272
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,693
Ah, fuck.

273
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,369
You bring him home,
Wallace.

274
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,142
They got your commercial
on TV up in Indian Ridge.

275
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:10,080
It's 4:00 in the morning,
but it's TV nonetheless.

276
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,483
You trick-or-treating?

277
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,751
Was wondering
if you knew anything

278
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,820
about Ken mersey
going missing.

279
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,622
Yeah, what kind
of trouble he got?

280
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:23,494
The considerable kind,
i guess.

281
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,563
Ooh.

282
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,198
Really taking
yourself seriously

283
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,100
in that uniform,
ain't you?

284
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,469
Don't mind going after

285
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,637
an old drinking buddy
like that?

286
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,239
As far as I can see,
he's under arrest.

287
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,640
Ah.

288
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,976
If he's still alive.

289
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,954
How do you take
your coffee?

290
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,989
I don't.

291
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,132
Well...

292
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,642
No sales being had.

293
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:15,913
No maintenance or repairs
being had.

294
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:19,850
It's just a whole lot
of nothing.

295
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,753
I haven't had a real need
for Ken in the garage.

296
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,522
What about
the stolen truck?

297
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,658
Trucks.

298
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,960
He took them with.

299
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,095
He didn't say anything.

300
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:34,198
He just...Went.

301
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,101
That don't sound like him.

302
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:41,005
People have a way of
changing on you, I guess.

303
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,575
I guess.

304
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:45,843
I want the trucks back.

305
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,545
That's why I only
reported one.

306
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:51,649
I wanted him
to know, you know?

307
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,684
I didn't really want Ken

308
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,920
to get into
any sort of trouble,

309
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,856
knowing his mama and all.

310
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,191
Ken was cutting
armor-piercing slugs

311
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,826
into scrap engine parts

312
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:06,030
not 20 feet
from where you're sitting.

313
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,698
Well, if he was doing
any of the sort,

314
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,999
it wasn't in my garage.

315
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,601
There's no other
place in town

316
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,804
suited for that
kind of...Activity.

317
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:18,275
First off,
how about<i> his</i> garage?

318
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,010
Ken opened his own shop?

319
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,180
Always get a ribbon
for trying.

320
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,785
Asshole.

321
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,034
You're good
right there, Wallace.

322
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,172
What'd you get
yourself into, Kenny?

323
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:08,779
I took 250,000
to leave this place,

324
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,749
to not belong in here,

325
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:16,320
for just--
for just one night.

326
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:19,356
It kicks a good bit
of life into you.

327
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,792
That cousin of yours,

328
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,428
he's laid out on a slab.

329
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,463
Kilbaught took his head
clean off,

330
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,933
and you ain't too far behind.

331
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,235
I want to know where
the bullets are coming from

332
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,203
and who struck the deal.
I want names,

333
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,240
names I can hunt down and put
away this side of the border.

334
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,975
The cartel won't
take this lightly.

335
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,343
They'll send someone.

336
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:44,782
What's coming,
it ain't some butcher.

337
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,383
It's punishment.

338
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,486
You can't stop
a thing like that.

339
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,955
All that money you took
can't buy the fact

340
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:55,125
that now you got them
coming after Marla too.

341
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,498
She didn't know.

342
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,967
They won't care.

343
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,836
I only took my cut!

344
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,064
What's this?

345
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,000
Oh, you chicken shit,
just go.

346
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,079
Fuck me.

347
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,652
Ugh!

348
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,397
Aah!

349
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,105
Kenny.

350
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,110
Fuck.

351
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,693
Aah!

352
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,399
Aah!
Aah!

353
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,802
Oh, god.

354
00:33:58,804 --> 00:33:59,803
Oh, god.

355
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,072
Oh, god.

356
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,512
What the hell?

357
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,515
Wallace?

358
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,885
Wallace!

359
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,854
Wallace...

360
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,624
Hey, Wallace.

361
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,460
What the hell
happened to you, son?

362
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:04,828
Huh?

363
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,697
Who did this
to you, boy?

364
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,299
When it happens...

365
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,700
When it stops...

366
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,835
You can't feel it.

367
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,336
It don't hurt.

368
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,672
We got to get you some...

369
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,577
Come on, Wallace.

370
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,512
Come on,
you're gonna be okay.

371
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,709
How does that feel?

372
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,449
About as good
as it looks.

373
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,992
If we fetch it,
we can re-attach it.

374
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:13,363
They do...
Do that, right?

375
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,402
Well, you got one
of two options:

376
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,673
Get used to it,
or don't look at it.

377
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,841
Hear that?

378
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,443
What?

379
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:30,547
That'd be me,
slow-clapping you,

380
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:35,018
if my clapping hand
was still with us.

381
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,288
Could have been
a lot worse on you.

382
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,490
I saw your friend
when they brought him in.

383
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,727
He ain't my friend.

384
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,498
Way you saw him...

385
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,434
Kilbaught was right
about people like him

386
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:56,306
bringing hell
up into this town.

387
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,540
The way I see it,

388
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,477
Ken mersey got
what was coming to him,

389
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,778
getting his head
cut off the way--

390
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,583
you said you were
gonna bring him home.

391
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:07,651
Marla...

392
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,986
That's what you said
to me, Wallace.

393
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,354
Well, the hell
with him.

394
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:14,391
I know what I said.

395
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:19,029
There was nothing
to bring home.

396
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,698
You're such a fuck.

397
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,040
Shepard Diaz.

398
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,743
History of misconduct,
brutality,

399
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:09,746
or any badges with that name?

400
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,715
Uh-huh.

401
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,872
Hang on.

402
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,611
Shoot.

403
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,581
Yep.

404
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,816
Simon, yep.

405
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,886
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on.

406
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,554
Well, does the system
make any note

407
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,493
of tattoos or distinct markings
and such?

408
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:04,501
The neck.

409
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,537
Yeah.

410
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,906
Last known address?

411
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,630
Wallace, I need to talk.

412
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,432
Think I've done more
than enough of that

413
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,100
with you today.

414
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,976
I'm sorry for snapping at you
back at the hospital.

415
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,947
Shit.

416
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,751
Wallace...

417
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:59,189
You should be
back in that bed.

418
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:03,760
You ran off
without these.

419
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:06,963
I don't want you
to do this.

420
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,039
It's not your job
to punish me like this.

421
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,041
I ain't punishing.

422
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:20,944
Going out there
and getting yourself killed?

423
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:26,716
Yeah, what are you
calling that?

424
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,018
Please don't do this.

425
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,199
You're all I got left.

426
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,271
Wasn't too good
at taking you

427
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:52,909
away from this place,
was I?

428
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,043
No.

429
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,080
Mm.

430
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,215
You are tired,
busted, and hurt,

431
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,218
is what you are.

432
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,728
Don't be mad.

433
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:16,132
Got to thinking about
that stolen jalopy of yours,

434
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:19,869
which got me thinking
about your ex-wife.

435
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,170
Hm?

436
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,740
Hm.

437
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,241
I couldn't hold on
either, shep.

438
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,309
Never could.

439
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:30,113
And I was captivated
by my bride.

440
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:34,651
I just couldn't tell
which color was what on her.

441
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:37,787
Didn't know why
i never did bother.

442
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,292
Anyway, she got to
walking out on me.

443
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,294
Hm.

444
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:49,666
Been gone more years now
than we was actually together.

445
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,736
No...

446
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,138
You can't win
a woman back.

447
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,241
That's something ugly beasts
like you and me

448
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,309
do not get to do.

449
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:00,643
Oh, go fuck yourself, le.

450
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:01,844
- Hey!
- Fuck you, fuck you.

451
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,913
Hold on there
a second.

452
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,049
Don't you go
dwelling in dignity.

453
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,617
Does not suit you.

454
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:11,187
Doesn't suit us.

455
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:16,025
She's half your worth,
and she's gone.

456
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,295
You haven't sold a car
on that lot for ages.

457
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,030
You got a face
like a thumb,

458
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,099
and you stuck it
on a TV commercial.

459
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,668
How dare you, hmm?

460
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,172
I do must ask myself,

461
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:32,709
how the hell do you
keep this place afloat?

462
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,382
Ahh.

463
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,185
Come on, sit down, shep.
Hmm?

464
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:43,853
Sit.

465
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:53,663
You are not
an unfortunate man.

466
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:55,832
You're an auspicious parasite,

467
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:57,133
and I need you to tell me

468
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:01,938
who's on the other side
of that spook.

469
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,043
You came in
with your mind made up.

470
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:11,681
What the fuck you want
me to tell you, le?

471
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,149
Huh?

472
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,953
Can't ask you
to trust me.

473
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:18,821
Well, then don't.

474
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,892
Shame on you.

475
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:27,764
I had trouble finding
the fix for it.

476
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,199
But I found it.

477
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,974
So what's this, then?

478
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:42,438
It's only ever been
three crosses that I remember.

479
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,841
Who's the fourth?

480
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:51,314
Could be the one
waiting for me.

481
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,749
"This god-forsaken road

482
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:56,452
will bury us all
somehow,"

483
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,921
was the way
Ken said it.

484
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:16,172
You look good
with that promotion on you.

485
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,007
You already got made sheriff.

486
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,208
You got what you wanted.

487
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,245
- Oh, yeah.
- What about me, huh?

488
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,480
Wasn't so much a promotion,

489
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,016
like I said it was.

490
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,187
Why wasn't I good enough?

491
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,357
Good enough
for you to stay?

492
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,467
Can't...

493
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,818
So how much money he take?

494
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,920
Well, enough,
i guess.

495
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,923
You sound like
you really care.

496
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,125
They don't care
about the money neither.

497
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:11,861
They just got to decide
if his death is enough.

498
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:14,096
Simple as that.

499
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:17,200
If they can find Ken
in the middle of a back road,

500
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:21,270
they're sure as hell are
gonna find you.

501
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:24,273
I've seen the man
who killed him.

502
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,008
I know his name,
i know where he is.

503
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,143
And what are
you gonna do?

504
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,413
You can't even
write him a ticket.

505
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,148
Kilbaught, he knew.

506
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,017
There's no
arresting anyone.

507
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,186
Not anymore.

508
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,125
I need a ride.

509
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,413
Up here,
on the left.

510
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,271
You know you don't
got to go.

511
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:31,307
Call it
a good cause, then.

512
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:32,942
The only good cause
you'll ever have

513
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:37,914
is listening to me.

514
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:43,352
We could go.

515
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:47,556
Keep driving.

516
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,358
I'd really like that.

517
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:31,600
Oh, fuck!

518
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,973
Get back, get back!

519
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,574
Go on, put it down.

520
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,742
That girl behind you

521
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,010
ain't gonna like you
with no pecker.

522
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,312
Now put the fucking gun down.

523
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,985
Who the fuck are you?

524
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,354
Who the fuck are you?

525
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:55,691
I'm the man looking
for Samuel Gibbons.

526
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,995
That'd be me.

527
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,196
Is this you hiding him?
Huh?

528
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,164
Look, look,
i don't know much,

529
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,500
but just take
whatever you want and go.

530
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,203
Shut up!

531
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,304
You're a cop?

532
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:11,374
I work for county,
same as you.

533
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:12,508
Whatever the issue
is here,

534
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,577
you and I,
we can sort it out.

535
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,312
We can understand
each other.

536
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,646
How is it
that they own you?

537
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,181
I don't know
what you're talking about.

538
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,282
I know they own you.

539
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:21,650
I swear to god, I don't know--

540
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,319
I don't know
what you're talking about!

541
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,453
I know they do, you son of a
bitch, I know they do!

542
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,022
Stop it! Stop it!

543
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,590
- You're gonna take me to him!
- Oh, my god!

544
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,326
Now we're gonna
make a liar out of you.

545
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:31,794
Why are you helping him?

546
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,464
Take me to him!

547
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,471
You gonna take me
to him now?

548
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,040
I don't know what
you want me tell you.

549
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,241
I don't know!

550
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:46,542
They're good
at making threats.

551
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,444
- Get the fuck away from him!
- Get back.

552
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,678
No.
Just--just stop!

553
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,813
They're efficient

554
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,615
at getting
their points understood.

555
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,684
So maybe you had a gun
held to your head.

556
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,720
But I bet she ain't had a gun
held to hers.

557
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,055
No, stop it!

558
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,222
You stop it, god damn it.

559
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,757
Please, no, please, please.

560
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,192
Stop, god damn it, please.

561
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,561
Stop, stop.
No.

562
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,597
Shh.

563
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,068
Shh.

564
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,538
Stop him.

565
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,405
It's okay.

566
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,573
You're gonna be okay.

567
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,841
What happens to her

568
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,376
is because of you.

569
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:21,811
Now, you tell me
where he is!

570
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:24,814
I swear to god, I don't know
what you fucking mean.

571
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,587
You know what he done.

572
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,756
And that don't make you
any better than him.

573
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,507
Oh, my god.

574
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,345
Is that the guy
who killed Ken?

575
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,784
I don't know.

576
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,822
I was sure that he--

577
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:09,825
you were gonna
kill him anyway?

578
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,633
What is it
with you, Wallace?

579
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,636
You find the wrong guy,
and then you won't stop.

580
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:24,406
It ain't making you any better
than what you're chasing after.

581
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,850
Marla, wait.

582
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,556
What a pair, huh?

583
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:14,757
Yeah.

584
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,564
What's that you said
about good people disappearing?

585
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,299
Was that...

586
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,567
'Cause there's no
protecting them?

587
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:27,303
Or you fail
to protect them?

588
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:29,939
Or you scare them away?

589
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,841
One of those.

590
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,710
All of those.

591
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,283
Nearly killed
an innocent man.

592
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,419
Well, there's
no getting him,

593
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:47,356
the man you're after.

594
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,391
Could be anybody.

595
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,928
Because incidentally,

596
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,563
he is anybody.

597
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,732
Monsters hide
in plain sight.

598
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,301
And once you put enough
money in a man's hands,

599
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,237
he'll do almost
whatever you want,

600
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,538
and you can turn him

601
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,709
into whatever
you need him to be.

602
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:10,846
Just like these boogeymen
on the back roads.

603
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,748
They're demons.

604
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,619
And "demons"
is only a way

605
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,821
of calling their illness.

606
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:22,524
- Ahh.
- What's there to stop it, then?

607
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:26,462
You go after
the illness itself.

608
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,332
Crumpled under the vest?

609
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,001
Señor Diaz
selling them crap.

610
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:34,970
They're after shep.

611
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,572
So shep was using Ken

612
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:39,508
to smuggle shitty bullets
into Mexico?

613
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,776
Huh.

614
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,649
Would you do it?

615
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,018
Make a go at it for 250,000?

616
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,521
That don't seem enough.

617
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,523
No, I wouldn't.

618
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:57,559
I wouldn't run
if I knew I couldn't.

619
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,799
I'd burrow down.

620
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,534
Where?

621
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,857
Put him on the back road,
let the back road take him?

622
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,091
What's different, then?

623
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,693
What's changed?

624
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:41,430
Shep owes your friend
Ken mersey a death.

625
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:42,831
Now, he'll pay for it,

626
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:47,569
and he'll pay
for it right, to us.

627
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,638
You're making an arrest?

628
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,673
That's why you're here.

629
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:56,645
Helping restore me
to the man I once was.

630
00:56:56,647 --> 00:57:00,616
He wasn't my friend.

631
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,117
This guy,
you sure he's here?

632
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,685
Asshole showed me
a wire receipt

633
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,788
just before he shot me.

634
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,427
Hey, stupid!
Come on out!

635
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,095
We know you're in there!

636
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,484
Oh, shit!

637
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:36,852
He's under the house!

638
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,728
You gonna shoot?

639
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,130
I was thinking
about it, yeah.

640
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,676
Fuck.

641
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,744
Put it down, shep!

642
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,068
Wallace!

643
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,836
Wallace!

644
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,269
Oh, shit.

645
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,575
It's okay.

646
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,043
It's okay.

647
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,113
Easy.

648
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:17,619
So...That hovel
you've been squatting,

649
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:21,757
what made you think
of that place, huh?

650
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:25,060
Might as well
spill it, shep.

651
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,596
The way you've been going
about getting folks killed

652
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:30,699
is only gonna
get me madder.

653
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:34,136
Some young filly
on the side, huh?

654
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,572
That was a long
time ago, sheriff.

655
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:37,739
Sheriff?
Oh, no, no.

656
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,241
I don't think
there's any need

657
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,642
for formalities anymore,

658
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:43,078
not after you shot me.

659
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:49,651
What the hell
you mean by that?

660
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:52,988
It's only me.

661
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,734
It's a list.

662
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,639
It's a walking,
breathing list,

663
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,375
and it will
follow you to hell.

664
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,711
The guy they use,

665
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,746
don't know where
he's coming from,

666
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:21,049
but he finds
who they tell him to find.

667
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,919
He is a butcher.

668
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:27,222
Won't matter
how far I get.

669
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,057
Won't matter where I go.

670
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,660
They're looking
to make an example.

671
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,128
You've been
liquidating assets.

672
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:38,800
I'm trying to buy my name
off that forsaken list.

673
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,068
I've given them everything

674
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,270
that's not locked down
on my lot.

675
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,973
I've given them every
buckskin I've earned,

676
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,809
and it's still
not enough.

677
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,311
Who's wiring your money?

678
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,916
My ex-wife's pension,

679
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,719
few drops in a bucket.

680
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:01,156
All her life
amounted to, I guess.

681
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,766
I need Ken mersey.

682
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,167
If he made it back
with that money

683
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,835
and I get my hands
on that money,

684
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,370
I promise you, le,
on my life,

685
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,806
I promise you,

686
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:21,977
I'll make all this
go away.

687
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:25,147
I'll even cut you in.

688
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:34,823
All you do is let me
walk on out that door.

689
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:38,060
Let me make it right.

690
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:41,963
How much you reckon
that's worth?

691
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:45,434
You stay another day
in this town,

692
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:49,805
and you're gonna answer
for what you did.

693
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,373
They'll put you
in a cement box

694
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:56,011
for what you did
to clive.

695
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:00,182
I'm offering you kindness.

696
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,225
I'll mull it over.

697
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,434
Fuck!

698
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:22,771
So that's you leaving.

699
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:25,874
Always known what's going on
in my head, haven't you?

700
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:28,744
Not by choice.

701
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,312
Yeah, lucky you.

702
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:33,882
Maybe some day,
when luck can afford me.

703
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:37,252
Yes, ma'am.

704
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,422
You are sweet
in small doses.

705
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,198
Your picture.

706
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:58,440
You deserve better.

707
01:02:58,442 --> 01:02:59,941
Wallace, please don't--

708
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,778
and I'm gonna keep
telling it to you like that

709
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,913
until you leave.

710
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:08,383
I can't.

711
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,385
Can't think of something
nice to say to her.

712
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,553
Lilly's a nice girl,

713
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,889
and she was asking
for a rosary,

714
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,423
so I think
i should get it.

715
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,491
Okay.

716
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:19,995
I'll go fetch it.

717
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,164
Wallace, please stay.

718
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,435
This place is...

719
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:29,337
Scorched of life.

720
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,808
It's a graveyard.

721
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,909
Think about leaving.

722
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:38,180
Do what you got to do, but...

723
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:42,350
The only person
that's gonna save you is you.

724
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,537
Oh, sorry,
i thought Lilly was in here--

725
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,539
it's you.

726
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,274
What about me?

727
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,149
Can't remember
the last time

728
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,584
I walked around
with a picture

729
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:19,421
of a girl in my wallet.

730
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:24,492
Well...One that
i didn't love to pieces, anyway.

731
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,127
I don't know.

732
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:29,297
Maybe I'm talking about
a different Ken mersey.

733
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,141
I know who you're
talking about.

734
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:44,179
The Ken mersey
i got to know...

735
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:47,349
Couldn't talk about
anything that wasn't you.

736
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,928
His share of the take

737
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:02,530
was always your share
of the take.

738
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:27,222
I hear he does that.

739
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,675
Always the church girls.

740
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,459
No.

741
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,098
Shit.

742
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,249
Damn it.

743
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,324
Lilly?

744
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,200
Lilly?

745
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,812
Slow down, heavy.

746
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:14,716
We're stopping
all cars tonight.

747
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,317
What the hell is this?

748
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,852
What in the hell
you think it is?

749
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,755
What the hell is that
cock-skin doing with a gun?

750
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,457
Now, now, now.

751
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,626
You're gonna have to mind
your manners around Jerry

752
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,194
from here on in.

753
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:27,495
He's been deputized.

754
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,930
What is it
you're doing here?

755
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,765
Someone is coming

756
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,434
to make something terrible
out of shep Diaz

757
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:35,303
and make an example
out of this town.

758
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:37,438
I reckon I'm here
doing the same thing.

759
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,410
By protecting shep
or by getting him killed?

760
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:45,580
Either way is
fine by me.

761
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,185
You are a mean
dinosaur, Leland.

762
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,721
Congratulations, Harry.

763
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:54,622
Go get your gun.

764
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:55,857
You've just been deputized.

765
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,792
Here, you take this.

766
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,761
And I'll take this.

767
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:01,529
Go on, now.

768
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:09,370
What the hell is this

769
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,373
between you and him?

770
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:16,711
What's that you call it?

771
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,646
That might as well
have been you out there

772
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,648
dismembering people.

773
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,218
He ain't hurting no one
that don't got it coming.

774
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:27,388
He took my fucking hand!

775
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,923
We fall short
of god's glory

776
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,726
because of people
like you.

777
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,428
What about Marla?

778
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,663
Because that's who
he's off getting tonight.

779
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,565
I seen the pictures,

780
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,301
the spying you've
been doing for him!

781
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:42,503
God, that's how
he knows where to find

782
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,005
who he needs to find.

783
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:45,440
If Marla dies tonight,

784
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,976
I'm gonna make sure
that falls on you.

785
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,877
His faith
is being tested,

786
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,346
like I'm being tested.

787
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:52,513
All right,
where's he coming in from?

788
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,514
It's the only
way he knows.

789
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,515
No, I need to know.

790
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:55,550
So we can be together.

791
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,720
Where's he
coming in from?

792
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,730
You expect him
to come get you?

793
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:11,899
Come and save you?

794
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,601
I'm the one saving him.

795
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,838
Ah.

796
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,273
Well, you ain't gonna do

797
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:22,543
too good of a job
of that tonight.

798
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,846
There's gonna be trouble
like you've never known

799
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:28,383
if you don't let him
finish that list.

800
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,957
What are you doing to her?

801
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:42,497
There's only ever
been three crosses.

802
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,598
Someone's gonna come

803
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,732
aiming to take Lilly
out of here.

804
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,000
You don't try
to be brave.

805
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,402
You let him
do just that.

806
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:48,636
He's gonna ask,

807
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,305
and you tell him
where Marla and shep went.

808
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:51,472
I don't know
where they went.

809
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,840
The crosses
down on carrion road.

810
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:53,941
Tell him that,

811
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:55,310
and don't get
in his way, you hear?

812
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,311
Where are you going?

813
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:57,779
To protect this town.

814
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,547
Dig faster, lollipop.

815
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,649
It'll help you stay warm.

816
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,690
I found something.

817
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,395
See?

818
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:17,999
I told you
little hands go faster.

819
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,872
Come on.

820
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:44,058
This is just a third.

821
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,893
This is nothing
but his cut.

822
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:46,794
He left my money behind.

823
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:51,466
It ain't gonna be enough.

824
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,568
Okay, there were other ones,

825
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,437
some other jobs he did for me.

826
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:59,407
Where does he keep his money?

827
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:02,009
We're both
on the fucking list.

828
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,044
Lilly?

829
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,892
Sorry, cap, we're...
We're closed.

830
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:53,461
Where is she?

831
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:55,430
Well, seems the poor girl

832
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,597
got herself
into an accident.

833
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,937
Don't surprise me none.

834
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,806
I'm sorry?

835
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:09,844
I said it don't surprise me.

836
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,179
She's a...

837
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:12,480
She talks like
she's the only one

838
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:13,981
that's gonna be saved.

839
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,921
Who's responsible?

840
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,856
Ain't nothing responsible
for an accident.

841
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:25,760
I said,
who's responsible?

842
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,528
You best remind Lilly,

843
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,865
there ain't no one
walking this earth

844
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,500
who is saved.

845
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:35,736
Then you tell me
what you see.

846
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,649
What do we do now?

847
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,200
This was Ken's dream.

848
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,503
This is why
he wanted the money.

849
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,671
Jesus Christ.

850
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,073
I really hate
that I'm believing you,

851
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,742
just let me tell you that.

852
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:22,884
He died for
that patch of earth.

853
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:25,219
This just seems
so fucking meaningless.

854
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:28,589
Yeah, we'll all have
a good cry about that later.

855
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,825
You see that?

856
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:33,094
You see that?
Come here.

857
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,630
Look.

858
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:37,231
Hear that?

859
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,169
- You hear that?
- Someday somebody is gonna

860
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:46,807
put a bullet in that fucking
fat head of yours!

861
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:49,176
You're just about
110 pounds of bummer,

862
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:50,211
ain't you?

863
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,712
Come on.

864
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,214
Give me that.

865
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:59,253
Now, look, baby.

866
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,856
This money
is part yours too.

867
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:05,259
Do you want it or not?

868
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:11,065
Well, go find something
for us to break this ground.

869
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,767
Go!

870
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,316
Oh, god damn it.

871
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,224
Oh, Harry.

872
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,194
Where is he?

873
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:17,298
He got away!

874
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,699
Leland?

875
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:21,102
Oh, god!

876
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:22,169
Jerry?

877
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,005
Jerry, where are you?

878
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,087
Come on!

879
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,063
You're not afraid
of dying, are you?

880
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:22,997
No!

881
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,165
I'll get you there!

882
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:28,335
Take me to Lilly!

883
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,452
Hurry up!

884
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,320
We don't have all night!

885
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:08,509
Wallace, are you there?

886
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:09,510
Wallace?

887
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:11,112
Wallace!

888
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,918
Wallace, are you there?

889
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,987
Marla...

890
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,195
Wallace, come get me.

891
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:30,030
I can't.

892
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:38,239
I saw your name
on that list.

893
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:42,076
He's coming through here
to get to you.

894
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:44,812
I'm gonna slow him down a bit

895
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:46,080
so you can disappear.

896
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,548
Wallace, don't...

897
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,884
Don't...

898
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:52,086
I always told you

899
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:56,157
that you deserve better, Marla.

900
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,893
But I never said
i didn't love you.

901
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,135
Wallace?

902
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:17,011
Hey!

903
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,078
What the hell you doing?

904
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,321
Guthrie...

905
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,923
That was his name,

906
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:33,027
harland Guthrie.

907
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,162
First man I killed.

908
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,465
Now I'm old and numb,

909
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,234
but that stinger's
still in there,

910
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:44,905
the kind of sorry
that burns in you,

911
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,140
for cutting the breath

912
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:51,345
of one of god's
own creatures like that.

913
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,981
Seeing you with her,

914
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:57,985
like harland looked at his wife,

915
01:20:57,987 --> 01:21:02,223
just days before he killed her.

916
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,024
I've been wondering
a lot about you.

917
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:08,162
I've been thinking
that, you know, if you...

918
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:13,267
If you fail them...

919
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:15,502
If shep goes on living
like he does,

920
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:20,207
then they won't hesitate
to punish you.

921
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,442
And they'll do to you

922
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,445
what you've been trying
to do to him.

923
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:27,147
They will erase you.

924
01:21:27,149 --> 01:21:29,116
And they'll erase
all memory of you,

925
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,051
starting with her.

926
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,054
With god by our side,
who can be against us?

927
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,423
Come the morning hour,

928
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:41,195
you'll reckon it's better
she dies by your hand

929
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:43,430
than their cruel hooks.

930
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:47,501
And then you'll be
just like old harland.

931
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,073
I'll make the same
deal tomorrow,

932
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:55,409
one just like it.

933
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,646
Why don't you
just leave with her?

934
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,964
You ain't gonna make it.

935
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:18,499
Neither are you.

936
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:20,501
Time to add
a few more crosses

937
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:22,336
to carrion road.

938
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:44,258
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

939
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,526
All right.

940
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:48,195
I think we're a minute
into your time.

941
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:55,269
You gonna try
something stupid again?

942
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:56,971
No.

943
01:22:56,973 --> 01:23:01,208
Oh, yeah, it's a fucking
smelly zoo, isn't it?

944
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,409
Don't worry, baby.

945
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:05,446
We're gonna get you
stinking too.

946
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,448
Come here.

947
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:08,682
All right.

948
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:10,751
Two hands.

949
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:12,553
Okay, come on.

950
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:14,555
Grab it,
two hands.

951
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:14,555
Okay.

952
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:18,659
Now, what you want to do is,
you want to lift up.

953
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,995
You want to put
your shoulders into it,

954
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,596
and you bring it down.

955
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,264
Real good.

956
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:26,033
Come on, baby.

957
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:27,167
Let's go.
You want your money,

958
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,369
you got to earn it.

959
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:29,203
Yeah, well,

960
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,571
you can fucking keep it!

961
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:32,573
Aah!

962
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,141
God!

963
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:38,012
God!

964
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:41,715
Come back, you bitch!

965
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:19,119
You're gonna finish off
the list for me.

966
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:21,588
First you're gonna
cross out the girl,

967
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,290
then the salesman.

968
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,564
If you know the girl
don't belong,

969
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,367
why not let her go?

970
01:24:33,369 --> 01:24:36,537
Because it's not
the true shape of fidelity.

971
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:38,238
Shit!

972
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,699
I see you.

973
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,407
Say it again.

974
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,347
Wallace...

975
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:02,856
Only killing
I'll ever see again...

976
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,858
Is you killing me.

977
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:10,631
And I don't even
know your name.

978
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,303
Wallace.

979
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,610
You put this on yourself, son.

980
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:26,547
You don't get to
walk away from this place.

981
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:31,919
Don't got to be this way.

982
01:26:31,921 --> 01:26:35,489
Don't let it take you, huh?

983
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,391
Wallace?

984
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:40,294
Give me--
give me the gun.

985
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,432
Don't go down the path
i did, Wallace.

986
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:46,700
Huh?

987
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,338
I see you.

988
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,642
Good enough.

989
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:43,824
It's gonna be all right.

990
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:45,859
It'll be just fine.

991
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,530
Now get out of here.

992
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,747
I couldn't keep
waiting for you, so...

993
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,452
I like that you're here.

994
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,454
After some thinking,

995
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:31,725
I decided I'd
come and get you.

996
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:34,161
You know, keep driving.

997
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:41,034
I like that.

998
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,436
Get in the car.

999
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,142
<i> Buenos dias.</i>

1000
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,017
Morning, stupid.

1001
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,570
How'd you find me?

1002
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:25,939
Patience.

1003
01:32:25,941 --> 01:32:28,174
And I'm telling you, boy,
when I get serious,

1004
01:32:28,176 --> 01:32:31,945
I stay fucking serious.

1005
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:33,947
Times like these,
you can't blame a guy

1006
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:37,117
for trying to
turn a dollar.

1007
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:39,085
Come on.

1008
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:44,090
I keep hearing these stories
about good people disappearing.

1009
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:50,263
If you're talking
about that offer I made,

1010
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,265
that still stands.

1011
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:53,767
Is that right?

1012
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:58,305
All you got to do is
let me walk out that door.

1013
01:32:58,307 --> 01:33:01,575
Let me disappear.

1014
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:05,612
No such thing
as disappearing, shep.

1015
01:33:05,614 --> 01:33:09,215
There's only dying.

1016
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:13,053
As far as good people go...

1017
01:33:13,055 --> 01:33:16,823
I don't recall meeting one
that wasn't already dead.
