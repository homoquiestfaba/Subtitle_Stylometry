1
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:55,208
[Connie] <i>I, Constance Reid,
take you, Clifford Chatterley,</i>

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,208
<i>to be my lawfully wedded husband,</i>

3
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,750
<i>to have and to hold from this day forward,</i>

4
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,041
<i>for better and for worse,</i>

5
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,291
<i>for richer and for poorer,</i>

6
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,708
<i>in sickness and in health.</i>

7
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,833
- [Connie laughing]
- [Hilda] How does it feel?

8
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,666
- I don't know. Ask me tomorrow.
- [Hilda laughs]

9
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,875
- [Hilda] You need to eat something.
- I need to get out of this dress.

10
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:31,916
Ooh. [laughs]

11
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,250
Mmm.

12
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,333
How do I look?

13
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,166
Well, I doubt Clifford
will want to stay long at the reception.

14
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,916
You don't think
his mother would've approved?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,708
Well, I'm not entirely sure I do.

16
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,250
Are we talking about the dress now, Hilda,

17
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,083
- or the wedding?
- [lips smacking]

18
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,458
He goes back to the front in the morning.
Imagine if we'd left it,

19
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,416
and then something terrible happened.

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,958
- Couldn't you have just had sex with him?
- Hilda! Be serious.

21
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,583
I am. It's much less commitment,
and it's all Clifford will want anyway.

22
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,958
Clifford's not like that.

23
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,000
You know him. He's kind and thoughtful.

24
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,250
He makes me feel safe.

25
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,291
His family's more traditional than ours,
I suppose,

26
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,375
but I think his own views
are actually quite progressive.

27
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,625
- [Hilda] Really?
- Yes.

28
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,708
Hmm...

29
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:20,166
- Does he know about that German boy?
- Yes. And he says it doesn't matter.

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,625
It was before the war,
so it doesn't count.

31
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,416
[Hilda] You don't need to convince me.
I had my own German boy, remember?

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,625
Well, mine's dead.

33
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,791
- [sighs]
- You see, that's just it.

34
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,750
- What?
- [sighs]

35
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,791
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,416
You, uh... You open your

37
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,291
heart so easily.

38
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,375
Oh, Hilda!

39
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,333
- Clifford!
- Hmm, reinforcements have arrived.

40
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,625
You read my mind.

41
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,083
[chuckles] I nearly drank yours
on the way up.

42
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,708
- [Clifford] Cheers.
- Cheers.

43
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,625
Well, what now?

44
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,250
[Clifford] Our fathers
are preparing their toasts.

45
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,791
Can we face them together?

46
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,666
[Clifford] Of course.

47
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,041
You look stunning, Con.

48
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,666
Thanks.

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,708
[guests speaking excitedly]

50
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,416
- [Clifford] I can hear them. [laughs]
- [Connie] Yeah.

51
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,166
[Clifford] Oh...

52
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,875
[Clifford] Are you ready?

53
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:19,458
- So, here's to Clifford and Connie...
- [tapping on glass]

54
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,250
...our new hope for an heir to Wragby.
[laughs]

55
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,125
[all] To Clifford and Connie.

56
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,166
Father, that's not just why we married.

57
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
No, why else would a baronet get married?

58
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,208
- [all laughing]
- Shh.

59
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,083
- I married because I found Connie.
- And I you.

60
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,833
[guests clapping and whooping]

61
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,416
We would like to thank those
who donated their butter and sugar rations

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,041
to help us celebrate.

63
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,250
To the next heir of Chatterley.

64
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,833
- [guests] To the Chatterleys!
- [glasses clinking]

65
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,666
[guests clapping and whooping]

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,750
[upbeat piano music playing]

67
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,250
We'll just watch and wait.

68
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,916
[Connie laughing]

69
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,958
[Clifford] Oh yeah.

70
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,791
Oh God.

71
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,750
"Why else is a baronet ever married?"

72
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,666
Unbelievable. [scoffs]

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,583
Do you want children, Clifford?

74
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,833
Uh, yeah. Yeah, someday.

75
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,250
- For our sake, not for my father's.
- Hmm.

76
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,208
Assuming you would.

77
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,875
I think so, yes.

78
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,333
What? You all right?

79
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,666
Yes, um, of course. Sorry. Uh...

80
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,708
It's just, um...

81
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,375
I can't stop thinking
about going back to the front.

82
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
- I... I know I'll be all right.
- You will be.

83
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,833
- We don't have to do anything.
- No, no, I... I want to.

84
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,500
[Connie giggles]

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,458
[soft piano music playing]

86
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,541
Sure you don't want me
to come to the station?

87
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,916
[Clifford] Thanks.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,541
Let's not make a ceremony of it, shall we?

89
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,166
I love you, Con.

90
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,291
Bye.

91
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,500
I look forward to your letters.

92
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,750
I'll write to you every day.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,666
[airplanes flying overhead]

94
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,583
- [mortar shells whistling]
- [explosions]

95
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,166
- [gunfire]
- [men screaming]

96
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,583
[Connie] <i>Dearest Hilda,
I knew the war would change us all,</i>

97
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,958
<i>but I just wasn't sure how much.</i>

98
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>It feels as though
it ended half a lifetime ago,</i>

99
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,416
<i>not just half a year.</i>

100
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,833
<i>We've already moved away from London.</i>

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,666
<i>We've just arrived at Wragby,</i>

102
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,625
<i>Clifford's family estate.</i>

103
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,125
<i>Once we're settled in,
I expect to write to you often.</i>

104
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,958
<i>Your loving sister, Connie.</i>

105
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,541
[Connie] Thank you.

106
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,291
[Mrs. Warren] Welcome home, Sir Clifford.
We've been praying for you.

107
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
[Clifford grunting]

108
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,083
Thank you, Mr. Warren.

109
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,500
[grunts]

110
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,583
There's the one

111
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,333
[Connie] All right.

112
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,958
[Clifford sighs]

113
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,375
Thank you. I can, uh... I can manage.

114
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,833
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, this is my wife,

115
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,291
the new Lady Chatterley.

116
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,083
It's so nice to meet you, milady.

117
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,125
There's plenty of work to be done.

118
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,083
Hire back all the workers
we can, Mrs. Warren.

119
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,625
Old girl's seen better days.

120
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,833
[Connie chuckles]
We'll bring her back to life.

121
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,500
We thought you might like to use
your father's study as the master bedroom,

122
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,416
so you don't have to bother
with the stairs.

123
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,208
[chuckles] Thank you, Mrs. Warren.

124
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,541
No.

125
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,375
No, let's put the luggage in here.

126
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,583
We'll use the library as a master.

127
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,833
- Wow.
- [Clifford chuckles]

128
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,833
What is more inspiring
for a writer than to sleep among books?

129
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,541
[Clifford chuckles]

130
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,291
This is where they found Father.
They say his heart gave out.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,583
I think he died of chagrin.

132
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,458
Clifford... it's all done now.

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,750
Life is what we make of it. [chuckles]

134
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,625
- Mrs. Warren.
- Yes.

135
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,791
Let's open the curtains,
let some light in.

136
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,166
[Mrs. Warren] Of course, milady.

137
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,750
- [Clifford] We should have a look around.
- I will.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,708
You're welcome to use
the private room above the library

139
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,166
with the family portraits.

140
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,125
You can have
the whole of the second floor.

141
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,958
Welcome home, Clifford.

142
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,416
[door opens]

143
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,916
You all right? I've got you.
Lean on me, put your weight on me.

144
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,708
- [Clifford grunts] Ready?
- Mm-hmm. Yes. [exclaims]

145
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,708
- [Clifford panting]
- [Connie chuckles]

146
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,791
[sighs deeply]

147
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,916
I'm getting the hang of it. [sighs]

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,333
- Love it.
- Mmm.

149
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,333
[Clifford sighs] You know, um...

150
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,416
I'm thinking of expanding
the short story I wrote in Cambridge.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,208
- Hmm?
- Turning it into a novel.

152
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,000
- It's a wonderful idea.
- You think?

153
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,208
Mm-hmm.

154
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,625
- You'll be my editor?
- Of course.

155
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,125
Proofreader, typist.
I'll submit my application.

156
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,041
I'll get you to the top of the pile.

157
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,125
- All right?
- Yes.

158
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,833
- Ooh, this bed is softer than I thought.
- [both chuckle]

159
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,916
- First night at Wragby. Hmm.
- Welcome.

160
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,791
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, you're fine. Really.

161
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,708
[Clifford chuckles]

162
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,458
[Clifford sighs]

163
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,875
What?

164
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,291
I'm sorry, Con.

165
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,250
I just can't anymore, you know?

166
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm so sorry.

167
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,583
It's all right. Don't worry.

168
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
You'll be fine?

169
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:13,916
Yes.

170
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,500
[whispering] I love you, Con.

171
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,125
This is misfortune, but you'll see.

172
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,916
We... We'll be happy here

173
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,958
at Wragby.

174
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,208
[switch clicks]

175
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,583
Hello, sir.

176
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,916
I'm a strong, hardworking man,
and I will not let you down.

177
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,541
Lily Wheedon.
My mum worked for Sir Geoffrey.

178
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,166
Really?

179
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,416
Oliver Mellors?

180
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,083
You, uh, worked for my father
before the war.

181
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,833
Aye, sir.

182
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,041
- And you were an army lieutenant.
- I was, sir.

183
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,708
Do you honestly believe
that a return to gamekeeping

184
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,416
will be satisfying
after your time as an officer?

185
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,833
Bit of quiet'd do me good.

186
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,291
- I've seen enough of what war does to men.
- [Clifford] Hmm.

187
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,666
As have I.

188
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,291
You must know your way
around the estate better than I do.

189
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,583
[Lily] Oh, no, milady.
I couldn't visit while she was working.

190
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,916
Very well then. Welcome back, Mr. Mellors.

191
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,583
[Oliver] Sir.

192
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,041
[Connie] In that case, we'll have to
learn our way around together. Won't we?

193
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,916
- [Lily] Hmm.
- Thank you, Lily.

194
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,750
My name is Kelly Martin, milady.

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,041
- Thank you.
- I've been a maid for five years.

196
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,208
[Connie] <i>Dear Hilda,</i>

197
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,583
<i>I'm a thoughtless lout
for not writing sooner.</i>

198
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,083
<i>In my defense, Wragby needed
an enormous amount of tending to.</i>

199
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,916
<i>But we finally have a full staff</i>

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
<i>who've done wonders
in restoring the place.</i>

201
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,000
<i>Clifford's strength has returned.</i>

202
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,750
<i>I'm still the only one
he's willing to let help him,</i>

203
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,333
<i>but every day,
he can do more and more on his own.</i>

204
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,708
<i>He's writing, all the time,</i>

205
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,291
<i>which keeps his spirits up,
and he's nearly finished his first novel.</i>

206
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,500
[Clifford] "I first met Mrs. Gertrude
at a dinner, comma,

207
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,875
- thrown by Lord Witherby."
- [typewriter clacking]

208
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,750
Witherby, W-I-T-H-E-R-B-Y.

209
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,416
"With the sort of fellow, whom..."
I'm quite pleased with this...

210
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,166
- "The sort of fellow..."
- [Connie] <i>It is quiet here in the country.</i>

211
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,041
<i>I miss the life we had in London,</i>

212
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,708
<i>and, of course, I miss you.</i>

213
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
<i>But we have to live, I suppose,</i>

214
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,583
<i>no matter how many skies have fallen.</i>

215
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,625
[men speaking]

216
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
[Connie] <i>We have had some guests.</i>

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,708
<i>Mostly Clifford's old bachelor friends.</i>

218
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,916
<i>It's hardly surprising that most of them
haven't found women, believe me.</i>

219
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,916
<i>Now and again,
we also get visits from writers</i>

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,875
<i>whose advice Clifford has sought out.</i>

221
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,875
<i>Apparently, my old friends</i>

222
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,208
<i>all seem to think
misfortune is contagious.</i>

223
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,666
<i>I know you and Owen</i>

224
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,208
<i>have been traveling everywhere
since the war ended,</i>

225
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,166
<i>but once you've settled back home,
I would so love to see you.</i>

226
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,958
- Am I interrupting?
- [Clifford] No, not at all.

227
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,083
I was thinking
about going to London for a few days

228
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,125
to visit Hilda.

229
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,958
Leaving me to fend for myself?

230
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,375
[chuckles] We do have
a house full of servants.

231
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,250
I don't need servants. I need you.

232
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,458
Why don't you invite Hilda?
She'd be more than welcome.

233
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,791
I have. She can't get away
from London for a few weeks.

234
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,250
Hmm. I'm glad at least she can come.

235
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,916
- [Clifford grunts]
- [man speaking on radio]

236
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,166
I'm going to go for a walk.

237
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,583
[Clifford] Why? We can send Mrs. Warren
out for anything you might need.

238
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,625
I don't need anything, Clifford.
I just want to go for a walk.

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Very well, dear.

240
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,333
- As you like.
- Jesus.

241
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,083
[birds chirping]

242
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,541
[whistling]

243
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,875
[dog barks]

244
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,708
- [whistling nearby]
- Hello.

245
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,750
[Oliver] Flossie! Come here, lass.

246
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,833
[Flossie barking]

247
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,541
- [whistles]
- [barks]

248
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,916
[Oliver] Come on.

249
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,250
Good girl. Good girl.

250
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:19,583
I wandered further down and I found this
stream running right through the woods.

251
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:25,041
[grunts] I, uh, think I know the place.
Doubt I'd be able to get there anymore.

252
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm sure we can find a way
if you wanted to go.

253
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,708
- Right.
- Perhaps.

254
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,083
Here we are.

255
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,291
- Ready?
- Yes.

256
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,375
[Connie chuckles]

257
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,208
All right.

258
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,458
[groans] It's fine.

259
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,958
- It's all right?
- Yes.

260
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,750
Uh, I don't want you to drop me.

261
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,166
I'm not going to drop you.

262
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,666
Look, just, um...

263
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,750
There we go.

264
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,458
There we are. That's fine.
Just let me go there.

265
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,041
Thank you. Thank you.

266
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,333
[panting]

267
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,541
[grunts] Ah. There.

268
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,875
- See, you didn't need my help at all.
- [panting, chuckles]

269
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,958
- There must be times you hate me for this.
- No.

270
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,125
I wouldn't blame you.

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,291
There are days
I wish I hadn't made it back.

272
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,041
Clifford.

273
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,916
Don't talk like that.

274
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,541
I'd be lost without you, Con.
You know that.

275
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,125
[Connie chuckles]

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,583
Let's open some windows,
get some fresh air in here.

277
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,625
I've never seen the sky so clear.

278
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,166
Yes, well, there's no smoke in the air.
Mines are closed for May Day.

279
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,208
You should go down to Tevershall.

280
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,916
See the fair. You can, you know?

281
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,750
Just be back in time for tea.

282
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,708
- Yes, I might.
- Hmm.

283
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,625
[festive instrumental music playing]

284
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,875
- [people laughing]
- [children squealing]

285
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,791
- [man] Nice to see you, Lady Chatterley.
- [woman] Milady.

286
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,333
It's nice to meet you, Lady Chatterley.

287
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, that's so kind.

288
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,083
Thank you.

289
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,208
[music and chatter continue]

290
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,958
Happy May Day to you, milady.

291
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,125
Happy May Day.

292
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,083
Who's this? She's precious.

293
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
- This is my Josephine.
- Hi, Josephine.

294
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,958
Say hello to Lady Chatterley.

295
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,250
I seem to be having
that effect on people today.

296
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,958
I'm Mrs. Flint.
I'm a schoolteacher here in the village.

297
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,666
I'm Connie. Lovely to meet you.

298
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,458
My, uh... My husband
leases Marehay Farm from your estate.

299
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,333
- Marehay Farm?
- It's not far from where you are.

300
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,958
[chanting] Side by side we fight forever.

301
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,166
More in numbers makes them stop.

302
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,958
Just as long as we stand together.

303
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,250
[muffled chanting]

304
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,916
[men clamoring]

305
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
What was that?

306
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,583
[Mrs. Flint] The miners.
They're out protesting again.

307
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,333
- Again?
- [woman 1] Leave him!

308
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,041
Um, that, um... That happens a lot?

309
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,458
They must've been
from one of the other mines.

310
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,708
They'd lose their jobs if they marched
like that through their own village.

311
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:42,125
Does it mean our miners from Tevershall
protest in other villages?

312
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,458
I wouldn't know.

313
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,125
I may teach their children,

314
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,916
but I'm an outsider
when it comes to the miners' wives.

315
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,416
That makes two of us.

316
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,750
- [woman 2] Well, hello, Lady Chatterley.
- Hello.

317
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,875
[Mrs. Flint] You should come
to Marehay one day.

318
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,958
- We'd love to have you.
- I'd love that.

319
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,166
Thank you.

320
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,708
Where are we going?

321
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,458
You've always wanted me
to join you on one of your walks.

322
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,708
I thought of somewhere
I'd like to show you.

323
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,333
[both chuckle]

324
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,458
- Don't think your chair was made for this.
- [chuckles]

325
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,958
Ah, Mellors. Give us a hand
trying to get this chair started again.

326
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,041
Yes, sir.

327
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,750
[Flossie barking]

328
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,583
Uh, Connie, have you met Mellors,
our new gamekeeper?

329
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,166
[dog barks]

330
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,125
Get down, you, Floss.

331
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,208
She's just being friendly. [chuckles]

332
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,958
Now, then.

333
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,541
You've been at Wragby
sometime, Mr. Mellors?

334
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
I was raised here, Your Ladyship.

335
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,291
- Whoa.
- [Clifford grunts]

336
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,083
[Connie] Need some help?

337
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,708
[grunts] Mellors is quite capable
of pushing on his own. There we are.

338
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,416
[laughing]

339
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,791
- Now... Now, now.
- [grunts]

340
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,541
Ooh. Ah.

341
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,875
Nothing else, sir?

342
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,375
Nothing else. Good day.

343
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,750
[Connie] That was kind of you.
Hope it wasn't too heavy.

344
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,583
No, not heavy.

345
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,666
Good day to you, Your Ladyship.

346
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,666
[Flossie barking]

347
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,500
[Mellors clicks tongue]

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,250
[Clifford] I used to come here as a lad,
sit for hours.

349
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,541
One of the finest views
in all the Midlands.

350
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,833
I want to restore these woods.

351
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,000
If these places aren't preserved,
there'll be no England left.

352
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,333
Our way of life will end,
never mind what we gave up to defend it.

353
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,416
I mind not being able to have a son here
more than any other place.

354
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,291
I'm sorry we can't have one.

355
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,708
Almost be a good thing
if you had a son by another man.

356
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,791
[Connie chuckles softly]

357
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,458
You're not serious?

358
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,750
- Why not?
- Why not? Because...

359
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,291
Because we're married.

360
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,583
I married you, Clifford.

361
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,666
Why would you even suggest such a thing?

362
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,291
You've told me
how much you'd love a child.

363
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,708
This way, you could have one
to dote on, to fill your days.

364
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,833
As far as anyone else knows, I might
still be capable of fathering a child.

365
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,208
If we raised him here at Wragby,
he'd be ours.

366
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,458
Do you really mean this?

367
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,791
Well, of course, I wouldn't want you
to yield yourself completely to him,

368
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,833
but the mechanical act of sex is nothing
when compared to a life lived together.

369
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,166
If you govern your emotions accordingly,

370
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,916
we could arrange this
like a trip to the dentist.

371
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,875
A trip to the... [scoffs]

372
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,250
And you wouldn't mind
what man's child I had?

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,750
I trust your judgment. You wouldn't let
the wrong sort of fellow touch you.

374
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,625
Someone of the utmost discretion.
The Chatterley name depends on it.

375
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,208
Would you expect me
to tell you who this man was?

376
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,291
Best I don't know.

377
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,666
An heir really means this much to you?

378
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,083
It means a lot to the people here.

379
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,458
I know you can do it for them
and for the Chatterleys.

380
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,416
You do agree with me, don't you?

381
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
[melancholic music playing]

382
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,875
I'm going ahead.

383
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,666
Okay.

384
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,791
They're all talking about your book
in London. It's good work.

385
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,083
You really think so?

386
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,000
I wanted to write something special.

387
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,333
Not just popular,
but something really first class.

388
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,708
The entire pals collective
across the entire northeast,

389
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,750
keeping them together,
making sure they've got all of...

390
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,333
So sorry. Will you excuse me?
Just for a second?

391
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,750
Uh, yes. Um...

392
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,083
- [guests speaking]
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

393
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,208
You imagine they've solved
the world's problems yet?

394
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,375
[chuckles] I'm sure they think they have.

395
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,041
Shame they've forgotten
their solutions by daybreak.

396
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,416
You're a writer.
Maybe you should take notes.

397
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,916
I doubt I'd be welcome
in that drinking circle.

398
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Don't worry. I'm not really
a part of this world, either.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,208
- Oh, but you grew up in it, didn't you?
- Hardly. My father's an artist.

400
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,458
So I grew up between rented villas

401
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:58,625
and woke up each morning
to the smell of turpentine.

402
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,791
Sounds like quite the Bohemian lifestyle.

403
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,416
There must be days
when you don't feel like a lady at all.

404
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:10,333
I head back home in the morning.
With luck, he'd invite me to visit again.

405
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,208
That's the last time
we'll invite the Irish playwright.

406
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,791
- Michaelis?
- Hmm.

407
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,083
He writes well, he knows how to dress,

408
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,208
but he's got the manners
of a Dublin street rat.

409
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,000
Maybe because he knows he's only around
as long as people deem him useful.

410
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,083
[chuckles]

411
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,791
We all know where we stand.

412
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,958
You ought to eat something.
You're wasting away.

413
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,083
- I'm not feeling well.
- Hmm? Mmm.

414
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,666
I haven't been feeling well
since our conversation.

415
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,625
Clifford.

416
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,791
[Clifford chuckles] Here we are, look!

417
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,625
I got my picture in the paper.

418
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,375
[clears throat] Hmm. Chatterley's novella
has garnered attention

419
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,250
for its humorous analysis
of people and their motives,

420
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,791
though his views on modern society
are not young and playful,

421
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,666
but curiously old
and obscenely conceited."

422
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,916
- Clifford, stop reading.
- "A wonderful display of nothingness."

423
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,291
It's just one review.

424
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,583
But they're right.

425
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,458
They... they've seen right through me.

426
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,791
It's all nothing.

427
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,791
A home, love,
sex, marriage, friendship, all of it.

428
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,875
You don't mean that.

429
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,583
I think I do.

430
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,708
I do. The whole point of living

431
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,416
is learning to accept
the great nothingness of life.

432
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,750
I'm going to get dressed.

433
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,208
[door closes]

434
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,625
[mysterious music playing]

435
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,041
[knock at door]

436
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,458
- [door opens]
- [Hilda] Connie. Connie, it's me.

437
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,791
[gasps] Oh my God, you came.

438
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,208
- [Hilda] What's wrong?
- I...

439
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,833
- What's wrong?
- [crying]

440
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,916
Tell me what's wrong.

441
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,291
- What on earth are you doing?
- [sniffles]

442
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,458
What's this?

443
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,750
I just... I wanted a change and...

444
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,625
You're ill.

445
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,333
- No, I'm fine.
- Has no one been looking after you?

446
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,583
Um, they have.

447
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,375
I'm so tired of them watching me, Hilda.

448
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,708
It's inescapable. It's...

449
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,375
I'm so tired.

450
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,083
It's okay.

451
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,666
[Connie] Thank you.

452
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,625
[knock at door]

453
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,083
Connie's not well, Clifford.

454
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,208
You think?

455
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,041
She's exhausted.
Look how thin she's gotten.

456
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,125
I'm afraid
it doesn't suit her to be a half-virgin.

457
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,625
This chair
doesn't very much suit me either, Hilda.

458
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,791
What do you propose?
Find her another of your German soldiers?

459
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,833
She needs to see a doctor.
Do you have one you, uh, use around here?

460
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:05,916
I'll look into it.

461
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,916
No. I'll take her to a doctor we trust.

462
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,041
In the meantime,

463
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,083
you must hire someone
to take care of you personally.

464
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,916
- I'm doing perfectly well, thank you.
- I'm not worried about you, Clifford.

465
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,833
Who's taking care of her
while she's taking care of you?

466
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,791
- Connie and I will discuss it.
- Connie and I already have.

467
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,458
- I believe you know this woman.
- [paper rustling]

468
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,833
Mrs. Bolton.
She cared for you when you were young.

469
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,958
Connie won't be your caregiver any longer.

470
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,958
We're so grateful
that you could come. Really.

471
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,541
It must be hard for Sir Clifford,

472
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,041
all he's suffered,
and hard on you as well.

473
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,000
You think your know how life will be,
and suddenly it's gone.

474
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:53,125
I only had my Ted for three years
before he was killed in mines.

475
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,833
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

476
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,083
Never you mind.

477
00:29:56,166 --> 00:30:00,375
Now, you just follow doctor's orders
and leave the care of Sir Clifford to me.

478
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,583
Ah, Clifford. This is Mrs. Bolton.

479
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,916
I remember Mrs. Bolton.

480
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,250
- Are we all satisfied?
- For the time being.

481
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,416
I'm headed back to London,
and Connie's going for a nice long walk.

482
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,583
Good. Safe travels.

483
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,583
Connie, would you stop in
at the gamekeeper?

484
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,833
Ask if the new pheasants
have begun laying?

485
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,416
Of course.

486
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,041
[water splashing]

487
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,666
- [knock at door]
- [Flossie barking]

488
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:40,916
Lady Chatterley.

489
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,125
- Does Sir Clifford need help?
- No. He sent me.

490
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,833
- Sorry, I don't mean to intrude.
- No.

491
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,041
[Flossie panting]

492
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,250
Do you want to come in?

493
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:01,000
- Sorry. I'm not dressed for company.
- No. Not to worry.

494
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,708
I just wanted, um...

495
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:06,041
Sir Clifford wanted to know
if the new pheasants had begun laying.

496
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,541
Oh, aye. Yes, milady. Yeah.

497
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,500
There'll be plenty of young chicks
in a matter of weeks.

498
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,666
This is a lovely little cottage.
You live alone here?

499
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,000
Quite alone, milady.

500
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,083
You read James Joyce?

501
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,916
That one was hard to find.

502
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Do you read much?

503
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,875
Well, it suits my solitary nature.

504
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,833
Still.

505
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,500
Must be awfully quiet around here.

506
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,125
No, I've got Flossie for company.

507
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,666
Mm-hmm.

508
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,333
Um...

509
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,333
Well, um, I'll let Clifford know

510
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,250
about the pheasants.

511
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,708
Um, thank you.

512
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,708
- I'll see you out then.
- All right.

513
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,916
- Apologies.
- [chuckles]

514
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,041
Lovely flowers.

515
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,416
[Oliver] Take some back with you.

516
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,208
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

517
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,000
[Connie chuckles]

518
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,166
They're yours.

519
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,291
- You sure?
- Yeah, help yoursen.

520
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,416
Good day, then.

521
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,250
Mrs. Flint. I brought you some flowers.

522
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,541
[exclaims] They're beautiful!
Aren't you thoughtful!

523
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,500
[Connie chuckles]

524
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,250
- It's quite all right.
- Let's get you a vase. Sit down.

525
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,875
They're all growing in the fields
by the keeper's cottage. Everywhere.

526
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,208
[hen clucking]

527
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,666
Here, have these.

528
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,166
[Mrs. Flint] Ah. Oh.

529
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,833
Interesting fellow, isn't he, the keeper?

530
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,541
He seems gruff at first, but then...

531
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:59,333
The older teachers still talk about
how clever Oliver Mellors was as a lad.

532
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,416
It's no wonder
he came back home a full lieutenant.

533
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,583
But now he lives down there? Alone?

534
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,541
He was married. Um...

535
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:12,208
But, uh, his wife, Bertha,

536
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,250
the whole time he was gone,
she carried on with other men.

537
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,000
It was awful. Everyone knew.

538
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
So, they're divorced now?

539
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,875
Oh, not properly, I don't think.

540
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,291
Uh, but there never was
much proper about Bertha Coutts.

541
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,916
She's off living
with another man at Stacks Gate.

542
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,166
Ned, I think his name is.

543
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:37,625
I imagine Mr. Mellors would be happier
never hearing from either again.

544
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,291
This is Wendy.

545
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,375
Hello, Wendy.

546
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,750
She's beautiful.

547
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,333
[rain pattering]

548
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,708
[thunder rumbling]

549
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,625
[breathing heavily]

550
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,458
[moans]

551
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,708
[Mrs. Bolton] There was
an explosion in the mines,

552
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,666
and Ted was only 28.

553
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,125
The company
said it was his own fault somehow.

554
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,791
He was running away
when he should have laid down.

555
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,291
Though the compensation was only £300.

556
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,041
I'll never forgive them for that.

557
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,166
Them branding Ted a coward.

558
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,750
He wasn't a coward, though, Mrs. Bolton.

559
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,666
He was only trying to survive.

560
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,416
You really should let Lily do that.

561
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,166
You're his nurse, not his servant.

562
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,250
No, I don't mind. Busy hands, quiet mind.

563
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,931
- [Mrs. Bolton chuckles]
- [bell tinkling]

564
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,333
Oh, there's the bell. I have to go.

565
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,125
[sighs]

566
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,875
[distant hammering]

567
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,208
[hammering continues]

568
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,083
I wondered what the hammering was.

569
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,875
[Flossie panting]

570
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,791
[Oliver] I'm prepping the coops
for the new chicks.

571
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,791
- Oh.
- [hammering resumes]

572
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:44,250
- Is there a chair in this hut?
- [hammering stops]

573
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,333
[hammer thuds]

574
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,708
Come on in.

575
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,166
Thank you.

576
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,583
I'll light you a fire, milady.

577
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,625
- Oh. No, don't bother.
- No, I insist.

578
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,666
- Warm yourself up a little bit.
- [fire crackling]

579
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,083
- All right?
- Thank you.

580
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,250
[hammering resumes]

581
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,250
I never knew this hut was here before.

582
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,583
Not many do.

583
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
It's why I like it.

584
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,541
Do you keep it locked
when you're not around?

585
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,125
Sometimes, milady.

586
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,208
Can I have a key?

587
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,541
You want a key?

588
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:17,708
Hmm.

589
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:19,750
I think I'd like to sit here sometimes.

590
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,875
I don't know if there is another key.

591
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,208
Well, I'll see to it myself, then.

592
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,791
[door opens]

593
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,083
[door closes]

594
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,833
Quite the walk you had.

595
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,958
Sorry. Am I late?

596
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,833
Could have asked Mrs. Bolton to make tea.

597
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,875
I don't quite see her
presiding at the tea table.

598
00:39:56,958 --> 00:40:00,583
Hmm. I don't remember
anything about tea in our wedding vows.

599
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:07,916
Do you know if there's a second key
to the hut where the pheasants are reared?

600
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,500
Uh, yes. There may be one
in the study. Why?

601
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,083
I thought it was quite lovely.
Might read my book there.

602
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,000
Books by that degenerate Irishman?

603
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,041
What? James Joyce?

604
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,458
I heard his next
is to be banned for obscenity.

605
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:23,791
Hmm, such a shame.
I was looking forward to reading it.

606
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:27,708
[clears throat]

607
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,125
- Was Mellors at the hut?
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,375
- He didn't appreciate the intrusion.
- What did he say?

609
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,375
Nothing. It was just his manner.

610
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,541
Don't think he liked me
having freedom of the castle.

611
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:44,000
[scoffs] Comes with a lieutenant
going back to being gamekeeper.

612
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,500
What do you expect, giving a fellow
like that rank and a sense of importance

613
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,791
then taking it all away?

614
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,875
[guitar music playing]

615
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,041
[Connie] <i>Dear Hilda,</i>

616
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,458
<i>I hope it hasn't been raining
all week in London.</i>

617
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,375
<i>It has here.</i>

618
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,333
<i>Until now, I've been able to go out
and explore the grounds all I liked.</i>

619
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,125
<i>But I've spent
most of this last week cooped up,</i>

620
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,041
<i>aching to get back outside.</i>

621
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,125
<i>I'm writing now from a little hut I found.</i>

622
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,708
<i>A secret place
where I can hide away from the world.</i>

623
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,458
<i>Only one other person comes here.</i>

624
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:28,625
Don't worry. I was just going.
Only came to get out the rain.

625
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,041
Here.

626
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,375
I shall leave this here
until I get another one.

627
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,625
Look at you.
You must be lord of the manor.

628
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,916
So, it's a simple enough game.

629
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,125
It begins with a 32-card deck
running seven through ace...

630
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,416
[chirping]

631
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:43,291
[Mrs. Bolton]
...he died last year from a fall.

632
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,375
Eighty-three he was.

633
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,208
- The chicks have started hatching.
- [Clifford] Oh, good.

634
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,500
- [radio static]
- I got Madrid. Listen to this.

635
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,333
[in Spanish] <i>...of evidence of young feds.</i>

636
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:53,541
What are they saying?

637
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,125
[Clifford] Damn!

638
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,958
- I've lost the signal.
- [Mrs. Bolton] Oh.

639
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,000
[Clifford] Damn!

640
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,708
Well, the young have...

641
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,625
Most have left Tevershall, they say,
now the coal's running thin.

642
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:10,458
It won't be long
before the town's finished.

643
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,166
- Finished? Are they really saying that?
- Hmm.

644
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:19,000
Mrs. Bolton,
will you call down to the mines?

645
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:23,041
- See that Mr. Linley joins us for dinner.
- Will do, sir. Absolutely.

646
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,916
[Connie] <i>I wish I could
be with you in Venice,</i>

647
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,791
<i>but Clifford says
he can't manage here without me.</i>

648
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,916
<i>Not yet at least.</i>

649
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,916
<i>But I'll come
on the next holiday, I promise.</i>

650
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,458
[Flossie barking]

651
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:42,458
[Connie] <i>With love, your sister Connie.</i>

652
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,458
[Linley] Well, if it starts
to increase profits.

653
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,291
That should keep them in business
for the foreseeable future.

654
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,958
- We can modernize as well. Why not?
- Clifford, what about your writing?

655
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,291
The literary world doesn't need me.

656
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,666
But the mine's a sinking ship.
It needs a proper captain to save her.

657
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,333
Don't you think the miners
have led grim enough lives?

658
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,416
I mean, couldn't you just
help them move on?

659
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,583
To what? Begging?

660
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,208
[mockingly] "Help them move on."
[in normal voice] You talk like a woman.

661
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,250
Spoken like a man.

662
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,375
[Clifford] Mr. Linley,
how much might it cost us,

663
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:17,041
a ballpark, to build a chemical work?

664
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,166
[Mr. Linley] Initially,
I'd say around £500 to £700.

665
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,666
Obviously, within that,
there is contingency...

666
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,416
[sighs]

667
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,916
[tense music playing]

668
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,291
Came to see the chicks.

669
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,708
How many do we have now?

670
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,750
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

671
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,250
Can I touch one?

672
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,250
Yeah, go on.

673
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,666
[chicks chirping]

674
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,916
What if it pecks at me?

675
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:17,458
Just peck it back.

676
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Ooh.

677
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,541
- [chirping]
- [Connie exclaims]

678
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:30,958
You just...

679
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,500
- [Connie] Ah... Oh...
- [Oliver] Uh...

680
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,291
[Oliver] That's it. Gently.

681
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,250
- [Connie] He's trembling.
- You're trembling more than he is.

682
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,250
[shuddering]

683
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:06,916
That's the way.

684
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,333

Mm-hmm.

713
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,625
I should probably go on alone.

714

Goodbye then.

There you are, milady.
I thought you'd gone lost.

No, I'm absolutely fine.

720
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,708
Why did you lock the door?
I only went to see the new chicks.

721
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,916
Sorry.

722
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,500
Is Clifford upset?
I didn't say goodbye to the guests.

723
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,500
Oh, he hasn't said anything.
He's still in with Mr. Linley.

724

I've been waiting for you.

Don't you think folks will become
suspicious if you keep coming here?

734
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,666
Imagine how lowered you'd feel,
you with your husband's gamekeeper.

But if you were to ever feel sorry
for what we've been...

740
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,291
We have to be quick.

Do we still feel like strangers to you?

Pardon me?

Not like strangers I've ever known.

- Connie... [chuckles] Are you all right?
- Hmm.

- Not feeling unwell again?
- No, not at all. Sorry. You were saying.

I know the mine
seems to be all I speak of these days.

But Tevershall belongs to me.

774

One day it will belong to an heir.

And the mine needs our help.

776
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,458

No, don't turn away. Look at me.

863
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,708
I want you to fuck me.

864
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,958
You want me to fuck you?

865
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,750
Yes.

866
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,416
[both panting]

867
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,125
Yes. Yes.

868
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,750
- Yes. That's it.
- [moans breathlessly]

869
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,083
That's it, Connie.

870
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,416
[moaning intensifies]

871
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,625
[breathing heavily]

872
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,750
[Connie sighs]

873
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:38,833
[Connie] Hmm.

874
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,958
We both came off together that time.

875
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,375
- It's good when that happens.
- Hmm.

876
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,708
Some people live their whole lives
and never know that feeling.

877
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,750
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

878
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:03,083
Is that the... All right, yeah. Fuck knows.

879
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,916
[Mellors laughs]

880
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,791
Fuck.

881
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,958
[both laughing]

882
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:16,083
You're gonna have to help me, Connie.
Here you are.

883
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,666
[piano music playing]

884
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,750
You know what you have?

885
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,208
Tenderness.

886
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,375
I... I didn't say you were gentle.

887
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,208
I've had enough of gentlemen.

888
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,708
- They're a different breed.
- How do you mean?

889
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:51,875
Dead.

890
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Dead.

891
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:59,416
You've got to...
cut them parts of you that feel off,

892
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:02,708
if you're gonna send men into mines or...

893
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:04,708
factories or...

894
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,500
into battle.

895
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,750
Either that
or you live with what you've done.

896
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:20,333
You're not like any man
I've... ever met before.

897
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,041
You're not like any other woman.

898
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:23,958
How?

899
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,125
[whispers] You are beautiful.

900
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:44,166
You know, I don't think I... realized
how lonely I've been until now.

901
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:47,416
Thank you.

902
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,833
You better go.

903
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,333
[exhales]

904
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,291
[panting]

905
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,458
Ten of spades.
Well, I have got you there with the king.

906
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,500
- [Connie] <i>I, Connie...</i>
- [Oliver] <i>I, Oliver...</i>

907
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,125
<i>- ...take you, Oliver...
- ...take you, Connie...</i>

908
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:50,916
<i>- ...in strength...</i>
- [Connie] <i>...and in freedom...</i>

909
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:53,333
[both] <i>...and in ecstasy.</i>

910
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,875
[melancholy music playing]

911
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,541
- [Connie squeals]
- [Oliver exclaims]

912
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,728
- [exclaims]
- [Oliver] How deep is it?

913
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,375
[exclaims]

914
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:47,541
- [Flossie whines]
- Please.

915
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,291
- "Why do I like you?"
- Mm-hmm.

916
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:56,458
"Fruit is black."

917
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,250
[melancholy music continues]

918
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:09,291
[panting]

919
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Hmm.

920
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:24,000
[sighs]

921
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,041
- [rain pattering]
- [thunder rumbling]

922
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,916
Oh, Your Ladyship,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

923
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
- I saw the light and...
- [chuckling] It's all right, honestly.

924
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:52,458
[sighs] Sit.
Be happy to have some company.

925
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,541
Really.

926
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:56,375
Why are you up so late?

927
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:59,750
Uh, Sir Clifford,
he's not been sleeping. [sighs]

928
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,416
I can't help looking in on him.

929
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:05,416
- Hmm.
- It was the same with me husband.

930
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,291
If he so much as got a cold,
I'd be up all night worrying over him.

931
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:10,375
[Connie] Ted.

932
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:12,708
You must miss him.

933
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,833
Oh, it's been 25 years,

934
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:18,125
but do you know, still sometimes in bed,

935
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,875
I'll wake up, and I think,
"He's not in bed with me."

936
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:22,958
[chuckles]

937
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,458
[Connie] Oh, it's just the touch of him.

938
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,541
Aye.

939
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,083
It's amazing, isn't it?

940
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,791
How someone can get so into your blood.

941
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,291
[Mrs. Bolton] Oh, it is.

942
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,083
It can make you bitter.

943
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,916
If it hadn't been for that pit,
Ted'd still be here.

944
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,875
He hated it down there.

945
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:48,291
He hated it, but what could he do?
He was trapped.

946
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,083
I suppose we all are in different ways.

947
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:56,541
You never wanted to remarry?

948
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:58,166
- Oh, Lord.
- [both chuckle]

949
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,208
Ted was the only one?

950
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:01,791
He was.

951
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:05,625
But you and your man,
you know, you grow together.

952
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:08,583
Who else is there in life?

953
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:11,625
Children, of course, but... Oh.

954
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,875
- I'm sorry, that was thoughtless of me.
- No.

955
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,916
Don't worry. It's fine.

956
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,291
Um...

957
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,416
More than fine, actually.

958
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:23,625
There still might
be some hope in that regard.

959
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,083
- For you and Sir Clifford?
- Hmm.

960
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:29,000
Doctor says his recovery is remarkable.

961
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:30,083
So who knows?

962
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,875
I might have a child yet.

963
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,916
Well, I hope and pray that you do.

964
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,416
Can I get you a blanket?

965
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,166
No, I'm fine, thank you.

966
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,916
Sleep well. Save some secrets
for our next conversation.

967
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,375
Good night.

968
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:01,916
[Flossie grunts]

969
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,458
[inhales deeply] Come on now, you lass.

970
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,250
I think we're best off outside.

971
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,041
Come on.

972
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,125
[whistling]

973
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,666
[dramatic music playing]

974
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,083
[clicking tongue]

975
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,916
[Clifford groans]

976
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,666
[Clifford grunting]

977
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,750
- [groaning]
- [Mrs. Bolton] There, there.

978
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,458
[Flossie barking in distance]

979
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,916
[Mrs. Bolton sighs]

980
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:52,500
Has Her Ladyship not risen yet?

981
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,666
- She got up before I did.
- Hmm.

982
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,083
She's already had her breakfast, then.

983
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,333
Yes. She's out on one of her walks.

984
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,958
I was up early myself.

985
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:06,666
There were a lot of people out this morn.
[breathing heavily]

986
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:09,750
- The gamekeeper, he was...
- Could you get me some fresh cream?

987
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:13,500
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

988
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:16,750
- [water splashing]
- [woman 1] <i>Since Sir Clifford took over,</i>

989
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,291
they've been working
the poor miners to the bone.

990
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:22,208
I thought the machines
were supposed to make the work easier.

991
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,708
It's a way to make
more money with fewer workers.

992
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:26,833
[woman 2] Don't he have
enough money already?

993
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,500
Oh, bet his lady
needs her baubles and silk

994
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,583
so she can
lord her station over the rest of us.

995
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,083
No, she's not like that.

996
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,875
She treats folks who work with her

997
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:37,458
with the same respect
she'd treat a lord or lady.

998
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,541
My Lily says the same about her.

999
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,208
Well, she deserves better then.

1000
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:43,166
Such a hard lot that's fallen to her.

1001
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:49,666
Oh! As it happens, uh, Sir Clifford
may not be quite as done in as we thought.

1002
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:54,791
Oh, his legs won't work again,
but, you know, rest might.

1003
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:59,625
Her Ladyship has even suggested
there might be a child one day soon.

1004
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,541
What?

1005
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:01,541
- No!
- [chuckling]

1006
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:04,083
- That's amazing.
- You ever heard of such a thing?

1007
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,166
[Clifford] How long
should these things last?

1008
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,250
[Mr. Linley] If we keep them
in good repair, for generations.

1009
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,583
Speaking of which, sir,
if you don't mind my asking,

1010
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,791
is there any truth to the rumor

1011
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:18,291
that we may
still have hope of an heir at Wragby?

1012
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,250
Are there rumors?

1013
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:21,958
Yes.

1014
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,375
Everyone's been asking me
what I know about it.

1015
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:28,041
I am happy to set the record straight
if the rumor's unfounded.

1016
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,041
Indeed.

1017
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:31,916
Well...

1018
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,958
there may yet be hope.

1019
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,250
Hello, Con.

1020
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,125
I've just had

1021
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:43,416
the most interesting meeting
with Mr. Linley.

1022
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:45,291
Hmm?

1023
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,458
Have you heard the rumor

1024
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,500
that you are to supply Wragby
with an heir?

1025
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:54,875
No.

1026
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Is it a joke?

1027
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,875
I'd hoped it might be a prophecy.

1028
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,000
I received a letter from Father.

1029
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:08,625
He's been invited to Venice
for July and August

1030
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:12,041
and has asked me and Hilda
to come with him.

1031
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,583
July and August?

1032
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,125
I wouldn't need to go for that long.

1033
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,333
Three weeks
should be more than enough time

1034
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:20,541
for what we discussed.

1035
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,125
Have plans already been set in motion?

1036
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,750
Not just yet.

1037
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:33,791
If I were absolutely certain
you'd want to come back to me?

1038
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:36,166
Of course I would.

1039
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,500
I don't want to know his name.

1040
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
No one can.

1041
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:54,958
Well, in that case, I think
it ought to be all right, don't you?

1042
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,333
Mm-hmm.

1043
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:07,666
[Connie] You know how much
you mean to me, don't you?

1044
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,041
And you to me.

1045
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,416
I have to go away for a while.

1046
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,833
- Where?
- Venice.

1047
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:19,583
With Sir Clifford?

1048
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,666
- For how long?
- Just a couple of months.

1049
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,125
But no, not with Clifford.

1050
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,083
He doesn't like to travel how he is.

1051
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,166
Aye.

1052
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,916
The poor devil.

1053
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,750
- You won't forget about me.
- Forget?

1054
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,708
- Mm-hmm.
- You know nobody forgets.

1055
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:38,500
It's not a question of memory.

1056
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,625
[sniffs]

1057
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,000
Look, um...

1058
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:49,791
I told Clifford I might have a child.

1059
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:53,666
You did?

1060
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:59,541
I... I think I'm already... expecting.

1061
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,125
[fire crackling]

1062
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,416
Oliver?

1063
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,750
What did he say?

1064
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:18,041
Um...

1065
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,666
He said he'd be glad

1066
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,458
as long as the child seemed to be his.

1067
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,958
So where does Sir Clifford suppose
that this child is coming from?

1068
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:32,041
- I said I might have an affair in Venice.
- You might. So that's why you're going.

1069
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,708
Not to have the affair.
Just the appearance of one.

1070
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,375
So that's why you wanted me then.

1071
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:40,958
To get a child.

1072
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,791
Of course not, Oliver.

1073
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:47,833
I never planned on you.
I never planned on any of this, really.

1074
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:50,916
What was the plan then, Connie?

1075
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,458
What was the plan, really?

1076
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,500
- What was the plan?
- I...

1077
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,916
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1078
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,416
Well, then, I am damned if I do.

1079
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,541
Fucking hell.

1080
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:06,166
Well, it's as Your Ladyship likes.

1081
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:08,666
If you get a child,
Sir Clifford's welcome to it.

1082
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,208
I shan't have lost anything.

1083
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,583
On the contrary,
I've had a nice experience.

1084
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,166
- Don't talk like that.
- If you've made use of me,

1085
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,583
it's not the first time
I've been made use of, is it?

1086
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,083
I don't suppose
it's ever been as pleasant as this time.

1087
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:24,583
Of course, one can't feel
tremendously dignified about it.

1088
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:28,333
I didn't make use of you... Oliver.

1089
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,333
As Your Ladyship pleases.

1090
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,708
- You forgot your book.
- [door slams]

1091
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,666
Or have you made use of that as well?

1092
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,625
With the new generators,
we'll be able to reduce the workforce.

1093
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:47,458
- Striking will be impossible.
- What about the workers?

1094
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:50,083
No man's forced to work for me.
I'm not forced to hire them.

1095
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,166
[Connie scoffs]

1096
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:54,791
- No wonder the men hate you.
- They don't hate me.

1097
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,041
They depend on me.
They should be grateful.

1098
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:59,375
They'd starve
without someone to tend them.

1099
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,791
You talk about them
as if they're herd animals.

1100
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,875
Not all of them.

1101
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:05,416
An individual
may rise from the pack now and again.

1102
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,000
Most of those men
have been ruled since time began.

1103
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,333
And you can rule them?

1104
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:12,125
Yes, because I've been brought up
and trained to do so.

1105
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,791
That's my role in society,
as it's their place to serve.

1106
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:18,041
So there is no shared humanity between us?

1107
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:20,708
We all need to eat and breathe,
but beyond that, no.

1108
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,500
Shall we go as far as the spring?

1109
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,125
Good day to you, Mr. Mellors!

1110
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:27,541
- [horn honking]
- Ayuh.

1111
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,625
[engine straining]

1112
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,083
Wait, Clifford. I'll push.

1113
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:40,875
What's the use of the thing
if she needs to be pushed?

1114
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:43,625
- [grunts] You're making it worse!
- Be quiet a moment, will you?

1115
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:45,833
[Connie groans]

1116
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,500
[Clifford grunts]

1117
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:49,958
Damn thing!

1118
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,083
- [grunts]
- Wait, stop!

1119
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,375
- [horn honks]
- Mellors.

1120
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:58,875
- Yes, Sir Clifford?
- Know anything about blasted motors?

1121
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,500
- I'm afraid not. Has she gone wrong?
- Apparently!

1122
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:03,916
Just have a look
and see that nothing's broken.

1123
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,666
[sighs]

1124
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:10,000
[Oliver grunting]

1125
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
No.

1126
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:18,000
Seems all right as far as I can see, sir.

1127
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,458
[Clifford] Then stand back.

1128
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,000
[engine starts]

1129
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,875
- Maybe if I give it a push.
- No. She'll do it herself.

1130
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:34,333
Yeah?

1131
01:23:34,416 --> 01:23:36,583
- You see? Good.
- [engine straining]

1132
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,791
Are you pushing? I asked you not.

1133
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,291
- It won't go if I don't.
- Give it a chance, man!

1134
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:46,791
Clifford, watch your brake.

1135
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:51,291
- Right. Fine.
- Clifford!

1136
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,666
[engine stops]

1137
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,125
It's obvious
I'm at everybody's bloody mercy.

1138
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:04,958
It would seem, Mr. Mellors,
that she would need to be pushed.

1139
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,541
Do you mind?

1140
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:08,875
- Not at all, sir.
- Hmm.

1141
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:11,750
Right.

1142
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,416
- Hang on, hang on.
- [grunts]

1143
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,541
- Two, three.
- [engine starts]

1144
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:17,708
Bombs away.

1145
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,500
- [Oliver grunts]
- There we are.

1146
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:21,791
[Oliver coughing]

1147
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:24,250
For God's sake, man,
what's the matter with you?

1148
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:29,208
Lungs are a bit knackered, sir.
[coughs] Little souvenir from the war.

1149
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:31,916
[Clifford] What the hell are you doing?

1150
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,291
- He needs my help, Clifford!
- [Clifford] God's sake.

1151
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:37,041
You all right?

1152
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,666
[engine revs]

1153
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:02,625
[Clifford] <i>I suppose the other chair
will need a new set of wheels.</i>

1154
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:04,291
[Connie] <i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1155
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,041
I mean,
how can you treat someone like that?

1156
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:09,166
[Clifford scoffs] Who? The gamekeeper?

1157
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,958
He was injured in the war as well.

1158
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:15,541
I mean, if he was in that chair,
what would you have done to him?

1159
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,125
I find your comparison in very bad taste.

1160
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,791
I find your lack of common sympathy
to be in the worst taste imaginable.

1161
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,541
You and your ruling class.

1162
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,625
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

1163
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,625
You make people work
for £2 a week or starve.

1164
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,541
It's not ruling, Clifford.

1165
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:33,625
That's bullying.

1166
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,458
[thunder rumbling]

1167
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,541
[door opens and closes]

1168
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,791
- [fire crackling]
- [footsteps approaching]

1169
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:50,000
Come on in, then.

1170
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,291
I'm sorry.

1171
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,541
I'm sorry for hurting you.

1172
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:06,000
I don't want you
for the sake of a child... Oliver.

1173
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,041
I just want you.

1174
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,041
All right?

1175
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,083
All right.

1176
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:22,583
But Clifford has to believe
that I tried to keep us together.

1177
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,666
That this was his idea,

1178
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:27,416
just all gone terribly wrong.

1179
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,708
For him to give me a divorce,
for us to be together,

1180
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,541
he needs to believe that.

1181
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:38,833
I just want to be with you.

1182
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,708
If that's what you want.

1183
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:47,666
It's not about wanting, Connie.
You know what I want.

1184
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,166
I've still got to get a divorce
from Bertha meself.

1185
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,708
What happened with Bertha?

1186
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:01,583
I went off to war,
she carried on with other men.

1187
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,125
And now she refuses to divorce me.

1188
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,875
- What about her other man?
- Ned?

1189
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,791
- Mm-hmm.
- He's a big baby of a fella.

1190
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:11,458
She bullies him.

1191
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:15,875
They both drink, he gets sent around here
to harass me for me war pension.

1192
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,833
Aye, let's dinna fight.

1193
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,333
- [Connie sighs]
- [Oliver kisses]

1194
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,416
[Oliver] I'm sorry.

1195
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,041
Why don't we just leave them all behind?

1196
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:34,875
Go to Australia.

1197
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,333
Go somewhere...

1198
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,250
Anywhere.

1199
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,250
- The three of us?
- Just our family.

1200
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,583
No one would judge us.

1201
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:54,583
Seems a wrong and bitter thing
to be bringing a child into this world.

1202
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:58,416
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

1203
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,458
- No.
- No, I mean this world here.

1204
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:03,458
I'm pleased for us.

1205
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,416
I'm pleased for you to be pleased.

1206
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:12,958
But when I think about around here,
what man has done to man...

1207
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,750
- [rain pattering]
- [thunder rumbling]

1208
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:17,916
...what leaders of men
have done to their so-called fellow men.

1209
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:22,166
Reduced them to less than humanness.

1210
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:25,083
Half corpses
and they think about nowt but money.

1211
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,541
Living to make money.

1212
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:34,375
But not all of us
have the freedom to live life how we want.

1213
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,333
Not all of us can do as we...

1214
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:40,916
Connie.

1215
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:43,666
What are you doing?

1216
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,541
[rumbling continues]

1217
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,875
[screaming] Whoo!

1218
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,458
Whoo!

1219
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,333
[Connie] Come on!

1220
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,916
[Oliver] Whoo!

1221
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,041
[both laughing]

1222
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:31,333
[Connie squealing]

1223
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,583
[both yelling excitedly]

1224
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:19,333
Where is she? She's been gone for hours.

1225
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:22,041
Well, I'm sure
it's just the rain that's keeping her.

1226
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,291
She's... she's probably sheltering
in the hut.

1227
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:27,583
- I'll send Warren and Betts to find her.
- No, don't you do that.

1228
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:29,166
It'll only get people talking.

1229
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,750
I'll slip over to the hut
and, uh, see if she's there.

1230
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:34,791
- What? And leave me here alone?
- Oh, don't you worry.

1231
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,083
We'll be back in no time.

1232
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,500
- Ayup.
- Ayup.

1233
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,791
- Ayup, me duck.
- Ayup, me duck.

1234
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,041
[both vocalizing]

1235
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:50,791
I leave for Venice on Thursday.

1236
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,833
I'll come by the cottage that night.

1237
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,125
[Mrs. Bolton] Milady?

1238
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:20,416
Oh, milady, there you are.

1239
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,375
Sir Clifford asked me to look for you.
He was worried something had happened.

1240
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:27,666
No. No, I was sheltering
in the hut from the rain.

1241
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,416
Mrs. Bolton.

1242
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,500
Your Ladyship would be
quite all right from here.

1243
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,833
Good evening to you.
Good evening to you, Your Ladyship.

1244
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:42,125
I am not a child.
It's monstrous that I have to be followed.

1245
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,291
My Ladyship, don't say that.

1246
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:47,250
Sir Clifford was sure
you'd been struck by lightning.

1247
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,541
It's not your fault.
It's foolish of Clifford to worry.

1248
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:52,250
[Connie sighs]

1249
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,875
Well, let's go home now.

1250
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,625
And I'll take care of the rest.

1251
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,458
You don't need
to send the servants out after me.

1252
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:08,166
[Clifford] God, where have you been?

1253
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,666
You've been gone out hours,
and in a storm like this.

1254
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,083
What have you been doing?

1255
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,583
What if I choose not to tell you?
I went to the hut and lit a fire.

1256
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:20,375
- Look at you. The state of your hair.
- I went out into the rain... naked.

1257
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,708
[sputtering] Are you mad?

1258
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,541
Suppose Mellors had seen you
while you were prancing with nothing on.

1259
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:30,000
Yes... suppose he had.

1260
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:34,708
You're right, Clifford.
I should really go and get cleaned up.

1261
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:38,500
[Clifford] Connie!

1262
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,208
[clock ticking]

1263
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,958
[vehicle approaching]

1264
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,458
[brakes squeal]

1265
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,958
[Connie] My sister's here!

1266
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:01,500
- [chuckles]
- [car door closes]

1267
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:02,500
Hilda.

1268
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,875
- [Hilda] It's so good to see you.
- It's been too long.

1269
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:08,125
[Hilda] Good to see you.

1270
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,708
[Connie] You know I've met someone,
don't you?

1271
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,125
[both squealing and laughing]

1272
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:15,125
I gathered from your letters, yes.

1273
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:19,208
I tried to tell myself it was nothing.
I tried to stay away. I did.

1274
01:33:19,791 --> 01:33:21,458
But I can't.

1275
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:22,541
He...

1276
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,375
I really love him.

1277
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:26,625
- Wow.
- And... I know.

1278
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:29,958
And I said I would stay with him tonight.
I promised.

1279
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:32,166
Are you going to tell me who he is?

1280
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,291
Oliver Mellors.

1281
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:35,125
He's our gamekeeper.

1282
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:41,708
[hesitates] No, Hilda. He's lovely.

1283
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:45,625
Honestly, he has
such an understanding and tenderness.

1284
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:47,666
He's quite the exception, you'll see.

1285
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,083
[sighs]

1286
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,250
I long hoped you would find someone else.

1287
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,041
- But one of Clifford's servants?
- I'm not giving him up!

1288
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:58,958
[scoffs] Listen to you. It's you
and that German boy all over again.

1289
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:01,958
- It's not, Hilda! It's nothing like that!
- Yes, it is!

1290
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:04,916
Confusing sex with love,
and then thinking it can continue

1291
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,625
just because it's what you want.

1292
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:11,250
Please, come to Venice and take the time
to think through what you really want.

1293
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,916
I know what I want!

1294
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
- Really?
- Yes!

1295
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:18,333
And I'm seeing him tonight
or I'm not going to Venice. I can't!

1296
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:21,583
I really thought that you,
of all people, would understand!

1297
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:29,541
Goodbye.

1298
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,583
- Bye.
- I look forward to your letters.

1299
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,666
[Connie chuckles]

1300
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:36,750
You have a good time,
and then come back and cheer us up.

1301
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,458
I will. Take care.

1302
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,583
[Flossie barks]

1303
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:46,083
Oliver.

1304
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:48,000
This is my sister, Hilda.

1305
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,875
- [Oliver] Hello.
- Hilda, this is Oliver Mellors.

1306
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,458
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1307
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:56,708
Take a seat then.

1308
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,083
[Connie] Hilda.

1309
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,500
What do you want me to say?

1310
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:13,541
Whatever it is you're thinking.

1311
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,625
Very well.

1312
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,541
It is one thing
to hold trysts in your cottage,

1313
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:23,166
but what happens
when you go out into the world?

1314
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,083
When Connie's friends
cross the street to avoid her.

1315
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:28,208
That's not fair.

1316
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,375
She's got me figured out, then, eh?

1317
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:35,500
What summed me up so quick?
Were it summat I said?

1318
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:37,791
Mr. Mellors.

1319
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,375
How do you expect to take care of her
once you've lost your job?

1320
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:46,958
Do you actually believe
you can give her a chance at happiness?

1321
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,708
Oh, you're asking the wrong person there.

1322
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,083
All I know is I get
a great deal of happiness from her.

1323
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:56,041
- Thought of your own happiness at least.
- Hilda, enough!

1324
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:59,208
I think you understand
far better than she does

1325
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,208
how badly this could end, Mr. Mellors.

1326
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,666
Think about how much
she really means to you.

1327
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,833
I'll pick you up
in the morning, Connie. Early.

1328
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:12,958
Don't keep me waiting.

1329
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:15,208
- Mr. Mellors.
- [Connie] Hilda.

1330
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:23,958
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have brought her.

1331
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:30,041
Please don't let her upset you.

1332
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:32,541
She's just protective.

1333
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:34,916
She's right.

1334
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,416
We haven't thought
beyond tomorrow, have we?

1335
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:43,708
Sir Clifford will fight this divorce.

1336
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:45,875
He'll fight to keep our child.

1337
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:06,125
I never had to think about these things
until you turned up.

1338
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:16,750
Let's go upstairs.

1339
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:36,791
[Oliver exhales deeply]

1340
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:47,166
[both breathing heavily]

1341
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,708
[both moaning breathlessly]

1342
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,916
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

1343
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,250
- [gasping, moaning]
- Yes.

1344
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,708
[both moaning]

1345
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,541
[Connie chuckles]

1346
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,291
[Connie sighs]

1347
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:35,708
[Oliver breathing heavily]

1348
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,166
[banging at door]

1349
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,458
[Flossie barking]

1350
01:38:58,750 --> 01:38:59,750
[growls]

1351
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,583
The fuck are you playing at, Ned?

1352
01:39:21,666 --> 01:39:25,041
Calm down, Mellors.
I'm not here to fight. Bertha sent me.

1353
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,541
She's your problem now.

1354
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:27,958
Not mine.

1355
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:29,250
Ain't how she sees it.

1356
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:33,333
She's still your wife,
entitled to half your military pension.

1357
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:36,375
Aye, and I'm entitled to a divorce.
I won't get one, will I?

1358
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:40,458
- Fuck off, then.
- [Flossie growling]

1359
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:42,750
- All right. I'm going.
- [Flossie barks]

1360
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:44,875
[Ned] I'm going.

1361
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:47,750
- [door closes]
- [lock clicks]

1362
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:49,791
[Oliver sighs]

1363
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:51,958
[Connie] Is he gone?

1364
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,625
Unless his heart's just given out running.

1365
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:58,000
Stay there till we know he's gone.

1366
01:40:06,666 --> 01:40:09,166
- [car horn honks]
- Oh, what is she thinking?

1367
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:12,750
Go on.

1368
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:35,041
[Hilda] Connie.

1369
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,458
For heaven's sake, Connie.

1370
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:21,750
We're going to Venice tomorrow.
Do you have to look so miserable?

1371
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:28,625
I think I'm pregnant.

1372
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,291
Oh.

1373
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:34,541
Right.

1374
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,500
I assume it's not Clifford's.

1375
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:39,666
No.

1376
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:46,666
Although, he did say he would be happy
for me to have a child with another man.

1377
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,166
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

1378
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,791
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

1379
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:52,750
It's all right.

1380
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,041
What exactly?

1381
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:56,875
What's happened?

1382
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,375
[sighs]

1383
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:01,500
I'm in love with someone

1384
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:03,791
other than Clifford.

1385
01:42:05,166 --> 01:42:06,375
So you've taken a lover?

1386
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,416
Well, good.

1387
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:10,333
Do I know the man?

1388
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,750
[scoffs] No.

1389
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:19,041
But I think I...
want a divorce from Clifford.

1390
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:22,583
[Sir Malcolm] Because of your feelings
for this other man?

1391
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:30,041
Well, if you want my opinion... [sighs]

1392
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:35,583
I'm sorry, but you stand to gain
very little by breaking things off.

1393
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,541
Feelings come and go.

1394
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,666
You may love one man this year
and another the next,

1395
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,541
but the world will go on.

1396
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:45,666
And Wragby will go on standing.

1397
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,250
Please yourself,

1398
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:52,458
but stick by Wragby.

1399
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,416
And Wragby will stick by you.

1400
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:00,083
Let's go to Venice, shall we?

1401
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:07,125
[dramatic music playing]

1402
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,166
[paper rustles]

1403
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:50,166
[Ned] He comes back home
thinking he's better than the lot of us.

1404
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:53,958
Gets the world to think poor Bertha's
to blame for all their trouble,

1405
01:43:54,041 --> 01:43:55,875
and then he refuses to support her.

1406
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:57,958
- [man] Bloody disgrace.
- I know.

1407
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:01,958
Bertha goes to the cottage today,
trying to patch things up.

1408
01:44:02,041 --> 01:44:02,916
Makes sense.

1409
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
She found
them silk nightclothes in the fire.

1410
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:05,916
[all laughing]

1411
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,666
No wonder he keeps to himself.
He's hiding a woman in there.

1412
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,958
Lady Chatterley
loans her gamekeeper a book,

1413
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:14,000
and she's accused of...
Sorry, that's outrageous.

1414
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:16,767
[woman] Of course it is. I won't breathe
another word on the subject.

1415
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,391
[woman 2] Everyone's talking about it.
You know how people gossip.

1416
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:22,083
Sir, no one
wants to have this conversation,

1417
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:23,166
but we must.

1418
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:25,875
[Linley] And of course,
it's pure nonsense.

1419
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:28,833
But your gamekeeper
seems to inspire all manner of rumors.

1420
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,750
The sooner you pack him off, the better.

1421
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,833
[Clifford] I appreciate
you coming to me with this.

1422
01:44:33,916 --> 01:44:35,291
Your concerns are noted.

1423
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:45,416
Hello... [hesitates]

1424
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,291
I'd like a London number, please.

1425
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:50,625
<i>Lady Chatterley.</i>

1426
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,208
- Ayuh, Mrs. Bolton.
- Good day.

1427
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:04,791
I hear Sir Clifford's asking for me.

1428
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:06,833
Of course, yes. He's in his study.

1429
01:45:06,916 --> 01:45:07,958
Right, aye.

1430
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:09,875
Mr. Mellors.

1431
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,750
I called Her Ladyship,
and she's coming back.

1432
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:15,583
- When?
- This evening.

1433
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:17,458
As soon as she can get here.

1434
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:20,375
She said you could meet at the hut
and decide what to do.

1435
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,083
There's...

1436
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:30,583
There's dark days coming, Mrs. Bolton.

1437
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:33,791
Best to steer clear from it all.

1438
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,708
[knock at door]

1439
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:41,791
[Clifford] Come in.

1440
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:46,291
[door closes]

1441
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:54,666
You are my servant,

1442
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:58,708
living upon my land at my sole discretion,

1443
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:03,500
and now your indecencies
have become the subject of gossip.

1444
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:07,583
You should
shut the mouths of the gossips...

1445
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:10,458
Are you aware that Lady Chatterley's
name has been slandered?

1446
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:14,083
Apparently, her name was inscribed
in a book found at the cottage.

1447
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:20,458
I've got a picture of Queen Mary
on me wall calendar.

1448
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:22,375
I suppose she's in my harem as well.

1449
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:26,041
I do not appreciate your sarcasm, Mellors.

1450
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:29,833
You have until the end of today,

1451
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,750
after which time I never want to see you
set foot upon my land again.

1452
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,625
- Do I make myself clear?
- Oh, perfectly.

1453
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:37,666
I better get packing then.

1454
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,333
[engine stops]

1455
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:54,291
Mrs. Flint. Mrs. Flint, excuse me.

1456
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,875
- I have to get Josephine to bed.
- I know you've heard things.

1457
01:46:56,958 --> 01:47:00,333
Please, I can't do this.
We lease this farm from Sir Clifford.

1458
01:47:00,416 --> 01:47:01,416
And you always will.

1459
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,541
You met him here, didn't you?
The day he came to get milk?

1460
01:47:04,625 --> 01:47:06,875
- I thought you'd come to see us.
- Of course I did.

1461
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:09,041
I found where you
parked the car in the trees.

1462
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:12,000
- No, that was one time.
- I don't want to know.

1463
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:13,166
[gate squeals]

1464
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,291
Good evening, Lady Chatterley.

1465
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:24,875
[panting]

1466
01:47:42,125 --> 01:47:44,875
[Connie] What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1467
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:46,041
[breathing heavily]

1468
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:47,625
Oliver.

1469
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:52,916
The cat is well and truly
out of the bag now, Connie.

1470
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,291
Everybody's talking.

1471
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,125
I've been sacked.

1472
01:47:56,208 --> 01:47:59,250
You cannot be seen here, Connie.
You need to be in Venice.

1473
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:03,125
- But we could just leave together. Now.
- Look at me.

1474
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:04,583
I have nothing to give you.

1475
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:07,916
I've no job. I've no home.
I've no purpose in life. Nothing.

1476
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Don't say that.

1477
01:48:09,041 --> 01:48:10,625
You are everything to me.

1478
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:13,750
[man] Mellors!

1479
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:17,166
You need to go!

1480
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:21,833
[sniffs]

1481
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,083
- Look at me.
- Shh.

1482
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:28,375
Promise me, promise me
we'll share our lives.

1483
01:48:29,208 --> 01:48:30,791
- Aye.
- Promise.

1484
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:32,625
Aye, me lass.

1485
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:34,125
When the time comes.

1486
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:36,166
When the time comes.

1487
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,500
- [man] Mellors!
- [Oliver] Oh...

1488
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:44,666
Ayuh, can I grab me coat, mate, or...

1489
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:47,041
[sniffles]

1490
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:49,916
[door closes]

1491
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,500
[somber music playing]

1492
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,083
I'll find you.

1493
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:14,458
Wherever you are, I'll find you.

1494
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:33,333
[door opens]

1495
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:39,583
- [door closes]
- [sobbing]

1496
01:50:10,916 --> 01:50:13,833
- My Ladyship, you shouldn't be here.
- No, Mrs. Bolton.

1497
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:19,333
[Clifford] Connie.

1498
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:26,875
It's all true.

1499
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:32,916
Why would you do this?

1500
01:50:34,666 --> 01:50:37,666
- It was your idea.
- My idea? No, no, no.

1501
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:41,125
Clifford, you knew perfectly well
what I was getting into.

1502
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:44,375
With the right sort of man.
I said the right sort!

1503
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:47,958
Oliver Mellors is a better person
than anyone I've ever met.

1504
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:50,583
I was perfectly clear, Connie.

1505
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:53,833
- We discussed the rules.
- I'm going to have his child.

1506
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:54,916
You're going to...

1507
01:50:57,708 --> 01:50:58,708
You're sure?

1508
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,416
But... everybody knows.

1509
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,958
You can't possibly expect me
to claim that child as mine now.

1510
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:08,041
No, I...

1511
01:51:09,416 --> 01:51:10,416
I don't.

1512
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:13,541
I don't.

1513
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:18,250
I want a divorce, Clifford.

1514
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:21,958
I'm leaving you.

1515
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:25,458
No. No, you can't.

1516
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,958
Look, I'm... I'm so sorry
about how this has all turned out,

1517
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:31,208
but we both know that this... marriage

1518
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:33,666
has been very unhappy
for a very long time now.

1519
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,666
It hasn't been.
It hasn't been. Not for me.

1520
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,791
Well, yes.

1521
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,500
Because you laid out all the rules.

1522
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:42,916
And I tried to follow them.

1523
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:48,333
I tried to support you
in every way I could.

1524
01:51:50,541 --> 01:51:53,083
[voice shaking] But you gave me
nothing in return.

1525
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:57,500
Not the slightest drop
of affection or kindness.

1526
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:01,750
And what's worse, you made me feel ashamed
for even wanting those things.

1527
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:04,083
I've always cared for you, Connie.

1528
01:52:04,166 --> 01:52:05,500
Yes, cared for me.

1529
01:52:06,208 --> 01:52:09,375
In the same way you care
for your books and for your radio,

1530
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:12,083
but never in the ways I need you to.

1531
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:14,333
[Clifford] I love you, Connie.

1532
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,583
I've loved you the only way I know how.

1533
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:23,500
I've given you everything
I know how to give.

1534
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:28,958
It's not enough.

1535
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:31,125
Then talk to me, Con.

1536
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:34,458
Help me understand.

1537
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:39,375
Show me how I can prove to you how I feel.

1538
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:44,458
Let me go.

1539
01:52:47,166 --> 01:52:48,166
Please.

1540
01:52:49,166 --> 01:52:50,250
Let me go.

1541
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:56,083
Go.

1542
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:57,833
Though know this.

1543
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:02,125
I will never grant you your divorce.

1544
01:53:04,416 --> 01:53:05,916
Because you broke your word.

1545
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:11,458
Because you've made a mockery
of my life here in Wragby.

1546
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:17,541
I am not inclined
to give you anything ever again.

1547
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:23,708
I don't think you ever really were.

1548
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,583
[sobbing]

1549
01:53:43,875 --> 01:53:44,875
Milady.

1550
01:53:45,958 --> 01:53:46,958
Uh...

1551
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:51,250
I wasn't meaning to pry,
but I worried about you.

1552
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:54,333
I'm all right. [sighs]

1553
01:53:57,791 --> 01:53:58,791
Listen.

1554
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,208
You have no idea where Mellors has gone?

1555
01:54:02,291 --> 01:54:03,291
No.

1556
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:09,291
Would you ask your friends
to let you know if they hear any news?

1557
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:12,916
And why shall I say I'm asking?

1558
01:54:14,791 --> 01:54:15,791
Because I love him.

1559
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:19,375
- Tell them that.
- Yes, milady.

1560
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:22,125
Milady...

1561
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:27,750
I do hope you find your gentleman.

1562
01:54:31,583 --> 01:54:32,916
Thank you, Mrs. Bolton.

1563
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:35,541
So do I.

1564
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:38,125
So do I. [chuckles softly]

1565
01:54:48,541 --> 01:54:50,541
[classical music playing]

1566
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,541
[church bell tolling in distance]

1567
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:55,750
[woman 1] <i>It's all true, then?</i>

1568
01:55:56,458 --> 01:55:58,208
<i>Has Her Ladyship left Sir Clifford?</i>

1569
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:01,083
Her Ladyship has asked

1570
01:56:01,833 --> 01:56:04,666
that you will pass along
any news of Mr. Mellors.

1571
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:08,750
"'Cause I love him," she said.

1572
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:12,083
She gave up everything for him.

1573
01:56:12,166 --> 01:56:15,708
Her title, her wealth,
her position in the world.

1574
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:17,458
Now she's lost him.

1575
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:24,250
I'll not hear a word spoken against them.

1576
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,833
This is a love story.

1577
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,416
[children yelling]

1578
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:39,333
[church bell tolling in distance]

1579
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
[somber music playing]

1580
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:10,500
[speaking indistinctly]

1581
01:57:32,541 --> 01:57:34,125
[gossiping]

1582
01:57:37,458 --> 01:57:39,708
This place is losing its charm,
don't you think?

1583
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:40,791
What?

1584
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,208
Let's go back to London.

1585
01:57:45,416 --> 01:57:46,416
All right.

1586
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:53,666
I'm Connie Reid. I don't think we met.

1587
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:55,666
Have a lovely evening.

1588
01:58:10,125 --> 01:58:12,083
How many times have you read that page?

1589
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:14,208
What?

1590
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:19,291
Well... it looks as though he's found you.

1591
01:58:19,791 --> 01:58:21,791
[dramatic music playing]

1592
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:31,791
- Oh my God.
- Yes.

1593
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:36,500
You'll want my car again, I imagine.

1594
01:58:41,416 --> 01:58:42,416
[sniffles]

1595
01:58:45,166 --> 01:58:48,291
[Oliver] <i>You'll be impressed to learn
that word of your departure from Wragby</i>

1596
01:58:48,375 --> 01:58:50,958
<i>has made it all the way
to my little village in Scotland.</i>

1597
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:56,166
<i>A man came to work in the local mines,
brought the tale with him,</i>

1598
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:59,833
<i>telling everyone in the pub
about a lady who fell for a hired man</i>

1599
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:03,541
<i>and didn't care if the world knew it
because... she loved him.</i>

1600
01:59:05,625 --> 01:59:07,291
<i>Names weren't used, of course.</i>

1601
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:13,166
<i>I was simply "the gamekeeper."</i>

1602
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,583
<i>You were the "Lady in love."</i>

1603
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:21,083
Excuse me, I'm looking for Oliver Mellors.

1604
01:59:21,166 --> 01:59:22,708
Do you... Do you know him?

1605
01:59:22,791 --> 01:59:23,916
[man] Oh yes, I do.

1606
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,083
He's down that road.

1607
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:28,625
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1608
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:33,625
[Oliver] <i>It was a good story,
and I found myself wondering</i>

1609
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:35,750
<i>if there might be more to the tale.</i>

1610
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,083
<i>A feller I knew from the army
got me work at a farm here.</i>

1611
01:59:40,958 --> 01:59:42,125
<i>Thirty shillings a week</i>

1612
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:44,500
<i>and decent lodgings
in a cottage up the road.</i>

1613
01:59:47,166 --> 01:59:48,583
<i>I thought I needed a purpose</i>

1614
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:51,000
<i>before bringing you
and a child into my life.</i>

1615
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:52,958
[panting]

1616
01:59:53,041 --> 01:59:56,541
[Oliver] <i>I can't say I've found
any greater meaning here on the farm,</i>

1617
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,083
<i>but I've made a home.</i>

1618
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,833
<i>I can't imagine
what you've already been through</i>

1619
02:00:06,916 --> 02:00:08,791
<i>and how much you've already given up.</i>

1620
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:12,500
<i>You'd be giving up even more
to come live here with me,</i>

1621
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:14,541
<i>but...</i>

1622
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:15,958
Oliver!

1623
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:22,500
[Oliver] <i>...what we have... together</i>

1624
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:26,125
<i>is different than anything
I've ever known.</i>

1625
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:36,250
<i>There's a little flame between us.
It's always burning.</i>

1626
02:00:38,166 --> 02:00:41,416
<i>And I've come to believe
that tending a fire like that is...</i>

1627
02:00:42,083 --> 02:00:43,708
<i>purpose enough for any life.</i>

1628
02:00:43,791 --> 02:00:45,291
[exhales]

1629
02:00:59,916 --> 02:01:00,916
