Just tell me.

15
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,691
Why didn't you tell me
sophomore year?

16
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,592
I don't know. I was scared.

17
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:59,628
Thought you weren't
gonna talk to me again.

Aww.

Yeah, well, I guess you're
not the only one with a secret.

00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,008
I've kind of
been into you, too.

I don't know. [laughs]

Um, excuse me. Do you mind?

[chuckles] We don't have
any drinks for you guys,

33
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,118
so can you, like,
leave us alone?

Let's get out of here.

Well, ladies and gents,
it's been a pleasure,

43
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,746
but we're gonna skirt.

Is that all you guys want?

51
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,874
You want us to let you in?

52
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,776
'Cause I don't know
what the hell that means,

53

You could have waited for me.

[chuckles] I know.

112
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,360
Hopefully we
figure it out by then.

113
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:32,928
It's in the bag, young lady.

114
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:34,130
It's in the bag.

115
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,285
Uh, sorry, babe.

There's, like,
a million other seats here,

right next to me.

We already receive
the Daily News, but thank you.

539
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,136
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

540
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,005
Um, I'm sorry. I'm not
selling subscriptions, ma'am.

541
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,008
I'm a journalist with the Times.

542
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,644
I'm writing a story
about the kidnappings.

543
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:11,788
To date, there have been...

544
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:13,790
three missing persons,

545
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:16,693
all in the course
of just one week,

546
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,127
all of whom are teenagers.

547
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:24,132
And there's been no trace
of any evidence.

548
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,769
Except for
a single eyewitness

549
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:31,139
who saw a group of kids
wearing black hoodies.

550
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:33,108
It was brought to my attention

551
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:36,612
that you were the victim
of an attempted robbery

552
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:40,282
involving a group of young kids
wearing black hoodies.

553
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:43,118
Yet you managed to escape.

554
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,086
Is that true?

555
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:49,057
I think we ought
to wrap this up now, Mr. Lutz.

556
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:52,127
Emily has to study
for an exam tomorrow, and she...

557
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,362
[Emily] Yes, it is true.

558
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:58,500
They kept asking me
to let them in.

559
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,505
Sorry. Uh, do you mind
if I record this?

560
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:08,443
[recorder clicks]

561
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,681
All of them were teenagers?

562
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:13,382
Yeah. I...

563
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,618
Well, not all
the same age and gender,

564
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:20,589
but they had black eyes,

565
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:23,492
like the entire eye was black.

566
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:26,628
And they had
extremely pale skin.

567
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,232
They smelled really bad,

568
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:34,136
like a mixture
of really old cheese and butt.

569
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,471
That's, uh, vividly descriptive.

570
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,808
Yeah, I'm just trying
to paint a picture for you.

571
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:41,711
It's very helpful.

572
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:44,546
You said that they asked you
to let them in?

573
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,582
Did they mean into your home?

574
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,685
Yeah, I guess.

575
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:53,155
I don't know.

576
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:55,157
The thing is,
this is a really small town,

577
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,560
and I've never seen
kids like this before ever.

578
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,872
Besties pact.
We do everything together,

579
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,273
no matter what.

580
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,742
[Emily] No matter what.

581
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,543
Okay, here we go.

582
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:16,813
But you go first.
I'm still nervous.

583
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,681
It'll be fine. Trust me.

584
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:20,182
You ready?

585
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:21,550
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

586
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,619
[deep breath] One...

587
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,389
two...

588
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,560
three!

589
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:42,671
- [thud]
- [gasps]

590
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,841
[panting]

591
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,721
[machinery whirring]

592
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,622
All I did was tweak
the frequency a fraction,

593
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,760
and then, boom,
it was real quick,

594
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:05,728
literally like three seconds,

595
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,397
and then all the power
just shut down.

596
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,799
[Emily] No offense, Christopher,

597
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,633
but I don't think
a tiny movement of needles

598
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,235
is proof of communication.

599
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:15,671
Trust me, it was
nothing we've heard before.

600
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,541
[transmission crackling]

601
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:21,778
This shihizzle's for real.

602
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:28,583
[frequencies warbling]

603
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,660
[transmission chattering]

604
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:49,906
[distorted] Jungspars.

605
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,842
[transmission crackles]

606
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,309
[transmission fades]

607
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:55,477
What?!

608
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:58,881
[blows lips]
Christopher, my dear friend,

609
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:01,684
I think that we need
to finally come to terms

610
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:03,485
that this is probably
never gonna happen.

611
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,021
What are you saying?

612
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:07,757
I'm saying that we've put in
a great effort here,

613
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,026
but I think we should try
something more realistic.

614
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,360
So you're just going to quit?

615
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:14,329
No, I'm not saying quit.

616
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:16,866
I'm just saying we should
figure out something else.

617
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,036
Emily, persistence is
science's middle name.

618
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,971
You know how many times
it took Edison

619
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:23,973
to finally invent
the light bulb?

620
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:26,374
- Thousands.
- Yes! How'd you know?

621
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,810
'Cause I know everything.

622
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:30,278
If you did, you'd realize
that we are so close

623
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:32,414
to communicating
with whatever is out there.

624
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,950
Well, what if there's
nothing out there?

625
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,551
You and I both know that
there's something out there,

626
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:38,620
and we are destined
to communicate with them.

627
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:40,422
I stan your passion,
Christopher,

628
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,959
but I think
I'm gonna cut my losses.

629
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:46,328
Emily, come on.
You can't do this.

630
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,597
[transmission crackles]

631
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,432
[distorted] Jungspars.

632
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,868
[crackles]

633
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,635
Jungspars.

634
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:54,904
[crackles]

635
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,742
Jungspars.

636
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,718
- [transmission warbles]
- [chatter]

637
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,919
Go ahead.

638
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,360
[speaker squeals]

639
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,494
Hello.

640
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:22,064
Uh, it's me, Emily Sparks,

641
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:24,432
coming to you from Earth.

642
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,002
Uh, you probably
don't understand

643
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,004
a word I'm saying
right now, but, uh,

644
00:35:28,037 --> 00:35:29,604
me and my friend Christopher

645
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:31,573
created this
communication device

646
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,076
to try to talk to aliens,
and I guess it works.

647
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,778
- [speaker squeals]
- Give 'em the Cliffnotes,

648
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:36,779
not the novel.

649
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:38,748
Okay. Oh, you're right.

650
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:40,348
Keep it tight. Okay.

651
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:42,617
So, uh, tell us
a little bit about you.

652
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,988
- [warbles]
- [distorted] Emily.

653
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:48,090
Did it just say my name?!

654
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,624
- It just said your name!
- Oh, my God!

655
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:50,993
- It just said my name!
- It said your name!

656
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,461
Said my name. Oh, my God.

657
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:54,462
[gasps]

658
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,598
[distorted] Christopher.

659
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:58,100
What?!

660
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:00,136
- They just said your name?
- They just said my name!

661
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:03,039
- They said your name!
- Oh, my God!

662
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,340
[distorted] Jungspars.

663
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:10,445
Jungspar.

664
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:14,150
Jungspar? Who's Jungspar?

665
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,852
[crackling]

666
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:19,588
[electricity surges]

667
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:22,457
[Chris sighs]
And you wanted to quit.

668
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:45,681
[knock at the door]

669
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,390
Can I help you?

670
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,894
[echoing] Will you let us in?

671
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,962
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
We're actually closed.

672
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:03,431
We open up again
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

673
00:37:03,465 --> 00:37:05,735
Our friend is quite dehydrated.

674
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:09,537
We're just looking
for something cold to drink.

675
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:11,640
Uh, sorry. I already
closed the register,

676
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,541
so I can't really
sell you anything.

677
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:15,778
Um, there's a Smart and Zip
around the corner.

678
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,179
They're open 24 hours.

679
00:37:22,018 --> 00:37:23,986
Okay. Have a nice night.

680
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,623
Creepy much?

681
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,734
[gasps]

682
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:56,584
Will you let us in?

683
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:22,111
[pounding on the door]

684
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:24,479
[slow pounding continues]

685
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:32,487
- [blow thumps]
- [metal clatters]

686
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:35,958
- [objects clatter]
- [yelps]

687
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:38,127
[panting]

688
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,936
Come on. Come on. Come on.

689
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,771
Come on.

690
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,239
Come on!

691
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:53,242
[knock at the door]

692
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,044
[Tobey] Jessie, it's me.
Open up.

693
00:38:55,077 --> 00:38:56,578
- Tobey?
- Open up, babe.

694
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:57,880
Everything's okay.

695
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:01,951
[yelps]

696
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:04,086
Will you let us in?

697
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,602
Will you let us in?

698
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:23,072
Screw you.

699
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:27,309
Ouch.

700
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:29,712
- [bone cracks]
- [screams]

701
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,748
[groaning]

702
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:34,683
Okay, I'll let you in!

703
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:36,551
I'll let you in.

704
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,725
I mean,
just the fact that you guys

705
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,293
worked so hard
putting this together

706
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:46,762
and got something or somebody
to communicate back

707
00:39:46,796 --> 00:39:48,330
is absolutely incredible.

708
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,866
I am so proud of both of you.

709
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,667
Emily, honey,
are you staying for dinner?

710
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:53,969
Sure. I guess.

711
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:59,875
Sweetie, we have to wash those
before you eat them. Remember?

712
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,044
You had that horrible bout
of diarrhea last time.

713
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,813
Jesus, Mom. Have a little couth.

714
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:05,948
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.
Well, will you please

715
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:07,249
tell your sister
to come downstairs?

716
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,151
And if you
have to use the bathroom,

717
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:10,652
please use wet wipes.

718
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:13,989
Hysterical, Mom,
but Jessie's not home.

719
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,091
Where is she?

720
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,725
I don't know.

721
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,361
Her shift ended an hour ago.
Is her car here?

722
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,233
I told her no Tobey's
until the weekend.

723
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:28,237
Oh, you are
in serious trouble, Missy,

724
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,706
sending me
straight to voicemail.

725
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,143
Christopher, please
set up the table, sweetie.

726
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:36,312
- I got it.
- Thank you.

727
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,785
[Emily] Wait.
So has she not responded?

728
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,054
No, and she usually does
right away.

729
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:46,822
I'll solve this
once and for all.

730
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:54,763
She's still at work.

731
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:57,433
What?

732
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,034
How could she still be there?

733
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,048
[sighs] It's locked.

734
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:16,752
[pounding]

735
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:18,787
Jessie! Jessie, you in there?!

736
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,689
Let me go check the back door.

737
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:33,969
[Christopher] Jessie?

738
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:37,740
Mom. Mom.

739
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:40,075
- Huh?
- Give me a minute.

740
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,244
- What?
- I think I just sharted.

741
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:44,446
Honey, I told you
not to eat those grapes.

742
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,949
I know, Mom. I was just hungry.

743
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,751
I'm a growing boy, you know.

744
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,888
[clatter]

745
00:41:52,922 --> 00:41:55,024
[metal creaks]

746
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,160
[Emily breathing heavily]

747
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:10,372
- [metal objects clatter]
- [gasps]

748
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:13,976
[metal objects clatter]

749
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:26,989
[door slams open]

750
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,390
- [footsteps shuffling]
- [guns cocking]

751
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:29,391
[man] Freeze!

752
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:31,093
[police dispatch chatter]

753
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:39,368
[Michelle] Um, I-I think
it was around 5:00.

754
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:41,303
- It was a text from her.
- [sirens approaching]

755
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:43,172
My God, I can't believe
this is happening.

756
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:45,507
You need to find her.
You need to find her now.

757
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,377
There are so many kids missing.
Something bad is happening.

758
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,247
[police dispatch chatter]

759
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,881
I'm scared, Em.

760
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,386
I'm really scared.

761
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,830
[chatter fades]

762
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,266
[doorbell rings]

763
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:12,401
[rain pattering]

764
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:15,204
Hello there, Emily.

765
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:16,405
Hi, Mr. Lutz.

766
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:18,841
This is my friend Christopher.

767
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:20,075
Nice to meet you, Christopher.

768
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:22,778
Uh, please come in.

769
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,552
Including your sister,
Christopher,

770
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:34,857
there's been seven missing
persons reports this week alone.

771
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,526
So do you know who these kids
are or where they're from?

772
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,061
No. No one does.

773
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:40,896
That's what makes it
so frustrating.

774
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:44,500
Some say it's a bunch
of meth kids from Canopy Falls.

775
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:47,836
Others think
it's a type of zombie.

776
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,506
But in all the research
I've done,

777
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:53,075
there's only been
one other account

778
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:55,377
of these black-eyed kids.

779
00:43:56,912 --> 00:44:00,249
It happened in this town
over 50 years ago.

780
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:03,052
Over 25 missing persons,

781
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:05,554
and there was
only one eyewitness.

782
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:11,226
And his name is Frederick Munch.

783
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:17,066
He and his fiancée were taken
five days before their wedding.

784
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,335
Apparently they let him go.

785
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:20,936
Why?

786
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:23,205
[chuckles]
You'd have to ask him.

787
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:25,140
Is he still alive?

788
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:26,141
He is.

789
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:28,444
He lives over on Elm.

790
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:32,614
Wait, Munch.
You mean Mean Mr. Munch?

791
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,283
You know him?

792
00:44:34,316 --> 00:44:35,351
Yeah.

793
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:36,919
All the kids know him.

794
00:44:36,952 --> 00:44:38,620
His house is totally haunted.

795
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:40,656
Yeah, the kids created
the Munch challenge.

796
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,958
It's where you gotta walk up
to his creepy doorsteps

797
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:45,594
and ring his creepy doorbell
and try to make it out alive,

798
00:44:45,627 --> 00:44:47,896
and one kid tried it, and...

799
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,531
He made it...

800
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:52,401
but then broke into a seizure
the minute he got home.

801
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:57,106
Well, I've been trying to talk
to him for the last six months.

802
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:01,009
Threatened to kill me
if I stepped on his property.

803
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,011
I'll talk to him.

804
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,079
You're kidding.

805
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:05,180
No, and you're coming.

806
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:07,082
That's not a good idea, Emily.

807
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,618
You have a better one?

808
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:13,021
[thunder rumbling]

809
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:15,357
[bird squawking]

810
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,694
[dog barking]

811
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,428
- Emily...
- Yeah?

812
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,596
I'm quaking.

813
00:45:20,629 --> 00:45:22,264
Yeah, me, too.

814
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:25,033
- [dog barking]
- What if he cuts our heads off

815
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:27,069
and uses our bodies
as flotation devices?

816
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,338
I don't think that's possible.
Bodies don't float.

817
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:30,939
[Christopher]
We can literally run now,

818
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:33,275
and the least we'll suffer
is a seizure.

819
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:38,046
[doorbell buzzes]

820
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:42,384
[bird squawking]

821
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,520
[ominous music playing]

822
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:47,589
[sighs]

823
00:45:48,657 --> 00:45:50,959
Okay, obviously
he's not home, so...

824
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,227
[Munch] Leave it by the door.

825
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:54,163
Uh, hi, Mr. Munch. I'm Emily,

826
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:55,497
and this is
my friend Christopher.

827
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,065
We live down the street.

828
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:58,033
Uh-huh.

829
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,568
[intercom clicks off]

830
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:02,504
Uh, Mr. Munch?

831
00:46:02,538 --> 00:46:04,373
Mr. Munch!

832
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:05,340
[bird squawking]

833
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:08,644
Oh, well. We tried.

834
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:11,647
[doorbell buzzes]

835
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:15,718
Emily, come on. He obviously
doesn't want us here.

836
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:17,119
We're finding your sister.

837
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,287
[sighs]

838
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,422
Get off my property.

839
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:22,357
Mr. Munch, please help us.

840
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,326
Christopher's sister has been
taken by the black-eyed kids.

841
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,462
- [groans]
- Please just let us...

842
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,531
We should go.

843
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,677
[hinges creak]

844
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:47,015
Holy crap.

845
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,322
[hinges creaking]

846
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,032
Creepy A.F.

847
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:25,654
[clock chimes]

848
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:27,155
Jesus Christ.

849
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,291
[exhales]

850
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:35,564
[mournful piano music playing]

851
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:44,406
[Christopher] Could this house
be any creepier?

852
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:45,641
[Emily] Shh.

853
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:51,380
[Christopher] I didn't
know someone so creepy

854
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,615
could be so talented.

855
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:55,217
Christopher, shut up.

856
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:12,100
I think I just urinated myself.

857
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:13,468
Emily...

858
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:16,338
[Emily] Come on. Get a grip.

859
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:18,073
[piano music continues]

860
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:45,634
[piano music stops]

861
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,410
I haven't had one lesson.

862
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:58,815
[clock ticking]

863
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:04,787
I appreciate you letting us in.

864
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,689
That supposed to be a joke?

865
00:49:06,723 --> 00:49:08,590
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean it that way.

866
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:10,860
We're just trying to get
all the information we can get.

867
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:12,829
The black-eyed kids.

868
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:16,164
Yes, exactly.

869
00:49:16,198 --> 00:49:18,266
I haven't talked about this

870
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,869
in more than 50 years.

871
00:49:21,536 --> 00:49:23,405
I was too scared to.

872
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:31,546
But with all
the kidnappings going on,

873
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,649
I feel I need to.

874
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:35,150
Thank you.

875
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:41,758
I saw 'em first
in the winter of '59.

876
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:46,829
They took me and my fiancée...

877
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:49,866
all of 'em...

878
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,502
with their alabaster skin...

879
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,372
and that jet-black hair...

880
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,676
black eyes.

881
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,480
Black as briquettes.

882
00:50:09,686 --> 00:50:12,254
They had this awful odor.

883
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:15,524
Awful.

884
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:20,629
Smelled like...

885
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:24,934
rotten molasses and, uh...

886
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:26,468
pig droppings.

887
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,338
I can still smell it today.

888
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,978
They ended up taking
my sweet Juniper.

889
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:38,580
My fiancée.

890
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:44,386
And they let me go.

891
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:50,525
There's not a day that I
don't wish it was the opposite.

892
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,427
So where did they take her?

893
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:55,297
Some sort of portal.

894
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,265
A portal?

895
00:50:57,299 --> 00:50:58,533
To where?

896
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:01,570
Space.

897
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:02,872
Space?

898
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,274
Space.

899
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:08,276
Outer space.

900
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,313
Like outer outer space?

901
00:51:11,346 --> 00:51:13,482
Like rocket ship outer space?

902
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,785
This kid on the spectrum?

903
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,652
[laughs] Yeah, of course.

904
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,857
Outer space.

905
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,559
So are these
black-eyed kids aliens?

906
00:51:24,593 --> 00:51:26,328
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

907
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,533
They don't refer to themselves
as black-eyed kids.

908
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:37,006
They call themselves Jungspars.

909
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:41,276
Jungspars?

910
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:49,786
Every 20 years,
they come to Earth...

911
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,923
to abduct
adolescent girls and boys.

912
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:57,093
It's their harvesting time...

913
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,461
a way for them
to propagate the human race

914
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,931
on their planet for slavery.

915
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,909
I was there. I've seen it.

916
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:17,379
And believe me,
you don't want to see

917
00:52:17,412 --> 00:52:19,849
the things that I've seen.

918
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:27,857
You've seen them, too,
haven't you?

919
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,393
So why do they ask you
that question,

920
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:32,862
to let them in?

921
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,463
Because they have to.

922
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:38,500
They need permission.

923
00:52:40,803 --> 00:52:43,405
They don't like
being said no to.

924
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:47,342
So they will terrorize you...

925
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:49,611
until you say yes.

926
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:52,949
But whatever you do,
never say yes.

927
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:58,154
Trust me when I tell you
the pain that you will suffer.

928
00:52:58,187 --> 00:53:00,790
Saying no will be nothing

929
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:05,560
compared to the pain that
you'll suffer if you say yes.

930
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:08,463
So how long
do they stay here for?

931
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:11,000
After researching,

932
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:15,604
I discovered that the duration
of each stay

933
00:53:15,637 --> 00:53:18,540
was ten nights
from the first abduction,

934
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,609
not a minute later.

935
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,644
Holy crap.

936
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:24,412
I'm sorry, Mr. Munch,
but I have to go.

937
00:53:24,446 --> 00:53:26,448
Hold on just one second,
young lady.

938
00:53:31,821 --> 00:53:33,022
Take that.

939
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:37,760
In case you need
to summon them...

940
00:53:38,895 --> 00:53:40,863
or cause severe pain.

941
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:43,900
Thanks.

942
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:47,803
I gotta skirt, too,

943
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:50,072
but nice meeting you.

944
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:55,044
I get it.

945
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,079
I'm a germophobe, too.

946

947
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:04,452
All good.

948
00:54:10,558 --> 00:54:12,995
[Emily] Hurry up.
We only have 'til midnight.

949
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:16,498
I'm doing it as fast as I can!
Jesus!

Hello.

It's us, Emily and Christopher.

971
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,879
Uh, last time
we talked on here,

972
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:46,682
you mentioned
the word "Jungspars."

973
00:56:46,715 --> 00:56:49,185
Could... could you please
tells us more about that?

974
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:54,990
- [static crackles]
- Hello?

975
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:56,158

Okay. Uh, it's us,
Yeah, Emily and Christopher.

Okay, Kluuk.

Nice to officially meet you.

989
00:57:31,093 --> 00:57:35,164
So, uh, can you tell us
more about Jungspars?

I told you no one would show up.

1012
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:06,989
Give it a minute.

1013
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:08,857
Not to mention
you made it so convenient

1014
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:11,827
for them to chop our parts
into a hundred pieces

1015
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,829
and bury us in the forest.

1016
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:15,898
Christopher, they don't murder.
They abduct.

1017

Oh, well, that makes me
feel so much better.

00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:25,007
Think we need to reassess.

1021
00:59:25,908 --> 00:59:27,009

What?

1027
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:39,088
Uh, I-I didn't say anything.

Hey.

Appreciate you showing up.

1031
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:03,846
Of course.

1032
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:07,016

you seem to have a knack

01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:52,448
for getting caught in the eye
of the storm, young lady.

1071
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,383
They took Christopher!
I need to find him!

In the meantime,
I want you to stay put

1074

and focus on being here,
where you're safe.

1075

You guys don't understand.
They're not human!

1076

You don't know how they think!

1077
01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:09,699
Emily, let me
make myself clear.

1078
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:13,068
If you leave this house,
I'm gonna have you arrested.

Are you comprehending me?

1080
01:03:14,403 --> 01:03:16,004
You gotta be kidding me.

1081
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:17,339
Serious as a tornado.

1082
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:19,174
You guys don't understand

1083
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,777
that the people who are
still missing are still alive,

1084
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,111
are we're running out of time!

1085
01:03:23,145 --> 01:03:24,513
[sighs]

1086
01:03:24,546 --> 01:03:26,381
Get some sleep.

1087
01:03:29,618 --> 01:03:31,453
We'll be right back, honey.

1088
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:44,466
[police dispatch chatter]

1089
01:03:48,136 --> 01:03:50,773
[crying]

1090
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:53,175
And this is
the exact same location

1091
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,178
where both Carly Hudson and
Luke Freitag were taken from.

1092
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,579
Authorities still have no clue

1093
01:03:57,613 --> 01:03:59,548
as to who's involved
in these snatchings,

1094
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:02,685
but eyewitnesses
believe they're not human.

1095
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,153
They're not human.
I don't know what they are.

1096
01:04:05,187 --> 01:04:07,623
- [girl] Where's Scarlett?
- [Emily] Christopher!

1097
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:09,324
Christopher!

1098
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:12,695
Christopher!

1099
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:14,229
Where's Christopher?!

1100
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:25,107
[insects chirping]

[police dispatch chatter]

1103
01:04:45,193 --> 01:04:46,528
Oh, damn it.

1104
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:48,630
Oh, what am I...

1105
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,838
[police dispatch chatter]

1106
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:57,606
[knock at the door]

1107
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:01,410
Come in.

1108
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,145
They've got you
in isolation, huh?

1109
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:05,213
Ah, Nana, please,
you gotta get me out of here.

1110
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:06,281
They've taken Christopher.

1111
01:05:06,315 --> 01:05:09,518
Ohh. Sweetheart...

1112
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:11,620
the police will take care of it.

1113
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:14,891
No, they don't even
know where he is! But I do.

1114
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:17,626
Well, you tell them then.

1115
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:19,796
No, they think I'm crazy, Nana.

1116
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:22,531
They don't believe me
when I try to tell them!

1117
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,868
Look, you know
my friend Cindy's dad's

1118
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:27,369
a policeman, right?

1119
01:05:27,402 --> 01:05:29,671
So all I want to do
is just tell him,

1120
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:31,440
and he'll take care
of everything.

1121
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:34,142
So please just let me
get out of here

1122
01:05:34,176 --> 01:05:35,277
so I can do that.

1123
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,445
Sweetheart.

1124
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:38,280
Please, Nana.

1125
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,818
I don't want to lose
another best friend.

1126
01:05:44,553 --> 01:05:45,654
[sighs]

1127
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:47,322
[Carol] I think we need to take

1128
01:05:47,356 --> 01:05:50,359
a lot more responsibility
for what's going on here.

1129
01:05:50,392 --> 01:05:53,462
I mean, when do you actually
spend quality time with her,

1130
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:56,198
- just the two of you?
- Oh, okay. Okay,

1131
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:58,433
so all this going on
right now is 'cause of me?

1132
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:00,669
- Is that right?
- Well, possibly.

1133
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:02,905
- [thump]
- [Nana moans]

1134
01:06:04,206 --> 01:06:05,607
[Mark] Mom!

1135
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:07,175
I've fallen...

1136
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:08,543
and I can't get up.

1137
01:06:08,577 --> 01:06:09,879
- God. Okay, what happened?
- Oh, my God.

1138
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:11,446
Can I help you up? Come on.

1139
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,281
- I don't know.
- Here we go. Here we go.

1140
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:15,384
- [grunting]
- Okay. Okay?

1141
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:18,353
[Nana] Yeah. I don't know.

1142
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:20,489
[music playing]

1143
01:06:49,618 --> 01:06:51,219
Shoot.

[car approaching]

1146
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:13,275
Need a hand?

1147
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:19,882
Maybe this isn't the safest
place to be right now, you know?

1148
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,818
We're really close.

1149
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:27,924
It says
he's literally right here.

1150
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:33,228
May I?

1151
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,263
Sure.

1152
01:07:46,308 --> 01:07:47,810
You're right. He's right here,

1153
01:07:47,844 --> 01:07:50,512
or at least
his phone's right here.

1154
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:02,992
We need to hurry up.

1155
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:04,593
It's almost midnight!

1156
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:06,062
- [brush rustles]
- [whispering] This way.

1157
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:07,395
Come on.

1158
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:10,432
[brush rustling]

1159
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,093
What is this?

1160
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:40,428
I think we found their Airbnb.

1161
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,803
[distant humming]

1162
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:57,612
I'm starting to think
this wasn't such a good idea.

1165
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:16,866
What do we do now?

1166
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:21,804
Seriously?

1167
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:23,438
You got a better idea?

1168
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:26,709

Hey there, buddy.

1173
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,695
Just gonna take
some of our friends back home.

1174
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:46,929
You cool with that?

1176
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,151
Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?

1177
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:10,552
Thank goodness you're here.

1178
01:10:10,585 --> 01:10:12,722
Oh, my God. Yeah.
How did you...

1179
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:14,589
We're trying to get
you guys out of here.

1180
01:10:14,623 --> 01:10:15,992
- [boy] Please help.
- Oh, my God.

1181
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,727
[girl] Get us out.

[pad beeping]

1183
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:24,432
Move.

1184
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,602
You really think
that's gonna work?

1185
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:33,109

01:10:33,142 --> 01:10:34,844

Oh, my God.

1188
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:38,114
[Mr. Jayo] Oh. Wow.

1189

- [chains rattle]
- Emily.

1190
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,217
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

1191
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,718
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1192
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:44,687
Um, you need
to go get Christopher.

1193
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,088
They took him
and some other kids.

1194
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:47,555
They're gonna send 'em
away somewhere.

1195
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:49,025
- Where are they?
- Down the corridor.

1196
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:50,625
Okay. Take care of these guys.

1197
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,162
Emily, wait!

1198
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:00,770
Proceed forward.

1199
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:02,537
No.

1200
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,073
No. No.

1201
01:11:04,974 --> 01:11:06,943
No. No. No.

[screams]

1203
01:11:10,947 --> 01:11:12,580
- Proceed forward.
- Here's the thing.

1204
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:14,216
I'm not really ready for this,

1205
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,953
so if you could just me go?
Please just let me go? No.

1206
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:18,486
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1207
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,156
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Let him go!

1208
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:27,029
I know it's hard to see
with those black eyes of yours,

1209
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:29,198
but my finger is literally
on the light switch.

1210
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:31,934
You think you'll get out alive?

1211
01:11:31,968 --> 01:11:33,235
Let him go.

1212
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:43,946
- [grunts]
- [chain clinks]

1213
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,053
We're gonna get out of here.

1214
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,604
[wailing]

1215
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:16,278
[girl] Emily.

1216
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:22,084
Rachel?

1217
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:23,853
It wasn't your fault.

1218
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:26,088
Emily, you didn't
do anything wrong.

1219
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:29,091
I slipped off the roof.
It was an accident.

1220
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,960
But I'm okay.

1221
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:32,128
I'm alive.

1222
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:38,334
Take my hand, Emily,

1223
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:41,737
so we can play together
just like we used to.

1224
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:51,113
[panting]

1225
01:12:53,816 --> 01:12:56,052

[gasping]

1227
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,697
So we meet again.

1228
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,933
Had a feeling we would.

1229
01:13:13,903 --> 01:13:18,107
I have the suspicion you know
what I am going to ask you.

1230
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:21,710
So will you?

1231
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:26,015
Will you let us in?

1232
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:35,958
I suggest you make this
simple for both of us.

1233
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:39,128
Will you let us in?

1234
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,074
Hell no.

1235
01:13:52,108 --> 01:13:53,776
[screams]

1236
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:57,012
- [girl] Run, Emily!
- [yells]

1237
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:58,914
Em, back of you!

[wailing]

1239
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,181
Get out!

[cheering]

1243
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:55,704
Thought I lost you.

1244
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:58,240
It's okay. I'm right here.

1245
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:01,844
I'm right here.

1246
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:09,752
[music playing]

1247
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,322
[Carol] Oh, did you
bring your retainers?

1248
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:15,024
[Emily] Yes, Mom.

1249
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:16,759
[Mark] Okay, I think we
double-checked everything

1250
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,194
at least four times.

1251
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:19,495
[Christopher]
May I take your bag, ma'am?

1252
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:20,930
- Thank you, sir.
- You're right. Sorry.

1253
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:22,097
How 'bout the slippers?

1254
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:23,966
- Got those?
- [Emily] Yep.

1255
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,401
[Christopher] I don't think
I slept a minute last night.

1256
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:26,835
- Me, too.
- Listen...

1257
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:28,137
about the crush thing...

1258
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,039
Drop it.

1259
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,441
But for the record,
if I was ten,

1260
01:15:32,474 --> 01:15:34,810
- I'd totally date you.
- Really?

1261
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:36,412
So there's hope.

1262
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:38,981
I mean, "if you were able
to go back in time" type hope.

1263
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:40,382
[chuckles] How dopey.

1264
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:43,485
Next project, time machine.

1265
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:45,287
[laughs]

1266
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:48,023
Em.

1267
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:50,426
I love you.
I'm so proud of you.

1268
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:54,463
Cape Canaveral,
that's pretty rad.

1269
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:56,365
Wow, Dad.
Didn't know you were so hip.

1270
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:59,101
Nah, your dad's still got
some teenager left in him.

1271
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:02,004
Oh, God, Dad. That's so creepy.

1272
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,207
[gasps] Jessie!

1273
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,375
[laughs]

1274
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:09,378
What's this?

1275
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:10,346
They're yours now.

1276
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:11,213
They're brand-new.

1277
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:13,082
Aww. Thank you so much.

1278
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:14,950
Have so much fun.

1279
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:16,285
And if he annoys,
you just flick his nose.

1280
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:17,953
Not funny.

1281
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,288
[laughs]

1282
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:20,889
All right, you two.

1283
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:23,025
NASA's waiting.

1284
01:16:23,058 --> 01:16:24,493
[Emily sighs]

1285
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:28,063
All right, here we go.

1286
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:50,252
[mouthing words]

1287
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,426
God, are they having, like,
a marathon today or something?

1288
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:00,029
[crowd cheering]

1289
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,532
[Christopher] Holy sweetness.

1290
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:04,833
This is for us!

1291
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:06,969
Oh, my God, this is insane!

1292
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,504
I'm so shook right now.

1293
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:11,407
There's Principal Malinsky.

1294
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,575
Guess this is what happens
when you're local heroes.

1295
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,210
[crowd cheering]

1296
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:16,578
[Christopher] Look!
There's Mrs. Barnett!

1297
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,148
And Dr. Bauer!

1298
01:17:21,216 --> 01:17:23,218
Did she just blow you a kiss?

1299
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:29,591
[cheering continues]

1300
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:32,561
[footsteps shuffling]

1301
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:40,602
[ominous music playing]
