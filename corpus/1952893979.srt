All right, Backson.

- [Pooh] Oh!

Oh, bother!

00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:40,286
- Pooh!
- Oh, hello.

688
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:43,628
Oh, Pooh, you went back for the honey,
didn't you?

689
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:45,956
But I told you it was empty.

690
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,623
Yes, and I believed you, Piglet.

691
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,424
But my tummy had to see for himself.

[whimpering] Oh, dear! Wait for me.

OK, Piglet, go look for something

714
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:16,972
[stammering] OK.

715
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:19,809
There might be
something over by the pack.

716
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:21,970
Thank goodness one of us is up there.

717
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,806
I was worried we'd be
stuck here forever.

718
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:26,519
I found something. Here.

719
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,723
- What?
- Ooh.

720
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:30,190
That's a lovely flower, Piglet.

721
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,236
Yeah, I thought so, too.

722
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:35,443
Yes, Piglet,
it's very nice, a perennial.

723
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,321
But I think we need something longer.

724
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:43,158
Longer? Of course. How silly of me.

726
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,166
Oh, good thought, Piglet.

727
00:38:50,257 --> 00:38:53,128
But you can't possibly think
that that's long enough.

728
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,469
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once,

729
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:59,889
and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.

730
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:01,007
[giggles] Oh.

731
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:04,471
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.

732
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,979
Of all things, why didn't we think
to bring a rope?

733
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:10,605
Well, there is this rope.

734
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:16,735
Spot-on, Piglet. Do be a helpful
little swine and get us out of here.

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,698
Yes, Piglet, all of us.

00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:25,162
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.

There! Now you can all get out!

741
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,590
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.

742
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:42,636
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.

743
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,553
Can you tie a knot?

744
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:45,724
I cannot.

745
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:47,272
So, you can knot.

746
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:49,265
No, I cannot knot.

747
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:51,517
- Not knot?
- Who's there?

748
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,725
- Pooh!
- Pooh who?

749
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,362
No! Pooh, it's...

750
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:57,116
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.

751
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,362
Not possible.

752
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,820
Ah! So, it is possible
to knot those pieces.

753
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:03,027
Not these pieces.

754
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:05,161
Yes, knot those pieces.

755
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,870
- Why not?
- Because it's all for naught.

756
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,709
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.

757
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,754
But there is something I can do.

758
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:18,627
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.

759
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,879
I can tie a bow.

760
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:22,716
- See?
- [groans]

761
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:25,845
For crying out loud! Piglet!

762
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:28,262
I know! Christopher Robin
has a jump rope.

763
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,636
Ahh!

764
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:33,101
Wait a minute. My gracious, that's it!

765
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:36,360
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.

766
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:37,727
Oh, I see.

767
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:40,741
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.

768
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:42,285
Yes, bring some honey...

769
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:45,074
[gasps] The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.

770
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,655
With a little honey on the side.

771
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,585
You mean, all by myself?

772
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:55,914
Through there?

773
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,550
Yes, Piglet.

774
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:01,595
Through a dark wood fraught with peril,

775
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,590
on a mission of life or death.

776
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:06,518
It is a task of great complexity,

777
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:10,896
but I have full confidence
that you shall return victorious,

778
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:13,852
and rescue us from the abyss.

779
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:16,897
Go forth, Piglet,
and we shall await your return.

780
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:19,478
For weeks, if necessary.

781
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:24,280

782
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,702
What?

783
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:33,369
I can't believe how wonderful
that speech was.

784
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:34,791
I can't, either.

785
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,956
Moved me to tears.

786
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,011
[narrator] So Piglet bravely ventured
forth towards Christopher Robin's house.

787
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:47,090
But the further he went,
the more frightened he became.

788
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:50,221
[whimpering] Oh, dear.

789
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,138
I mustn't fear.

00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,315

Oh, dear. I am the help.

796
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:22,214
How did you ever get stuck up there?

797
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:25,387
It wasn't the Backson, was it?

798
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,380
Oh, good.

799
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,599

Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.

And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.

The most wonderful thing about Tiggers,

is you're the only one.

Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.

The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!

858
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:42,285
I mean the letters... We can get out!

859
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:47,087
[narrator] And so they all used the
letter ladder to climb out of the pit.

860
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,295
But little did they know that
coming through the bushes was...

861
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:53,629
- [branches snapping]
- [all gasp] Backson!

862
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,181
Back to the pit!

863
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:57,554
[Christopher] Wait, everyone.

864
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,142
It's only me.

865
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:02,518
[all] Christopher Robin!

866
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:06,021
You found them, B'loon. Well done.

867
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,897
It's Christopher Robin!

868
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:11,146
How did you escape from the Backson?

869
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,157
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?

870
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:15,488
He wakes up babies!

871
00:46:15,578 --> 00:46:16,953
He swipes your stripes!

872
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:18,580
He puts out the lights!

873
00:46:18,664 --> 00:46:22,199
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.

874
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:25,911
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?

875
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:27,629
Your note.

876
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:33,675
[narrator] Christopher Robin explained
that it had all been a misunderstanding.

877
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:36,633
And now that it was autumn,
the school year had begun.

878
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:41,849
His note was simply to say he had
gone out and would be back soon.

879
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:45,430
[all] Oh!

880
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,312
Ooh. Um...

881
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:54,190
OK.

882
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:56,691
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.

883
00:46:56,786 --> 00:46:57,953
Just a moment, everyone.

884
00:46:57,953 --> 00:46:58,570
Just a moment, everyone.

885
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:00,454
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.

886
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,615
We owe a very special someone...

887
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:05,958
...a token of our appreciation.

888
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,243
Ohh!

889
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:11,336
This reward goes to a good friend
and a loyal companion.

890
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:13,797
Someone who not only helped us
out of this pit,

891
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:16,211
but also found Christopher Robin.

892
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:20,255
And he just so happens
to be wearing red today.

893
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,435
So it is with great, great honour
and a humble heart,

894
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:27,768
that I bestow this pot of honey
upon our dear friend...

895
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,103
...B'loon.

896
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,652
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.

897
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:33,227
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!

898
00:47:33,823 --> 00:47:37,274
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!

899
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:41,496
[narrator] Pooh watched as B'loon took
the honey pot higher and higher,

900
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,373
until it was completely out of sight.

901
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,212
Oh, bother.

902
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,586
Sorry, Pooh.

903
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,508
Ever have one of those days
where you just can't win, Eeyore?

904
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:06,220
Yep. I know how you feel.

905
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:12,691
- [rumbling]
- Oh, yes.

906
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:15,067
I simply must find some honey.

907
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:18,322
[narrator] As Pooh continued searching,
he got hungrier...

908
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:21,818
- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...

909
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,706
- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...

910
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,700
Ohh...

911
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:31,376
...until he found himself
at Owl's house.

912
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:46,926
[bell jingles]

913
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:51,858
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.

914
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,231
Hello, Owl.

915
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,404
Well, congratulate me.

916
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,159
- For what?
- I have achieved completion

917
00:49:00,242 --> 00:49:03,243
of my autobiographical treatise!

918
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,072
Oh! Was it painful?

919
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:08,331
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.

920
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:09,662
Oh.

921
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:13,959
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep
staring at that bell rope?

922
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:18,840
Because it reminds me of something.

923
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:21,679
And that reminds me
of another something.

924
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:23,756
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?

925
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:27,681
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?

926
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,430
A small lick, I should think.

927
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:32,523
My boy, I shall do better than that.

928
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,601
Not only will I beckon you to my table,

929
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:38,608
but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt

930
00:49:38,697 --> 00:49:41,070
from chapter 127,

931
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:45,536
which tells the gripping tale of how
only a few days ago,

932
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:48,788
I found that very handsome bell rope
that you were admiring

933
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:52,243
just hanging over a thistle bush.

934
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,664
Thistle bush?

935
00:49:53,754 --> 00:49:55,546
Or was it a gorse bush?

936
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,834
No. No. It was definitely
a thistle bush.

937
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:00,171
Pardon me, Owl.

938
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:02,930
At first I thought someone lived there,
so I rang it.

939
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:04,258
No one answered.

940
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,219
And then the thing just fell off
in my hand.

941
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:11,307
What sort of place
was this particular thistle bush in?

942
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:13,686
Certainly not a very cheery place.

943
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,933
One might say it was rather...

944
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:17,485
Gloomy?

945
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:20,143
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?

946
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,519
Oh, dear.

947
00:50:21,615 --> 00:50:24,237
Nobody seemed to want it,
so I brought it home.

948
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:27,031
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.

949
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:28,532
Really? Who?

950
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:31,659
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.

951
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,743
He was fond of it, you see.

952
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:36,505
- Fond of it?
- Attached to it.

953
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:38,213
Attached?

954
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:40,172
Ohh!

955
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:42,252
Yes. Well, yes.

956
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:46,259
And I was just keeping it safe for him.

957
00:50:46,348 --> 00:50:49,552
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.

958
00:50:49,643 --> 00:50:52,728
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.

959
00:50:52,813 --> 00:50:55,814
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?

[narrator] Ignoring his tummy's
desperate pleas,

963
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:12,120
Pooh went directly
to Christopher Robin's.

964
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,239
Tail.

965
00:51:14,085 --> 00:51:15,911
Nail.

966
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:17,201
Hammer.

967
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:23,251
So what do you think, Eeyore?

968
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:25,502
I'll test it out.

969
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:29,464
Seems about the right length.

970
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:32,180
Pink bow's a nice touch.

971
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:36,638
Swishes real good, too.

972
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:38,939
So, are you happy, Eeyore?

973
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:41,185
- No.
- Ooh.

974
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:44,694
But I sure do like this new tail.

975
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:48,201
Thank you, Pooh.

976
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,996
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.

977
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:54,654

978
