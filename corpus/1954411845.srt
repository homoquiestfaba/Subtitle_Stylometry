HOW AM I
BEING UNPLEASANT?

7
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,406
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
BEING UNPLEASANT,

8
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,408
BUT YOU ARE MAKING THIS
AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION

9
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,711
INSTEAD OF MAKING IT
AN EROTIC ONE LIKE I AM.

10
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,779
YEAH, REALLY EROTIC,
COLIN.

11

I MEAN, AGAIN,
YOU DON'T SEEM TO GRASP

12
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,384
THAT WE COULD BE
TALKING ABOUT 48,

HATED J.R.

WE DO.
BUT, YOU KNOW,

19
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,606
SHE ASKED FOR A FAVOR,
AND I SAID YES.

20
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,942
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SIBLINGS,
SO YOU HAVE
NO FRAME OF REFERENCE

33

CHANGE YOUR PANTS.

WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

I HEARD YOU WERE LIVING
WITH YOUR PROFESSOR,

50
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,777
AND DATING HIM,
AND THEN HE THREW YOU OUT.

51

WHAT IS A VISION BOARD?
WHAT IS THIS GIANT PIECE OF SHIT
COVERED IN PICTURES OF YOU?

73

AND DREAMS OUT ON PAPER, THEY'RE
MORE LIKELY TO COME TRUE.

I THINK WE SHOULD STICK--

80
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,963

101
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,883

HOW COME YOU AIN'T GOT
NO WEDDING RINGS?

109
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,642
THIS ACTUALLY IS
A WEDDING RING.
AND I SOLD MINE TO BUY--

HE SOLD HIS
TO BUY DRUGS FOR KIDS.
MEDICINE FOR SICK CHILDREN.

111
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,182
IN CHERNOBYL.
THERE'S A LOT OF SICK KIDS--
IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY.

112
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,752
WE'VE GIVEN THEM SO MUCH,
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH UNGRATEFUL
AT THIS POINT.

AN AWFUL LOT ALIKE.
YOU SURE YOU'RE MARRIED?

AND LIVE WITH THIS PERSON

115
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,761
THE REST OF THEIR
GOD-GIVEN LIFE?

116
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,265
I REMEMBER WHEN MY WIFE AND I--
WE GOT MARRIED.

117
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,335
UH-HUH.
I WAS 15, SHE WAS 14.

118

HOW ROMANTIC.
HAD OUR FIRST CHILD-- 17.

119
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,841
16.

120
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:14,946
AND 16 IS A, UH, GOOD AGE

121
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,115
FOR A GIRL TO HAVE A BABY.

122
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,117
THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.

123
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,821
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT MY LIFE STORY.

124
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,823
NO, WE DON'T.
SHH.

125
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,359
YES, WE WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR YOUR LIFE STORY

126
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,729
AS SOON AS
WE GET SOME REST.

127
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,367
ALL RIGHT. WELL,

128
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,369
YOU PAY AT
THE DOOR AT THE END.

129
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,704
YOU NEED TO LEAVE
A $20 DEPOSIT.

130
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,806
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.

131
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,642
YOU BETTER MAKE IT 40.

132
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,914
WAIT A MINUTE.

133
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,917
LET ME SEE
YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS KISS.

134
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,819
WHY WOULD WE
HAVE TO KISS?

135
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,689
BECAUSE OUR POLICY.

136
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,091
I NEED TO SEE
MARRIED COUPLES KISS.

137
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,427
IS THAT AN ACTUAL SIGN
THAT YOU USE?

138
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,295
YES.

139
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,399
DID YOU MAKE THAT SIGN BY HAND
JUST BEFORE WE GOT HERE?

140
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,368
NO.
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?

141
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,938
HE WOULD SLEEP IN THE CAR.
NO, HE WOULDN'T.
UM, SURE.

142
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,443
UH, WHY WOULD WE DO ANYTHING
OTHER THAN EXPRESS OUR LOVE

143
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,744
AND DEVOTION TO...

144
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,180
BLESS YOU, AND KEEP YOU.

145
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,015
VERY NICE.

146
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,350
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

147
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,419
I GET TO DO THAT
EVERY NIGHT OF MY LIFE,

148
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,021
AND POSSIBLY AFTER DEATH,
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT,

149
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,925
WHICH I DO, OF COURSE.
VERY NICE.

150
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,894
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

151
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,328

AND GOD BLESS.
[SCOFFS]

153
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,447
WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD,
PRETENDING TO KISS ME?

154
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,149
[COUGHS]

155
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,151
THE SAD THING IS
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST BOY

156
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,288
TO THROW UP
AFTER KISSING ME.

157
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,023
IT'S SOMETHING I ATE.

158
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,159
SOMETHING AWFUL--
AWFUL THAT I ATE.

159
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,362
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?
I DON'T THINK I'VE THROWN UP
IN, LIKE, 12 YEARS.

160
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:15,300
ISN'T THAT KIND OF
AN IMPRESSIVE RECORD?

161
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:19,070
WHAT, IS THAT, LIKE, SOMETHING
YOU HAVE TO BRAG ABOUT?

162
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,941
LIKE, THAT'S A SKILL?
LIKE, OH, I HAVE
A SUPERIOR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.

163
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,010
REWARD ME, PLEASE.
OH, I HAVE GOOD HEARING.

164
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,980
I TAUGHT MYSELF HOW
TO HAVE GOOD HEARING.
RIDICULOUS.

165
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,782
CAN YOU SMELL THIS BIBLE?

166
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,418
GET THAT OUT OF MY FACE.
I JUST THREW UP.

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,986
WAIT A MINUTE.

168
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,523
"IF A MAN MATES
WITH AN ANIMAL,

169
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,826
HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT
TO DEATH, AND YOU
SHALL KILL THE ANIMAL."

170
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,828
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR
TO THE ANIMAL. WHA--

171
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,830
DID YOU BRING
ALL THOSE GARGOYLES HERE?

172
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,199
YOU COULDN'T BE AWAY FROM THEM
FOR THREE DAYS?

173
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,103
WELL, I'M NOT PERMITTED
TO DISPLAY THEM
WHEN ZOE'S AROUND.

174
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,273
SHE THINKS THEY WATCH HER SLEEP.
GROSS. WHO WOULD WANT
TO WATCH HER SLEEP?

175
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,943
WE JUST GOT THIS ONE
ON MY TRIP TO PUERTO RICO,

176
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,945
AND I'VE BEEN EXCITED
TO DISPLAY IT.
WAIT.

177
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,114
WHY WERE YOU IN PUERTO RICO?
WERE YOU DEPORTED?

178
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,950
MOM AND DAD GOT
A FAMILY VACATION PACKAGE,

179
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,486
AND THEY TOOK ME AND ZOE
ON THIS REALLY NICE
ALL-EXPENSES PAID VACATION.

180
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,955
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING ME?
I TOTALLY COULD HAVE COME.

181
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,457
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

182
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,527
AND I THINK
THE EXACT WORDS WERE:

183
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,563
"I WANT THIS VACATION
TO BE RELAXING AND PLEASANT,

184
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:22,133
NOT A HUMUNGOUS PAIN IN THE ASS
LIKE IT WILL BE
IF J.R. IS AROUND."

185
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,335
I CAN HONESTLY SAY
AT NO POINT DID ANYONE EVER SAY

186
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,238
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FUN
HAD YOU BEEN THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

187
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,508
I'M SURE MOM AND DAD DIDN'T
INVITE ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW
I DON'T LIKE THE OCEAN.

188
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,344
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T
WANNA HAVE FUN ON A CRUISE.
I'M SURE THAT'S IT.

189
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,581
IT WASN'T A CRUISE, BY THE WAY.
IT WAS A BEACHSIDE RESORT
WITH A POOL.

190
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,350
HAVE YOU EVER SAT IN A POOL
AND LOOKED AT THE OCEAN?
IT'S LOVELY.

191
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,587
WHY WOULDN'T THEY WANT ME THERE?
I HAVE SO MANY
WONDERFUL THINGS GOING ON.

192
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,990
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M THEIR ONLY CHILD.
I'VE GOT THAT OVER YOU.

193
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,992
SECOND OF ALL,
I'M A WONDERFUL PERSON.

194
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,563
THAT IS SO NONSENSICALLY UNTRUE,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

195
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,465
THE FIRST CHILD
IS ALWAYS THE FAVORITE.

196
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,535
RIGHT. BUT THE FIRST CHILD'S
NOT THE ONLY CHILD.
"ONLY CHILD" MEANS ONLY CHILD.

197
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,537
NUMBER TWO,
I'M A WONDERFUL PERSON.

198
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,573
NUMBER THREE,
I'M AN ASPIRING ACTRESS.

199
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,576
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS?
NO ONE WANTED TO LISTEN TO YOU

200
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,378
TALK ABOUT LIVING
WITH YOUR PROFESSOR
IN A DEN OF SIN.

201
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,447
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTED
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

202
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,116
I THINK WE WANTED
TO GO DOWN THERE
AND CONCENTRATE ON THE BREEZE

203
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,953
AND THE PIñA COLADAS
AND NOT YOUR EMOTIONAL TURMOIL

204
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,522
AND YOUR PATHETIC
SHAMBLED LIFE.

205
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,092
YOU ARE SUCH A JERK.

206
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,896
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD HAVE THROWN UP
ALL OVER THIS FLOOR

207
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,365
TO PROVE MY POINT TO
THAT JESUS FREAK CLERK.

208
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,567
AND WHAT POINT MIGHT THAT BE?
THAT YOU LOVE HIM?

209
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,569
THAT I THINK HIS POLICIES
ARE BULLSHIT,

210
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,472
AND THIS PILE OF VOMIT
ON THE FLOOR IS A REPRESENTATION
OF MY FEELINGS.

211
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,474
WELL, IF YOU'D THROWN UP
ALL OVER THE FLOOR,

212
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,444
WE'D HAVE TO SLEEP IN A ROOM
WITH VOMIT ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

213
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,312
DID YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT THAT, EINSTEIN?

214
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,181
NO. NO, BUDDY, I DIDN'T.

215
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,516
BUT IF I
HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN,

216
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,987
I'M GOING TO THROW UP
ALL OVER THE FLOOR
IN THE MORNING.

217
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,489
YOU'RE THROWING UP
ALL OVER THE FLOOR,
NOT JUST IN ONE SPOT?

218
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,159
YES. ABSOLUTELY.
I'M GONNA STAND ON THE BED
AND SPIN AROUND.

219
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,629
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
A LAWN SPRINKLER BUT WITH PUKE
JUST EVERYWHERE.

220
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,199
SHH. OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
[WOMAN SPEAKING, FAINT]

221
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,368
[WOMAN MOANING]
HEAR WHAT?

222
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,436
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING?
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

223
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,973
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE
BETTER HEARING.
SHH.

224
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,510
EW. HAVING LOUD SEX
IN A MOTEL ROOM.
SO CLICHé.

225
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,247
I BET THEY'RE FAT.
I SHOULD GO TELL THE MANAGER.

226
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,616
IT'S PROBABLY HIM
HAVING SOME GROSS SEX
WITH A BLONDE WOMAN.

227
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,985
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
AGAINST THE POLICIES
OF THIS CHRISTIAN ESTABLISHMENT.

228
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,621
A MINUTE AGO,
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO THROW UP ALL OVER THE ROOM

229
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,623
IN RESPONSE TO
HIS HATEFUL POLICIES.

230
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,358
NOW YOU WANT TO SNITCH?
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

231
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,161
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
BECAUSE THIS AFFECTS ME.

232
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,030
ME. I'M TIRED.
[DEEP VOICE]
"ME."

233
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:35,366

WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,

HE WAS A QUICK--

236
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,546
COLIN?
WHAT?

237
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,548
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS?

238
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,317
I DON'T KNOW. NO.

239
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,686
I WONDER IF THERE'S,
LIKE, GAY GHOSTS.

240
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,056
AND IF THERE'S GAY GHOSTS,
DO YOU THINK THEY GO
[ALTERED VOICE] "BOO"?

GOOD NIGHT NOW.

242
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,328

243
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,421
YOU MISSED QUITE
THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST.

244
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,990
SHH.

245
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,992
I BURNED THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH
ON A PIECE OF TOAST.

246
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,493
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

247
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,062
COLIN, JUST STOP IT.

248
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,532
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'M UP. I'M UP.

249
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,702
I'M UP. STOP.
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

250
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,476

LIKE, WHY I NEEDED YOU
THIS WEEKEND, DID YOU?

252
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,646
NO.
OKAY, GOOD.

253
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,115
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU ANYWAY.

254
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,717
YES, THEY DO.
STOP IT WITH THAT.

255
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,720
WHY WOULDN'T THEY CARE ABOUT ME?
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE LIVING
WITH SOME CREEPY,

256
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,589
GROSS PROFESSOR MAN
NEARLY TWICE YOUR AGE,

257
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,657
AND HE THREW YOU OUT,
AND YOU DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,

258
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,128
AND NOW YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO,
AND YOU'RE PICKING ME UP...
ALL RIGHT.

259
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,730
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT CREEPY PROFESSOR MAN
THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

260
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,400
IS ONE OF THE TOP
BROADCAST JOURNALISM PROFESSORS
IN THE ENTIRE STATE.

261
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,703
I AM CLEARLY ON A FAST TRACK
TO A CAREER IN BROADCASTING.
HE GOT YOU ALL THOSE GREAT JOBS,

262
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,805
ALL THOSE WONDERFUL AUDITIONS,
ALL THOSE PATHETIC EVENTS

263
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,807
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO
WITH YOUR DUMB LITTLE HEADSHOT.

264
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,176
YEAH, YOU HAVE SO MANY JOBS NOW
BECAUSE OF HIM.

265
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,112
THAT'S WHY NOBODY LIKES YOU.
YOU'RE TOO SUCCESSFUL
TO HANG OUT WITH US.

266
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,349
YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL I FORGET.
I FORGET SOMETIMES
HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE,

267
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,385
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE TALK ABOUT
SITTING AROUND THE DINNER TABLE
IS WHAT A SUCCESS YOU ARE.

268
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,554
WAH, WAH, WAH.
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

269
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,323
ANYONE YOU COULD HAVE ASKED,
WHY ME? YOU MUST KNOW
TWO DOZEN PEOPLE.

270
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,793
I DON'T WANT TO INVOLVE
MORE PEOPLE THAN IS NECESSARY.

TO HELP ME CARRY
A FEW STUPID BOXES.

272
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,065
I JUST NEED ONE PERSON.
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO KEEP IT HUSH-HUSH,

273
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,400
OR BECAUSE YOU'RE ASHAMED
AND EMBARRASSED
AT HOW THIS IS ENDING?

274
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,603
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME,
YOU COULD'VE STAYED AT HOME

WELL, THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,716
IT'S MY FAULT. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS FOOD POISONING.
...I'M SHOCKED YOU ASKED ME.

00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:09,320

A REASON YOU ASKED ME,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.

280
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,622
COLIN, I ASKED YOU BECAUSE
I TRUST YOU WITH MY STUFF,

AND MAINLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NOBODY IMPORTANT TO TELL.

I COULD TELL YOU NEEDED A STRONG
MALE FIGURE THE MINUTE WE MET.
I'M NOT GONNA DENY YOU THAT.

470
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,196
DOES YOUR DAUGHTER
HAVE A STRONG MALE FIGURE
IN HER LIFE?

472
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,967
OH, YEAH.
I'M SORRY.

00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:12,936
WHY ARE WE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AGAIN?

474
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:16,206
IS THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO ASHAMED TO ADMIT

FROM A ROOM FULL OF STUDENTS

WITH THIS THING WE HAD?

IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
YOU CAME IN HERE ALL AMPED UP.

482
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,592
I WASN'T EXPECTING

00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:01,810
WELL, I'VE ALSO HEARD
THAT IF A MAN EATS
A LOT OF PINEAPPLE,

941
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,213
IT WILL MAKE HIS EJACULATE
TASTE DELICIOUS.

942
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:06,482
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

943
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,851
I DON'T KNOW.
I FIGURED MAYBE I COULD EAT
THIS ENTIRE THING,

944
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,253
AND WE CAN
ALL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I GONNA GO NOW.

945
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:13,255
OKAY. THAT'S GREAT.
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE

946
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:16,692
AND CUT THIS PINEAPPLE UP
AND EAT IT A LITTLE BIT MYSELF.

947
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,528
YOU KNOW,
BROADCASTING IS JUST SUCH
A HARD THING TO BREAK INTO.

948
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,530
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THESE PEOPLE
GET THESE ON-CAMERA JOBS,

949
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,832
AND THEY DON'T EVER
WANT TO LEAVE.

950
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:27,670
THEY HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE,
EVEN IF THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO ARE WAY MORE TALENTED.

951
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:30,272
BUT, I MEAN,
IT'LL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

952
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,708
I MEAN, ME AND MY MANAGER
ARE SETTING UP JOBS

953
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,577
IN, YOU KNOW,
MAJOR MARKETS.

954
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,579
NOTHING LOCAL, SO...

955
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,848
WHAT ARE MAJOR MARKETS?

956
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,519
OH, HEY, BRO.
I FORGOT TO MENTION.

957
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,721
THERE'S A DRESS CODE
FOR MEN.

958
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,290
MEN HAVE TO
WEAR JACKETS.

959
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:51,293
I GOT THIS ONE
SPECIAL FOR YOU.

960
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:55,564
PUT IT ON, NOW.
I INSIST.

961
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,833
GOOD EVENING.
I'M YOUR NIGHTLY
CORRESPONDENT, J.R.

962
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,903
IN OTHER NEWS,
MULTIPLE SCHOOL CHILDREN

963
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,239
[CLEARS THROAT]
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH.

964
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,374
ALL RIGHT. WAIT.
LET ME START OVER. OKAY.

965
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:06,842
GOOD EVENING.
IN OTHER NEWS,

966
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,311
MULTIPLE SCHOOL CHILDREN
WERE FOUND BLUDGEONED TO DEATH,

967
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:10,980
THEIR BODIES STUFFED
IN A GARBAGE DISPOSER--

968
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,881
GARBAGE-- GARBAGE
[MISPRONOUNCES]
CHUTE--

969
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,416
GARBAGE CHUTE. UGH!

970
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,518
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS
IN AUDITIONS!

971
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
WHATEVER. IT'S WAY HARDER
THAN IT LOOKS ON T.V.

972
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,756
YOU KNOW THAT.

973
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,393
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I-- GOOD...

974
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:26,428
HOW IS THAT?

975
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,930
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

976
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,632
CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

977
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,634
WHY?
WE JUST GOT HERE.

978
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:33,669
I'M HAVING
A HORRIBLE TIME.

979
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:36,572
SOMEBODY SPILLED
DRINK ON ME ON PURPOSE.
YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE.

980
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,574
NONE OF THE GIRLS WANT TO EAT
ANY OF MY PINEAPPLE.

981
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,376
YOU OWE ME FOR THAT PINEAPPLE,
BY THE WAY.

982
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,378
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

983
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,713
UH, FR-- NO, NO.
THIS IS MY BROTHER COLIN.

984
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,949
YOU REMEMBER.
COLIN?

985
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,551
HI, KIM.
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU.

986
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,453
YOU'VE KNOWN ME
SINCE I WAS SIX.

987
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,789
YEAH, BUT YOU
USED TO BE SO--

988
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:57,960
I MEAN, YOU LOOK
SO DIFFERENT NOW.
DO I?

989
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,929
I DIDN'T USED TO HAVE
ALL THIS DRINK SPILLED ON ME.
[LAUGHTER]

990
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,832
THAT MUST BE IT.
YOU KNOW,
COLIN USED TO HAVE

991
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,501
THE BIGGEST CRUSHES
ON YOU GUYS GROWING UP.

992
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:07,503
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNEW THAT.
WHAT THE FUCK?

993
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,438
IT'S TRUE.
DO YOU REMEMBER IN TENTH GRADE
WHEN WE TOOK THOSE PHOTOS

994
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,573
IN OUR BATHING SUITS?
YEAH.

995
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:12,975
HE SAVED ALL OF THEM.

996
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,744
EVEN THE ONES OF ME.
ISN'T THAT KIND OF WEIRD?

997
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:18,547
I DON'T MIND.
YEAH.
COLIN, WE'RE FLATTERED.

998
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,383
YEAH, WELL, UH, J.R. DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO READ UNTIL SHE WAS TEN.

999
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,719
ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS?
I HAD TO TEACH HER,
AND I'M YOUNGER.

1000
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,788
IT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'RE SO FUNNY, COLIN.

1001
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,490
I AM, BUT IT'S
NOT AS FUNNY AS YOU
NOT KNOWING HOW TO READ

1002
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,793
UNTIL YOU WERE
IN FOURTH GRADE.
SHUT UP. EXCUSE ME.

1003
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:33,796
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GO CALL MY MANAGER AND SEE IF
ANY CASTING PEOPLE CALLED ME.

1004
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:35,798
EXCUSE ME.

1005
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,333
HI.

1006
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:40,569
I'M COLIN.

1007
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,071
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST HARD,

1008
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,939
BECAUSE YOU STILL WANT
TO GO OUT, YOU KNOW?

1009
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:47,843
I MEAN, I'M ONLY 26,
BUT I HAVE A HUSBAND
AND A KID.

1010
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,846
OH, YOU GOT MARRIED
AND HAD A KID ALREADY?

1011
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,648
WELL, OF COURSE I DID.

1012
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,117
I MEAN, HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK
I GET TO BE HERE TONIGHT?

1013
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,587
LET ME TELL YOU,
THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN
HAVING A LIVE-IN BABYSITTER

1014
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,622
IS HAVING A HUSBAND
IN A BACK BRACE.

1015
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:04,360
OOH-LA-LA.
SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

1016
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,661
[MUTTERS]

1017
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,529
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

1018
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,865
THIS IS WAY LESS FUN
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.

1019
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,701
YOU THINK I HAVE A SHOT
AT KIM? I THINK THINGS
ARE GOING WELL WITH US.

1020
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,036
OH, MY GOD, YES.
TOTALLY.

1021
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,904
THAT'S THE ONLY THING GOOD
IN THIS PARTY.

1022
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,906
I FEEL LIKE KIM IS GIVING YOU
REALLY SLUTTY EYES.

1023
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,908
I FEEL LIKE
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.
IT'S SURPRISING.

1024
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,077
I DIDN'T BRING MY "A" GAME,
I DIDN'T PREPARE ANY JOKES,

1025
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,446
NOTHING, BUT HERE SHE IS,
GIVING EVERYTHING TO ME.

1026
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,482
NOW, J.R.,

1027
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,651
YOU ARE VERY BOHEMIAN
TO ME.

1028
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,554
IS THAT THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?
IT IS.

1029
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,723
SO YOU CHOOSE
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF

1030
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,893
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY,
AND I RESPECT THAT.

1031
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,928
I'M JUST WONDERING

1032
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,898
HOW YOU CAN GET A JOB
LOOKING THE WAY THAT YOU DO.

1033
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,102
I MEAN,
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
OH, WELL, I--

1034
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,104
IT'S MORE THAN JUST
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT,

1035
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,140
IT'S ABOUT FINDING A JOB
THAT MATTERS,

1036
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:53,409
ALWAYS WORKING TOWARDS
BEING THE BEST IN YOUR FIELD,

1037
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,577
MAKING GOOD CAREER CHOICES.

1038
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,579
AH, GOOD CAREER CHOICES.

1039
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,181
LIKE WHAT?

1040
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,450
WELL, I'M A JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT
AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

1041
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,652
TELECOMMUNICATION FIRMS
IN THE CITY.

1042
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:07,055
PRETTY SOON,
THAT'S GONNA BE
SENIOR ACCOUNTANT.

1043
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,826
I AM ASSISTANT TO THE HEAD
OF CLIENT MANAGEMENT

1044
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,662
AT AN ARTIST'S UNION.

1045
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:16,665
I WORK FOR A TEMP AGENCY.

1046
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,168
OH, MY GOD.
I TEMPED BEFORE.
IT'S SO BORING.

1047
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,437
OH, I WAS ENTERING DATA, LIKE,
FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT.

1048
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,739
I FELT LIKE A ROBOT.
I TOTALLY KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

1049
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,741
NO, NO. I, UH--
I'M NOT A TEMP.

1050
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:27,910
THAT'S SORT OF RIDICULOUS.

1051
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,611
I WORK
FOR THE TEMP AGENCY.

1052
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,213
I PLACE PEOPLE IN POSITIONS.

1053
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:34,883
J.R., HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME
FOR ALL YOUR LITTLE AUDITIONS?

1054
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,885
I MEAN, DO YOU DO THEM
AFTER WORK?

1055
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,087
OR DO YOU HAVE
A FLEXIBLE JOB?

1056
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:41,690
I MEAN,
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT KIND
OF JOB YOU HAVE.

1057
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,592
YOU HAVE SUCH A KOOKY
SENSE OF HUMOR.

1058
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,961
[LAUGHTER]

1059
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,997
UH, NO, NO.
LET'S KEEP TALKING ABOUT YOU.

1060
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,166
I'M JUST, LIKE,
A FLY ON THE WALL
AT THIS PARTY.

1061
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,169
J.R., DON'T BE SO MODEST.
EVEN IF IT IS JUST A DAY JOB,

1062
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,238
IT'S STILL A REALLY BIG
PART OF YOUR LIFE.

1063
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
UH, NO--
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE YOU'RE JUST

1064
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:01,977
SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING,
LIKE, WAITING FOR A PHONE CALL

1065
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,680
ASKING YOU TO BE A WEATHER GIRL
LIKE YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

1066
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:06,815
[LAUGHTER]
[J.R.]
UH, NO.

1067
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,918
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD
AND PATHETIC, RIGHT?

1068
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,221
YEAH.
SO WHAT IS IT?

1069
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:15,157
UH, NO, NO.
[MUTTERS]

1070
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,226
NO, WHAT?
NO--

[MUTTERING]

1072
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,864
NURSE. I AM A NURSE.

1073
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,732
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
FOR A MINUTE THERE,

1074
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,133
WE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

1075
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,537
HOW SILLY WOULD THAT BE?
[LAUGHTER]

1076
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:31,740
THAT WOULD BE SICKENING.
[LAUGHS]

1077
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,977
THAT'S NURSE TALK--
SICK.

1078
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:37,012
[WOMAN]
IT'S JUST SUCH

1079
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,214

UH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,637
THAT'S OKAY. NO.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S FINE. I-- NO.

00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,917
LOOK, YOU GOT A CHOICE
TO MAKE, BUDDY.

1090
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,919
YOU CAN GO ON
AND GET OUT OF HERE,

1091

AND WE CAN WAIT FOR THAT GIRL
I HEAR IS YOUR HOT SISTER

1092
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:23,992
TO GET DRUNK ENOUGH SO WE
CAN AUDITION HER OURSELVES.

1093
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,994
[EXHALES FORCEFULLY]
THAT IS TEMPTING.

1094
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,030
BUT, UH, WHAT'S
MY OTHER CHOICE?

1095
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:32,234
OR YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR GAUCHE ASS OUT OF HERE
AND REPLENISH OUR SUPPLIES.

1096

01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,661
OH, YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT ZOE?

1263
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:22,230
YOU TWO ARE, LIKE, TOGETHER,
FOR SERIOUS, RIGHT?

1264
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,332
YEAH. WHAT ABOUT HER?
I DON'T KNOW.

1265
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,334
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED?

1266
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,870
NO. I MEAN, I COULDN'T.

1267
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:31,573
YOU KNOW,
THE SITUATION WITH HER
IS SO FUCKED.

1268
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,575
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY--
IN WHAT WAY?

1269
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:35,743
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD
ANY SEX FOR,

1270
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,246
LIKE, WEEKS OR MONTHS.

1271
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:40,715
WAIT. MOM AND DAD DIDN'T
TAKE YOU TO PUERTO RICO?

1272
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,685
NO. NO,
WE WENT TO PUERTO RICO.
WE JUST, YOU KNOW...

1273
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,287
I LIED ABOUT
HOW ROMANTIC IT WAS.
[SCOFFS]

1274
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,456
I'M SURE, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING,

1275
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,459
I'M GONNA BE ON
THE SUBURBAN MARRIAGE WAGON
ANY DAY NOW,

1276
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:56,131
WITH MALE PATTERN BALDNESS
AND VARICOSE VEINS.

1277
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,269
IT'S A RELIEF TO HEAR
THAT YOU DIDN'T...

1278
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:04,139
I DIDN'T WHAT?

1279
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:07,142
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST, LIKE,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HER,

1280
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,344
BUT I GUESS THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

1281
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,346
I DON'T KNOW.

1282
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:14,716
YOU'RE NOT GONNA END UP
LIKE A NORMAL SUBURBAN LOSER

1283
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,518
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.

1284
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,520
I'LL COME WHISK YOU
AND YOUR STUPID--

1285
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:21,222
OR PRECIOUS
GARGOYLES AWAY

1286
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:23,525
BEFORE I'D EVER
LET THAT HAPPEN.

1287
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,894
I SEE YOU, LIKE,
TWICE A YEAR.

1288
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:29,797
YOU KNOW,
I'D BE COMPLETELY A LOST CAUSE
BEFORE YOU EVER GOT TO ME.

1289
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:31,499
NO.

1290
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,735
JUST CALL ME,
AND I'LL PULL YOU--

1291
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:35,737
I'LL WHISK YOU AWAY
TO ONE OF MY--

1292
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:38,840
WHOEVER MY NEW
MENTOR/SUITOR IS.

1293
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:42,644
WE CAN LIVE IN
THEIR BASEMENT OR SOMETHING.

1294
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,345
NO, IT'S WAY TOO LATE
FOR ME.

1295
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,347
I'M TRAPPED,
AND I'VE FLOATED AWAY TO SEA.

1296
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,317
NO! NO, YOU'RE OKAY,
HONESTLY.

1297
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,753
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU
RATHER BE DOING

1298
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:54,722
IF YOU WEREN'T HAVING
YOUR CURRENT LIFE?

1299
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,958
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE A PLAN "A"?

1300
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,295
YEAH. LIKE,
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN "A"?
WHAT'S YOUR, LIKE, DREAM LIFE?

1301
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:02,330
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I GUESS AT SOME POINT,

1302
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,799
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD TEACH.

1303
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:07,202
TEACHING?
THAT'S IRONIC.

1304
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:10,572
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE ONE
TO SAY TEACHING IS, LIKE,
THE BIGGEST FAILURE--

1305
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:13,775
THAT THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN TEACHING--

1306
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:16,844
THAT TEACHING IS ALLOWING
OTHERS TO FAIL--
TO FAIL.

1307
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:18,846
...WHILE SPINNING
YOUR OWN WHEELS.

1308
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,583
YOU REALLY REMEMBER
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

1309
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:23,785
WELL, YEAH.
I MEAN, IT HAD AN EFFECT.

1310
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:26,354
I MEAN, AT ONE POINT,
I THOUGHT

1311
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:28,723
I MAYBE WOULD
PURSUE TEACHING,

1312
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,592
AND YOU KIND OF TALKED
ME OUT OF IT.

1313
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,594
YOU? TEACH?
YEAH.

1314
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,862
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO TEACH.
YOU'RE BARELY QUALIFIED
TO LEARN.

1315
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:37,765
[SCOFFS]
THANKS, I GUESS.

1316
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:40,635
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, IT JUST FELT LIKE
SOMETHING THAT I COULD DO.

1317
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,371
IT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE IN.

1318
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:45,240
IT JUST SEEMED
LIKE AN OPTION, BUT--

1319
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,741
YEAH, BUT THEN WHAT?

1320
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,377
YOU, LIKE, TEACH FOR TEN YEARS,
AND THEN WHAT?

1321
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,546
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THEN?

1322
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:55,016
I GUESS YOU CAN JUST
FUCK YOUR YOUNG STUDENTS
AND PROMISE THEM JOBS.

1323
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,718
[SCOFFS]
SHUT UP.

1324
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,820
I'M SORRY.
I'M IN NO POSITION TO JUDGE.

1325
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:02,757
[SIGHS]
NO. BUT I GUESS
I COULD IMAGINE YOU, THOUGH.

1326
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:06,361
WHAT?
FUCKING MY STUDENTS?

1327
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:08,596
YEAH.
OR TEACHING?
OR FUCKING MY STUDENTS?

1328
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,598
YEAH. HAVING SEX WITH
YOUR STUDENTS. I MEAN--
THANKS.

1329
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,001
THE WAY YOU WERE
WITH KIM TONIGHT,
I CAN JUST IMAGINE

1330
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:16,771
ALL THE CREEPY PERVERSE STUFF
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF
THAT I DIDN'T THINK BEFORE.

1331
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,507
OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF IT.

1332
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,409
OOH-LA-LA.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

1333
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:23,411
OH, REMEMBER--
[MUMBLING]

1334
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,913
REMEMBER WHAT
I WAS SAYING EARLIER
ABOUT MOM'S VIBRATOR?

1335
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:28,916
OR I STARTED TO TELL YOU,
AND THEN YOU CUT ME OFF
AT THE STORE?

1336
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:31,552
YES. I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO GET
AN ERECTION BECAUSE OF IT.

1337
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:33,554
IT'S HAUNTED ME EVERY SECOND
SINCE YOU TOLD ME.

1338
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:36,924
WAIT. KIM DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A BONER?

1339
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:39,661
UM...
SORRY.

1340
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:43,531
I WAS JUST THINKING IF THERE WAS
A WAY I COULD KILL MYSELF
BEFORE YOU GO ON WITH THIS.

1341
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,667
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR A STORY
ABOUT MOM'S VIBRATOR?

1342
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:47,669
ISN'T THAT WHAT EVERY--

1343
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:49,904
EVERY YOUNG MAN
WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT?

1344
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:53,841
UM, WELL, SINCE I GUESS I CAN'T
ACTUALLY KILL MYSELF
BEFORE YOU KEEP TALKING,

1345
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,777
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GO ON.

1346
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:59,080
OKAY. WELL,
DON'T TELL ANYONE, BUT...
[SIGHS]

1347
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:01,482
WHEN I--
WHEN I FOUND IT--

1348
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,319
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I FELT LIKE
I SHOULD SMELL IT.

1349
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,321
ISN'T THAT DISGUSTING?
I DON'T KNOW.

1350
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,556
I JUST--
I JUST THOUGHT, LIKE--

1351
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:11,459
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE LAST TIME SHE,
LIKE, USED IT OR WHAT,

1352
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:13,761
OR IF IT WAS JUST
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM OR SOMETHING,

1353
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:17,332
BUT I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT IT SMELLED LIKE.

1354
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,667
YEAH? AND?

1355
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,803
IT DIDN'T SMELL
LIKE ANYTHING.

1356
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:24,405
SO...NOTHING AT ALL.
NOTHING?

1357
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:27,909
I MEAN, MAYBE THAT MEANS THAT
IF YOU EVER HAVE CHILDREN,

1358
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:32,647
MOM PASSED ON
THE NO-SMELL PRIVATE PART
TO YOUR OFFSPRING.

1359
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:35,683
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE
A BIG HIT AT PARTIES.

1360
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,887
I KNOW.
DON'T TELL ME THAT A SCENT-FREE
VAGINA IS A GREAT THING,

1361
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,956
LIKE I DON'T
ALREADY KNOW THAT.

1362
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:45,593
IS THERE ANY OTHER SCENT-RELATED
FAMILY INFORMATION
YOU WANT TO PASS ON TO ME?

1363
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:48,129
DID YOU EVER SMELL ANY--
ANY UNDERPANTS AROUND THE HOUSE?

1364
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:52,033
OOH-LA-LA. NO, SADLY.
IS THERE ANY ASS INFORMATION
YOU CAN DIVULGE TO ME?

1365
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,536
ALL RIGHT. STOP.
NO-- OKAY. I'M SORRY.
I'LL-- I'LL STOP.

1366
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:59,774
I'LL STOP WITH
ALL THE BUTT CRACKS.
[LAUGHING]

1367
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,610
THAT ACTUALLY WAS...

1368
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,812
SO STUPID.

1369
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:09,650
OH, I CAN JUST IMAGINE YOU,
THOUGH,

1370
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:11,652
BEING A TEACHER.

1371
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:13,421
YOU WOULD BE--

1372
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:16,491
I CAN JUST IMAGINE YOU, LIKE,
IN FRONT OF SOME CLASS.

1373
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:19,093
YOU'RE, LIKE, WEARING
YOUR STUPID MARSHMALLOW SHOES

1374
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,462
AND, LIKE, SOME--
YOUR STUPID JEANS

1375
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:24,999
AND SOME WEIRD
OFF-THE-RACK BLAZER,
BEING LIKE,

1376
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:27,535

"COME ON, CLASS.
LISTEN TO ME.

1377
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,104
"COME-- YOU KNOW,
I'M A SERIOUS PROFESSOR.

1378
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,873
[MOCKING GIBBERISH]
"LOOK AT ME.

1379
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,875
LOOK AT MY GARGOYLES.
OOH."

1380
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,743
OH, YOU REALLY GOT ME
DOWN PAT THERE.

1381
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,445
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
THAT'S IT.

1382
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:40,648
THAT'S ALL YOU SAY TO THE CLASS,
THEN YOU WALK OUT.

1383
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,785
NO, I CAN JUST
IMAGINE IT, THOUGH.
LIKE...

1384
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,821
LIKE,
YOU GATHERING YOUR STUFF,

1385
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:49,023
LIKE, AFTER CLASS.

1386
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:53,428
LIKE, EVERYONE LEAVES.
AND YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,
SUCH AN AWKWARD GUY.

1387
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,530
AND THE CLASS HAS, LIKE,

1388
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,832
NEVER HAD A TEACHER
LIKE YOU BEFORE,

1389
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,867
AND, LIKE, THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO MAKE OF YOU.

1390
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,869
AND, LIKE, I'M SURE
THERE'S, LIKE, SOME, LIKE,

1391
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,871
RANDOM GIRL
AT THE END OF CLASS.

1392
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:06,674
SHE'S, LIKE, PACKING UP
HER BOOKS REALLY SLOWLY

1393
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,643
AS EVERYBODY LEAVES.

1394
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:10,511
AND YOU'RE, LIKE--
YOU'RE, LIKE,

1395
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,480
PUTTING YOUR BOOKS
IN YOUR, LIKE, SATCHEL

1396
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:14,982
OR WHATEVER
PROFESSORS CARRY.

01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,084
SHE, LIKE,
WALKS OVER TO YOU

1398
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:20,087

01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:37,605
I CAN JUST SEE IT.
LIKE, SHE'S...

1406
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,741
SHE'S LIKE, "OH, PROFESSOR,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?"

1407
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,611
AND YOU'RE, LIKE--
YOU, LIKE, APPRECIATE HER,

1408
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,613
'CAUSE SHE'S, LIKE,
THE ONLY ONE IN THE CLASS THAT,

1409
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:48,015

01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:53,654
BUT, LIKE,

01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,857
THAT YOU GAVE TO HER.

'CAUSE, LIKE, ONE DAY,

YOU GO TO THE MOVIES,

AND YOU LEAVE
A SEAT EMPTY,

HOPING THAT SOMEBODY
WILL SIT THERE.

1421
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,916
AND NOBODY DOES. BUT THEN,
RIGHT AS THE MOVIE STARTS--

SHE WALKS IN.

YOU PUT YOUR STUPID BLAZER.

PUT BUTTER ON IT

TALK AGAIN UNTIL LATER,
