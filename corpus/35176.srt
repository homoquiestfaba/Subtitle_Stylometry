Changing Lanes (Subtitle Revised by HchC)

1
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:06,524
I think I'll make this
the  boys' room.

2
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,617
The master  bedroom?

3
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:12,710
- Boys need, you know, space.
- How old are they?

4
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,886
- Steven's ten, Danny's seven.
- Lucky kids.

5
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,392
Lucky dad.

6
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:02,233
Is everything--

7
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,864
- It's my first house, and--
- Doyle, you're getting the loan.

8
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm not sure I filled
everything out correctly.

9
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,072
You're approved. We'll have
it done for you tomorrow.

10
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,309
Come  by, say, 12:30,
and we can sign off on this.

11
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,984
What about you?

12
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,990
- He  bought all these instruments.
- Right.

13
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:25,151
Did you know that
he  built this hall?

14
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,991
And a gallery...

15
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,894
a shelter and a hospital
in Mexico...

16
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:32,866
and a lot of other
really great things.

17
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,097
I met Simon Dunne
when I was in college.

18
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,402
I was tutoring kids
from the local school--

19
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:42,410
kids who didn't have
a lot of resources.

20
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:44,776
And one of the people
I was working with...

21
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:48,613
said that her grandfather
liked to help children in nee.

22
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,380
Her name was Mina Dunne.

23
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,421
In fact, she's sitting
right over here.

24
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:58,850
So my friend and I went to
her grandfather and we said...

25
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:02,658
we have some kids
who need a playground.

26
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,825
We needed a thousand dollars.
He said, "I'll tell you what.

27
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:09,268
You can't have
a thousand dollars...

28
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,067
to  build one playground.

29
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,473
You can have 10,000 to  build ten.''

30
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:16,636
So we did.

31
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:18,942
- How long have you played violin?
- Six years.

32
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:23,144
- How about you?
- I feel llke champagne.

33
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:27,177
I understand the idea
of celebration.

34
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:31,386
I see the  bubbles in champagne...

35
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,227
as something good and  beautiful.

36
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,823
Not part of my soul evaporating...

37
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:42,064
 but--  but rising...

38
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,662
with--

39
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,207
with joy.

40
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,367
What I'm trying to say is...

41
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,414
I don't want champagne.

42
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:56,474
I am champagne.

43
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:02,719
It's great to  be alive.
Thanks for lettin' me share.

44
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,190
Thanks for sharing.

45
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:11,357
- I'm Mike, and I'm an alcoholic.
- Hi, Mike!

46
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,334
I've  been so ber for 15 days.

47
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:20,735
Mina, wait a second!

48
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:24,802
My grandfather liked you for some
mysterious reasons of his own.

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,678
Excuse me. That's the only reason
we allowed you to speak today.

50
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,444
Wait a minute.
Mina, we're friends.

51
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,453
We were friends a long time ago.

52
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,682
Mina, I owe you so much.

53
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:37,549
What happened to you?

54
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,560
What do you mean?

55
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:42,596
- I'll see you in court.
- Mina! Wait a second.

56
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,962
It's okay, it's okay.
Let her go.

57
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:48,434
Let her go.
George, Melissa. How are you?

58
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:50,437
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

59
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,439
...grant me the serenity...

60
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,533
to accept the things
I cannot change...

61
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:57,875
and the wisdom
to know the difference...

62
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,504
to keep coming  back.

63
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:03,540
It works if you work it,
so work it. You're worth it.

64
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,151
- Good morning, Julia.
- Hey, Gavin.

65
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,488
Good morning, guys.

66
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,327
...use of the premises  by lessee,
then lessor and lessee shall--

67
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:19,094
I don't deserve this.
I did absolutely nothing wrong...

68
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,260
and now she just decides
she's gonna hate me.

69
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,600
-Just a second, Tom.
- No, nothing.

70
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,936
Do your thing.
I just wanna tell you the news.

71
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,272
You know, I did
a bsolutely nothing wrong.

72
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,680
So what is it with
all this champagne stuff?

73
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,010
- Oh, that was-- That's just--
- It's a metaphor.

74
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:41,078
Yeah. But I'm not drinking...

75
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:43,351
and that's what's important, right?

76
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:47,862
Be careful with your metaphors.
Just one drink, right?

77
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,660
She's only mad at you  because
she can't  be mad at him.

78
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,667
He was your client. She's not.
Simon Dunne was your client.

79
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:58,831
She's still just incredibly
angry about this.

80
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,841
Those are her feelings, not yours.

81
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:03,707
- I know that, Steven.
- You got the documents all signed.

82
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,009
Get in and get out, Gavin.

83
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,641
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Of course we didn't.

84
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,648
File the papers and get out.

85
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,019
- Okay?
- Right.

86
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,785
Okay, Mr. Warren.

87
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,793
What you want is term insurance,
 but you're not sure about the cost.

88
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:23,888
What's important is that you  be
realistic about what you need.

89
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:28,733
This policy is never gonna cost you
more than $15 a month.

90
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,362
That's right.

91
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,787
Ellen, call the courthouse
and tell them I'm gonna be late.

92
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,851
You know what?
Just call Kaufman's offllce...

93
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,830
and tell him that I called
to say that I'm gonna  be late, okay?

94
00:07:56,898 --> 00:08:00,095
""Your Honor,
I'm representing myself today...

95
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:04,264
 because I want you to hear
the sincerity of my words.

96
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,537
Boys need their fathers.
Boys need their fathers.''

97
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,772
- You all right?
- Yeah. Are you?

98
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,313
Yeah. You got an insurance card?

99
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,641
Yeah, sure.

100
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:54,624
- We just got a call from the court.
- I had an accident.

101
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,994
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

102
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,033
- I'm fine. It's nothing.
- Nothing?

103
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,590
- Who's that?
- It's no one.

104
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:03,695
- This may  be nothing to you--
- No, don't do that! Don't do that!

105
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,399
- I'll do what I have to.
- I'm sorry. Not you.

106
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,737
- I have to do this right, you know?
- I think so.

107
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,936
I do.
Yes, hold on a second!

108
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:13,640
- Clean in all my actions.
- Hold on for one second, okay?

109
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:17,378
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell the court I'm on my way.

110
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,852
Okay, tell them I'm on the steps.
Okay, thank you.

111
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,890
- It's only gonna take five minutes.
- I gotta  be somewhere.

112
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:26,324
You really should keep your card
in your glove compartment...

113
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,555
- and not your  briefcase.
- That's not what I'm looking for.

114
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,428
Come on! Shit.

115
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,059
Thank you.
Thank you.

116
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:37,662
Thank you. Very nice of you.
Listen. Tell you what.

117
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:42,403
I'm gonna write you a  blank check,
and you just get your car fixed--

118
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:44,877
- I don't want your check, man.
- You have an honest face.

119
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,039
- Don't worry about it.
- I wanna do this right.

120
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,845
- Come on! Please! I gotta go!
- I gotta  be someplace else too!

121
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:52,853
It's important to me we do it right.
It should  be important to you too.

122
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,253
That's it.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

123
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,518
- You're sorry what?
- I gotta go, man. I'm late.

124
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,719
I've gotta  be somewhere too!
Well, can I get a lift?

125
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,284
- I'm sorry.
- Where are you going, man?

126
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:03,923
- Don't leave me out here like this!
- Better luck next time.

127
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:06,193
Better luck--

128
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,259
Hey, you're leaving
the scene of an accident!

129
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,704
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.

130
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,805
- I was in a traffllc accident.
- Are you all right?

131
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:56,942
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Was anyone hurt?

132
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,009
Then will Mr. Kaufman  begin?

133
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:06,119
Your Honor, since its inception,
the Simon Dunne Foundation...

134
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:09,857
was managed  by Mr. Dunne
and a  board of trustees...

135
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,025
which included his granddaughter,
my client Mina Dunne.

136
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,832
Upon his death,
that  board was disbanded.

137
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,941
We wanna know why.

138
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,310
Well, it was on instructions
from my client, Your Honor.

139
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,043
Why would he do that?
These people were his friends.

140
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:32,052
They were wonderful people
who loved kids and music...

141
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,647
 but they weren't qualiflled to manage
a 100-million-dollar foundation.

142
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:37,657
- That's why he signed--
- Your Honor, please.

143
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,625
Address the court, Counselor.

144
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:42,390
Simon Dunne signed
a power of appointment appointing...

145
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:46,332
Walter Arnell and Steven Delano
sole trustees of the foundation.

146
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,869
He was old
and he was taken advantage of.

147
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,371
You took advantage of him, Gavin!

148
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,498
Now you're charging a crime,
Miss Dunne...

149
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,805
and this is probate court,
not criminal court.

150
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:59,813
- Does your client understand?
- She does, Your Honor.

151
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:03,874
Your Honor, I'm not here
to debate everyone's opinion...

152
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,977
about Simon Dunne's intention.

153
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,988
I'm here to present
some papers to the court...

154
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:10,650
which are signed  by Mr. Dunne.

155
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,488
They've all  been notarized.
And furthermore...

156
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,858
they direct the foundation
to  be administered...

157
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:18,365
in precisely the way
in which Mr. Dunne...

158
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,061
not his granddaughter, intended.

159
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,763
- Please the court?
- What do you got?

160
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:25,100
Trust agreement...

161
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:28,339
tax exemption...

162
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,445
power of appointment.

163
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:43,283
- Mr. Banek?
- Sorry.

164
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,793
Mr. Banek?

165
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,537
I made a mistake.

166
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:59,232
What mistake?

167
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:03,038
This morning, after the accident
 by the side of the road...

168
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:07,275
we were exchanging
insurance information...

169
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:10,442
and I used the file folder...

170
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:12,986
to, you know, to--
you know, to--

171
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,954
No, I don't know.

172
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,082
To write my name on,
and address.

173
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:20,286
And I gave it to him.

174
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:23,922
I just wasn't thinking clearly,
I guess. Must've  been the accident.

175
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,228
Did you get his name?

176
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,493
Did I get his--
Yes, of course I got his name.

177
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,334
Let's call him.

178
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:35,770
As I-- If memory serves,
Your Honor...

179
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:38,334
- I  believe he's not in.
- How do you know?

180
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:41,905
He made some reference
to the fact that he was...

181
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,451
feeling hurried  because...

182
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,487
he had to  be at an appointment
of some sort.

183
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:50,149
- Call him and leave a message.
- Yes, of course. I will.

184
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,326
Your Honor,
may I make a suggestion?

185
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,128
I'm in no hurry,
and I know how  bad...

186
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:03,136
a person feels after a--
a car crash, right?

187
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:05,104
Yeah.
Thanks, Terry.

188
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:08,142
No. Don't mention it.

189
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,145
So, Gavin, when the man,
whose name you don't know...

190
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:15,546
gets out of the meeting
that you say he's in...

191
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:19,553
would you call him at the number
that you think is in your car...

192
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:22,522
so that we can have the document
you assure us gives us the proof...

193
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,956
that the senior partners
of your law firm...

194
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:28,291
do control the money Simon Dunne
left to the children of New York?

195
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,593
Doesn't matter. He'll have a copy.
He'll  bring the copy in.

196
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:33,634
A piece of paper with
an original signature on it...

197
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,636
still has great magical power.

198
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,729
Without that piece of paper
with the signature...

199
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:41,366
Miss Dunne can sue
that law firm for fraud...

200
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:46,709
and possibly send you and the other
members of your law firm to jail.

201
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:50,308
Mr. Banek, find your man...

202
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:52,410
and  bring me  back that file
 by the end of the day.

203
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,753
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,192
- Hold on, sir.
- Put your hands up, please.

205
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,763
Wait. Hold on a second.

206
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,891
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

207
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,794
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

208
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,801
- You're late. Mom went in already.
- What's in the  bag?

209
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,030
- What  bag?
- Daddy!

210
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:33,801
Oh, this  bag.
It's a present for the judge.

211
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,967
I want a present!
I want a present!

212
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,273
- You shouldn't lie to him, Dad.
- Okay, okay.

213
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:43,445
I would never give a judge
such a cool present.

214
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,782
Happy  birthday yesterday.
Listen to me, guys.

215
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,345
Everything's gonna  be  better.
I  bought a house.

216
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:52,722
- In Oregon?
- No, in Queens.

217
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,694
- Mommy says we're movin' to Oregon.
- Now you don't have to.

218
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,958
That's why I  bought the house--
so you don't have to move to Oregon.

219
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:00,626
Are you gonna live there with us?

220
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,867
See what the judge says, okay?

221
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,670
The court denies the motion
for joint custody...

222
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,906
and awards sole custody of
the children to their mother.

223
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:12,911
Wait!

224
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,175
Miss Gipson is moving to Oregon
to start a new job.

225
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:18,309
- Weekly visitations are impossi ble.
- So noted.

226
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,877
- File with the court clerk.
- Hold it! Your Honor--

227
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:24,152
Your Honor, I know I'm late,
 but someone hit my car.

228
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:29,253
Now-- See, look here.
This is evidence-- new evidence.

229
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,890
I have a new plan for joint custody.
It's all right here.

230
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,332
Mr. Gipson, you are late,
and the hearing has  been conducted.

231
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,700
- But I had an accident.
- Your Honor, are we free to go?

232
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,830
- I'm not done yet!
- The court ruled, Mr. Gipson.

233
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,601
- But I wasn't here.
- The court ruled.

234
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,604
Valerie, I--
I  bought you a house.

235
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:46,441
- It's too late, Your Honor.
- No, it's not too late!

236
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,846
It's 20 minutes.
It's just 20 minutes.

237
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,384
Twenty minutes can't  be too late.
Valerie, please.

238
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:54,546
Don't let 20 minutes stand in
the way of what I'm trying to do.

239
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,954
- Please don't start.
- Don't talk to him.

240
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,117
Mr. Gipson, would you please
approach the  bench?

241
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,252
- Your Honor, can we leave now?
- Yes.

242
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,057
- Mr. Gipson--
- Valerie, can't we talk?

243
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,064
- Valerie, can we--
- Mr. Gipson.

244
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:08,067
Mr. Gipson, come here for a moment.
Please?

245
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,996
Emotions run high in here.
If this weren't a divorce court...

246
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,735
the way you just yelled
in my courtroom--

247
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,743
- I'm sorry.
- Of course you are.

248
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:20,144
You have children, Mr. Gipson.
Keep them in front of you.

249
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:23,706
I just wanted to tell my wife
I got her a house for the children.

250
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:26,480
- When?
- Well, I have it all right here.

251
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:30,217
That's my plan. I found a house
for Valerie and for the  boys...

252
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,384
and they don't have to move.

253
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,420
This is what I wanted to say.
""Boys need their fathers.

254
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:41,992
The streets of this world are lonely
for  boys without their fathers.

255
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,629
I have made mistakes,
and I have grown...

256
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:48,505
and I have recognized
those mistakes.''

257
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,443
What kind of a house?

258
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:54,072
It's not a  big house,
and it's not in great shape.

259
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:56,082
But I can fix it.
I can make it work.

260
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,642
And there's a space for--

261
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,178
Well, if she'll have me  back,
there's a place for me too.

262
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:06,055
But I'm not asking for that
right now. I'm just asking that...

263
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,789
she not take the  boys and move
halfway across the world.

264
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:12,924
You can arrange visitations. Oregon
is not the other side of the world.

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,492
It is to me!
I want my family. I want my  boys.

266
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,062
I had an accident.
This guy hit me on the FDR.

267
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,338
He cut me off!
I wanted to  be here!

268
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,436
If this was my marriage,
I would've  been here on time.

269
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:30,041
Everyone was here on time,
except you. Next case.

270
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,379
Thank you.

271
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,183
- Docket 718.
- Thanks.

272
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,123
Counselor, step up, please.

273
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,626
- How is everybody today?
- Good morning, Your Honor.

274
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,161
Nice to see you again.

275
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:04,115
It's not gonna help me pay
my phone  bill, my electric  bill.

276
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,449
I'm not making any money sittin'
in court. I'm goin' to court.

277
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,183
I've  been sittin' in court every
day. I'm not making any money.

278
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:08,811
If you and I had gotten caught
before we stopped...

279
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,953
and my wife found out,
and I left the law...

280
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:18,992
and you died in
a horrible accident at sea...

281
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:24,086
I would  be  better off
than I am right now.

282
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,597
What happened?

283
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,435
He wouldn't take a check.

284
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:33,405
He said he wanted to be clean
in all his actions.

285
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,534
- The judge wouldn't take a check?
- The guy.

286
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,599
What guy?

287
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,339
- What day is today?
- Friday.

288
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:42,473
- Actually, it's Good Friday.
- Good Friday.

289
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,074
- What's good about it?
- Gavin, what's going on?

290
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,746
I know what's good about it.

291
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,686
My file's walking down the street.

292
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,732
Hey! Excuse me.

293
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,893
Listen, man, you don't know me.
I know.

294
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,099
And you don't have to  believe me,
 but that was not like me today.

295
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:09,870
And I'm just so grateful,
you know, to God...

296
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:13,106
and right here in front
of the Lord's house.

297
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,740
Come on. Hop in. Get in the car.
Get out of the rain.

298
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,986
My name's Gavin Banek.

299
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:26,488
- Doyle Gipson.
- Hey, listen, Doyle.

300
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,755
That is not what I'm like--
this morning.

301
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,263
That's not who I am.
I mean it. I'm a lawyer.

302
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,890
I should have never left
the scene of an accident.

303
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,799
I should know  better.

304
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,473
My file-- did you fllnd it?

305
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:46,146
I had an orange file.
It was in my  briefcase.

306
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:50,172
I thought may be it fell out
and you picked it up.

307
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,018
Do you have it?
Did you get it?

308
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,685
You said,
""Better luck next time.''

309
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,749
I said, ""Give me a lift.''
You said...

310
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,886
""Better luck next time,''
and just--

311
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:07,527
""Better luck next time''?
I said that?

312
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,865
Listen, sir, please.

313
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:13,395
I have no excuse for my  behavior,
and I am sorry.

314
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:15,567
I don't know what I can do
to make it up to you, except--

315
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:17,544
I will  buy you a new car.

316
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:24,842
Money. You think I want money?

317
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:28,479
What I want is my morning  back.

318
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,786
I need you to give
my time  back to me.

319
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,951
Can you give me  back my time?

320
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:38,020
Can you give my time  back to me?
Huh? Can you?

321
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:41,226
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Whoa! All right!

322
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:44,031
So she won't move to Oregon!
So she won't take the  boys!

323
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,335
So they'll move into the house
so I can  be a father!

324
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,875
Just 20 minutes!
Can you give me that?

325
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:52,377
I wish I could, man.
I wish I could.

326
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:56,582
I wish I could.

327
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,785
Wait a minute!
Wait. Do you have the file?

328
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,346
Doyle, you got the file?

329
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,358
Wait a minute! Doyle!
Wait a minute!

330
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,326
Doyle, do you have the file?

331
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,386
- I'm sorry!
- I don't have your file!

332
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,557
- I threw it away!
- What do you mean?

333
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,567
I threw it away!

334
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,483
- Hey, guys.
- How did it go?

335
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,556
Well, Kaufman did some tap dancing.

336
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:19,058
But once I filed the papers,
what was he gonna do?

337
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:21,293
The guy squeaked like a mouse.

338
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,359
I love it when they squeak.

339
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,735
We have the power of appointment,
so God's on our side.

340
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:34,047
Hey, I'm going over
to Southeast Harbor tomorrow...

341
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,412
to look at a  boat.

342
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:37,609
Hinckley 51 .

343
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,949
Wow. Fifty-one footer, huh?
It's a tough life.

344
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,387
You are not quite ready
for a 51-footer yet.

345
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:45,254
Oh, right.

346
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,759
But as soon as
I take delivery on her...

347
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:51,491
I want you and Cynthia
to have China Bird.

348
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:01,971
- Steven, I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

349
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,341
I'm saying thank you to my partner
and my son-in-law...

350
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,240
and my friend.

351
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,417
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

352
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,788
Thank you.

353
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,019
Thank you.

354
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:27,195
So I have a couple more interviews
I gotta  bang out...

355
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,462
down the hall, so I'm gonna...

356
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,663
go  back down there
and do some work.

357
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,535
Great.

358
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,537
All right, well, so long.

359
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:42,104
- See you.
- All right.

360
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,291
- How are you doing, Kate?
- Hey, Gavin.

361
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:59,796
- So, how'd it go?
- In and out. Easy-peasy.

362
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:04,235
- What kind of people have we here?
- This is Sarah Windsor.

363
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:05,703
Hello. It's a pleasure.

364
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,503
- Tyler Cohen.
- How are you? Who's up first?

365
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:12,545
- Miss Windsor.
- Sarah Windsor, come on down!

366
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,876
Have a seat, please.

367
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,406
- And who are you?
- Sarah Windsor.

368
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:21,921
Not the name tag. Who are you,
as in what have you  been doing?

369
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:24,047
Why do you wanna  be a lawyer?
Why do you wanna work here?

370
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,093
Well, I went to St. Paul's.

371
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,492
I did my undergraduate work at Yale.

372
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:32,054
And now, I'm finishing at Yale Law.

373
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:36,592
I clerked last summer for
the California State Supreme Court.

374
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,436
I chose law  because my father was
district attorney of San Francisco.

375
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:41,439
Really?

376
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:43,601
I've always  been interested
in the law and politics...

377
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:47,306
and I was an economics major.

378
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,280
This firm is particularly strong...

379
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,182
in municipal finance law
and public policy...

380
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:57,781
which is the area
I'm hoping to explore.

381
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:00,019
Although, I gotta tell you...

382
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:02,459
I do have an eye on public service.

383
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,890
I know how much this firm
supports pro bono work...

384
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:09,834
and I'd love to help on a
death penalty defense for the poor.

385
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:18,606
Why didn't I just
give him my insurance card?

386
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,305
I'm sorry?

387
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,214
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

388
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,877
Excuse me. Gavin?

389
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,012
This really weird fax
Just came in.

390
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,717
- I think you should look at it.
- Okay. Thank you.

391
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,792
Do you know what it means?

392
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:47,573
Michelle, I gotta talk to you.

393
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,438
Just a second.
What the hell--

394
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,272
Read this!

395
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:54,336
It's from the file.
He's got the file.

396
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,345
Help me.

397
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,238
Can I have a...

398
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,075
-  bourbon, straight up?
- Sure.

399
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:47,599
Can I have a twist, please?

400
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:02,646
I'm not a partner here.

401
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,310
That actually doesn't  bother me.

402
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,479
Partners have to  bring in  business.
I just gotta do my job.

403
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:10,489
If I don't like it here,
I can leave.

404
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:15,258
- What's not to like?
- Watching you  become one of them.

405
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,532
I always thought you were cutting
a pretty  big corner...

406
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,627
 by convincing a dying old man
to sign a power of appointment.

407
00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:27,264
- It wasn't like that.
- Are you sure it wasn't like that?

408
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,433
Of course I'm sure.

409
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:37,542
What?

410
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:42,885
He was in pretty  bad shape
when I went to see him.

411
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:45,356
I mean, it was--
May be he didn't--

412
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,290
May be?

413
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,626
-May be he didn't understand exactly.
-Didn't understand exactly?

414
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:54,223
He didn't know exactly
what he was signing.

415
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,667
Walter and Steven said that...

416
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:01,639
Simon put too much faith
in his friends, and...

417
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,303
the  board was in his pocket, and
it was  better for the foundation...

418
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:07,573
if we could just help
control and manage the money.

419
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:09,672
Delano said that?

420
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:11,257
- Doesn't that sound reasonable?
- What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:12,019
- Doesn't that sound reasonable?
- What's that supposed to mean?

422
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:14,525
That means that
without this file...

423
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:18,030
you'll  be in more trouble than
your father-in-law and his partner.

424
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,793
You're the attorney of record.

425
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,301
You could actually
go to jail for this.

426
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,132
You need that file.

427
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:27,939
What am I gonna do?

428
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,572
There's this guy.

429
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:43,454
He helps out
with things that need...

430
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:44,717
helping out.

431
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,853
Like what?

432
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:51,628
Like things. Like...

433
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:53,757
getting people to do things
you want them to do...

434
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:57,564
when they don't necessarily
want to do them.

435
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,171
Where is he?

436
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,549
I need help.

437
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,380
Did you really  believe
that it served Simon Dunne...

438
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:15,614
to sign those papers when
he was too weak to read them?

439
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:18,020
I wouldn't have done it otherwise.
Yes.

440
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:23,460
- Yes, I did.
- Do you want what's right?

441
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,622
Of course I do.

442
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:30,135
And what's right is your job,
your wife...

443
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,534
your life?

444
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:44,876
Where is he?

445
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,428
Don't go anywhere.

446
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:59,329
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going out.

447
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,798
I'm in a  bar.

448
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,563
You want company?

449
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:12,076
That champagne feeling
gave you a hangover.

450
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:15,780
Are you drinking?

451
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,016
What happened in court today?

452
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,324
I'm in a  bar.
What's that tell you?

453
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:34,696
It tells me that you're really
angry, and that anger...

454
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:37,634
has gotten you into the one place
in the world you shouldn't be.

455
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:43,671
Come on.
Leave that  bar.

456
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,447
Come on.
Leave the  bar.

457
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:54,518
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:32,747
Can I have a Coke, please?

459
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,792
Come on in.

460
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,997
Look, you tell Roberta...

461
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:50,099
that I said one cookie
 before lunch is okay.

462
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:53,145
Get  better.

463
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:55,544
- Mr. Banek.
- Are you Mr. Finch?

464
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,549
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

465
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,478
- You look nervous.
- Yeah, a little  bit.

466
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:05,683
Don't  be.
Have a seat.

467
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:11,019
Who's your God?

468
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:14,430
- Now, or hall of fame?
- Whenever.

469
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,095
Well, I'd say it's the guy
who did the Volkswagen ad.

470
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,365
The one where the cop is giving the
speeding ticket to a guy in a Bug.

471
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:22,373
Classic.

472
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,932
Doyle Gipson.

473
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,945
Shouldn't have told you
he was in insurance.

474
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,981
Makes it too easy.
I tell my clients...

475
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:32,279
""Never tell anyone anything
a bout yourself.''

476
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:37,289
Yeah. Here's his
state insurance license.

477
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:39,916
And that gives me
his social security number...

478
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:44,224
which gives me everything.

479
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:46,231
- You don't fucking know.
- I do know.

480
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,926
- It's the one with the little kids.
- The little kids, yeah.

481
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,628
He's sittin' around, you know.

482
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:53,399
I don't know what he is.
Like, an Indian kid?

483
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,600
Cute little  black kid.
Like, ""I'm Tiger Woods.''

484
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,268
""I'm Tiger Woods.''

485
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:03,143
You had a fender  bender,
and the other guy's going postal.

486
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:06,616
- That's not the way to do things.
- I don't wanna kill any body, you know?

487
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:11,420
I've just...

488
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,618
never done this kind
of thing  before.

489
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:16,924
What kind of thing is that?

490
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,930
I just want my file back, you know.

491
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,796
You'll get your file back.

492
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:27,828
How, exactly?

493
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:30,705
It's like the dog collar that
gives a little electric shock...

494
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:33,244
when the dog  barks.

495
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:37,339
You don't kill the dog. You just
want the dog to settle down.

496
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:41,618
Now we're torturing an animal?
I mean--

497
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:44,719
We're all set.
May I?

498
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:52,363
Is there any other way to--

499
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,126
Well, sure.

500
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,464
Call him up
and just  be nice to him.

501
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,534
All right, do it.

502
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:07,644
- Are you guys in advertising?
- Yeah. You too?

503
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:11,274
No. But--

504
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,945
I hope you don't mind,  but I was
intrigued  by your conversation.

505
00:36:15,021 --> 00:36:17,717
I just thought
you were in advertising.

506
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,659
I wanna give you my dream version
of a Tiger Woods commercial, okay?

507
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:27,357
- By all means.
- Go ahead.

508
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:30,925
There's this  black guy
on a golf course.

509
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,164
And all these people are trying
to get him to caddy for them...

510
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,174
 but he's not a caddy.

511
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:38,369
He's just a guy trying
to play a round of golf.

512
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:42,742
Then these guys give him
a five-dollar  bill...

513
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:46,649
and tell him to go to the clubhouse
and get 'em cigarettes and beer.

514
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,356
So off he goes, home...

515
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:54,819
to his wife and little son...

516
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:57,692
who he teaches to play golf.

517
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,697
We see all the other little  boys
playing hopscotch...

518
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:02,461
while little Tiger practices
on the putting green.

519
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,867
We see all the other kids
eating ice cream...

520
00:37:04,937 --> 00:37:07,963
while Tiger practices hitting
long  balls in the rain...

521
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,576
while his father shows him how.

522
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,836
And we fade up...

523
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,780
to Tiger winning
four grand slams in a row...

524
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,616
and becoming the greatest golfer
to ever to pick up a nine iron.

525
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:26,481
And we end on his father...

526
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:29,049
in the crowd on the sidelines...

527
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:31,619
and Tiger giving him the trophies.

528
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:37,561
All  because of
a father's determination...

529
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:42,664
that no fat white man--
like your fathers, probably--

530
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:47,270
would ever send his son
to the clubhouse...

531
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:50,474
for cigarettes and  beer.

532
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,849
I'm sorry.
What did you say about our fathers?

533
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:07,896
- You  better go.
- Mr. Doyle Gipson.

534
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:10,696
You is now  bankrupt.

535
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,431
And you owe me $5,000.

536
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,212
- Come on.
- Where'd he go?

537
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,918
Where is he?

538
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:35,926
- Hello?
- It's me.

539
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,554
- So you really bought a house?
- Yeah.

540
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,121
- Wanna play a round of golf?
- Really? You actually own it?

541
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,397
It's not a mansion on the hill.

542
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:47,905
It needs a lot of work,
 but it'd  be yours.

543
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,941
- It'd  be your house.
- Here we go!

544
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:53,239
- Gonna hit the  ball!
- Oh, God.

545
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:56,372
What? This line's going dead.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

546
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:58,780
Obviously, it would be better for
the boys to be near their father.

547
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,308
- What?
- To have you nearby.

548
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,116
- What?
- No, we didn't like it.

549
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,714
- I'll call you  back.
- Talkin' to your daddy?

550
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:13,564
- Oh, God! You hit me!
- I'll hit you again! You like it?

551
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,631
Mister, please!

552
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:22,833
- I got kids, man!
- Yeah? Well, so do I!

553
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:33,444
Doyle Gipson.
This is Gavin Banek calling.

554
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,816
I have something that
I wanna tell you.

555
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:37,946
First of all,
I wanted to shake hands, all right?

556
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:40,617
I wanted to start over.
I gave you a chance.

557
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:43,126
And you did this. Fine.

558
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:45,789
I have just turned off your credit.

559
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:50,528
You are now a spirit
without a body, all right?

560
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:52,229
Now, I can go on and on...

561
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:55,933
pulling your llfe down
around your ears.

562
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:59,307
You can turn it off. You can
go  back to the way things were.

563
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:02,347
Just give me my file  back!
Just-- Today.

564
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,511
I mean,just--
I mean-- Thank you.

565
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:10,544
Give me my file back, get the credit
turned back on. Okay? Today.

566
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,055
Thank you.

567
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:25,499
- Has he phoned yet?
- Not yet.

568
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:34,036
- Look at this.
- What?

569
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:36,046
- What is it?
- It's the life of Doyle Gipson.

570
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,674
His whole life.

571
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,980
We have his  bank...

572
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:44,511
his wife, kids--
two  boys, Danny and Steve--

573
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:48,753
their  birth dates, the school
they go to, credit card  balances...

574
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,454
health records.

575
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:53,396
His cholesterol is high,
 but his blood pressure is normal.

576
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,865
I'm 29 years old.

577
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:59,563
That foundation has
107 million dollars in it.

578
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:01,572
My  bosses are the trustees.

579
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:06,573
So why didn't they
come to court with me?

580
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:10,339
I don't know.
Mina Dunne hates me.

581
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:13,441
I assume there's a reason. Why
am I always the last guy to know?

582
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:18,789
What's in those files
that I haven't seen?

583
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:39,105
- Can you get me a messenger?
- What for?

584
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:46,049
I found something. I wanna give it
 back to the person it  belongs to.

585
00:41:46,118 --> 00:41:48,712
Is there a reward or something?

586
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:52,982
- Yeah.
- What is it?

587
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:54,992
Doing the right thing--
giving it  back.

588
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,823
- That's it?
- That's it.

589
00:41:56,895 --> 00:42:00,160
- That's the reward.
- How about that?

590
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,164
Yeah, how a bout that?

591
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:18,249
Mr. Gipson, it's Ron Cabot
at Queen's Royal Federal.

592
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:22,309
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

593
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:24,321
If you can give me
a call today...

594
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:28,325
or if it's convenient to stop by
the bank, I'd appreciate it.

595
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:31,419
- Thank you.
- Doyle Gipson.

596
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:34,192
This is Gavin Banek calling.

597
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,632
I have something that
I wanna tell you.

598
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:41,138
I lied to you this morning.

599
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:45,368
On my way to the court,
I stopped off at a diner.

600
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:47,605
I took the files out,
I looked them over.

601
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,045
When I was leaving,
I put them  back.

602
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:52,049
At least, I could've sworn
I put them  back.

603
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:54,677
When I got to the court, the
power of appointment was missing.

604
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:57,847
And the court has given me
until the end of the day...

605
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,857
- to produce the original.
- Did you call the diner?

606
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:03,383
I did. All the trash has been
picked up,  but we're tracking it.

607
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:06,329
I think we'll probably get it back.
I just wanted you to know.

608
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:09,629
Why did you lie to us?

609
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:12,863
I'm really sorry.

610
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:15,939
You're sorry?

611
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,567
Who the fuck gives a shit about
the struggles of your character?

612
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:20,270
Get out of here,
you son of a  bitch!

613
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:22,575
If you have to go through every
fuckin' gar bage  bag in this city...

614
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:25,548
you fllnd that file, or you're gonna
 be the disaster of my life!

615
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:27,642
Wait a minute.
We might get the file  back.

616
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,949
But if we don't, we have
to adopt a strong position.

617
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:32,251
- I need to see those files.
- You're not gonna see the files!

618
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:34,656
- Why do you wanna see the files?
- Who not? He's my goddamn client!

619
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:37,058
Hey, what are you gonna do?
Give me a lecture on law?

620
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,824
Why did you send me to the court
 by myself? I'm your son-in-law!

621
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:41,798
- I hired you, you little shit!
- Steven, calm down!

622
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,858
- Quiet, please.
- What are you doing?

623
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,869
- There's a way out of this.
- What are you doing?

624
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,073
A way out? By letting him
 bring the files into court?

625
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,872
Calm down and stay with me here.
Okay.

626
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:56,675
We had a signed document,
right? Didn't we?

627
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:58,739
- Yes.
- Okay. Now.

628
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:01,115
The power of appointment...

629
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:03,381
is eight pages.

630
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,731
The living will, which also has
his signature, is ten.

631
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:08,358
The living will, which also has
his signature, is ten.

632
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:12,595
So we can reformat
the power of appointment...

633
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,039
and using the signature page
from the living will...

634
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:20,168
attach it to the new printout
of the power of appointment.

635
00:44:20,245 --> 00:44:23,942
And code the header
to match the document.

636
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,711
- What do you think? Will it pass?
- Yeah, this could work.

637
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:31,279
I didn't ask you, all right?
Gavin, will it pass?

638
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:32,948
We forge it?

639
00:44:33,024 --> 00:44:34,992
We just forge a document?

640
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:37,027
You screwed this up.
You lost the fuckin' file.

641
00:44:37,095 --> 00:44:39,063
No body's asking you
to get yourself out of it alone.

642
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,496
We're willing to put ourselves
on the line for you with this.

643
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,659
Making a file is fraud.

644
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:46,465
A new file is fraud.
Do you understand that?

645
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:50,572
And we're saying we're gonna put
our own careers on the line for you.

646
00:44:50,642 --> 00:44:52,576
That's what it means
to  be a partner.

647
00:44:52,644 --> 00:44:54,839
We're not inventing. We're not.
We're not inventing.

648
00:44:54,913 --> 00:44:56,972
We're just reproducing something
that already exists.

649
00:44:57,048 --> 00:45:00,108
Look, Gavin, you take this
into the court...

650
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:03,518
and,  buddy,
we can go on with our lives...

651
00:45:03,588 --> 00:45:06,557
like this never happened, huh?

652
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:11,320
- Let me think about it.
- What are you gonna think about?

653
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:13,956
Your high school ethics class?

654
00:45:14,032 --> 00:45:15,966
What choice have you got?

655
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:18,802
You wanna go to jail?

656
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:29,504
No, I don't wanna go to jail.

657
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:37,808
Get out of here!
Leave it!

658
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,908
Leave it! Go!
Leave!

659
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,246
What does it say?

660
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,846
It says they pay themselves
a million and a half dollars...

661
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:54,824
each, out of the trust.

662
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:57,656
Out of the income of the trust.
Jesus Christ!

663
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:00,596
Which is why they got rid of Mina
Dunne and the rest of the  board.

664
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:04,123
- It's probably not even illegal.
- It's probably just disgusting.

665
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,094
I did this.

666
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:10,163
- I did this.
- No, you didn't.

667
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,675
- I did this.
- No, you did not.

668
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,749
What do I do?

669
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:26,051
You give me the file,
and I'll take it  back.

670
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,751
- Take it  back?
- What?

671
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:30,225
You didn't know
who these people were?

672
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:32,228
You married into it.

673
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:42,737
Since  breakfast, I've left
the scene of an accident...

674
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:45,367
I just  bankrupted a guy
I don't even know...

675
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:47,377
lied to my  bosses...

676
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:50,806
pulled a false alarm at work...

677
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:55,577
discovered I'm a party
to defrauding a charity.

678
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,123
And now I'm sitting here...

679
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:04,650
seriously contemplating forging
a power of appointment.

680
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:50,933
Hey, mister!
Mister, hold out your hand.

681
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:54,500
- What?
- Hold out your hand.

682
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:56,444
How many hands you got?

683
00:49:56,514 --> 00:49:58,209
Two.

684
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:03,309
Thanks.

685
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:06,030
- Oh, God.
- It's the file.

686
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:09,565
Shit!

687
00:50:11,669 --> 00:50:14,570
- Wait. No, look, it's--
- It's not the power of appointment.

688
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:17,766
- It's a notice to appear in court.
- Where's the kid?

689
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,069
Look at this.

690
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,581
It's a phone number.

691
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:30,980
- Who's that you're with?
- Is that your  business?

692
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,888
- Is she your secretary?
- No, she's a lawyer.

693
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,892
- Not your wife?
- No.

694
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,629
Guy Ieaves the scene
of an accident.

695
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:42,564
- Guy cheats on his wife.
- Can I have my file  back, please?

696
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:44,567
It'll take me half an hour
to get to my  bank.

697
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:48,765
If my credit's not on by the time
I get there, I destroy the flle.

698
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,329
- That's the deal.
- Okay.

699
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,500
Understood. Okay.

700
00:50:57,915 --> 00:51:00,042
- That was pretty fast, huh?
- It was great.

701
00:51:00,117 --> 00:51:03,712
Listen, I need you to turn it  back
on as fast as you turned it off.

702
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:06,085
Amazing, wasn't it?
Two hours!

703
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:07,748
- Two hours!
- Yes, it was great.

704
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:09,759
It was terrifllc. I need you
to turn it  back on right now.

705
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:12,261
Thirty minutes, okay?
Can you do that?

706
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:14,297
That's a llttIe harder.

707
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:16,299
Please, man.
Don't tell me that.

708
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:19,268
Please, do something.
Do something for me here.

709
00:51:19,336 --> 00:51:21,463
You gotta do something, man.

710
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,005
I'll do my  best.

711
00:51:30,514 --> 00:51:32,038
- Hey,  ba be, how's it going?
- I need to see you.

712
00:51:32,116 --> 00:51:34,482
Well, it's not a--
a great time right now.

713
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,542
- I need to see you right now.
- Is something wrong?

714
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,487
I just need to see you.
Meet me at Refugio's in ten minutes.

715
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:41,217
- I'll be right there.
- Don't be Iate.

716
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:43,122
- Okay, fllne.
- Okay, honey, thanks.

717
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,660
All right.

718
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,901
I gotta-- I gotta go.

719
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:57,873
Okay? I'll see you in a  bit.

720
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:48,047
You're gonna tell me my credit's off
and I can't get the loan approved.

721
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,625
- Right.
- Check it.

722
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:54,220
Well, right here.

723
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:00,803
Well, that was strange.
You're right. Your credit's  back on.

724
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:02,304
So?

725
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:06,941
Oh, this is so weird.

726
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:11,140
There you go. That's what I thought.
I knew I saw that.

727
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:12,807
I knew it.

728
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:17,548
- I can't help you.
- What do you mean?

729
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:19,452
- You just saw.
- There's still a problem.

730
00:53:19,523 --> 00:53:22,321
No, no, no.
It's all taken care of.

731
00:53:22,392 --> 00:53:25,384
It's all  been solved.
Look in the computer.

732
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:27,396
It says you're  bankrupt.

733
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:34,794
This is a mistake.

734
00:53:34,872 --> 00:53:36,271
If it is a mistake...

735
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,808
then clearing it up shouldn't
take more than three months.

736
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:50,650
Ron, I've  been having a  bit
of a tussle today with someone.

737
00:53:50,721 --> 00:53:53,952
It doesn't matter who.
But what does matter...

738
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,958
is that he got into my records.

739
00:53:56,026 --> 00:53:58,256
I don't know how,
and that doesn't matter either.

740
00:53:58,328 --> 00:54:01,161
- It's true,  but--
- You've seen what he did.

741
00:54:01,231 --> 00:54:04,166
He's got some kind
of a computer voodoo.

742
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:08,170
I don't know,
 but he's got it, doesn't he?

743
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:11,097
Someone sure
caused you some trou ble.

744
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:18,441
I need this loan, Ron.

745
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:20,710
I need it for my life.

746
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:25,153
Now, nothing has changed
 between yesterday and today.

747
00:54:25,222 --> 00:54:27,918
I'm still the same guy.
I wasn't  bankrupt yesterday...

748
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,459
and I'm not  bankrupt today!

749
00:54:32,663 --> 00:54:34,790
I'm sorry, Mr. Gipson.

750
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:37,026
The computer says you are.

751
00:54:48,312 --> 00:54:50,212
Now it doesn't!

752
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:09,723
Are you okay?

753
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:13,868
What's wrong?

754
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:21,502
Did you know that my father
had a mistress for 20 years?

755
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:26,515
Don't lie.

756
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:32,755
I didn't know it was 20 years.

757
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,793
My mother knew about it.

758
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:40,188
Why didn't she leave him?

759
00:55:40,264 --> 00:55:42,198
Because she loved him so much.

760
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:47,127
She decided it'd  be hypocritical to
leave a man for cheating at home...

761
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:50,139
when the expensive life
she enjoyed so much...

762
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:54,769
was paid for by a man whose job
was based on finding ways to cheat.

763
00:55:55,946 --> 00:55:57,880
Is that your opinion of the law?

764
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:01,840
What do you think
the law is, Gav...

765
00:56:01,919 --> 00:56:04,319
at this level of the game,
at my father's level of the game...

766
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:07,289
at your level of the game?

767
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:10,588
It is a big, vicious rumble, Gavin.

768
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:14,063
The people who founded
this law firm...

769
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:17,589
and the people who sustain it...

770
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:19,932
understand the way the world works.

771
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:25,297
If you wanna continue to live
the way we've been living--

772
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,309
You have to steal.

773
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,814
I could've married an honest man.

774
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:38,178
I could've lived
with a professor of...

775
00:56:38,255 --> 00:56:41,747
Middle English, for example...

776
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:44,521
if he was a moral man
and had tenure at Princeton.

777
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:48,126
But I didn't.

778
00:56:48,198 --> 00:56:50,962
I married a Wall Street lawyer.

779
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:53,229
Which means I married someone
who lives in a world...

780
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:57,034
where when a man comes to the edge
of things, he has to commit...

781
00:56:57,107 --> 00:57:00,474
to staying there and living there.

782
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:02,409
Can you live there, Gavin?

783
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:06,509
Can you live there with me?

784
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:14,240
You're not gonna do
anything stupid like leaving me.

785
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:17,775
You've had fantasies, I'm sure.
So have I.

786
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:19,446
But we're married.

787
00:57:21,658 --> 00:57:23,285
I knew about Michelle.

788
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,159
I knew when it was happening,
and I knew when it was finished.

789
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:32,567
And I know you love me.

790
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,770
You do love me,
and I love you too.

791
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:41,938
I'm your wife,
and I wanna stand beside you.

792
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,853
Just let me help you, Gavin.

793
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:55,857
Let me help you with this.

794
00:58:01,831 --> 00:58:04,493
What do you want me to do?

795
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,936
Take the signature page from
the living will and attach it...

796
00:58:10,006 --> 00:58:13,066
to the newly formatted copy
of the power of appointment.

797
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:18,274
Bring it to the courthouse,
and then meet me for dinner tonight.

798
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:21,641
We're going out
with Karen and Carl.

799
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,920
I forgot about Karen and Carl.

800
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:34,429
And I remembered.

801
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:38,466
We're a team, Gav.

802
00:58:38,534 --> 00:58:39,967
We're partners.

803
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:16,029
- Deal's a deal.
- The credit's back on?

804
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:18,539
- I used my MasterCard just now.
- Sir, we don't allow cell phones.

805
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:21,236
That was fast.
Okay, one second.

806
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,301
They turned my credit  back on.
Now I owe you something.

807
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:25,870
Thank God you did not
throw that away this morning.

808
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:28,644
- So how you wanna do this?
- One second.

809
00:59:28,718 --> 00:59:31,380
- You wanna come to my offllce?
- No.

810
00:59:31,454 --> 00:59:33,422
- Why not?
- You got your car?

811
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:36,014
- It's at the office, yeah.
- How about the courthouse?

812
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:37,992
You do have to turn this thing in,
don't you?

813
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:41,258
- Right.
- See, I'm thinking about you.

814
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,560
Okay, listen, Doyle--

815
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:47,399
Look, please. You aren't gonna
get all soft on me, are you?

816
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:51,566
I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, and I just--

817
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:54,371
I'm just glad this thing is over.

818
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:30,879
Don't get too close.

819
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:40,648
Hey, my hero.

820
01:00:40,723 --> 01:00:42,748
My champion.
It's all over.

821
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,486
He called me.
He's giving me  back the file.

822
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,619
Really?

823
01:00:46,696 --> 01:00:49,256
- What do you mean?
- Because there's--

824
01:00:49,332 --> 01:00:51,596
- There's one thing I couldn't do.
- What couldn't you do?

825
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:59,631
This damn bankruptcy
has a llfe of its own.

826
01:01:01,811 --> 01:01:03,745
What couldn't you do?

827
01:01:03,813 --> 01:01:06,976
I couldn't undo the bankruptcy.

828
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:08,482
Sorry.

829
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:14,414
Shit.

830
01:02:59,428 --> 01:03:01,862
Are you drunk?

831
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,233
Are you sure?

832
01:03:08,504 --> 01:03:10,096
Yes, I'm sure.

833
01:03:32,595 --> 01:03:34,028
It's nice.

834
01:03:45,908 --> 01:03:48,433
Show me the house.

835
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:06,691
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

836
01:04:08,164 --> 01:04:09,688
Come

837
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:14,361
Let us worship

838
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:19,461
This is the wood of the cross

839
01:04:19,461 --> 01:04:20,393
This is the wood of the cross

840
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:26,526
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

841
01:04:26,602 --> 01:04:28,832
Come

842
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:32,567
Let us worship

843
01:04:50,993 --> 01:04:53,052
Do you know why
I took the job in Oregon?

844
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:58,732
To...

845
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:05,871
get as far away from me
as possible.

846
01:05:09,177 --> 01:05:11,907
I looked at a lot of cities, and...

847
01:05:13,015 --> 01:05:14,448
Portland...

848
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:19,811
has thousands of nice, dull,
 bearded guys.

849
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:24,382
And I thought, you know,
guys like this just--

850
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:28,057
Guys.

851
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,394
I could find one.

852
01:05:30,465 --> 01:05:33,628
A better version of you, Doyle.

853
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:36,762
A version of you,
 but a  better version of you.

854
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:38,430
What I always...

855
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:44,670
wanted you to  be,
and what you were for a little...

856
01:05:44,746 --> 01:05:46,680
when I met you.

857
01:05:52,988 --> 01:05:55,718
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

858
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,986
I don't-- It's all right.
I don't want confession.

859
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,029
I just-- All the seats
were full out there...

860
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:04,964
so I came in here
Just to listen to the song.

861
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:06,967
There's some seats up front.
I'll show you.

862
01:06:07,035 --> 01:06:09,196
I don't want that.
Thank you.

863
01:06:13,642 --> 01:06:15,200
Are you a Catholic?

864
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:24,448
It's  beautiful.

865
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:27,010
No, it's not.

866
01:06:27,089 --> 01:06:28,716
But it could've  been.

867
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,618
I don't know
what's gonna happen,  but...

868
01:06:34,296 --> 01:06:36,491
I don't  blame you
for wanting to leave.

869
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:40,727
Oregon.

870
01:06:42,571 --> 01:06:45,472
The  boys...

871
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,474
it'll  be good for them.

872
01:06:49,778 --> 01:06:52,508
I know how hard it must  be
for you to say that.

873
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,656
I'm sorry I was late today.

874
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,717
We should've waited.

875
01:07:06,495 --> 01:07:08,656
I came here for some meaning.
I'm trying--

876
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,756
I want you to give the world
meaning to me.

877
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:14,427
Why does the world need meaning?

878
01:07:14,503 --> 01:07:16,095
Why does the--

879
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,807
Because the world's a sewer.

880
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:23,106
Because the world's a shithole
and a gar bage dump.

881
01:07:23,178 --> 01:07:27,114
Because my father-in-law
got me to screw a good man...

882
01:07:27,182 --> 01:07:30,015
a decent man,
out of his money.

883
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:32,417
And my wife cheers me on.

884
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:35,320
Because I got into a fender  bender
with this guy on the FDR.

885
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,553
I had a flight with him. I tried
to do everything to settle it.

886
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:42,563
- But this guy just won't let it go.
- Why?

887
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:44,826
- Why wouldn't he let it go?
- I don't know why!

888
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,128
I don't know why.

889
01:07:46,201 --> 01:07:51,468
Sometimes, God likes to put two guys
in a paper  bag and just let 'em rip.

890
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:01,848
Thank you.

891
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,015
Thank you for letting us go.

892
01:08:28,276 --> 01:08:30,301
Are you saying
he's a threat to his chlldren?

893
01:08:30,378 --> 01:08:33,541
He's told friends that
if his ex-wife got custody...

894
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:36,413
he would kidnap his sons
and take them out of this country.

895
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:38,316
- And she got custody?
- We were in court this morning.

896
01:08:38,386 --> 01:08:40,320
I don't know for a fact
that he's coming here,  but--

897
01:08:40,388 --> 01:08:44,586
- Doyle Gipson? Really?
- Really. What does that mean?

898
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:47,423
He comes to every play they're in,
all the teacher conferences.

899
01:08:47,496 --> 01:08:50,761
So a guy comes to a school play,
you trust him?

900
01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:55,667
Doyle Gipson is a man
of no honor at all!

901
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,230
A low man.

902
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:01,935
But that's okay,  because
no body else has any honor either.

903
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:04,376
That's what makes life
so hard for people--

904
01:09:04,446 --> 01:09:06,414
is that we're taught
this fairy tale.

905
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:09,473
The good and well,
and the  bad and poorly.

906
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:12,520
- Do you  believe that?
- I'd like to.

907
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:16,284
He's coming here.
Be ready for him.

908
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:28,064
Is he in?

909
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:31,071
Hello. Is he there?

910
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:36,335
Well, I just need
to leave a message for him.

911
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:39,403
I'm calling from
his children's school.

912
01:09:41,116 --> 01:09:43,584
Yeah. I'm afraid
there's  been an accident.

913
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:23,556
- How are my sons?
- Who are your sons?

914
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,526
Danny and Steven Gipson. I received
a call that said they were hurt.

915
01:10:26,595 --> 01:10:29,086
- Danny and Steven Gipson?
- I haven't heard anything.

916
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:31,098
I wanna see my sons!

917
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,964
- Mr. Gipson--
- Miss Miller, how are the  boys?

918
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:37,027
I think you should leave
 before we call the police.

919
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:41,704
Mr. Gipson,
don't make me call the police.

920
01:10:44,045 --> 01:10:47,640
- So, they're fine?
- Yes, your  boys are fine.

921
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:50,446
- And all of this is just a mistake?
- Yes.

922
01:10:55,257 --> 01:10:56,690
I'm sorry.

923
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:13,311
Call the police.

924
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:15,975
Daniel Gipson! Stevie Gipson!
Can you hear me?

925
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:19,848
- Can you hear me?
- Call their mother.

926
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:22,719
- Gipson  boys, where are you?
- Daddy!

927
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:25,156
- Come  back here.
- Daddy!

928
01:11:31,232 --> 01:11:35,328
Get off me!
Get off-- Danny! Stevie!

929
01:11:38,005 --> 01:11:40,371
- Daddy! No!
- Calm down!

930
01:11:47,849 --> 01:11:51,580
They said you were hurt!
You haven't  been hurt or sick today?

931
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:55,783
We're gonna pick you up
nice and slowly.

932
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:57,586
- All right? Got it?
- Okay.

933
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:01,458
- Don't hurt my dad! Please!
- Okay, let's go. Up.

934
01:12:02,597 --> 01:12:03,791
Nice and easy.

935
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:08,234
Come on.

936
01:12:15,476 --> 01:12:17,239
See that?
I tried to make peace with you.

937
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:29,089
You know what I can do to you
for trying to kill me?

938
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:31,648
You know who I am?
You know who I am?

939
01:12:31,726 --> 01:12:34,923
You see what I can do to you?
You try to kill me?

940
01:12:34,996 --> 01:12:37,556
Motherfucker.
What's up now?

941
01:12:51,345 --> 01:12:52,778
Shit.

942
01:13:19,774 --> 01:13:21,708
Empty your pockets, sir.

943
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:26,779
Keys.

944
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,349
Change.

945
01:13:30,418 --> 01:13:32,886
Wallet. Pager.

946
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:39,959
File.

947
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:48,634
Hey, how you doing?
I'm looking for a Ron Ca bot.

948
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:51,171
- Count your money, sir.
- What?

949
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,831
Count your money.

950
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:58,509
Mr. Cabot,
I am Doyle Gipson's attorney.

951
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:01,605
I don't wanna talk about him. Since
we're closing, I don't have to.

952
01:14:01,682 --> 01:14:04,173
I understand that. Mr. Ca bot,
I just need you to help me--

953
01:14:07,922 --> 01:14:09,184
Seventy-seven dollars.

954
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:11,384
I'm asking you to try
to help me help Doyle here.

955
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:12,585
He needs it.

956
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,890
He has had about
the worst day of his life.

957
01:14:14,962 --> 01:14:18,728
He had this credit problem that was
not his fault. It was caused  by--

958
01:14:18,799 --> 01:14:21,597
Someone who hacked away
into his records. I know.

959
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:24,502
How can we get this whole thing
straightened out? What can I do?

960
01:14:24,572 --> 01:14:25,732
Nothing.

961
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:37,073
Okay. Mr. Ca bot.

962
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:42,789
Ron, let's try this
another way, okay?

963
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:46,054
Let's say there's a different man.
You don't know this guy.

964
01:14:46,127 --> 01:14:48,925
And he has some credit problems
that are his fault.

965
01:14:48,996 --> 01:14:51,055
And then another man--
you don't know him--

966
01:14:51,132 --> 01:14:53,532
he wants to help
the fllrst guy, okay?

967
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:57,765
Now, what does he have to do to help
the second guy take out a loan?

968
01:14:57,838 --> 01:15:01,399
Come on. What do I do? Just cosign?
What's the thing? What's the deal?

969
01:15:01,475 --> 01:15:03,409
Can you please tell me
what I gotta do.

970
01:15:03,477 --> 01:15:05,809
I'm asking you what I have to do
to make this thing work.

971
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:11,048
You know this has nothing
to do with you. It's this guy.

972
01:15:11,118 --> 01:15:14,451
- He's  been at me all day.
- Some body you're fighting with?

973
01:15:14,522 --> 01:15:16,615
You had a fight with some body
who hit your car...

974
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:18,716
and then you spent the day
in some kind of  battle with him.

975
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:21,489
Then he went to the school
to hurt you as hard as he could.

976
01:15:21,562 --> 01:15:24,497
You  believe me?
Thank God. Thank God.

977
01:15:24,565 --> 01:15:26,829
This guy, this lawyer,
Gavin Banek--

978
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:29,665
Doyle, stop! Stop, Doyle!
I don't care.

979
01:15:29,737 --> 01:15:32,069
Whatever this little drama
you've gotten yourself into...

980
01:15:32,139 --> 01:15:35,199
it's just the kind of thing
that always happens to you.

981
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:38,439
And it never happens to me unless
I am in your field of gravity.

982
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:41,811
You went crazy like you always do,
like you always will go crazy.

983
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:44,407
Drunk or sober, it doesn't matter,
'cause that's you.

984
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:47,683
A person can  be loving...

985
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:49,689
and a person can  be crazy
all at once.

986
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:53,352
That's life. But this is not
Just my life now or yours.

987
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:55,952
It is the life
of two children...

988
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:58,021
and I have to protect
those two children.

989
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:01,159
Is that a misunderstanding?
Is it?

990
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:03,795
Is it, Doyle? I mean,
is that this guy's fault?

991
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,374
At least let me say
good- bye to them.

992
01:16:10,544 --> 01:16:12,808
I'm takin' those  boys away,
and you will never see them again.

993
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,782
You will never find us. Do not try
to come after us. Do you hear me?

994
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:18,648
It is over!

995
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:08,063
- Where's Ellen?
- She went home.

996
01:17:08,135 --> 01:17:10,365
Why are you still here?

997
01:17:11,572 --> 01:17:13,665
You told me to wait.

998
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:20,921
Well, come on in.

999
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,452
Have a seat.

1000
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:40,063
- So why do you wanna  be a lawyer?
- I  believe in the law.

1001
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,836
I  believe in order and justice.

1002
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,004
I  believe that people are,
 by nature, good.

1003
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,846
I  believe that historical forces
push us into conflict...

1004
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:53,478
and without the law
as a  buffer  between people...

1005
01:17:53,554 --> 01:17:56,648
we would have
a world of vendetta...

1006
01:17:56,724 --> 01:17:58,885
a world of violence,
a world of chaos.

1007
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:04,260
The law--
The law keeps us civilized.

1008
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:07,266
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's--

1009
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:11,669
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's funny.

1010
01:18:11,739 --> 01:18:14,537
That's why I am gonna
give you this job.

1011
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:21,004
Because I wanna hear what
you have to say about the law...

1012
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,549
after you've worked here
for five years...

1013
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:26,586
or three years, or a month...

1014
01:18:26,653 --> 01:18:28,678
a week, a day, an hour.

1015
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:33,753
I'm hired?

1016
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:35,886
Don't I have to see...

1017
01:18:35,963 --> 01:18:38,557
a committee or something?

1018
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:43,802
- You made bail.
- Who?

1019
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:45,463
A friend.

1020
01:18:48,742 --> 01:18:51,540
"To the Honorable
Judge Frances Abarbanel.

1021
01:18:51,612 --> 01:18:53,978
I have been unable to recover
the power of appointment...

1022
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:55,675
signed  by Simon Dunne.

1023
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:58,183
But even if I had  been able to
produce the power of appointment...

1024
01:18:58,252 --> 01:19:02,154
I want the court to know that
the document was a fraud.

1025
01:19:02,222 --> 01:19:04,122
I induced Mr. Dunne
to sign a document...

1026
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,751
when his mental status was
diminished and he was incapable...

1027
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:09,387
of making an informed decision.""

1028
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:16,293
They set you up! They made
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1029
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:18,565
- And they're gonna make more.
- And I made partner...

1030
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:20,664
and a  bonus that could've paid
for 200 pianos.

1031
01:19:20,741 --> 01:19:22,299
You don't say anything about them.

1032
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:26,005
You're taking everything
on your shoulder in this letter.

1033
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,173
Why? You could send 'em to jail.

1034
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,676
They gotta write their own letters.

1035
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,036
Let me go.

1036
01:20:21,068 --> 01:20:23,366
Should've left me inside.

1037
01:20:23,437 --> 01:20:27,237
You're too important to me.
Come on. Let's go to a meeting.

1038
01:20:27,307 --> 01:20:29,332
No, no, no.
I went to one yesterday.

1039
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:35,211
- Well, that was yesterday.
- Yeah, one day at a time, right?

1040
01:20:35,282 --> 01:20:37,978
Yeah, one day at a time,
and do the next right thing.

1041
01:20:38,051 --> 01:20:40,918
Let's go.
There's a meeting at 6:00.

1042
01:20:40,988 --> 01:20:43,047
""God, grant me the strength...

1043
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:45,887
to accept the things
I cannot change.""

1044
01:20:57,671 --> 01:21:00,265
It's an admirable gesture,
 but it's unnecessary.

1045
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,776
It's unnecessary  because
you've already filed...

1046
01:21:03,844 --> 01:21:05,778
the power of appointment
with the court.

1047
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:13,152
A  bonded courier delivered it
to the judge just  before 5:00...

1048
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,154
and her  bailiff signed for it.

1049
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:20,449
Your note of apology was contrite,
 but it was absolutely professional.

1050
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:22,461
Everything's taken care of.

1051
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:27,266
- You filed a forgery.
- Bullshit.

1052
01:21:27,334 --> 01:21:29,427
I filed what I had to file.
What happened to--

1053
01:21:29,503 --> 01:21:32,028
You just disappeared.
Time was up.

1054
01:21:32,105 --> 01:21:34,505
Come on.
You scared the hell out of us.

1055
01:21:34,575 --> 01:21:36,509
I didn't know what to do.

1056
01:21:42,216 --> 01:21:44,150
So you finally hit rock  bottom?

1057
01:21:47,654 --> 01:21:50,521
Today you almost killed a guy.
Tomorrow you might go all the way.

1058
01:21:50,591 --> 01:21:52,650
Keep doing the next wrong thing,
you could start a religion.

1059
01:21:52,726 --> 01:21:54,785
Convince the so ber to drink.
Don't tell them...

1060
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:56,829
to keep each other alive with hope.

1061
01:21:56,897 --> 01:22:01,732
You saw today that everything decent
is held together  by a covenant.

1062
01:22:01,802 --> 01:22:03,929
An agreement not to go  bat shit!

1063
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:08,640
- You  broke the contract!
- I didn't have a drink!

1064
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:10,506
Well, wow!
Thank you for sharing!

1065
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:12,807
You didn't have a drink today!
What an inspiration!

1066
01:22:12,879 --> 01:22:15,006
That's the point, isn't it?

1067
01:22:16,617 --> 01:22:18,050
God!

1068
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:28,918
You know,  booze isn't really
your drug of choice anyway.

1069
01:22:31,798 --> 01:22:33,493
You're addicted to chaos.

1070
01:22:36,236 --> 01:22:39,034
For some of us, it's coke.
For some of us, it's  bourbon.

1071
01:22:39,106 --> 01:22:41,666
But you,
you got hooked on disaster.

1072
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:52,516
Fuck!

1073
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,388
Here's what you shouId do.

1074
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:00,824
You get up Monday morning...

1075
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:03,226
and you get yourself
on a plane to Texas.

1076
01:23:03,297 --> 01:23:05,629
Take that letter with you.

1077
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:08,167
When you get to Texas...

1078
01:23:08,235 --> 01:23:11,363
you get on the defense team
of somebody on death row.

1079
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:17,643
And then put all your energy
into saving a man from execution.

1080
01:23:18,979 --> 01:23:22,574
And then come on  back here
in a few months.

1081
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:26,710
You still wanna confess, go ahead.

1082
01:23:28,722 --> 01:23:30,713
Come on.

1083
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:33,191
How the hell do you think
Simon Dunne got his money?

1084
01:23:36,897 --> 01:23:39,695
You think those factories
in Malaysia...

1085
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:41,563
have day-care centers in them?

1086
01:23:41,635 --> 01:23:45,196
Wanna check the pollution levels
of his chemical plants in Mexico...

1087
01:23:45,272 --> 01:23:49,732
or look at the tax  benefllts
he got from this foundation?

1088
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,554
This is all a tightrope.

1089
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:57,318
This is all a tightrope.

1090
01:23:57,390 --> 01:24:00,257
You gotta learn to  balance.

1091
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:02,352
How can you live like that?

1092
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:06,923
I can live with myself
 because at the end of the day...

1093
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,334
I think I do more good than harm.

1094
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,871
What other standard
have I got to judge  by?

1095
01:25:09,996 --> 01:25:11,987
I have to thank you.

1096
01:25:18,672 --> 01:25:21,140
For the house?

1097
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:24,870
I understand what
you were trying to do,  but...

1098
01:25:24,944 --> 01:25:28,573
my wife's moving,
she's taking the  boys.

1099
01:25:28,648 --> 01:25:31,173
The house is a little  bit
too much for me right now.

1100
01:25:32,352 --> 01:25:33,785
I'm sorry.

1101
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:39,254
I was a horribly unstable father.

1102
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:45,364
And Valerie says
I'll never see them again.

1103
01:25:47,734 --> 01:25:49,668
But you know what?

1104
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,403
I will.

1105
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:02,047
I'll see 'em in a year or two...

1106
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,548
may be three.

1107
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:09,417
I'll go to Portland,
I'll call her...

1108
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,922
and I'll find a way
to be their father again.

1109
01:26:19,099 --> 01:26:20,623
How about you?

1110
01:26:24,704 --> 01:26:26,763
Well...

1111
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,502
I have the file...

1112
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:31,635
 but I don't need it anymore.

1113
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,983
It's  been taken care of.

1114
01:26:39,052 --> 01:26:41,748
You know.
It never happened.

1115
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:50,322
But it did happen. Right?

1116
01:26:51,865 --> 01:26:53,298
Right.

1117
01:26:57,904 --> 01:26:59,838
So, now what?

1118
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:23,954
I'm going to dinner with my wife...

1119
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,463
her parents.

1120
01:27:28,134 --> 01:27:33,868
And this weekend,
I'm gonna go look at a  boat.

1121
01:27:40,847 --> 01:27:46,342
And then on Monday, I'm gonna
come  back in here and go to work.

1122
01:27:47,253 --> 01:27:48,686
And then...

1123
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,681
magically this whole...

1124
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:57,924
incredible day just somehow...

1125
01:27:57,997 --> 01:27:59,589
becomes a memory.

1126
01:28:02,468 --> 01:28:05,869
It's like you go to the  beach.
You go down to the water.

1127
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:09,431
It's a little cold.
You're not sure if you wanna go in.

1128
01:28:10,877 --> 01:28:12,936
There's a pretty girl
standing next to you.

1129
01:28:13,012 --> 01:28:16,743
She doesn't wanna go in either.
She sees you.

1130
01:28:16,816 --> 01:28:18,750
And you know...

1131
01:28:18,818 --> 01:28:22,117
if you just asked her
her name...

1132
01:28:24,824 --> 01:28:27,292
you would leave with her.

1133
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,023
Forget your life,
whoever you came with...

1134
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:35,600
and leave the  beach with her.

1135
01:28:38,972 --> 01:28:40,906
And after that day...

1136
01:28:42,308 --> 01:28:44,936
you remember her.

1137
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:49,880
Not every day, every week.

1138
01:28:51,684 --> 01:28:53,618
She comes  back to you.

1139
01:28:55,388 --> 01:28:58,585
It's the memory...

1140
01:28:58,658 --> 01:29:00,592
of another life...

1141
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,252
you could've had.

1142
01:29:05,665 --> 01:29:07,599
Today is that girl.

1143
01:29:32,558 --> 01:29:36,016
I'm sorry about what I did.

1144
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:42,593
Me too.

1145
01:29:44,771 --> 01:29:46,705
You  brought the file  back.

1146
01:30:02,789 --> 01:30:07,283
When you're done, there's a lovely
little place on the hill where--

1147
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,294
where you can get a--

1148
01:30:10,463 --> 01:30:12,192
- Cappuccino.
- Yes, that's right, dear.

1149
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:15,701
They're lovely cappuccinos,
and it's clean and it's cool.

1150
01:30:15,768 --> 01:30:20,034
They have these prints on the wall.
They're really quite lovely.

1151
01:30:20,106 --> 01:30:24,338
I don't know who they're  by.
They're  by that artist--

1152
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,311
- Chagall.
- Right. They're Chagalls.

1153
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,143
There's three of them.
They're early Chagalls.

1154
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,376
I think he painted them
when he was visiting there.

1155
01:30:38,825 --> 01:30:41,020
Am I missing something this evening?

1156
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:43,585
- What is this?
- This, my dear--

1157
01:30:43,663 --> 01:30:46,894
This is Simon Dunne's...

1158
01:30:46,966 --> 01:30:49,901
power of appointment.

1159
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:51,493
- I got it  back.
- No, you didn't.

1160
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:55,837
- Yes, I did. This is it.
- Please.

1161
01:30:55,908 --> 01:31:01,175
This is  behind us, isn't it?
Haven't we put this  behind us?

1162
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:02,805
I was thinking about
what you said to me.

1163
01:31:02,882 --> 01:31:06,648
About the end of the day--
about doing more good than harm.

1164
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,016
That is what you said, isn't it?

1165
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:10,429
- Don't you fuck with me.
- I am not fucking with you, sir.

1166
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:11,760
- Don't you fuck with me.
- I am not fucking with you, sir.

1167
01:31:13,065 --> 01:31:14,430
Can you imagine how unpleasant
it would  be...

1168
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,627
if the judge
got ahold of this file?

1169
01:31:16,702 --> 01:31:19,296
That's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen, Gavin.

1170
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:25,837
I think I might order the snapper.

1171
01:31:29,014 --> 01:31:31,209
I'm gonna hold onto this file. I'm
gonna keep it in a very safe place.

1172
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:34,013
But I'm not going to Texas.

1173
01:31:34,086 --> 01:31:36,350
I'm gonna come  back
into work on Monday.

1174
01:31:36,422 --> 01:31:40,518
I'm gonna start doing that pro  bono
work that you recommended that I do.

1175
01:31:40,593 --> 01:31:43,255
But I'm gonna do it
from our office.

1176
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:47,322
The first thing we're gonna do
is help a man  buy a house.

1177
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:49,367
- Gavin, can we please not do this?
- And I think...

1178
01:31:49,435 --> 01:31:52,700
I would like to  be the one
to call Mina Dunne.

1179
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:54,705
I'm gonna tell her
that you and Walter...

1180
01:31:54,773 --> 01:31:57,833
are gonna give  back the three
million dollars you stole...

1181
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,844
from her grandfather's foundation.

1182
01:32:08,954 --> 01:32:12,685
You were right.
I can do this.

1183
01:32:12,758 --> 01:32:14,692
I found the edge.

1184
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:17,488
Can you live there with me?

1185
01:32:20,299 --> 01:32:21,891
Can you?

1186
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:31,309
I haven't had a fucking thing
to eat all day, and I'm starving.

1187
01:32:35,848 --> 01:32:38,043
So what are we gonna eat?

1188
01:32:56,869 --> 01:32:59,463
- Mrs. Gipson?
- Yes?

1189
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:02,029
My name is Gavin Banek.

1190
01:33:02,107 --> 01:33:04,041
What do you want?

1191
01:33:05,177 --> 01:33:07,873
Five minutes, ma'am.

1192
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:10,177
I owe your husband twenty.

1193
01:33:10,249 --> 01:33:12,479
Hell...

1194
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:15,042
I'm only asking for five with you.

1195
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,042
