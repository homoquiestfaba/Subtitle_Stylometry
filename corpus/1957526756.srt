00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,793
Hi.

2
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,344
I'm Rushion McDonald.

3
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,562
My next guest represents the
new millennial entrepreneur,

4
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:29,758
spirit, determination,
and drive.

5
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,310
He's faced a number
of challenges,

6
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:34,068
had some huge setbacks, but
that has not stopped him

7
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:35,655
from being successful today.

8
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:39,206
Please welcome to "Money Making
Conversation" Chad Tomlinson.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,724
Thank you so much for having me.

10
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:42,034
It's an honor to be here.

11
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:43,424
Well, I'm glad you
made time to do my show.

12
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:44,034
Oh, of course.

13
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:45,379
I love your show.

14
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:46,665
I really love the
episode with Nick Cannon.

15
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,113
There's a lot of
insight in there, man.

16
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:49,241
I really appreciate...

17
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:50,744
That lets me know
you watch my show.

18
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,241
That makes me happy.

19
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,344
Let's get started here.

20
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,758
Education.

21
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:57,448
Education played a major role in
your career branding early on.

22
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:00,275
Your educational
background was where?

23
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:05,068
Wake Forest for undergrad and
Duke University for graduate.

24
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:06,413
Why?

25
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,482
Well, I have a degree
in business analytics,

26
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,931
and I wanted to compete
with the best in the country

27
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,586
in order to be the
best in the country.

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,172
Now the reason I ask why,
because of the fact that I know

29
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:17,620
I'm a pushy dad.

30
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:18,793
I'm a successful dad.

31
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:20,862
I have a daughter, single child.

32
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,931
And so what influenced you
to go to those schools?

33
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:25,586
Well, I'm I'm a
single child, as well.

34
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,931
And I will tell you that my
parents had a huge influence

35
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,448
on me going, as well.

36
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,965
My dad is crazy successful.

37
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:36,827
And I think that's all I've
ever wanted from my life.

38
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,689
And I'm doing something very
similar to what he's doing.

39
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,275
I'm an operations consultant.

40
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,827
After I graduated
from Duke University,

41
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,517
he aligned it to where I could
get with one of the biggest

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,620
firms in Charlotte.

43
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,517
Chad, let me tell you
what my major concern is.

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,689
It's your lack of
job experience.

45
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,413
Experience?

46
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:02,037
I completed my
master's, and it took me

47
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:04,620
the last six years of my life!

48
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,793
And then I came here to intern
for you for an entire year!

49
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,793
I was never even late,
sir, so with all due

50
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,655
respect, where am I supposed
to find this experience,

51
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,000
if not from here?

52
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:18,862
With all due respect,
internship isn't always enough.

53
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,241
Now, listen... what?

54
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,241
I didn't get the job.

55
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,103
And did you tell your dad?

56
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:28,103
Not immediately,
but ironically enough,

57
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,846
as soon as I got home
from the internship,

58
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:31,655
he was standing in the driveway.

59
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,562
He had this look in his
eye like he knew already,

60
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,482
so I was more so
bracing for the speech.

61
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,517
But, I mean, he didn't know.

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
He didn't know.

63
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,068
So how'd it go?

64
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,275
You know, just...

65
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,068
You know, let's
talk about it inside.

66
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on.

67
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,103
OK.

68
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,241
Surprise!

69
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,448
What is all this?

70
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just a little party
to celebrate you finally

71
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,137
making your way in the world.

72
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:16,620
Congratulations, baby.

73
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:23,827
After all of the hard work
that this young man has put in,

74
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:26,482
congratulations are
finally in order.

75
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,103
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

76
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,206
Congratulations.

77
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,689
I'm proud of you, son.

78
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:34,793
That's my boy.

79
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:11,379
And at the point
where everybody was calling me

80
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,137
a winner, I really
felt like a loser

81
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,413
inside because I
hadn't gotten the job.

82
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,896
I felt like I was the
littlest person there.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,896
Chad.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,620
Have you been looking into
an investment portfolio?

85
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:27,034
You know it's never too
early to get started.

86
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,413
No, not really.

87
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,551
What about real estate?

88
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:33,482
I don't think I'm
ready to buy a house yet.

89
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:37,344
But when you're ready,
look over at Eastover.

90
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:40,034
They've been up and
coming for some time now.

91
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:40,896
OK.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,724
All right.

93
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

94
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,724
As long as you delay the truth,

95
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,896
certain things step in
the way of the truth.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,896
I learned that lesson, as well.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,793
Chad!

98
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:54,896
I heard you got a fat
signing bonus, buddy.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,275
Congratulations on the job, man.

100
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,551
Thank you, Will. Thank you.

101
00:04:58,655 --> 00:04:59,827
I don't even know who I am

102
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,551
or what I'm going
to do at that point.

103
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,137
Chad, young brother.

104
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,413
Hey.

105
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,931
Have you ever seen
Aspen in the winter?

106
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,034
No.

107
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,793
It's a beautiful place.

108
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,217
Matter of fact, I
need to introduce

109
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,517
you to my nephew, Brett.

110
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,517
You're going to be working
one floor under him.

111
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,931
Matter of fact, his wife
and him do a couples

112
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,103
retreat every year there.

113
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,620
Bring your lady friend.

114
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:24,103
I will bring my lady friend.

115
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,724
Thank you.

116
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,527
Man, everybody
in the room had a job but me.

117
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,103
Failure is scary.

118
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:31,793
Is that what drove
you to Atlanta?

119
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,827
That's exactly what
drove me to Atlanta.

120
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,137
I felt like I was lost,
and like most millennials,

121
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,758
I have social media.

122
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:42,586
I was inspired from a post from
my old roommate at Wake Forest,

123
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,103
and I decided I was
going to try something

124
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:47,517
different since
clearly this life

125
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,896
didn't have anything for me.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,793
Let me ask you this.

127
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:50,896
OK.

128
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,448
So that friend
invited you to Atlanta.

129
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,034
That's how we got here.

130
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,457
My friend painted a picture
for me that I could not refuse.

131
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,275
Yo.

132
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,379
Jacob, it's Chad.

133
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,965
Chad?

134
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,241
Freshman year, college?

135
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:12,482
Oh!

136
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,103
Yo, what up, boy?

137
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,251
Yo, what are you up to, man?

138
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,068
It's been a minute.

139
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:16,965
I've been good, man.

140
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,172
Just school and stuff.

141
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,931
School?

142
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,931
Wait, still?

143
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,103
Man, what, you become
a doctor or something?

144
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:27,517
No, operations consultant.

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,206
Yeah, I have no
idea what that means.

146
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,827
Yeah, a lot of people don't.

147
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,724
Anyway, I saw on Instagram
that you're in Atlanta.

148
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,379
How's that been going for you?

149
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:36,586
Oh, yeah, man.

150
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,482
I hooked up with
this indie film crew.

151
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:41,517
Yo, business is
booming down here, man.

152
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,172
Yo, we worked with
some dope people.

153
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,000
Man, we party every night.

154
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,827
All right, yo, we going
to some cool places, man.

155
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,448
It's been dope.

156
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,448
That sounds awesome.

157
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,758
So what's up, man?

158
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,976
Like, you looking for
a change of scenery?

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,896
I think so.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,655
Dude, get down here!

161
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:58,482
Hey, yo, you know a
smart dude like you,

162
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,379
you would kill it man, for real.

163
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:02,586
So what's up, man?

164
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,655
You looking for
something in particular?

165
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,758
I don't know yet.

166
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:18,862
Yo, yo, Chad!

167
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,034
Hey.

168
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:22,862
I hate to drop a bomb on
you, but I'm in Atlanta.

169
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:23,862
Yo, that's what's up.

170
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,862
Man, you just missed me.

171
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:26,965
What?

172
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:27,931
Yeah, me and the
crew are going down

173
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,217
to Miami to shoot on location.

174
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:29,862
We on the way there now.

175
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:32,137
Yeah, cool, cool, man.

176
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:33,103
That's... that's good.

177
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,241
No problem. Awesome.

178
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,241
Oh, damn.

179
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,758
I didn't... I didn't...

180
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,217
I thought you were talking
about doing your own thing.

181
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:41,206
I mean, you know, you
know, I travel a lot, bro.

182
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,896
No, it's no problem at all.

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,034
Trust me, it's totally fine.

184
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,448
It's cool.

185
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:47,838
Hey, but you're welcome to
come down to Miami and meet us,

186
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:48,758
man.
It's only like a 10 hour drive.

187
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,241
It's going to be lit.

188
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:51,448
Yeah.

189
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,562
I would let you
stay in my bed, man,

190
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,896
but you know I got roommates.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,206
Yo, but if it's cool with
them, it's cool with me.

192
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,103
I'll shoot you to
address, the Copper Coin.

193
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,551
Go by and see what's up.

194
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,655
Good luck.

195
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,827
Yeah, cool.

196
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,355
I'll think about it,
and I'll let you know.

197
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,172
All right, I'm going
to talk to you later.

198
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:13,655
Fuck my life, man.

199
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,793
Damn it.

200
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:50,586
Hey!

201
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:51,941
Man, roll down your window, man!

202
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,172
I need some help, man.

203
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,379
Yo, you got to give
me something, man.

204
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,827
You got to give you something.

205
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:57,689
I know you got it, man.

206
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:58,793
Help me out, man.

207
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:01,517
I don't have any cash on me.

208
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,793
OK, I got some food.

209
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:04,724
You want some food?

210
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,586
I don't want no food!

211
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:07,689
I need help, man!

212
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:22,620
Wow.

213
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,034
Can I just say the word wow?

214
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:28,344
Wow, dreaming about the
homeless people that I am.

215
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,689
It was so weird.

216
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,931
I can't even put that
into words, like,

217
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,827
the whole experience,
sleeping in the back of a car

218
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,586
when I just drove
3 and 1/2 hours...

219
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:38,793
And running.

220
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,148
I go back to the
fact, you're running.

221
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,379
I was running really fast.

222
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:43,206
Maybe if you told a
little truth back then...

223
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,310
Yeah.

224
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,413
Found a table, huh?

225
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,482
Yeah, I guess so.

226
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,586
Is this your section?

227
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:17,655
This is my section now.

228
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:18,931
Can I get you something?

229
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,586
$2 for all tap beers tonight.

230
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:27,448
Here's a menu, unless you
already know what you want.

231
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,793
Yeah.

232
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,448
Do you know Lola?

233
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, I know her.

234
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,838
Do you think I could
talk to her for a minute?

235
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:35,896
Sure.

236
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:52,310
I've been shook
down, shook down by love,

237
00:13:53,448 --> 00:14:01,448
shook me down
taught me a thing or two,

238
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:09,517
that's when I
learned there are few

239
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,000
things that a man should do.

240
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,827
I'm.

241
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,517
Lola

242
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,965
Hey, I'm Chad.

243
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:20,965
I'm a friend of Jacob's.

244
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:21,931
We went to school together.

245
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,448
He's never mentioned you.

246
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,310
I mean, it was a while
back, freshman year.

247
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,379
Didn't Jacob drop out
after freshman year?

248
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,793
Yeah, he did.

249
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:31,965
We were roommates.

250
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,517
Well, he's my roommate now.

251
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,862
Right, so he said I could
talk to you while he's in Miami.

252
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,689
I'm in Atlanta, possibly stay
in his room until he gets back.

253
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,344
Oh, whoa, whoa.

254
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,620
I don't know.

255
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,551
See, I have my little sister
living with me, as well,

256
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:47,862
and I don't really know you.

257
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:51,586
Oh, no, no, no, I'm
really good with kids.

258
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,137
That's the problem.

259
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,241
That's my little sister.

260
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,551
So no offense, I don't really
think it's a good idea.

261
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,448
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,448
Oh, no.

263
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,344
I totally understand. It's fine.

264
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,000
It's cool.

265
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:03,862
No big deal.

266
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,586
Are you OK?

267
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,482
Yeah.

268
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:07,793
I'm going to be fine.

269
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,936
I got to figure some things
out, so I'm going to go.

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,286
I really wish I
could help you more.

271
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,103
I'm sorry, but I'm sure
it'll all work out.

272
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,310
Nice to meet you, Lola.

273
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,758
Hey!

274
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,379
Are you serious?

275
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:31,482
What?

276
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:41,172
Come on, man!

277
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,275
I...

278
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,482
Did you forget something?

279
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,758
Yes, I did.

280
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:55,931
Thank you so much.

281
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:57,862
It's going to be
that kind of night.

282
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,034
Appreciate you.

283
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,931
Yeah, hello?

284
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,474
I got a boot on my car, and this
is the number to call, right?

285
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,862
75... dude, there's
no signs to indicate

286
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:16,931
that I can't park here.

287
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,482
There are no other
cars with boots.

288
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:21,655
Are... how long?

289
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:24,862
OK.

290
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,413
I need your ID.

291
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:41,862
$75 is a lot.

292
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,586
Is there really
nothing we can do?

293
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:44,689
No.

294
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:48,862
Jesus Christ.

295
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:03,310
Hey, can you just
cut him some slack?

296
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,827
No.

297
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,965
You got any cash on you?

298
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,241
No, I don't.

299
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:17,689
Will 40 do?

300
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,068
All right.

301
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,182
Yo, you really don't have...

302
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,827
Listen, there's an ATM inside.

303
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,344
You could just
pay me back later.

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,586
Thank you.

305
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:34,862
Hey, I actually have a
friend that has a little bit

306
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,724
of establishment down off
the farmer's market, always

307
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,310
looking for a few extra hands.

308
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:41,458
You could make a
few extra bucks.

309
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,758
I could tell him about you.

310
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,620
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

311
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,724
You're welcome.

312
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:47,758
What's your number?

313
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:42,448
Hello?

314
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:43,551
Oh!

315
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:48,689
May I speak to the
manager, please?

316
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,034
I'm the owner.

317
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,620
Nice to meet you.

318
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,965
Would you guys be running the
seven-day free trial still?

319
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,275
Sure.

320
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:59,965
Do you have, like,
lockers and showers?

321
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,068
Absolutely.

322
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:01,827
Let me show you around.

323
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:02,931
Oh, cool, man.

324
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:21,068
Thank you.

325
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,281
I need to know everything, who
and the what and the where.

326
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,689
I need everything.

327
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,827
Trust me.

328
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,044
I hear what you saying,
but act like it's

329
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,448
new what you're telling me.

330
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,689
I'm Curious George.

331
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:34,620
I hop in the Porsche.

332
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,379
It's 500 horse.

333
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:36,241
I'm ready for war.

334
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,586
I'm coming for throats.

335
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:42,103
They turn into ghosts I
need to know everything.

336
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,896
Oh, perfect timing.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,793
We're about to unload.

338
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:45,931
Cool, man.

339
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,286
Well, look, I have
two free hands,

340
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,689
so what do you need me to grab?

341
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:56,827
Oh, you ready to work.

342
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,034
Let's see.

343
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,137
Come on.

344
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:03,941
What am I getting
myself into here?

345
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:04,724
Kombucha

346
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:05,827
Kombucha?

347
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,551
Major health benefits.

348
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,103
It's an acquired taste, but
people around here love it.

349
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,206
What's up, man?

350
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,241
What's going on, man?

351
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:16,862
Looks good.

352
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,965
Looks good.

353
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,655
So what you thinking?

354
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:24,793
Let's take a shot.

355
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:25,931
All right, yeah.

356
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,517
Oh, my... there go my baby momma.

357
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,803
Look at my dumpling right here.

358
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,034
This Miss Mary right here.

359
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,182
- Hi, Miss Mary.
- How you doing?

360
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:32,965
This is Chad.

361
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:33,862
Nice to meet you.

362
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:34,965
All right, let's taste.

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,241
Thank you so much my brother.

364
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:38,586
Hey, I say let's take
it to the ..

365
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:39,517
- Ready?
- Yeah.

366
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,172
All right.

367
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,275
Cheers.

368
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:50,931
It's an acquired taste.

369
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:52,482
Yeah.

370
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,827
None of them cold,

371
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,562
they just got lucky but
never adapted, so I'm 10

372
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,000
to one if it's coming to blows.

373
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,551
My enemies cutting it close.

374
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,803
I let them think that they
got me, but what do you know?

375
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,758
I had them beat
before we ever spoke.

376
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,862
I'm ready for smoke.

377
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,493
I need to know everything,
who and the what

378
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,482
and the where I need everything.

379
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:10,827
What's up?

380
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,827
Hey, Eric.

381
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:14,724
- How are you?
- Good.

382
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:15,551
How are you doing?

383
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,206
Good.

384
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,448
Good to see you.

385
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,862
All right, yeah,
all right, let's go.

386
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,310
Pop the trunk.

387
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,137
I'm sorry?

388
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,241
Pop the trunk.

389
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,206
Yeah.

390
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,310
Cool.

391
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:34,344
Come on, man.

392
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:36,034
I'm trying.

393
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:37,655
There you go.

394
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:45,758
So I guess Airbnb is
running a special on car beds.

395
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:49,586
You didn't strike me as a type
that would sleep in his car.

396
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:50,929
Yeah, well, I didn't really have

397
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,448
a plan or money or anything.

398
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:58,896
Well, sleep at my place.

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,758
Really?

400
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,793
Yeah.

401
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,827
And it's Thursday, so
there's no farmer's market.

402
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,411
Let's roll up to the
auto parts store.

403
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,827
OK, you want to just
drop your car off at the...

404
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,655
Nope.

405
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:09,482
I'm going to fix it myself.

406
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,827
It's the alternator.

407
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,034
You fix cars too?

408
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:16,000
I watch YouTube.

409
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,103
Hang on a second.

410
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:20,448
Hello?

411
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:21,620
This is Chad.

412
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,103
Chad, Hey. Mr. Burke.

413
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:24,241
Got a minute?

414
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:28,103
Sure, what can
I do for you, sir?

415
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,896
It's about your interview.

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,137
I respect your boldness,
and I've given it

417
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,344
some careful thought, and
after talking to you dad,

418
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:39,448
I'm going to offer
you the position.

419
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,000
That will include a
$10,000 signing bonus

420
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:43,655
and three weeks paid vacation.

421
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,034
Hello, Chad?

422
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:49,862
Yes, sir.

423
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,206
I'm here.

424
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,389
Did you hear what I just said?

425
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,206
Yes, sir.

426
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,068
I heard you.

427
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,344
OK, well, it sounds like
you need a little time

428
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:01,000
to think about it.

429
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,734
Why don't you discuss
it with your parents

430
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,931
and then get back to me?

431
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,827
But I need to hear from
you by next Tuesday.

432
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,827
OK, I will.

433
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,241
Thank you.

434
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:12,344
I'll be in touch.

435
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,137
Let's go.

436
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,172
Let's head out.

437
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,413
Miss you, too.

438
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:45,117
Thanks for not fussing
at me like before.

439
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:52,275
I just don't know.

440
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:53,655
Not yet.

441
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:55,638
I just need some time to
figure some things out.

442
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:05,655
I didn't run away.

443
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:23,965
What you looking for, man?

444
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,586
I don't know.

445
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:30,969
I'll let you know
when I find it.

446
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,896
Grab your stuff.

447
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Follow me.

448
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:45,103
Come on in.

449
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,206
This is my place.

450
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,315
Put your stuff over there.

451
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,793
Come check this out.

452
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:56,620
So my boy is a drummer
and he's on tour

453
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:59,241
right now, so you can crash
in there until he gets back.

454
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sure he won't mind.

455
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,482
- All right, man.
- There you go.

456
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,586
- Thanks.
- All right.

457
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:16,724
Wake up.

458
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,931
What do you got going on today?

459
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:24,172
All right, you coming with me.

460
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,517
I got to be out of
here in 20 minutes.

461
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,413
Wake up.

462
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:29,517
OK.

463
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,413
All right, come on, let's go.

464
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:32,275
All right, man.

465
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:33,379
All right.

466
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,655
Man, I told you to get up.

467
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:41,000
Jamin, my man.

468
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:41,896
Yo.

469
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,310
What's up, man? What?

470
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:44,137
Come on, man.

471
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,793
What up?

472
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:48,931
I ain't hacking nothing
for you today, bro.

473
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,482
Just tell
me you upgraded that Rambo.

474
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,068
Of course I did.

475
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:55,079
I always do what I say I'm
going to do, unlike some people.

476
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:55,862
See, I knew it.

477
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,103
Yeah.

478
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:58,562
Every time I come in,
it's the same stuff, man.

479
00:25:58,586 --> 00:25:59,838
Are you going to do this for me?

480
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,931
You still owe me for that ..

481
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:04,068
And the wireless mouse
went missing last week.

482
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:05,206
No.

483
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,872
I do not owe you for
that wireless mouse.

484
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,113
Every time I come in here,
you say the same thing

485
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:10,724
about that mouse.

486
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,551
Aww, you're rude.

487
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,068
I'm Jamin.

488
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,827
Your friend is rude.

489
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:16,689
It's all good, man.

490
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,103
My name is Chad.

491
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:19,103
I really like the spot.

492
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,379
Oh.

493
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:22,448
I've never seen a computer
repair place look so...

494
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:24,379
Um... elegant.

495
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,379
Thank you.

496
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:26,482
Thank you.

497
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,665
You can take a look around, man.

498
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,586
Get comfortable.

499
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,344
You might be here a minute.

500
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,793
Oh, OK.

501
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,803
Unless... are you here to
help him move the boxes?

502
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,620
No, I'm just looking around.

503
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,551
He's here to help
me move the boxes.

504
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:37,827
- Come on, my brother.
- What?

505
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,389
You didn't know it,
but now you know it.

506
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,551
Wow.

507
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:43,275
Wow.

508
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:46,389
So how long do you think
you're going to be out here?

509
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,137
I mean, I haven't
really figured it out yet.

510
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,827
Yeah?

511
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,344
So what you thinking?

512
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,931
Right now?

513
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,234
I'm thinking about how good
this barbecue's about to be.

514
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:04,689
Well, I'm thinking...

515
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:10,517
What you got up for tonight?

516
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,517
I don't know, man.

517
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Let me check my schedule.

518
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,344
It's good.

519
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:22,689
Man, look, Jam's dude this
having an art show tonight.

520
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:25,310
We should pull up.

521
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,172
Let's do it.

522
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:28,275
Let's do it.

523
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:31,896
All right.

524
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,241
This is amazing.

525
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:37,827
I appreciate it.

526
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:39,896
How long you been doing this?

527
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,758
Man, I came out
the womb painting.

528
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,379
Now the real talk.

529
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,734
My mother bought me a sketch pad
to keep me quiet during church,

530
00:27:45,758 --> 00:27:47,275
and it was a wrap since then.

531
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,931
I can tell you been
doing this for a while.

532
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,206
You do this full time?

533
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,448
Nah, not yet.

534
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:53,803
I'm an investment banker
on a regular 9:00 to 5:00.

535
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:56,034
But soon, though.

536
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:57,172
It's coming.

537
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:57,827
I appreciate it, man.

538
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:58,758
Really good, man.

539
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:00,172
Appreciate the support.

540
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:01,344
Of course.

541
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:02,734
Let me show you this
over here, though.

542
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:03,827
Check got this 2Pac.

543
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,724
[MUSIC - IKAI & CYRUS FEAT.

544
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,275
Space man, hell yeah.

545
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:18,344
ATL, check it, ATL, check it.

546
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,034
I make moon like Black boys.

547
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,172
I'm on the black nonstop, boy.

548
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:29,413
Jesus.

549
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:30,689
Shit!

550
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,448
You see me behind you?

551
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:33,596
No, I didn't see you at all.

552
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,379
Are you blind?

553
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:35,724
No, I'm not blind.

554
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:37,320
Then what the fuck is
wrong with you, then?

555
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:38,206
You know what?

556
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,665
We're just going
to call the police

557
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:40,700
and get this insurance
thing rolling.

558
00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:41,448
OK, I'm sorry.

559
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,586
I'm so sorry.

560
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:43,689
Shit.

561
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,965
Ugh.

562
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:49,206
Just bought this damn car.

563
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,482
OK, uh...

564
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,344
What the fuck?

565
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:57,241
There's gotta be...

566
00:28:57,344 --> 00:29:01,103
Uh, hey, so my insurance lapsed
two days ago, but I mean, we...

567
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,206
Nigger, please, with your
no insurance having ass.

568
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,631
Unless you're going to pay for
this damage out of your pocket,

569
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:07,827
I ain't trying to hear it.

570
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,079
No, we can go to
the place right now

571
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:10,113
and get it taken care of.
I promise.

572
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,448
I can just pay for it...

573
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,148
If we pull out of here
and you try and dip on me,

574
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:16,034
I will be right on your ass.

575
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't know what "dip" is.

576
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,862
As in NASCAR, nigger.

577
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,413
I will be on you.

578
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,413
Don't fuck up because
I will catch you.

579
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:23,758
OK.

580
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:24,655
And then we gonna use
the police for real.

581
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:26,103
No need. I promise.

582
00:29:26,206 --> 00:29:27,034
Just follow me, and
everything will be all right.

583
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:28,206
I promise. I'm sorry.

584
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,862
It better be.

585
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:30,413
OK, I'm sorry.

586
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:32,000
With your no driving ass.

587
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:39,275
Hey.

588
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,379
All right, man.

589
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:41,206
Man?

590
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,379
Yo, here are your.

591
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:48,344
And now you know it's cheaper
if you pay cash, right?

592
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:51,655
I don't... I don't
think I have cash, man.

593
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:54,620
I kept imagining
myself in those people's lives.

594
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:58,931
Um, here.

595
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:00,103
Yeah, that's fine.

596
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,517
Just put on this credit card.

597
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,540
All right, we'll be right
back with your receipt.

598
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:11,827
What's up, man?

599
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:12,655
How you doing?

600
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:13,758
What's up, Erik?

601
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:16,344
You know, I'm all right.

602
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,344
Everything is good.

603
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,689
Everything is great.

604
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,862
I'm just trying to
edit this shit down,

605
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,689
and it's driving me crazy.

606
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:23,862
Yeah.

607
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,379
How you really doing?

608
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:26,482
I'm good.

609
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:27,965
I swear I'm good.

610
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:33,206
All right, what is it?

611
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,896
Dude, I just backed
into somebody's car.

612
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,344
And then I find out that
my insurance lapsed,

613
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,275
so I had to pay to
get that reinstated.

614
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:44,259
But since here at the car
without any insurance,

615
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,355
I had to pay out of pocket
to get the lady's car fixed.

616
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,620
Pay out of pocket?

617
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:49,010
You just told me
you had no money.

618
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,714
Where'd you get money
to pay out of pocket?

619
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:52,586
I'm still broke, OK?

620
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,310
I put it on a credit card.

621
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,482
Credit card?

622
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,896
Yes.

623
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,493
Man, look, it it'll
all work itself out.

624
00:30:58,517 --> 00:30:59,517
It always does.

625
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:00,827
No, I don't think you get it.

626
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:02,655
It's not going to work
itself out like that.

627
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:04,000
It's my dad's credit card.

628
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:05,758
Ooh, must be nice.

629
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:06,896
Dad's credit card.

630
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,280
I wish I had a
dad's credit card.

631
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,299
Hell, all the times I need
somebody's credit card

632
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,689
to put my stuff down on, man.

633
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,275
Look, I had a job
for us tomorrow.

634
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,620
Can't do it because
the truck broke down.

635
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,862
So hell, I guess we can't do it.

636
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:19,034
No, no.

637
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,217
Do you know anybody
with a truck?

638
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:21,521
I'm just going
to let it go, bro.

639
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:22,551
I mean...

640
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:23,931
My dad does not play.

641
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:27,655
I need to pay this back, please.

642
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:28,872
I got one dude that I can call,

643
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:30,241
maybe, because he's a hustler.

644
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:31,241
So I don't know.

645
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,413
Shit.

646
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:35,655
Please... please call
the hustler, please.

647
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,241
Hey, what's up, man?

648
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,527
This is E. Listen, man, I got
a job to do in the morning,

649
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:42,620
but my truck broke down, so
I was just wondering if you

650
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:43,724
got a truck I can borrow.

651
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,068
Yeah.

652
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,517
Well, I kind of need it tonight.

653
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,482
Oh, you do?

654
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:54,862
Oh, man.

655
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,827
All right, yo, I'm going
come by with my homie,

656
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:59,241
and we'll pick it up
tonight, all right?

657
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:00,862
Thank you. There you go.

658
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:01,965
I get shit done.

659
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,793
If you ever question me again.

660
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:05,448
Thank you.

661
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:06,551
Hustler, yeah.

662
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
You know what?

663
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:08,665
Shake my hand one more time.

664
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:09,448
Of course, man.

665
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:10,275
Yeah.

666
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,068
Give me your other hand.

667
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:11,896
Give me your hand.

668
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,758
That's different?

669
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:13,586
What are you doing?

670
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:14,482
OK.

671
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:15,620
What's up with this?

672
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:18,448
I don't... I don't
know what's happening.

673
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:22,103
Nigger, them is white collar
hands, not a knot on them.

674
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,734
Nigger, the job we got
to do in the morning

675
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:26,344
calls for blue collar hands.

676
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:27,206
You ain't shit.

677
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,172
I don't care what we need.

678
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,137
I will do it.

679
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,241
Dude, I need the money.

680
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:31,000
Please.

681
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:31,931
I have to pay this back.

682
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,448
Man, go check with Lola.

683
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,355
She might need something
down there at the restaurant.

684
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:37,010
She might need some help,
so go check with her.

685
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,206
What?

686
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,172
Is she, like, the
manager or something,

687
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:40,137
what are we talking about?

688
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:41,551
Lola owns the restaurant.

689
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:46,275
Somewhere on the scene,

690
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,517
you got a little
longer, so it seems.

691
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:55,068
I burned out, so to speak.

692
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:56,206
Now come a little closer.

693
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,103
A feel a little light in
the track.

694
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:17,551
Hey, is that your truck?

695
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:18,758
No, not really.

696
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:20,142
I can move it if you need me to.

697
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:20,896
That's OK.

698
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,310
Come here.

699
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,103
OK?

700
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,103
Excuse me.

701
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:26,896
Is there a problem, officer?

702
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,758
I don't know.

703
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:28,965
Is there?

704
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:29,931
Well, I was just
asking because you

705
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:30,931
asked about the truck.

706
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:31,793
Don't ask me no questions.

707
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:32,896
Let me see your IDs.

708
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:33,827
Why do you need to see our...

709
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:36,034
I said, let me see your ID.

710
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,448
Hurry up.

711
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,862
Sit on the ground.

712
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,700
Lock your legs in front of
you, and put your hands under...

713
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:46,620
You didn't even need...

714
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,827
I said, sit on the ground.

715
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:51,379
Lock your legs in front of you.

716
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,620
And put your hands on your head.

717
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,103
Shit.

718
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:57,086
This is motherfucking
bullshit, and you know it.

719
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:57,931
Come on, man. It's cool.

720
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,517
Shut up.

721
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,758
OK, the jail cell ..

722
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:02,517
Did your parents know then?

723
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,793
I called home.

724
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:06,379
That was the first time
I had spoken to my father

725
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:10,137
since I "ran away"
from the house.

726
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,758
But yeah, that moment
was pivotal for me

727
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:16,241
because I'll be the first
to admit that, if I'm

728
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,896
being completely honest, I...

729
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,344
I hear about it.

730
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:22,379
I grew up in Charlotte,
North Carolina,

731
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:24,379
but I wasn't on the
side of the fence

732
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,896
where it was common to see it.

733
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,068
I have to call somebody.

734
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,172
Oh, my God.

735
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,620
Why do you keep whining, man?

736
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:30,862
It is not that bad.

737
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,137
The truck was stolen.

738
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:33,137
Did you steal a truck?

739
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,344
No, I didn't steal a truck.

740
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,596
Well, I didn't
steal a truck either,

741
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,020
so it's going to
all get worked out.

742
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:38,743
No, it's not going
to just get worked out.

743
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:40,827
What are you going to do?

744
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,527
Snitch and tell them when
you got the truck from?

745
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:44,517
Give me a stolen truck
and don't tell me about it?

746
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,148
Hell, yeah, I'm gonna
snitch on that nigger.

747
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,172
We are in jail.

748
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,620
My dad is going to kill me.

749
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:51,034
One, you're a grown man.

750
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:53,620
Two, why do you
keep thinking you

751
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,931
have to tell your
father everything.

752
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:00,586
And you ain't in jail.

753
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:03,586
Man, we in jail.

754
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,689
So chill.

755
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:09,241
At least it's just
me and you in here.

756
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:11,172
We can eat, make phone calls.

757
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,275
We can chill.

758
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,344
I don't... I don't know, man.

759
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,769
I just got to call my
dad, and everything

760
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:18,655
will be taken care of.

761
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:19,862
Back to this shit.

762
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,527
Why do you feel like you
got to call your dad?

763
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,137
So he can bail us out of here.

764
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:32,241
Officer.

765
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:36,034
Officer!

766
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:37,137
Ooh.

767
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:45,965
Hey, dad.

768
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,034
Hey, dad.

769
00:35:48,137 --> 00:35:49,827
So you're going to
call me from jail

770
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:51,241
and start off with, hey, dad.

771
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:56,379
Sorry, it really is
a huge misunderstanding.

772
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:58,896
And what the hell does
it have to do with me?

773
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,896
I'm your son.

774
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,103
Oh, no, no.

775
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:03,689
You are not my son, see?

776
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:07,241
Because my son would be working
at his job, the one that we

777
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:08,862
just celebrated.

778
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,286
See, now, the man I'm talking
to you on the phone right now.

779
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,827
This man has lost his mind.

780
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:14,689
This man that I'm
talking to is stupid.

781
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:17,965
You're just
going to leave me here?

782
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:19,103
Leave you where?

783
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:20,310
I don't know where you are.

784
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,241
And apparently, from
the sounds of it

785
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,896
you don't know where
you are either.

786
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:29,310
Good Lord.

787
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,000
So?

788
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,103
How did that go?

789
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,758
Did I just hear you correctly?

790
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,620
Chad's in jail?

791
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:51,517
Did you just hang up on my son?

792
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,137
Yes, and now if you
would stop letting

793
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:58,448
them drink off your titty, maybe
he wouldn't be in this mess.

794
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:02,068
If he is grown enough
to up and leave,

795
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:03,452
then he is grown
enough to handle

796
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:04,965
his own affairs out there.

797
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:07,793
You and I both know that he
is not grown enough to handle

798
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:08,896
what happens out there.

799
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,137
And why is that?

800
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:14,827
Because my son's father is
a despotic narcissist who's

801
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,241
too busy with his head
up his own fucking

802
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:20,000
ass to realize that he
hasn't allowed his son

803
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,482
a chance to be his own man.

804
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,137
So this is my fault.

805
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,344
No, no.

806
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:28,172
It's never your fault.
You never wrong.

807
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,275
You're such a humble being.

808
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:31,551
That's why I married you.

809
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:36,068
You're just... you're
so fucking perfect.

810
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,172
Fix this!

811
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:41,172
Have you been smoking?

812
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,206
No.

813
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,241
You liar.

814
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,448
I smell it all over you.

815
00:37:45,551 --> 00:37:46,551
Ooh.

816
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,137
My father hates me.

817
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:57,448
Your father don't hate you.

818
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:58,827
He's leaving me in here.

819
00:37:58,931 --> 00:37:59,931
And he probably should.

820
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:05,758
And this is just a bump in the
road, and you need to relax.

821
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:06,724
We're in jail.

822
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:07,448
And so what?

823
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,724
What are the facts?

824
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,862
You didn't steal
a truck, did you?

825
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,734
As a matter of fact, you
put money in your pocket,

826
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,655
and you did it all by yourself.

827
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,231
It had nothing to do
with your damn father.

828
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,931
If I was listening to my father,

829
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,474
I bet I wouldn't be
in here with you.

830
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:02,310
Hey, you.

831
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,931
You made bail.

832
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,034
Must be nice.

833
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:15,655
Hey!

834
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:16,448
I already told you.

835
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:17,620
Knock that shit off!

836
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:29,068
Switching my lanes.

837
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:31,758
Living too fast.

838
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,724
For living, as long we prison.

839
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,107
So many crash.
When I feel like...

840
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,206
What did I tell you?

841
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,000
Get in here.

842
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:38,448
Sit down.

843
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:39,838
It was
like looking in the mirror.

844
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:40,379
You know?

845
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:41,620
Hmm?

846
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:42,586
I just didn't want

847
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:43,896
my life to end up like that.

848
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,103
I'm Black and I'm Black

849
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:45,965
and I'm Blacker than Wesley.

850
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:46,689
My flow is amazing.

851
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:47,551
You flow.

852
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:48,655
I'm feeling established.

853
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,758
Hello?

854
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:53,758
Chad, what's good, player?

855
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:54,586
You tell me.

856
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,000
It is what it is.

857
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,551
What will be will be.

858
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:59,068
Are you back from Miami?

859
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:00,655
Yes, sir.

860
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:01,758
Great.

861
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:04,965
Um, do you think you
could pick me up?

862
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,275
Take me to my car?

863
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:08,896
I just got let out of jail.

864
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,206
What?

865
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,310
Yeah.

866
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:19,448
Hop in, boy.

867
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,689
Hello?

868
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,482
Hello.

869
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:28,113
Grab your stuff, and
let's get out of here.

870
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:28,965
What about Erik?

871
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:30,413
Lola called over there.

872
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:31,517
He had a warrant.

873
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:32,700
He's going to be there a minute.

874
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,896
Damn, I hate leaving him there.

875
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

876
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,148
I'm sure he's not
happy about it either.

877
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:38,241
I know Erik.

878
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:40,655
He's got abandonment issues.

879
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:43,034
Dad hates me, and now
Erik's going to hate me.

880
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,862
Hey, grab your stuff; get to
my place; and figure out there.

881
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:46,689
Go.

882
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:47,793
Go, go.

883
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,448
Damn.

884
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,862
What smell like ass in here?

885
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:12,862
Hey, mom, I was actually
going to call you after I

886
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:14,310
finished showering and shaving.

887
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:15,689
How are you?

888
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:19,068
Now is not the time to
stall talking to me, OK?

889
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,344
What is going on?

890
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,620
What do... what are
you doing in jail?

891
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:25,586
Mom, I promise, it's...

892
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:26,551
It's taken care of.

893
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:27,413
Everything was good.

894
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:28,413
It's a big mix-up.

895
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:30,103
No, it's not fine, Chad.

896
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,379
It's not fine.

897
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,976
I got a call in the
middle of the night

898
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,896
from Atlanta telling
me that you're in jail,

899
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,965
and I got a credit
card bill for $2,200.

900
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:42,413
What is going on?

901
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:43,275
You know what?

902
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:46,758
You better fix this.

903
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:47,655
OK.

904
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:53,896
Um... I didn't get the job, mom.

905
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So what?

906
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:58,310
You got another job
offer in Atlanta?

907
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:03,344
I actually saw a friend of
mine's page on Instagram and...

908
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:04,448
On Instagram?

909
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,172
Chad.

910
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,517
Look, I just...

911
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,172
I just needed a
change, you know?

912
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:10,000
I had to take...

913
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:10,724
What?

914
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:11,896
To run away to Atlanta?

915
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,172
No, not run away to Atlanta.

916
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,896
Yes, and why Atlanta?

917
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,724
I don't know.

918
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,137
And it wasn't just Atlanta.

919
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,689
It was somewhere, you know?

920
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:22,862
I... but everything is good.

921
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:25,482
Like, I started working here and
I have this friend now, right?

922
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,448
And we've started to go to the
farmer's market and move things

923
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:29,310
and...

924
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,137
No, wait a minute.

925
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,689
What friend, Chad?

926
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:34,172
And moving... you
just got to Atlanta.

927
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:35,482
Where are you moving?

928
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,413
Not moving to Atlanta?

929
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:41,137
Like, moving furniture.

930
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:42,275
OK.

931
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,448
Look, it's a lot, right?

932
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:47,689
It's a lot.

933
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:49,517
And just... if you
give me some time,

934
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,482
I can explain it in person.

935
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,448
Yes, come home.

936
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:54,275
Yeah.

937
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:55,379
Huh?

938
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,137
Yeah, I can be there tomorrow.

939
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,482
Tomorrow.

940
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:00,344
Tomorrow.

941
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:02,137
Yeah, that works.

942
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,827
Tomorrow.

943
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:06,172
Look, that's a long
drive home, Chad.

944
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:07,872
It should be plenty of
time for you to come up

945
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:09,275
with a story that makes sense.

946
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:14,448
Yes, ma'am.

947
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,206
I just don't get what is wrong.

948
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,724
What... what's going on?

949
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,517
This is not you.

950
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,000
We gave you everything,
Chad, everything.

951
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,517
What is wrong?

952
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,172
I just don't... I
don't understand.

953
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:32,103
Just, please... just let
me just explain it tomorrow,

954
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:33,206
please?

955
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:40,448
I love you.

956
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,551
I love you.

957
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,586
Hey.

958
00:43:55,689 --> 00:43:57,551
Hey.

959
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,586
Thanks for coming.

960
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:02,172
Thanks for the invite.

961
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:03,724
I really am sorry.

962
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:05,000
About what?

963
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,827
It's my fault. I
introduced you to Erik.

964
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:10,793
This is not your
fault. It's fine.

965
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:14,206
Erik's cool and all, but
he's all over the place.

966
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,793
Sometimes he hangs
with shady people.

967
00:44:16,896 --> 00:44:18,482
Still, this isn't
your fault. I mean,

968
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:19,746
you were just trying to help.

969
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:20,620
You could have just
sent me on my way.

970
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:21,758
That's my problem.

971
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,448
I'm always trying
to help people.

972
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:25,034
I need to learn that I can't.

973
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:29,793
Still, I'm grateful
that you decided

974
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:32,000
to help me out in this case.

975
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,275
Listen, you're more than
welcome to stay at our place

976
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:38,206
for a bit, if you want.

977
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,551
It's the least I can do.

978
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:41,896
I really am sorry.

979
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:46,344
Thank you.

980
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:48,113
Still, that's nothing
compared to what's going

981
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:50,758
to happen when I leave, so...

982
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,517
Stay here then.

983
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,793
Order what you want.

984
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:54,620
Don't worry about it.

985
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:55,793
It's on me.

986
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:10,206
- I don't know.

987
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,827
I just got to hurry
up and go home.

988
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:13,771
My parents are pissed
off, and they're worried.

989
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:15,148
You want me to
ride down with you?

990
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:16,793
My schedule's pretty open.

991
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,758
Thank you.

992
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:22,822
But no, I wouldn't even
throw you in the deep end.

993
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:27,448
Well, just so you know,
I'm a pretty strong swimmer.

994
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:29,827
Look at you you, always
trying to help somebody.

995
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:32,413
Oh, my God, I need help.

996
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:34,206
Yeah, you need to go
to Helpers Anonymous.

997
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,446
So what brought you to Atlanta?

998
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:43,896
I don't know.

999
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,827
I guess I was just
looking for something.

1000
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:48,137
And you think you're
going to find it here?

1001
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:53,413
Not specifically Atlanta,
but I did need a change.

1002
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,275
But why?

1003
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,896
I'm not sure.

1004
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,800
After I graduated from
this really prestigious

1005
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,793
private school my
parents sent me to,

1006
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:06,379
they sent me off
to this college.

1007
00:46:06,482 --> 00:46:09,827
And I really wanted to go
to school out of state.

1008
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,379
But since I wasn't
paying for it,

1009
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:16,103
beggars can't be choosers,
as my dad always says.

1010
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:20,620
I went straight into my
master's and aced everything,

1011
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:24,068
landed this really big
internship, and really didn't...

1012
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,655
It really didn't lead to
anything, and now I'm here.

1013
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:34,172
OK, what was the problem?

1014
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:37,758
I think it's time for me to
start making my own decisions.

1015
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:43,034
I get that, but what
do you want out of life?

1016
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:46,724
I want to be successful.

1017
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:50,034
Define "successful."

1018
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:51,137
Oh.

1019
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,000
Well, I have my master's
in business analytics,

1020
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,206
so I'd imagine I'd go
get a job in my field

1021
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,103
and work really hard to
where my family doesn't

1022
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:01,344
want anything financially.

1023
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:03,689
And that's it?

1024
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:06,793
That's what you
define as successful?

1025
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:08,482
What about you?

1026
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:11,034
What about your life?

1027
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:14,000
You have to be more specific.

1028
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:16,758
Well, that would be my life.

1029
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:18,448
Your job?

1030
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:19,551
That's your life?

1031
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,586
What do you define a success?

1032
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:27,551
Happiness, freedom.

1033
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,034
I like that.

1034
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,931
So how can someone have that
if their bills aren't paid?

1035
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:50,000
You were taught to go
to school, get a degree,

1036
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:53,758
get a good job, making money.

1037
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:55,551
So we're successful, right?

1038
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,034
Right.

1039
00:47:57,137 --> 00:47:58,137
OK, then you're good.

1040
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,620
What are you passionate about?

1041
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:09,172
That's what drives me.

1042
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:11,482
I used to take care of
myself and my little sister,

1043
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:15,068
but I came up with a plan
that addressed my passion.

1044
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:17,310
It wasn't always just
about paying the bills.

1045
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:22,862
So how did you end up with
the responsibility of Vanessa?

1046
00:48:22,965 --> 00:48:25,172
She seems like she
could be a handful.

1047
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:27,103
Long story short, she is.

1048
00:48:27,206 --> 00:48:29,379
But when it comes to family,
you do what you got to do.

1049
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:31,137
Yeah, well, I
know all about that.

1050
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:36,482
That BMW you drive out
there is pretty nice.

1051
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:38,551
Did you pay for that
with your intern salary?

1052
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,551
No.

1053
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:42,068
Was it a gift from mommy?

1054
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:45,344
No, it belongs to my father.

1055
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:47,344
Oh, so he's pretty successful.

1056
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,517
Yes, very.

1057
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,482
So why not take his
blueprint for success?

1058
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:54,620
I have, my entire life.

1059
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,068
Obviously something went wrong.

1060
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,689
Let me ask you this.

1061
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:07,758
What would you do every day
for free because you loved it?

1062
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,586
Figure that out, and
you'll feel right as rain.

1063
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:15,586
That's right.

1064
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:12,448
Where is mom at?

1065
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,448
Oh, I'm good, son.

1066
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:15,896
Thanks for asking.

1067
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,482
I mean, I have been dealing
with some things around here,

1068
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:19,206
but I think I'm OK.

1069
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,689
I'm sorry.

1070
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:21,586
Uh...

1071
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:22,689
Yeah, she's upstairs.

1072
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,000
Do you know what
I do for a living?

1073
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,103
Yes, dad.

1074
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:03,217
I know what you do for a living.

1075
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:04,689
So what do I do?

1076
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:06,206
You're an equity broker.

1077
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,620
And what does that mean?

1078
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,655
It means sometimes you
trade for a currency

1079
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,241
and sometimes you day trade.

1080
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:13,458
But I know you like
foreign currency

1081
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:16,137
better, stocks and bonds.

1082
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,081
And your clients trust
you, so they invest big.

1083
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:20,344
Yeah, that's right.

1084
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:24,310
My clients invest
big because of trust.

1085
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:26,620
That's a trust that's
been built over time.

1086
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:28,724
That trust has a
value on it that only

1087
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:29,827
a fool would throw away.

1088
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:33,896
You look like a fool right now.

1089
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,068
I tell my clients you got to
spend money to make money.

1090
00:51:37,172 --> 00:51:40,103
I've spent a lot
of money on you,

1091
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:45,068
and I am not seeing the
return that I expected.

1092
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:52,448
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint, dad.

1093
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,275
Let me ask you...

1094
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:01,482
Do you know what
I do for a living?

1095
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:02,344
No, I don't.

1096
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:03,586
Why don't you tell me?

1097
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:04,689
That's the problem.

1098
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:06,275
I can't tell you
because I don't know.

1099
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:08,059
I haven't had a chance
to figure it out yet

1100
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:11,517
because you have made every
decision for me my entire life.

1101
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,724
Oh, please.

1102
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,758
You told me what school
I'm supposed to go to.

1103
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:16,965
You told me what car
I'm supposed to drive,

1104
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:19,551
where I'm supposed to live in
the future, how much money I'm

1105
00:52:19,655 --> 00:52:22,620
supposed to have, and even what
girl I'm supposed to settle

1106
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:24,413
down with, and you
never once considered

1107
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,482
that maybe I wanted a
hand in the decisions

1108
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:27,931
being made in my life, dad.

1109
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:29,827
Never.

1110
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:32,586
We both know there's been
nothing wrong with my choices.

1111
00:52:32,689 --> 00:52:35,103
That is not what we are
discussing here today.

1112
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:37,896
What we are discussing
are your choices,

1113
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,034
and we both know that there
have been some problems there,

1114
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:42,137
jailbird.

1115
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:05,517
Good morning.

1116
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,940
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you.

1117
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:07,965
Good to see you, too.

1118
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:37,827
Whoa.

1119
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:44,241
Chad.

1120
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:45,389
Mr. Burke, how are you, sir?

1121
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:46,517
Fantastic. How are you?

1122
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,655
I'm great.

1123
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:50,551
Listen, you have
earned this position.

1124
00:53:50,655 --> 00:53:53,482
You shined here as an
intern, and I expect nothing

1125
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:55,275
less than you as an employee.

1126
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,739
Let's put that
degree to work, huh?

1127
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,286
Thank you for the
opportunity, seriously.

1128
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,379
Listen, after what your
father's done for me,

1129
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,206
it's the least I could do.

1130
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,551
Yeah, right, of course.

1131
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:08,068
Listen, I will see you tomorrow.

1132
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:09,034
Yes.

1133
00:54:09,137 --> 00:54:10,137
Talk to you later.

1134
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:53,206
"Mom and dad,
thank you both all of your love"

1135
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,413
and your sacrifice.

1136
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:57,758
I feel as if the only
way for me to honor

1137
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:04,310
that is by going off and
actually living a life of love

1138
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:07,448
and sacrifice on my own.

1139
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:10,896
So I'm taking a train
back to Atlanta today,

1140
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,965
and I'm writing the
address of where I will be

1141
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:15,268
"at the bottom of this letter."

1142
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:19,137
"You
support is more than welcome."

1143
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:21,862
But it's not necessary anymore.

1144
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:24,103
You taught me well.

1145
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:26,103
Thank you.

1146
00:55:26,206 --> 00:55:27,896
"I love you both."

1147
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,793
"Chad."

1148
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,551
So

1149
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,172
Yeah, I believe so.

1150
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:53,172
Would you be down to assist
me on a few I got?

1151
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:54,310
Yeah, of course.

1152
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:55,206
It sounds like fun.

1153
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,482
Cool.

1154
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:57,803
Well, I had to let
my last assistant go.

1155
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,482
She was getting a
little too attached.

1156
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:02,241
Oh, nobody ain't attached
to your trifling ass.

1157
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:03,896
Look, you had your chance.

1158
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,620
Suspect.

1159
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:06,379
Please.

1160
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:07,275
You know how I get down.

1161
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:08,379
You know.

1162
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,000
I do not.

1163
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:11,689
I do not.

1164
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:13,344
Wait, where are you going?

1165
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:14,517
Bathroom, damn.

1166
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,275
Number one or number two?

1167
00:56:16,379 --> 00:56:17,827
Shh.

1168
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:20,379
You good?

1169
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:21,586
Yeah, I'm fine.

1170
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:22,413
Just getting my legs
back underneath.

1171
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:23,517
You know.

1172
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,000
What did you have in mind?

1173
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:26,206
I don't know.

1174
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,172
I might check back
in with Ted Jinks.

1175
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:30,965
You should talk to Lola about
you have a Copper Coin, man.

1176
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:31,689
Waiting tables?

1177
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:34,103
You'd be great at it.

1178
00:56:34,206 --> 00:56:35,068
I don't know.

1179
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:36,206
I don't know.

1180
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,389
You gotta about
that comfort zone.

1181
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:38,172
I did.

1182
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,000
Look at me.

1183
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,275
Like, I'm bowling.

1184
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:42,896
Yeah.

1185
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,217
But you're still going to be
my assistant, though, right?

1186
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,379
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1187
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:47,517
I got you.

1188
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:56,586
Hi.

1189
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,275
Hi.

1190
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:03,931
Lola, um, I really
need some work.

1191
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,562
Do you have any openings
at the restaurant

1192
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:06,586
where I can come in and...

1193
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:10,517
I'm serious.

1194
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,793
Can we both agree?

1195
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,689
You know nothing
about waiting tables.

1196
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:15,286
So what is it exactly
you have in mind?

1197
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,172
I don't know.

1198
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:17,517
I would do anything, Lola.

1199
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,586
How about this?

1200
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:26,000
You take my yoga class.

1201
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:27,103
I'll think about it.

1202
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:30,965
Hello, everyone.

1203
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:32,310
Hello.

1204
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:34,034
My name is Lola.

1205
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:36,551
I want to welcome you
all today's class.

1206
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:39,896
How many of you are new to yoga?

1207
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,931
Well, today's class
is a beginner's class.

1208
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:45,103
So feel free to take as
many breaks as possible.

1209
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:48,344
And please do remember one
thing above all things,

1210
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:49,517
to always breathe.

1211
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,034
Ooh, Chad, you do yoga, too.

1212
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:52,965
Amazing.

1213
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:56,448
I love a limber man.

1214
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:57,689
You're late.

1215
00:57:57,793 --> 00:57:58,793
Sorry.

1216
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:03,862
Excuse me, ladies.

1217
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:06,000
Do you all need anything else?

1218
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,340
All right, well, if you
do, my name is Chad.

1219
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:11,448
Do not hesitate to stop me
if you see me because I'm

1220
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:12,724
here for you, all right?

1221
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:13,827
Thank you.

1222
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:28,206
Hi.

1223
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,482
Hey.

1224
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:52,872
I'm coming to say, good night.
- We're good.

1225
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,113
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1226
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:54,862
Good night.

1227
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:55,655
Good night.

1228
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:57,931
Good night, Ty.

1229
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,517
Make any money?

1230
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,448
Yeah, I did OK.

1231
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:02,620
I'm proud of you.

1232
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,137
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1233
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,241
What?

1234
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,827
All the work?

1235
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:09,310
Most millennials I know
love to talk about the work.

1236
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,896
I really haven't met too many
that actually do the work.

1237
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,320
My daddy ain't
raise no punk, so...

1238
00:59:14,275 --> 00:59:15,448
Apparently not.

1239
00:59:16,758 --> 00:59:18,206
I know you're
figuring things out,

1240
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,586
but I've been watching you,
and you're working really hard.

1241
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:22,809
I'm happy I gave you a shot.

1242
00:59:27,206 --> 00:59:31,448
Hey, so...

1243
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:34,137
We're friends, Chad.

1244
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:36,793
I'm OK with that.

1245
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:38,416
And I feel like
there's a, but, coming.

1246
00:59:38,517 --> 00:59:39,241
There isn't a, but.

1247
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:40,827
There's an, and.

1248
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:43,482
And we're friends, and I don't
mix business with pleasure.

1249
00:59:43,586 --> 00:59:45,596
But there could be pleasure
if there was no business.

1250
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,482
I did not say that.

1251
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:47,689
So what are you saying?

1252
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:50,206
I'm saying, good job, homie.

1253
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:52,137
So I'm the homie then?

1254
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,448
Yeah.

1255
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,517
OK.

1256
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,000
After saying, good job, the
guys are saying something else.

1257
01:00:04,655 --> 01:00:08,241
Good job, isn't good enough?

1258
01:00:08,344 --> 01:00:10,172
Yeah.

1259
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:11,103
Thanks.

1260
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:13,586
You're welcome.

1261
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:15,182
So this is the part
where I start calling

1262
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:17,275
you, sister, or, cousin?

1263
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:18,379
Or boss.

1264
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:30,206
All right, so we
have the sandwich here.

1265
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,551
We have the burger here.

1266
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:34,241
And the salad in the middle.

1267
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:37,275
If you guys need anything else,
my name's Chad, all right?

1268
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:38,172
Excuse me.

1269
01:00:38,275 --> 01:00:39,862
You guys OK?

1270
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:41,286
If you need anything,
name is Chad.

1271
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,620
Please call, me all right?

1272
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,448
Thank you.

1273
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:44,310
Are you good?

1274
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:45,413
OK.

1275
01:00:49,137 --> 01:00:52,310
Sir, can I get
you anything else.

1276
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:53,413
No, I'm good.

1277
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:54,586
You know Lola?

1278
01:00:54,689 --> 01:00:55,413
Yeah.

1279
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:56,551
Is she here?

1280
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:58,137
Not yet.

1281
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,121
I was supposed to be
meeting her, but I'm early.

1282
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,172
Oh, OK.

1283
01:01:01,275 --> 01:01:02,493
When she gets in,
I'll let her know.

1284
01:01:02,517 --> 01:01:03,597
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.

1285
01:01:09,517 --> 01:01:11,034
Are you Damien?

1286
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:12,241
Yes, Lola.

1287
01:01:12,344 --> 01:01:14,724
Yup, and you're early.

1288
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:15,896
I like that.

1289
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,068
Follow me to my office.

1290
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:23,482
I did a "Time" magazine

1291
01:01:23,586 --> 01:01:24,724
article on millennials.

1292
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:26,689
There are three
types of millennials.

1293
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,689
They're the ones that
are lazy, entitled,

1294
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:31,793
self-obsessed narcissists.

1295
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,044
And then there is
the ones who are

1296
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,517
open-minded, liberal
self-expressive,

1297
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,931
upbeat, and overly passionate.

1298
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,355
It kind of sounds
like my daughter.

1299
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:39,413
OK.

1300
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:40,827
And the third kind

1301
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,965
are the ones who know how
to turn their followers

1302
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:46,344
and their likes into money.

1303
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:49,137
It's all about the cash.

1304
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:50,413
Which one are you?

1305
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:51,517
You want a taste?

1306
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,551
Nah, we good.

1307
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:56,965
We good.

1308
01:01:57,068 --> 01:01:59,448
I... wow.

1309
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:00,344
Oh, my God,.

1310
01:02:00,448 --> 01:02:01,344
This is so beautiful.

1311
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:02,689
Yeah.

1312
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:03,655
Yeah, it's crazy to
see all that greatness

1313
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:04,872
come from this little thing.

1314
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:06,103
All right,.

1315
01:02:08,206 --> 01:02:09,562
Have you ever noticed
that you're the only one

1316
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:11,103
that laugh at your jokes?

1317
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:14,206
Man, it's because I'm the only
person educated enough to grasp

1318
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,310
my comedic genius.

1319
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:16,689
Bow.

1320
01:02:16,793 --> 01:02:19,517
I have a master's degree.

1321
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,862
What is that supposed to mean?

1322
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:23,103
Well... are you implying
that you're more or less

1323
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:28,241
educated than, say, me, because
I ain't a master's degree but...

1324
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,700
Lola, do you have
a master's degree?

1325
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:30,965
- Sure don't.
- No, I wasn't...

1326
01:02:31,068 --> 01:02:31,827
Shh.

1327
01:02:31,931 --> 01:02:32,655
I wasn't...

1328
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:34,620
At, da, da.

1329
01:02:34,724 --> 01:02:35,448
I wasn't...

1330
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,896
Shh, der, da, der.

1331
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,493
You know I wasn't
trying to say nothing.

1332
01:02:39,517 --> 01:02:42,137
Mmm, just remember that.

1333
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:46,137
Yo, she done yet?

1334
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,379
No.

1335
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:52,793
You know I
didn't mean what I said up...

1336
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:53,620
You're just do.

1337
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:56,000
Don't sweat it.

1338
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:58,827
Some things you just
lie by just doing.

1339
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:00,724
Other things you might
need a master's, bro.

1340
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:01,551
Leave him.

1341
01:03:01,655 --> 01:03:02,655
Alone.

1342
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:08,862
Chad, do you want to snack?

1343
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,482
I got a banana, bag of nubs.

1344
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,103
Don't nobody want your
plant and seeds, OK?

1345
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,655
We need actual food, please.

1346
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:15,551
Nourishment, please?

1347
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:16,655
You know what?

1348
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:19,172
Actually, food does sound good.

1349
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:20,758
What do you guys have in mind?

1350
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,689
Something good.

1351
01:03:22,793 --> 01:03:23,965
Something cheap.

1352
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:25,344
Sounds good to me.

1353
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:32,103
Hey, you got a minute?

1354
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:35,103
JAMIN Yeah, Chad, come on.

1355
01:03:35,206 --> 01:03:37,068
I got a proposal for you.

1356
01:03:37,172 --> 01:03:37,689
Yeah?

1357
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:38,896
Shoot.

1358
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,758
Hire me as your
operations consultant.

1359
01:03:44,827 --> 01:03:46,275
This place has so much potential

1360
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:48,206
to tap into a massive
audience that I don't

1361
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,620
think you can reach without me.

1362
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:50,758
Right.

1363
01:03:50,862 --> 01:03:52,379
Chad, what do you
know about tech?

1364
01:03:52,482 --> 01:03:54,631
I know as much as the next
man walking down the street.

1365
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:57,379
So why would I hire you
as my operational consultant

1366
01:03:57,482 --> 01:03:59,448
if you don't know
anything about tech, Chad?

1367
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:01,482
Because I don't have
to know about tech.

1368
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:02,655
I'm not the tech genius.

1369
01:04:02,758 --> 01:04:03,482
Right.

1370
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:04,344
You are.

1371
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:05,482
That's your job.

1372
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:08,000
But that's not enough.

1373
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:10,379
You got to create an experience.

1374
01:04:10,482 --> 01:04:11,769
You don't want a
bunch of techies.

1375
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:12,896
You want customers, right?

1376
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,310
Chad, I'm still
waiting for a proposal.

1377
01:04:15,413 --> 01:04:17,758
The proposal is trusting
me with your business

1378
01:04:17,862 --> 01:04:19,241
for the next 30 days.

1379
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,182
If I can increase your
traffic and your profit margin

1380
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:23,103
by at least 20%, you'll
hire me for one year

1381
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,137
here as your
operations consultant.

1382
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:29,827
It sounds fairly reasonable.

1383
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:30,689
Uh-huh.

1384
01:04:30,793 --> 01:04:32,000
Mmm-hmm.

1385
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:34,482
So how much am I out
of pocket for 30 days?

1386
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:35,586
Nothing.

1387
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,172
Everything is already here.

1388
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:39,551
Let's put some visuals up, man!

1389
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:40,655
Let's make things pop.

1390
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:41,969
This whole generation is visual.

1391
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:44,448
You've got to give him
something to look at.

1392
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:46,310
Example, right?

1393
01:04:46,413 --> 01:04:48,103
The average person
would not understand,

1394
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:50,310
let alone buy, a
cooler-base computer.

1395
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:51,793
Right.

1396
01:04:51,896 --> 01:04:54,482
However, I would rather hire
somebody who knows how to fix

1397
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:57,137
my phone and my computer,
that knows how to build that,

1398
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:59,724
than deal with some snooty
geek at a corporate store.

1399
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:02,758
Man, every single time someone
walks in here, that 3D printer

1400
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:04,344
should be printing something.

1401
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:05,000
I don't know.

1402
01:05:05,103 --> 01:05:06,000
I don't care.

1403
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:07,689
Phone cases, computer parts.

1404
01:05:07,793 --> 01:05:09,482
It really doesn't matter.

1405
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,896
And when people see that,
they tell the next person,

1406
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,360
and then they tell
the next person,

1407
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:15,148
and they tell the next
person, and so on and so on.

1408
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,692
And that creates the
most powerful form

1409
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:18,275
of marketing, word of mouth.

1410
01:05:18,379 --> 01:05:19,517
And that's just the start.

1411
01:05:21,827 --> 01:05:22,827
All right.

1412
01:05:24,931 --> 01:05:25,724
All right.

1413
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:26,517
Let's see what you got.

1414
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:27,689
We got a deal?

1415
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:28,689
Let's see what you got.

1416
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:29,517
Got you.

1417
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,620
Thank you so much.

1418
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:38,931
How you feeling, champ?

1419
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:40,931
Right as rain.

1420
01:05:41,034 --> 01:05:42,310
I think I'm ready.

1421
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:43,413
Ready for what?

1422
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:46,931
To propose.

1423
01:05:47,034 --> 01:05:48,586
Propose what?

1424
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:50,068
Nah, it's a joke.

1425
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:52,620
I'm ready to make
a proposal to you.

1426
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:53,793
Don't play.

1427
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:55,344
I'm not.

1428
01:05:55,448 --> 01:05:57,896
I just signed Jamin, tech
genius to a one-year consulting

1429
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,724
contract.

1430
01:05:58,827 --> 01:05:59,862
What?

1431
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:00,793
Oh, my God.

1432
01:06:00,896 --> 01:06:02,379
Congratulations.

1433
01:06:02,482 --> 01:06:03,689
Thank you.

1434
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,827
I want to do the same thing
for you at Copper Coin.

1435
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:07,344
What?

1436
01:06:07,448 --> 01:06:10,931
Copper Coin is killing it.

1437
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,448
OK.

1438
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,413
It is.

1439
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:14,517
If you say so.

1440
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:18,971
What did you have in mind?

1441
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:22,044
You have to highlight
what's best about us.

1442
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:23,103
And what is that?

1443
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,379
Great music, great coffee.

1444
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,551
Every time I've been
there, it feels like home.

1445
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,000
But sometimes that
can pose a problem.

1446
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:36,068
I mean, the
comfortable environment

1447
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:40,310
can come off lazy to the
clients that we serve.

1448
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,827
We have great
service at Copper Coin.

1449
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,344
I didn't say you did.

1450
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm... but when's the last
time you revised the menus?

1451
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,172
What's wrong with the menu?

1452
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:52,551
I didn't say there
was anything wrong,

1453
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:56,793
but a couple of vegan
options wouldn't hurt, right?

1454
01:06:56,896 --> 01:06:58,586
Vegan?

1455
01:06:58,689 --> 01:07:00,355
Uh-huh, you have to
stay ahead of the wave.

1456
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:02,827
Having it is better
than not having it.

1457
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:04,517
It's just good business.

1458
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,862
Well, if that's what they
want, then I shall provide.

1459
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:11,655
I tell you what.

1460
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:12,862
Let's pop in there.

1461
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:14,044
Let's talk to some
of your customers

1462
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:16,448
and see what they want.

1463
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:17,671
But I know it's a good idea.

1464
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,103
Hey, yo.

1465
01:07:32,206 --> 01:07:33,034
So this is the nigger that
you going around with?

1466
01:07:33,137 --> 01:07:34,379
Let me take this.

1467
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:35,962
You get the fuck out
of my restaurant,

1468
01:07:36,034 --> 01:07:37,379
or you get dragged the fuck out.

1469
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:39,182
I seriously doubt that
shit going to happen.

1470
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:40,379
Why are you even here?

1471
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:41,976
I told you we should've
got a restraining

1472
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,113
order on this punk ass bitch.

1473
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:44,137
You a scrub.

1474
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:45,862
Do something I dare you.

1475
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:47,275
I already called the police.

1476
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:48,586
So you want to run up, nigger?

1477
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,551
Run up.

1478
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:50,206
Run up.

1479
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,310
Yo, it's OK.

1480
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:55,896
What are you doing?

1481
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,965
I'm sorry about that, bro.

1482
01:07:58,068 --> 01:07:59,275
It's OK.

1483
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:00,389
You know we're not
going to let anything

1484
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:03,241
happen to you out here, bro.

1485
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:05,034
Strong, man.

1486
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:06,827
Yeah, let's go home.

1487
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:08,137
Yeah.

1488
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,827
The night's just
getting started, love.

1489
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:11,413
You ready to go home, Chad?

1490
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,551
Yeah, I think so.

1491
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:16,241
Thanks for having
my back over there.

1492
01:08:16,344 --> 01:08:19,758
You're one of us now.

1493
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,172
All right.

1494
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:28,034
Uh, hello Can
somebody get the door?

1495
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,137
Damn.

1496
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,344
Hey.

1497
01:08:43,448 --> 01:08:45,448
Hey.

1498
01:08:45,551 --> 01:08:49,103
Um, this is where you said
you would be if we needed you.

1499
01:08:49,206 --> 01:08:50,206
Yeah.

1500
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:54,620
Going to let me in?

1501
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:56,137
Oh, yeah, of course,
please, please.

1502
01:08:56,241 --> 01:08:57,241
Come in.

1503
01:09:06,724 --> 01:09:09,758
This is it.

1504
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:18,172
Mrs.?

1505
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:19,965
Hey.

1506
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:21,758
Hey.

1507
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:23,034
You remember me?

1508
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:24,379
Jacob!

1509
01:09:24,482 --> 01:09:26,344
No.

1510
01:09:26,448 --> 01:09:28,586
High school?

1511
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:31,862
Me and Chad were roommates
freshman year in college.

1512
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,379
You look different.

1513
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:35,562
Yeah, a lot of things have
changed since high school.

1514
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,310
Chad?

1515
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:41,655
Is this why you moved from home?

1516
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:42,758
Oh, no, ma'am.

1517
01:09:42,827 --> 01:09:43,551
No, ma'am.

1518
01:09:43,655 --> 01:09:46,137
No, not at all.

1519
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:48,689
Is this where you're sleeping?

1520
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah, this is my spot.

1521
01:09:52,103 --> 01:09:54,413
Hi, who's is?

1522
01:09:54,517 --> 01:09:55,827
This is my mother.

1523
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:57,103
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

1524
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,965
Hi, Vanessa.

1525
01:09:59,068 --> 01:09:59,827
I'm Lola.

1526
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:02,034
Hi, Lola.

1527
01:10:02,137 --> 01:10:03,517
Chad, can we talk?

1528
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,241
Yes.

1529
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:06,931
Yes, we can talk.

1530
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:07,758
Oh, sorry.

1531
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:08,586
Sorry.

1532
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:09,551
Vanessa, come.

1533
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:10,206
Sorry.

1534
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,344
Sorry.

1535
01:10:25,862 --> 01:10:27,344
Your father is very upset.

1536
01:10:29,862 --> 01:10:32,000
Yeah.

1537
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,896
Yeah.

1538
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,172
What is wrong, Chad?

1539
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:36,655
What's wrong?

1540
01:10:36,758 --> 01:10:38,838
What do you... just tell me
what do you need, and I'll

1541
01:10:38,862 --> 01:10:39,931
make sure that you get it.

1542
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:41,458
I just want to figure
things out by myself.

1543
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:44,068
But we need you at home.

1544
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:45,206
And what about Paris?

1545
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,689
She's beside herself.

1546
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:48,310
OK, well I'll have to call her.

1547
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:49,931
You have to do more than that.

1548
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:53,655
That's all I can do right now.

1549
01:10:58,827 --> 01:11:03,482
Chad, I'm sick.

1550
01:11:03,586 --> 01:11:07,206
In three weeks, I have to
have a surgery to remove

1551
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,206
a mass from my breast.

1552
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,310
What?

1553
01:11:11,344 --> 01:11:13,551
No, what are you talking about?

1554
01:11:13,655 --> 01:11:15,724
Look, I've already
seen the specialist,

1555
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:19,068
and they've assured me that,
after these treatments,

1556
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:20,620
that I will probably be OK.

1557
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:21,827
Probably.

1558
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:24,310
Mom, what does... what
does, probably, mean?

1559
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:25,413
Chad, I have cancer.

1560
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,275
But I have to have this
surgery in three weeks,

1561
01:11:30,379 --> 01:11:33,310
and then there are some
post-operative things

1562
01:11:33,413 --> 01:11:34,793
that I have to do.

1563
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:37,655
But they said, after I do
this, that I will be fine.

1564
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:42,172
Your dad and I... we have some
of the best doctors on this,

1565
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:44,620
and they've assured me
that I will be fine.

1566
01:11:44,724 --> 01:11:47,655
So I know what I need to do,
and I'm not telling you this

1567
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:50,000
to try to get you to come home.

1568
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:53,517
It's just that I want you to
figure things out for yourself.

1569
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,896
I do.

1570
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,976
And I drove all the way out
here to see you in person.

1571
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,482
I'm sorry I just showed up.

1572
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:01,241
But I wanted to say this in
person and not over the phone.

1573
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:04,689
For a little while.

1574
01:12:04,793 --> 01:12:07,689
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1575
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:12,379
Chad, it just...

1576
01:12:12,482 --> 01:12:15,068
Just... it's so much going on.

1577
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:17,034
There's so much happening.

1578
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:18,172
You knew when I was home?

1579
01:12:18,275 --> 01:12:19,758
Yeah, we did, but we were still

1580
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:22,724
waiting for the full diagnosis,
so there was nothing to say.

1581
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:25,448
Mom, you should have told me.

1582
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:27,448
No, we felt it was
more important to get

1583
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,068
you back on track first.

1584
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:31,113
Don't you think I should have
been a part of that decision?

1585
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:31,896
No, I didn't.

1586
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,103
I didn't.

1587
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:33,965
No.

1588
01:12:34,068 --> 01:12:34,827
Yeah, bro.

1589
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:36,000
Your mom is sick.

1590
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,137
Jacob.

1591
01:12:37,241 --> 01:12:38,241
My bad.

1592
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:41,769
Look, I'm going
to be there for you.

1593
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,793
Just give me time to just
tie up some things here,

1594
01:12:43,896 --> 01:12:47,103
and I promise you I'm going to
be there for you ..

1595
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:50,413
OK.

1596
01:12:53,655 --> 01:12:57,931
Well, I'm going to head back
to Charlotte before your dad

1597
01:12:58,034 --> 01:12:59,068
does something drastic.

1598
01:13:04,344 --> 01:13:07,482
Um, it's nice to meet everyone.

1599
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:09,172
Bye, Mrs. Sterling.

1600
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:10,517
Nice to meet you.

1601
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:14,147
Jacob, it's good
to see you again.

1602
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:14,896
Yes, ma'am.

1603
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You take care.

1604
01:13:25,137 --> 01:13:29,310
Um, mom, thank you for coming.

1605
01:13:29,413 --> 01:13:31,310
I love you.

1606
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:32,655
I love you.

1607
01:13:32,758 --> 01:13:33,758
Mmm.

1608
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,965
OK, baby.

1609
01:13:50,724 --> 01:13:52,689
I'm way proud of you.

1610
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:55,137
I feel like you
deserve a reward.

1611
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:56,379
For what?

1612
01:13:56,482 --> 01:13:58,310
For taking a road
less traveled, Chad.

1613
01:13:58,413 --> 01:13:59,413
I'm proud of you.

1614
01:13:59,448 --> 01:14:01,517
You should be proud of yourself.

1615
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,655
Thank you.

1616
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:06,137
You remember that guy,
Damien, that came to my spot

1617
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,172
a while back with the suit?

1618
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:11,000
Yeah, I remember Damien.

1619
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:13,137
Well, he represents
a restaurant group here

1620
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,172
in Atlanta, and they've
had their eye on Copper

1621
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:18,517
Coin for some time now.

1622
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,896
They bought us out.

1623
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,206
I brought up some of your ideas
in the meeting, might have set

1624
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,896
us over the top.

1625
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,103
This is good?

1626
01:14:29,206 --> 01:14:30,310
Yes.

1627
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:31,275
Oh, wow, great, cool.

1628
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:33,275
They cut me a nice check.

1629
01:14:33,379 --> 01:14:36,034
My restaurant is
under their umbrella.

1630
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:38,586
They like my style.

1631
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:41,655
I can get that.

1632
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:43,620
Guess who else gets broken off?

1633
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:47,172
What's broke?

1634
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,517
A check.

1635
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,034
Oh, who?

1636
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:51,862
You.

1637
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:52,551
Me?

1638
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,655
Yes, you.

1639
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,310
I want to hire you
next year to be Copper

1640
01:15:04,413 --> 01:15:06,931
Coin's business consultant.

1641
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:09,275
I mean, you can still
wait tables if you want.

1642
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,931
It's up to you.

1643
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,379
Thank you.

1644
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:17,241
I love you.

1645
01:15:17,344 --> 01:15:18,344
You're amazing.

1646
01:15:21,034 --> 01:15:22,137
Thank you.

1647
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:22,965
I love you.

1648
01:15:23,068 --> 01:15:23,827
You're amazing.

1649
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:24,655
Thank you.

1650
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:27,310
I'm going to be right back.

1651
01:15:27,413 --> 01:15:28,172
I need this.

1652
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:30,172
Thank you so much.

1653
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,275
I'm sorry.

1654
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:32,068
I'll be right back.

1655
01:15:32,172 --> 01:15:32,965
Excuse me.

1656
01:15:33,068 --> 01:15:34,068
Yeah, wait.

1657
01:15:39,137 --> 01:15:40,137
Thanks.

1658
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:59,068
Hey, is that for mom?

1659
01:15:59,172 --> 01:16:00,413
Yeah.

1660
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:02,557
Do you mind if I take it
up to her when you're done?

1661
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,758
Nah, go ahead.

1662
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,310
Here, mom.

1663
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,689
Thank you.

1664
01:16:31,793 --> 01:16:33,620
How are you?

1665
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:36,206
I'm good.

1666
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,206
How are you?

1667
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,551
I'm OK.

1668
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:41,344
I'd be better if
dad didn't hate me.

1669
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:46,344
You just need to talk to him.

1670
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:47,551
He doesn't hate you.

1671
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:49,655
You're the only
person he listens to.

1672
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:50,965
Can you talk to him, please?

1673
01:16:56,517 --> 01:17:01,034
Directness works
with your father.

1674
01:17:01,137 --> 01:17:04,137
Clarity... that works with you.

1675
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,517
OK.

1676
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,620
OK.

1677
01:17:19,896 --> 01:17:22,724
You know, what happened
was necessary for me

1678
01:17:22,827 --> 01:17:24,206
to be the man you want me to be.

1679
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,103
You know that, right?

1680
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:27,206
So say you.

1681
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:34,758
Answer me this.

1682
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:37,413
Did you do everything your
father told you to do?

1683
01:17:42,482 --> 01:17:44,103
What's game plan?

1684
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,517
Hmm?

1685
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,793
Do we have one?

1686
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:51,827
Yeah, we do.

1687
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:53,527
I just signed Mr Burke
as my third client,

1688
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:54,551
so I'm in business.

1689
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:12,655
All right, so what
do you need from me?

1690
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:14,413
Nothing.

1691
01:18:14,517 --> 01:18:15,517
What do you want?

1692
01:18:20,724 --> 01:18:23,551
When you look
at him and he looks at you...

1693
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,310
Before we close... your father...

1694
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:30,827
If he had to ask you what you
wanted, what you wanted, Chad,

1695
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:32,241
what would be your answer?

1696
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:38,137
This whole run, this whole run.

1697
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:42,586
And my plan, what I want is
to make sure that I make them

1698
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:47,896
proud every single day, make
sure that they get to reap

1699
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,620
the benefits of all
of my hard work,

1700
01:18:51,724 --> 01:18:53,241
their hard work raising me.

1701
01:18:53,344 --> 01:18:56,379
And... and most
importantly, I want

1702
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:04,482
to make sure I can steer this
ship that is my life without...

1703
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:09,620
Without making the same mistakes
that I've always made before.

1704
01:19:09,724 --> 01:19:12,931
I commend you for that honest
answer, and that's why I wanted

1705
01:19:13,034 --> 01:19:15,241
to bring you on the show,
is that "Money Making"

1706
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:18,482
"Conversation" allows CEOs,
industry decision-makers,

1707
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:21,517
celebrities, and athletes
to tell their story.

1708
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,379
Yeah.

1709
01:19:22,482 --> 01:19:23,655
Thank you.

1710
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:25,217
It's crazy to even
be in that category

1711
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:26,965
or in the alumni
of amazing people

1712
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:28,448

1713
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:29,551
So thank you so much...

- Thank you.
- for having me.

1715
01:19:30,793 --> 01:19:31,965
Appreciate you.

1716

Keep being successful,
and keep winning.

1717
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:34,551
Thank you.
