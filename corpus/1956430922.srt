in our lifetimes,

34
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:47,567
we saw the words, "Bush," "operation,"
and "success"

35
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,000
in the same sentence.

(laughing)

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,800
...which is what happens
when a guy fucks up so much

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,233
that when he fucks up again,

43
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,934
people go,
"Well, what do you expect?"

00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,767

00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,700
that history will be
kind to him.

Not appreciated
in this lifetime.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,767
I swear to god,
a couple of weeks ago he was defending his legacy,

57
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:37,300
and he said,
"They're still debating our first president."

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,500
No, they're not.

00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,300

That's about as Kim Jong-il as we're gonna get in America.

71
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:21,033
Rudy Giuliani,
another brilliant assessor of people and presidents.

72
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,200
He actually brags
on the campaign trail

73
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
that--
(laughs)

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,433
on 9/11, as the towers
are going down,

75
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:33,166
he turned to his
super corrupt chief of police...

76
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,767
(laughs)

77
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:39,166
...and said,
"Thank god George Bush is president."

78
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,834
That alone
should disqualify a person

79
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,367
from any higher office.

80
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,633
(Applause)

81
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:46,867
Oh my god.

82
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, right, Rudy.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,667
Whenever I'm looking
down the barrel

84
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,700
of Muslim fundamentalists
with nuclear ambitions,

85
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,667
I want a guy who's
not smarter than a fifth-grader

86
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,834
to be heading up our team.

87
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,967
(Chuckles)

88
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,700
I kid George Bush
with love.

89
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,166
I hope that comes through.

90
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,867
(Laughing)

91
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,400
Because when it comes
to who's standing on rubble,

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,300
and making speeches
in front of trees,

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,700
and hugging black kids,
he's the best.

94
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,934
(Laughing)

95
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,367
He is.
And praying.

96
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,533
(Chuckles)
America.

97
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,166
I swear to god,
what a country.

98
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,734
The way we have a disaster--
whenever there's a disaster,

99
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,834
Bush shows up and says,
"I'm gonna pray."

100
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,533
And people go,
"Wow, he's on it."

101
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,200
(Laughing)

102
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,867
We got this covered,
because he's praying,

103
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:40,400
which is nearly as good as
hoping it were so.

104
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,533
(Laughing)

105
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,667
And that's why I'm telling you,
Rudy Giuliani is probably gonna be

106
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,967
the next president
of the United States.

107
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,533
(Groaning)
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,800
(Booing)

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,266
Because it's all about image.

110
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,133
He's got the big
anti-terrorist image, you know.

111
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,667
And I'm telling you,
on January 20th, 2009,

112
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,033
you may very well be welcoming
to the White House,

113
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,967
Rudy Giuliani
and his lovely wife,

114
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,934
whoever that may be
at the time.

115
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,333
We don't-- We don't know that now.
(Laughing)

116
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,800
(chuckling)

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,567
I love it.
He's had three wives.

118
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,834
Right?

119
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,533
Uh, McCain; two wives.

120
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,800
Uh, Fred Thompson;
two wives.

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,433
Newt Gingrich; three wives.

122
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:28,333

Mitt Romney, the Mormon.

125
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,233
And... (chuckles)
(applause continues)

126
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,600
You know this too,
that Rudy's first wife

127
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
was his cousin.
I'm not making that up.

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,967
I think that is a very cheap way
to go after the Southern vote.

129
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,500
That's--
(laughing)

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,834
(groaning)
That's insulting to the South.

131
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,567
(Chuckles)

132
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,800
And on the Democratic side,

133
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,934
you know that
the only two candidates

134
00:05:57,934 --> 00:06:02,033
who could not actually run
together on a ticket

135
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,100
are Hillary and Barack Obama,

136
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,867
because that's too much non-male whiteness at one time for America.

137
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,467
They would freak out.

138
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:13,600
And the Republicans would have a field day if they ran together.

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,734
First, Bush would call,
like, 12 fake terror alerts.

140
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,867
(Laughing)

141
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,900
And then the Republicans
would run like a series of ads

142
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,567
about how terrorism
is happening now, again!

143
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:31,567
And the wolf is at the door,
and this is no time to trust the country

144
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,600
to a woman and a black teenager.

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,700
(Laughing)

146
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,100
Rudy Giuliani, vote for him.
He knows...

147
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,200
He was there, you know.

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,734
(Sighs)

149
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,367
Yeah, 'cause they did
so well before-- the white men.

150
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:49,000
Like, I flew in yesterday.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,734
I wish someone would just start

152
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:53,133
Fly At Your Own Risk Airlines.

153
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,166
How about that?
(Laughing)

154
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,266
You can... (chuckles)
(applause)

155
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,633
You can have your hair gel.
You can have your lighter.

156
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,200
You can have fuckin' gun.
How about that?

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,934
(Laughing)

158
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:08,734
You can show up at the gate five minutes before the plane leaves,

159
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:12,700
and pay in cash
like in the good old 1980s.

160
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,867
(Cheering, applause)

161
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,633
The ticket just says,
"Shit happens," on the back

162
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:25,200
because that's the way it is
anyway in this country.

163
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,934
This country needs
to get over itself, seriously.

164
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:30,066
It's not the 1950s anymore.

165
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,834
We're not the most efficient.

166
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,667
We're not the most healthy.

167
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,467
We're not the most respected.

168
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,066
I'm not hating on America.
These are facts.

169
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,400
This is a challenge to America.

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,567
I'm tired of people saying,
"This is the greatest country in the world."

171
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,967
How would you know?
(Laughing)

172
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,166
Always from the people
who've never been anywhere.

173
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,867
Just pulling it
out of their ass.

174
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,767
It's the greatest country--
you know.

175
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,166
(Applause)

176
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,333
Why can't it just be
the greatest country for us?

177
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm not asking for the check,

178
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,800
but it's so childish.

179
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
"Greatest country in the world."

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,967
It's like saying,
"I have the greatest wife in the world."

181
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,667
(Laughing)

182
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,800
"Not just the one
best suited for me.

183
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,834
"The greatest wife
in the world,

184
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:18,467
"and if you could have my wife,
you would kill your wife."

185
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,600
(Laughing)

186
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,700
But, look, you know what?

187
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,800
I do understand that any country
that lets me run my mouth

188
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,734
the way I do in public
deserves to be saved.

189
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,033
(Cheering, applause)
I'm trying.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,633
No, I do.
I...

191
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:42,100
(applause continues)

192
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,233
I love America.

193
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,600
It's Americans I can't stand.

194
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
These are the people.

195
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,800
But not all Americans,

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,533
just the ones who work backwards
from the notion

197
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,133
that we're the real Americans.

198
00:08:56,133 --> 00:09:00,533
If anything characterizes this Bush Administration,
it's that.

199
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:04,367
The idea that,
"We're the good people from the get-go.

200
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:07,033
"That's a known fact,
you know.

201
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,233
"We love Jesus
and fuck our wives.

202
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,767
"We're the good people."

203
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,567
(Laughing)

204
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:16,200
"So whatever we have to do
to stay in power,

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,500
"steal elections,
tap your phones,

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,100
"politicize
the justice department,

207
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,567
"that's justified because we're
the real Americans."

208
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,500
A couple of months ago
at the State--

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,800
(stammers)
The, uh...

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,633
Correspondents' Dinner,
Sheryl Crow was there.

211
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,834
She went up to Karl Rove.
She wanted to talk to him.

212
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,300
He wouldn't talk to her,
and she said,

213
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,500
"You have to talk to me.
You work for me."

214
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,467
And he said, "No, I work
for the American people."

215
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,800
(Laughing)

216
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,567
You see, that's the attitude.

217
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,467
You're Sheryl Crow.
You're in rock 'n' roll.

218
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,767
Ew.

219
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,600
You've had many penises
inside of you.

220
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,300
Ew.
(Laughing)

221
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
(chuckles)

222
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,133
You could be some kind
of a Jew.

223
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,200
I mean, you know--
(laughing)

224
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
It's like when Ann Coulter
called John Edwards a faggot.

225
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,834
I-- I didn't even know
what that meant.

226
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,300
I wasn't offended.
I was like,

227
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,667
"Why is he a faggot?
He combs his hair?"

228
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,533
(Laughing)

229
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,967
But, no, then I got
that mindset.

230
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:21,300
She wasn't saying that John Edwards is a bathhouse homosexual.

231
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,800
She meant "faggot" like,
"He's a liberal pussy.

232
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,667
You know,
somebody who reads."

233
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,667
(Chuckles)

234
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,700
And listens to other people.

235
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,100
(Laughing)

236
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,266
Fag stuff.

237
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,367
(Laughing)

238
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,934
Whereas the conservatives
are all macho bluster.

239
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:44,300
All pro-gun, and pro-death,
and pro-torture.

240
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,000
You know, real men,
who go off in the woods

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,934
and blast each other
in the face from time to time.

242
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,700
(Applause)

243
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,266
Real men who...

244
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,900
you know...

245
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,734
kill birds that don't fly.

246
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,767
I love that.
(Laughing)

247
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,967
Cheney, hunting on a private ranch from a car.

248
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,834
I'm not kidding.
They went in a car.

249
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,867
Pull over.
I wanna kill that.

250
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,033
(Laughing)

251
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,867
No fag stuff.
We're in a car killing things.

252
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:19,066
What could be more macho
than cars and killing?

253
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:22,133
You know,
our outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

254
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,367
General Peter Pace,

255
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,133
who, uh,
when he was in Iraq,

256
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,900
picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

257
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,500
(Laughing)

258
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,567
(chuckles)

259
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,233
He--
(chuckles)

260
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,433
General Peter Pace said
he didn't want any homosexuals

261
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:39,100
in his army,
because homosexuality was immoral.

262
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,033
Well, you know what,
General Peter Pace? Maybe that's true,

263
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:46,133
but at least they know when to pull out of a shit hole.

264
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,266
(Cheering, applause)

265
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:53,066
I had to...

266
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,166
(sighs)

267
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:06,600
The ego of this surge
of George Bush's,

268
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,300
that he can think that everybody else is wrong but me,

269
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,734
he is gonna bring democracy
and freedom to the Iraqi people

270
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,667
if he has to kill
every last one of them.

271
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,367
(Laughing)

272
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,266
Because we did have an election
about this, remember?

273
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,200
The people said,
"No, I think this war is over.

274
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,266
"We don't like it."

275
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,834
Even his own party
is against it now,

276
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,867
but George Bush,
all by himself--

277
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,467
"The Decider."

278
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,000
(Laughing)

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,033
Just spitballing. You know,
thinking outside the box.

280
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,166
(Laughing)

281
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,400
You know what?
Thinking outside the box is for smart people.

282
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,166
(Applause)

283
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,100
The box is for you.

284
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
You need the box.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,633
Stay inside the box.

286
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,767
(Cheering, applause)

287
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,333
Yeah, let's attack
the wrong country.

288
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,633
They won't be expecting that.

289
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,467
(Laughing)

290
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,166
Outside the box,
I'll give you that.

291
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,400
That is outside the box.

292
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,700
What a...
(chuckles)

293
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,767
What a clown
on the world's stage, you know.

294
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,700
A couple of months ago,
he and Laura went off

295
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,734
to the big G8 Summit
in Germany,

296
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,633
and I'm sure the Europeans
are always thrilled when

297
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,367
the Duke and Duchess
of Hazzard...

298
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,900
(laughing)

299
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,533
...jet in...

300
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,633
(chuckles)

301
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,734
...to lend
a little superpower charm

302
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,700
to old Europe.
But--

303
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,533
(laughing)

304
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:46,100
George Bush said he looked
into Vladimir Putin's eyes--

305
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,734
You know this--
and saw his soul.

306
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,867
(Laughs)
(audience laughing)

307
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,734
Exactly.

308
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,600
Now, of all the people in the world who couldn't do this,

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
I would have to say
George Bush, top of my list.

310
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,467
I mean--
(laughing)

311
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,900
And of all the people
you couldn't do this to...

312
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,433
(laughing)

313
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,734
Vladimir Putin.

314
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:10,266
I looked into his eyes,
I saw Lucifer.

315
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,033
(Laughing)
I--

316
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:18,734
I saw black pools
of ex-KGB deadness.

317
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,233
(Laughing)

318
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,333
But George Bush,
god bless him, looked and...

319
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,066
See, that's the problem with religious people like George Bush.

320
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:32,467
They think they have powers
that the rest of us don't have.

321
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:36,600
That's why George Bush never
thought he needed to learn

322
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,800
or read about Iraq,

323
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,300
because he prayed.

324
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,800
He prayed to Santa Jesus.

325
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,934
(Laughing)

326
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,633
And...

327
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:55,567
I saw a couple--
(laughs)

328
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,300
A couple of months ago,
the President was on "60 Minutes,"

329
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,900
and he said that he was
reading a book.

330
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,133
(Laughing)

331
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,934
I was very impressed.
And, uh...

332
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,700
and it was the book
about the Algerian Civil War,

333
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,700
and, yes,
Algeria had a Muslim insurgency in the 1950s

334
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,433
against a Western power,
France.

335
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,967
What a good book to read,
maybe, before...

336
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,166
(laughing)

337
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,100
...you invaded Iraq.

338
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,100
But, okay, I'll take
what I can get.

339
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,900
He's reading a book,
but, of course,

340
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
President Numbnuts takes away
from the book

341
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,133
the exact wrong message,
because if George Bush is about anything with Iraq

342
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:40,667
it's about the idea that if we don't beat them there,
they're gonna follow us home.

343
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:44,600
Yeah, 'cause that's exactly what happened with the French in Algeria.

344
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,500
They pulled out of Algeria,
and they got followed home.

345
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,767
(Sparse laughing)

346
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:53,100
That's why the Eiffel Tower
today is a 7-11.

347
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,433
(Laughing)

348
00:15:55,433 --> 00:16:00,100
And the Cannes Film Festival
is run by Ayatollahs.

349
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,166
They'll follow us home.
What are they, Lassie?

350
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,667
(Laughing)

351
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,000
(chuckles)

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,567
Can I keep him, Mom?
He followed me home.

353
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:13,834
No, Billy, he's a terrorist.
Of course you can't.

354
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,033
This whole war
has been run on slogans.

355
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:21,433
George Bush,
when you pull his string, says, like, five things.

356
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,333
(Sparse laughing)

357
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,033
And they all have to be
under 10 words,

358
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,300
or else people...
you know.

359
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,333
"If we don't beat them there,
they'll follow us home."

360
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,934
(Laughing)

361
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:36,100
"The world is better off
without Saddam."

362
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,100
"They hate us for our freedom."

363
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,500
(Laughing)

364
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
"We're fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them here."

365
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,867
(Laughing)

366
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,133
(exhales)

367
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,700
(laughing)

368
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,400
And my favorite,

369
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,066
"We used to think oceans
could protect us."

370
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,767
(Laughing)

371
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,300
No, we didn't.
(Chuckles)

372
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,934
You did.

373
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,066
You thought that.
(Applause)

374
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,567
We knew our enemies had figured out boats and flying machines.

375
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:22,066
Yes, we knew that here,
in Tax-achussetts.

376
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,400
(Groaning)

377
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,033
You know, Senator John McCain
went to Baghdad recently.

378
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,633
Again, on one of his
not-listening tours.

379
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,767
(Laughing)

380
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,266
To show how good
it's going on over there,

381
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,500
and his traveling partner,
Senator Lindsey Graham.

382
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,433
Uh...

383
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,900
You know, they--
(chuckles)

384
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,367
He said at the press conference
that they went to the market.

385
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:49,100
He said,
"I bought five rugs for $5."

386
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,633
Oh, great, you cheap,
stupid fuck.

387
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,033
(Laughing)

388
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,633
Now we're not just invading them
and killing them,

389
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,266
we're ripping them off too.

390
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,600
The American trifecta.

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,633
Great, way to win hearts
and minds in the Muslim world.

392
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,400
Good.
Jew down the people who hate the Jews.

393
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,467
That's-- that's--

394
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,600
That's a great "stragedy."
(Laughing)

395
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
'Cause, you know,
at least we're not dealing with people

396
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,000
who hold a grudge.
(Laughing)

397
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,133
I mean, you realize
that this Iraqi Army,

398
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,734
the "Not Ready
for Prime Time Fighters..."

399
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,600
(laughing)

400
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,100
...they're never going
to stand up,

401
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,800
because they don't care
about Iraq.

402
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,266
They care about Sunnis
and Shiites.

403
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:39,333
Iraq has only been a country
since 1932.

404
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,533
Paul Newman is seven years older
than Iraq.

405
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,700
(Laughing)

406
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,033
What--
(chuckles)

407
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:49,000
What do we care about fighting
for the borders of Iraq?

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,333
I know George Bush is fond of saying
that democracy can work anywhere.

409
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,767
Maybe not.

410
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,967
Maybe it's like when Elton John
tried to marry that chick.

411
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,533
(Laughing)

412
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,967
Good try.
(Chuckles)

413
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,133
And, of course, the reason
that we can't leave Iraq now

414
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,000
is because the people

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,400
who predicted everything wrong
about going into Iraq,

416
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,133
that we'd find the weapons,
we'd be greeted as liberators,

417
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:28,433
the oil would pay for the war,
every prediction dead wrong,

418
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,567
are now the ones who are predicting what will happen if we leave.

419
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,533
Syria will come from the west,

420
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,033
and then Iran will come up
from the east,

421
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:40,000
and that'll bring in
Borat's country.

422
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,066
(Laughing)

423
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,400
(chuckles)

424
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
You know what, Nostradamus?
Hand over the Magic 8-Ball.

425
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,166
I think you've had
enough shots at this.

426
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,300
(Applause)

427
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,600
Oh god.

428
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,433
Why don't we just
declare victory and get out.

429
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:06,200
I mean, this is the biggest "let's not and
say we did" country that ever was anyway.

430
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Right?
Everything is, you know--

431
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,266
Clean up New Orleans?

432
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,633
(Muffled)
Let's not and say we did.

433
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,433
(Laughing)

434
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,367
Protect the ports
or the nuclear plant?

435
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,367
(Muffled)
Let's not and say we did.

436
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,800
No Child Left Behind.

437
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,867
That's a good "let's not and say we did," huh?

438
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,600
Yeah, 'cause the conservatives
don't really care

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,333
about educating your children.

440
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,567
What they care about
is that teenagers don't fuck.

441
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,367
(Sparse laughing)

442
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,800
Which is an easy goal,
'cause teenagers aren't horny, you know.

443
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,200
(Laughing)

444
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
(chuckles)
But, yes, they've spent

445
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,934
billions of your tax dollars

446
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:47,600
to start abstinence clubs
in the high schools.

447
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,100
Making the kids take
the abstinence pledge.

448
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,700
The big pledge.

449
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,567
And, of course,
they make them do this with a big lie,

450
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,967
'cause they tell them,
"You know what?

451
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,667
"The only way to really be safe
is not to have sex at all,

452
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,433
"because condoms?
Very unreliable.

453
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:07,300
"Condoms break all the time."

454
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,900
Okay, I've been using
these things for 35 years.

455
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,533
I've never had one condom break.

456
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:16,133
Either I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch who ever was,

457
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,233
and I'm not,

458
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:22,700
or this is the most reliable
product since the toaster.

459
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,600
(Laughing, applause)

460
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,200
But...
(chuckles)

461
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,200
(applause continues)

462
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,233
But you know what?
The abstinence pledge program

463
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,700
didn't work anyway.
(Chuckles)

464
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,834
Listen to this,
they found out that among the high school girls

465
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,066
who took the abstinence pledge,

466
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,233
they are six times more likely
to be engaging in oral sex...

467
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,433
(chuckles)
(laughing)

468
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,533
...and four times more likely--
anal.

469
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,333
(Laughing)
I love this.

470
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,734
I love this!

471
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,767
(Chuckles)

472
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,900
The Republicans
have managed to create

473
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,934
an entire generation
of apple-cheeked young girls...

474
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,767
(chuckles)
(laughing)

475
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:08,734
...saying to their boyfriends, "Oh, no,
I'm saving myself for Mr. Right."

476
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:09,734
(Breathes deeply)

477
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:11,567
"Fuck me in the ass.
Go ahead.

478
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,834
(Laughing)
"Just...

479
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:17,800
"pump me like the piston on an old iron train."
(Cheering, applause)

480
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
I love it.

481
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,700
I kid the Republicans.

482
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,233
I hope I'm not piling on.

483
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,233
(Laughing)

484
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:31,100
Well, I'm sorry,
but they can't govern,

485
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,367
and they can't govern because they don't care about governing.

486
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,667
That's not what they're good at.

487
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,400
They're good at winning elections,
but governing?

488
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,967
Please, they run on a platform
of government is inefficient.

489
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,567
Yes, the way you do it.

490
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,233
(Laughing)

491
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:50,767
This is the crowd that wants
to build a 700 mile wall

492
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:54,500
along our 2,100 mile-long border
with Mexico.

493
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,200
(Laughing, applause)

494
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,767
(chuckles)

495
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,100
You know what?

496
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,433
I think instead of building a wall along the border,

497
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,967
build a Walmart.

498
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,633
Build a 2,100 mile-long Walmart,

499
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,600
and the workers could come
in the back.

500
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,133
(Laughing) The shoppers could come in the front.

501
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,100
Just like anywhere else
in America.

502
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,233
(Cheering, applause)

503
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,500
But it would be
2,100 miles long,

504
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,367
and still the one register open.

505
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,500
(Laughing)

506
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:38,200
You know, I understand
why rich people vote Republican.

507
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,533
I never will understand why poor people vote for the Republicans.

508
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:46,166
I mean, no offense,
but they are just tricked into doing it.

509
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,633
And it is sort of
what fucks up democracy,

510
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:53,467
because the regular people need to actually vote their interests,

511
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,600
'cause if they don't,
the only thing--

512
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,967
That's all we have left.

513
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:59,900
Otherwise, the lobbyists,
and the corporations,

514
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,200
and the moneyed interests win.

515
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,433
That's why democracy
doesn't work anymore,

516
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,800
because the lobbyists win.

517
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,500
And, you know,
lobbying stories never make the TV news.

518
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,333
So I'm gonna tell
a few tonight.

519
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,967
Here's one of my favorites.
The FCC,

520
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,100
the governing body in Washington
that was so outraged

521
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,500
that Janet Jackson's
milkshake...

522
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,066
(laughing)

523
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:26,633
...was on television
for one blurry, black second.

524
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,066
(Laughing)

525
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,467
An outrage.

526
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,433
Okay, turns out
that their regulators

527
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,834
have accepted
in the last 10 years

528
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:38,000
over 2,500 vacation trips

529
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,166
from the broadcast industry,

530
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,467
from the people
they're regulating.

531
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:46,166
Okay, that would be
an outrage,

532
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,467
because I don't know
if you're like me,

533
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,600
but when someone gives me
a vacation trip,

534
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,367
I like them.
(Laughing)

535
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,500
(chuckles)
Is that me? Am I weird?

536
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,567
I'm weird with that, right?

537
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,834
No, people love a trip.

538
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,300
Even a shitty trip.

539
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,633
(Laughing)

540
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,467
On the old Dating Game
they used to send them

541
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,266
to Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia.

542
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,900
You remember this?

543
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
When it was behind
the Iron Curtain.

544
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,767
People would be like,
"We're going to Dubrov--

545
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,367
"What the fuck?

546
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:20,200
"What?
Who cares, we're going!"

547
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,300
They didn't-- that's--
'cause people love a trip.

548
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,667
They don't care where it is.

549
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,734
And I tell you why
they love a trip;

550
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,600
because people think
on a trip, "I might get laid."

551
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,967
(Laughing)

552
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,500
They do.
(Chuckles)

553
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,233
It's not happening here,
but Cleveland!

554
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,633
That's where it could happen.
I could...

555
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,767
(laughing)

556
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:41,734
And I don't just mean
single people.

557
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,533
Married people love a trip.

558
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,100
Oh, you kid--
A trip is a cue to fuck.

559
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,300
(Laughing)

560
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,633
Married people need
a cue to fuck, a prompting.

561
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,767
You can't just fuck.
What are you, sick?

562
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,734
(Laughing)
You're married.

563
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,400
Oh god.

564
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,400
That's why there are certain fuck days on the calendar.

565
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Wedding anniversary?
Fuck day!

566
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,834
Yes, we fuck on the day
we fucked before

567
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,934
to commemorate
that fucking.

568
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,166
(Laughing)

569
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,400
Whether we need it or not,

570
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,967
we're gonna fuck
on that day, by god.

571
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,900
Valentine's Day?
Fuck day!

572
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, we fuck when there's
chocolates and flowers around.

573
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,934
We fuck.
(Laughing)

574
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,367
Your birthday?
You might even get a blowjob on your birthday.

575
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,100
(Laughing)

576
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,567
(applause)
I know.

577
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:35,300
It looks like everyone's getting laid in America.
Doesn't it?

578
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
I mean, if you look
at the media;

579
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,166
television and movies, you know.

580
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,333
(Laughing)

581
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,834
Everyone's always, you know--

582
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,834
advertisements in magazines--
(blabbers)

583
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:49,100
(laughing)
Billboards, everyone is...

584
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,166
but it's a mirage.
Not everyone lives at the MTV Beach House.

585
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,333
(Laughing)

586
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,633
If this country wasn't
really so sexually repressed,

587
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,133
why would there be
so much perversion?

588
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,400
Why is there--

589
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Why is there this rash,
excuse the phrase...

590
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,567
(sparse laughing)

591
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,100
...of hot, blonde, 20-something
middle school teachers

592
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,033
fucking their 13-year-old
boy toy students?

593
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,667
Which I'm for, by the way.

594
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,200
(Laughing)
Seriously.

595
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,500
You know.
(Chuckles)

596
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,900
(applause)

597
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,333
See, America's big on
no-- no, uh--

598
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,367
Zero tolerance
and no double standards.

599
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,433
No, you know what?
Sometimes a double standard is necessary,

600
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:32,400
'cause there's two things.

601
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
(Laughing)

602
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,533
Yes, when a 28-year-old
male teacher

603
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,533
fucks his 13-year-old
female student,

604
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,000
that is a crime,

605
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,633
but when 28-year-old
Debra Lafaye

606
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:46,133
fucks that kid,
that's a crime we didn't get it on videotape.

607
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,300
(Laughing, applause)
Wow.

608
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,934
That's...
(chuckles)

609
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,900
That kid is not traumatized
for life.

610
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,433
I should have been
so traumatized for life.

611
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,567
So scarred!

612
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,900
(Laughing)

613
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,467
Yeah, there's no such thing
as zero tolerance

614
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,233
and no double standards.
You know what?

615
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:09,500
Nuance isn't everything.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

616
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,400
Even with fucking kids,
there's nuance.

617
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,133
(Hushed chatter)

618
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,066
For example, Michael Jackson.

619
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,700
(Laughing)

620
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,433
Now I'm not defending
what he did if he did it,

621
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:23,567
but you know what?
Even Michael Jackson's worst accusers

622
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:28,667
never said that he bent them over a table and...
you know...

623
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,967
Catholic shit.

624
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,100
(Laughing)

625
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,567
No. No.

626
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,700
(Cheering, applause)

627
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,734
No, the--
(chuckles)

628
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:43,667
the worst they said
that Michael Jackson ever did

629
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,767
was a little grabby-grabby
under the covers,

630
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,700
which, don't get me wrong,
I don't condone that either.

631
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,767
That's a crime,
but... a little nuance, okay?

632
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,133
Because you know what?

633
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:56,433
When I was 12 years old,
I was once brutally beaten up

634
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,266
on the playground
by two bullies.

635
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,533
Just punched in the face.

636
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,667
And if I could go back
to 1968,

637
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,834
(chuckles)
and trade that experience

638
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:09,100
with being gently masturbated
by a pop star,

639
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,033
(laughing) I would do it in a New York minute.

640
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,700
Frankie Valli
could jerk me off.

641
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,433
Glen Campbell
could jerk me off.

642
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:23,066
Tommy James and the Shondells
could jerk me off.

643
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:28,467
The Rascals.
Gary Puckett & The Union Gap could jerk me off.

644
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,900
The Zombies
could jerk me off.

645
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,266
The Drifters.
Not even the group,

646
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,934
just people who were out of work... (laughing)

647
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:38,367
...could come in
and jerk me off.

648
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:42,734
Would still be better
than being punched in the face.

649
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:46,066
But I digress.
That's not really...

650
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,600
(laughing)
...what I was talking about.

651
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,433
(Laughing)

652
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,867
I don't know how I got there.

653
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,900
I forgot I have free water
here tonight.

654
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,300
(Laughing)

655
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,900
Okay, lobbying stories.

656
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,300
(Laughing)

657
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Here's-- here's another
great lobbyist stories.

658
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
You know, after 9/11
they put these barriers

659
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,867
in front of the Capitol.

660
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,533
Well, about a year ago
they finally stopped a guy.

661
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,667
It was Patrick Kennedy.

662
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,400
(Laughing)

663
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,066
Congressman Patrick Kennedy

664
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,934
was driving to work at 3:00 a.m.

665
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:27,667
Why?
Because he was on Ambien,

666
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,633
which makes you crazy,

667
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:34,467
and he thought he had to get up out of bed at 3:00 a.m. and go to work.

668
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:39,066
But that's okay,
'cause Ambien is a prescription drug,

669
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,767
and they have a lobby,

670
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,967
and if your name
is on the little bottle,

671
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,633
it really doesn't matter
what it makes you do

672
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:49,200
because the United States government is a wholly-owned subsidiary

673
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,867
of the pharmaceutical industry.
(Applause)

674
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,600
So that's cool.
(Cheering)

675
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,900
That's okay.
(Applause)

676
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,834
Meanwhile, marijuana has been
exhaustively tested over the last 30 years,

677
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,734
just by me.

678
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:10,500
(Laughing)
(chuckles)

679
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,233
And nothing.

680
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,633
That doesn't hurt you,
but not a--

681
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:19,500
not a month goes by when there's not a headline in the newspaper

682
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,834
about some prescription drug
doing something awful.

683
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:28,767
We found out that Vioxx relieves the pain and stiffness of arthritis

684
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,867
by killing you.

685
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:30,967
(Laughing)

686
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,100
(chuckles)

687
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,734
Couple of weeks ago it was Avandia,
whatever that is,

688
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:42,633
raises heart attack levels
by 43 %.

689
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,333
That seems like a lot to me.

690
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,633
(Laughing)

691
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:49,467
Ask your undertaker
if Avandia is right for you.

692
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,400
(Laughing)

693
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,567
I mean, seriously.
If this shit was any more lethal,

694
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:57,233
the Chinese would
put it in your toothpaste.

695
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,834
(Laughing)

696
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,367
(applause)

697
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,367
And--
(chuckles)

698
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,000
(applause continues)

699
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,633
And have you taken note
of the fact

700
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:12,433
that every prescription drug
has an "X" or a "Z" in the name?

701
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:16,133
You know, Vioxx, and Paxil,
and Oxycontin,

702
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:20,200
and Celebrex, and Fosamax,
and Prozac.

703
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,834
Are Americans really that dumb,

704
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:26,400
that all you have to do is put an "X" or a "Z" in the name and they go,

705
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,266
"Well, I'm not a doctor,
but I can see this is serious medicine"?

706
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:32,400
(Laughing)

707
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,767
I think they come up with the pill before they come up with the disease.

708
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,800
Did anybody have
restless leg syndrome...

709
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,000
(laughing)

710
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,767
...before they had
a pill for it?

711
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,266
Did you get calls-- "Bill, I'd love to make the party,

712
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,500
"but the old restless leg
is acting up again, I--"

713
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,133
(chuckles) I never knew that I had a fungus monster

714
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,934
living under my big toenail.

715
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,700
(Laughing)

716
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,033
There's a Tasmanian Devil
in there, apparently.

717
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,367
And not just in there,
it's partying.

718
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,834
(Chuckles)
(laughing)

719
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:10,800
Have you seen the commercial?

720
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I swear to god,
there is a bacteria

721
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,500
playing the trombone.

722
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,266
(Laughing)

723
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,600
That is pretty serious.

724
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,133
I'm waiting for the pill
they come up with

725
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,600
for your morning hard-on.

726
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,800
(Laughing)
Do you need Flacciddix?

727
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
(Laughing)

728
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,700
(applause)

729
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,734
Flacciddix makes your penis
soft and manageable

730
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:36,934
when you need it most.

731
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,033
And it's got an "X"
right in the name.

732
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:43,266
So you know it's
serious medicine.

733
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,266
I see a lot of pills
advertised to relieve stress.

734
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,700
I think that's a huge scam.

735
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,500
Stress is life.

736
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,967
Sorry to burst the bubble.

737
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,800
But, you know,
I have good days and bad days.

738
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,333
I never have a no-stress day.
Do you?

739
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,800
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

740
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,300
It's in nature.
Look in nature.

741
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,734
You ever look
at a little woodland creature?

742
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:11,166
(Chuckles)
It's a nervous wreck.

743
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,734
(Laughing)

744
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,266
Look at a poor little squirrel.
You know, it's like--

745
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,767
Even when it's eating lunch,
it's like--

746
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:23,533
Fuck, is something
gonna swoop down

747
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:25,367
or bite me in the ass...

748
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,300
Animals are such toast anyway.

749
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,300
You know, here's a good--
Here's a great lobbying story.

750
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,033
Okay, our national parks, right,

751
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:45,667
our shared national treasure,
and birthright, and all that, okay?

752
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,066
So they have a charter,
and in the charter it describes

753
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,000
something called,
"park purposes."

754
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,433
You know, what people do
in a park.

755
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:57,700
Like, you know, hiking, and boating,
and camping, and picnicking.

756
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,467
The Bush Administration
added mining.

757
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,000
(Laughing)

758
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
Mining.
Oh, it's very relaxing, mining.

759
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,934
I love to get out there
in the parks and do some mining.

760
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,266
I tell you.

761
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,734
Whenever the old restless leg
is acting up

762
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:17,667
I get out to the parks
and I get a pneumatic drill

763
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:20,367
and a helmet with
a big light on it.

764
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,934
It's like falling asleep
in a hammock.

765
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,133
It's just--
(laughing)

766
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,600
(chuckles)

767
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,567
Wouldn't you think that when it came to the environment,

768
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:37,266
conservatives would be
on the side of conserving?

769
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,734
Why-- why doesn't
that make sense?

770
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,033
But they're not.

771
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:44,433
They're on the side of making
Al Gore look ridiculous,

772
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,567
because if you can make
Al Gore look ridiculous,

773
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,500
he equals global warming,

774
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,734
and then that's ridiculous.

775
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,300
Except that it's not
really about Al Gore.

776
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,834
You know what?
It's not.

777
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:58,867
It's about losing
the polar icecaps,

778
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,767
and then the seas rising,

779
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,834
and then losing Venice,

780
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,233
and losing Holland,

781
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:05,533
and losing Manhattan,

782
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:06,734
and losing New Orleans,

783
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,600
and losing Florida,

784
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,333
and that's why I believe
Al Gore,

785
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,066
because if there's
one thing he knows,

786
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,834
it's losing Florida.

787
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,967
(Laughing)

788
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,400
I told you it was easy
to make fun of Al Gore.

789
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,734
(Chuckles)

790
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:24,800
But seriously, I think
there are people who think

791
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,633
we don't really have to do
anything about the environment

792
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,133
because technology will save us.

793
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,367
They'll come up with some sort
of big space Dustbuster...

794
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,133
(mumbles)
(laughing)

795
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,867
No, I don't think so.

796
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:40,734
Because I don't think
the technology I have works.

797
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,100
I don't.

798
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,667
I mean, iPods don't hold
a charge.

799
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:47,900
Cell phones work, basically,
whenever the fuck they want to.

800
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,100
(Laughing)

801
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,967
The shit doesn't work.

802
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,934
You know what works?
Condoms.

803
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:55,100
(Laughing)

804
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,367
Condoms, my friends...
(chuckles) (applause)

805
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,400
ladies and Jews,
work every time.

806
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,467
I think that technology
has just served

807
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,533
to make us
more passive aggressive.

808
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:10,033
Like, I love email,
'cause you can just say what you have to say,

809
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,834
and push send
and leave the room,

810
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,800
and I'll deal
with your bullshit later.

811
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,500
(Laughing)

812
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,033
(chuckles)

813
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,333
We like that.
We really don't want to talk to each other.

814
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,867
You know, the phone machine.

815
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,433
We got so used
to getting the machine

816
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:24,834
that if someone
answers the phone,

817
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,400
it's like,
"Oh..."

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,333
(laughing)

819
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,433
(chuckles)

820
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,667
"Well, that's rude."

821
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,233
(Laughing)

822
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,900
"That is awfully rude of you.

823
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,667
"That puts me in the awkward position of having to talk to you."

824
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,800
(Laughing)

825
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,367
We don't want
to talk to each other.

826
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:47,767
Cars now have television screens in the back seat,

827
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,166
'cause god forbid you talk
to the person in the front seat.

828
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:55,233
"Just 'cause we're in the same car doesn't mean I have to talk to you...

829
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,433
"Dad."

830
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,433
(Laughing)

831
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:02,467
And then they blame the break up of the family on gay marriage.

832
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,967
(Sparse laughing)

833
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,300
Although I guess not anymore.

834
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,300
That was-- that was the big
wedge issue of 2004.

835
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,700
The big, fear-driven bogey man
was gay marriage.

836
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,000
But you know, for 2008;
immigration.

837
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,166
Oh, yes.
Brown is the new pink.

838
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,333
(Laughing, groans)

839
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:24,133
Yes.
(Applause)

840
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,433
And, boy, that Ricky Martin
can't catch a break.

841
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,600
(Laughing, groans)

842
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,333
(applause)

843
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,867
Jeez.

844
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,333
Now wait, this is true.

845
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,300
In 2004...
(chuckles)

846
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,500
Senator Rick Santorum
said that gay marriage

847
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,867
was a slippery slope
to bestiality.

848
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,133
(Laughing)

849
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,400
True.
Lance and Timmy get married,

850
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,000
and the next thing you know,
the cat wants to blow them.

851
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,567
That's...
(laughing)

852
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:55,300
...how the cat knows they're married?
No, I don't know...

853
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,533
But it-- it's always
this fear, you know.

854
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:04,033
Fear of something,
and this time coming up it's gonna be the fear

855
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:06,900
that there are
dark, swarthy people out there

856
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,800
and if they're not coming here
to kill us,

857
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,100
they're coming here to take
our sweet valet parking jobs.

858
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,934
(Laughing)

859
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,900
You know, the--

860
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,967
The far right in Congress--
the tough guys,

861
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:22,900
but also the ones who say
they're the big Christians--

862
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,066
they spent all year trying
to figure out the best way

863
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:31,567
to punish the people who do the worst jobs for the least pay.

864
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:35,433
The people who clean toilets,
and pick lettuce,

865
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,266
and wipe asses
for less than minimum wage.

866
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:41,000
That gravy train has to stop.

867
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,266
(Laughing)

868
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:47,300
(applause) Could anything be less Christian

869
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,467
than exploiting the poor
and least fortunate among us?

870
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,967
I'm sorry religion is
so retarded, but it is.

871
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,333
(Sparse laughing)

872
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,266
(cheering, applause)
I-- No, no.

873
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,233
I know I see people looking at me like...
(applause continues)

874
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,433
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

875
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:11,400
But look,
I was just at the newly opened creationist Museum

876
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,834
in Kentucky,
if this doesn't say it all--

877
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:19,300
There is now a creationist Museum dedicated to the idea of creationism,

878
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,567
and they have this exhibit
of a giant dinosaur

879
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,734
with a saddle on his back.

880
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,667
(Laughing)

881
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:31,667
Because the world
is only 5,000 years old

882
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:34,367
so man and the dinosaur
had to co-exist,

883
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,467
and of course we rode them.

884
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,467
(Laughing)

885
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:41,200
(chuckles)

886
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,066
A theory I thought laughable
at the age of eight,

887
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,400
when I saw it
on The Flintstones.

888
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,533
(Cheering, applause)

889
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,133
Aye, aye, aye!

890
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:55,834
And you know what?

891
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:57,033
(Chuckles)

892
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,633
The problem is
that the people

893
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:01,000
with the most ridiculous ideas

894
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,533
are always the people
who are most certain of them.

895
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:07,033
These people know
when life began.

896
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:09,033
They know when your life begins

897
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,567
and when it ends.

898
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,734
Which is so silly,
'cause you don't know.

899
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:16,900
Did you think Terri Schiavo
was dead?

900
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,233
I did.

901
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:20,367
But I have to say,
a couple of months later,

902
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,433
a brain-dead woman
gave birth to a baby,

903
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,400
and I said,
"Congratulations, Britney!"

904
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,300
(Laughing)

905
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,767
(cheering, applause)
You go, girl!

906
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,900
(Chuckles)

907
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:41,533
But these right-wingers
changed the Constitution

908
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:46,133
to insert a feeding tube
into Terri Schiavo,

909
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,367
and I thought it was
wonderfully ironic

910
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:51,200
that at the very moment
they were doing that,

911
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Pope John Paul,
the old pope, was dying,

912
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,834
and they offered him the tube.

913
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:56,900
And he was like,
"Fuck the tube!"

914
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,834
(Laughing)
(chuckles)

915
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,867
The Pope was gangster
about that shit.

916
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:05,533
He was-- "I don't need no stinkin' tube.

917
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,767
"I'm the pope,
how would that look?"

918
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,667
(Sparse laughing)

919
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,667
When the Pope died,
Bush went over to Rome to his funeral,

920
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,233
and I've never
seen him happier.

921
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,767
He was like a kid
at the circus.

922
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:21,333
He was very impressed
by that funeral.

923
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,133
And you know what?
I don't blame him.

924
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,734
That was an impressive funeral.

925
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,467
That was a nine-hour funeral,

926
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,300
went off without a hitch.

927
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,233
And there was so many
lighting cues,

928
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:32,934
and sound cues,
and red choirs,

929
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:34,333
and then the white choir,

930
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,333
and the body comes in,
and the body comes out,

931
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,467
and this was going--

932
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,800
(chuckles)
You know what?

933
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,100
I don't know if everyone
in that Catholic Church is gay,

934
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,600
but they sure have enough
to put on a show.

935
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,233
(Laughing)

936
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,066
(chuckles)
Wow.

937
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,633
There is a fine line
between Liturgy and Liberace

938
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,400
in that Catholic Church.

939
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,967
(Laughing)

940
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:59,133
But the pope-- there's another one who's pro-life

941
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:01,900
as long as it's microscopic.

942
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,100
They all think they know
exactly when life begins

943
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,233
and that's why we can't
have stem cell research,

944
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,266
which actually would help
real people,

945
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:13,300
but they know for sure
that life begins

946
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,166
the moment the sperm
hits the hoo-ha.

947
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,166
(Laughing)

948
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,567
(chuckles)

949
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:24,633
Before the man
can light a cigarette,

950
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:28,166
there is a third person
in that room.

951
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,367
(Laughing)

952
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:31,667
Before he can get up
and get a towel,

953
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:36,467
(laughing) there is a third person in that room.

954
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:39,700
Before the woman can even say,
"What are you thinking?"

955
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,233
(Laughing)

956
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,333
(applause)

957
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,333
(chuckles)

958
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,500
What happened to men
in this country.

959
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,367
Seriously.
Did you see that story...

960
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,066
about a year ago,
out of Atlanta,

961
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,200
about this woman
named Ashley Smith

962
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,533
who was kidnapped by this thug,
and he was a thug.

963
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:04,033
You know, he was on trial,
and he took over the courtroom

964
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:07,066
where they were trying him.
Shot three people in the courtroom,

965
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:10,667
hijacked a car, shot another guy,
kidnapped her,

966
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:16,033
and she talked to him
for 10 straight hours,

967
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,400
and he literally waved
a white flag.

968
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
(Laughing)

969
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,333
(applause)

970
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:29,233
He was like, "Take me back to prison,
just shut this bitch up."

971
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,100
(Cheering, applause)

972
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,300
And...

973
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:38,200
And I gotta say,
I think that says it all about men and women,

974
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,734
because women need
someone to listen,

975
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:44,934
and men need someone
to shut the fuck up!

976
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:45,934
(Laughing)

977
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,066
(chuckles)

978
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:50,800
Every time I'm on an airplane,

979
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,333
before we leave, sitting there,
every guy around me

980
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:57,066
is on the cell phone--
"Yeah, we're on the runway now."

981
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,200
(Laughing)

982
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,266
"Love you, love you, love you,
love you, love you--"

983
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:07,033
Oh, there's so much love
out there in America.

984
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:08,834
"Yeah, we're third in line
for takeoff."

985
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,600
(Mutters)

986
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,400
Why don't you just get
a husband cam?

987
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,166
You know, just...

988
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,433
get a camera that would
fit on your head,

989
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:20,133
and then she could see
where you are

990
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,834
every second of the day,

991
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,633
and you wouldn't
have to check in,

992
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,300
you pathetic, pussy-whipped
piece of shit.

993
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,567
(Laughing)

994
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,700
(cheering, applause)

995
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,066
You know what commercial
bugs the shit out of me?

996
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:41,867
That Cialis commercial.

997
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:44,333
You know,
the all-day boner pill?

998
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,100
(Laughing)

999
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,600
(chuckles) "When the tender moment becomes the right moment."

1000
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,300
Oh, Christ.
It's your own wife.

1001
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,934
Can't you just bone somebody?
I mean...

1002
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:58,100
you married her
for crying out loud.

1003
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,834
They show the guy
taking her shopping,

1004
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:04,233
they're in the hot tub together,

1005
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:07,533
and touching fingers, you know.

1006
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:13,367
Is it this much work to fuck
your own wife in America?

1007
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:17,533
You have to keep a hard-on
for 36 hours?

1008
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:21,066
Just for when the tender
and the right moment finally--

1009
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,934
Pow! There you go.

1010
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:25,533
Why don't you do a rain dance,
you piece of...

1011
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,667
(laughing)

1012
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,133
Has to be the tender moment?

1013
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:33,934
I think a good grudge fuck
would do the both of you

1014
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:35,433
a world of good.

1015
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,567
(Laughing)

1016
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,467
I think it would do the whole country a world of good.

1017
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,834
I'm telling you,
I think this country is so sexually frustrated,

1018
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:51,600
and that is very fertile ground
for the Christian right

1019
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,867
to conflate morals and values
with sex.

1020
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:58,066
Because if they didn't
demonize sex,

1021
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:01,266
then they'd have to start thinking about what was really moral,

1022
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:03,800
or really a value.

1023
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
The Republicans
think sex is bad

1024
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,734
because with them
it always is.

1025
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:10,467
(Laughing)

1026
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:12,100
It is.
They're--

1027
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,300
I'm sorry, but...
(applause)

1028
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,467
They're just...
(chuckles)

1029
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:21,567
doughy, asexual,
wonky white people,

1030
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:23,600
and if you had
to have sex with them,

1031
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,066
it would be over in an excruciating three minutes.

1032
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:27,900
It's just--
(laughing)

1033
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:31,266
And from the headlines
of the last year,

1034
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:35,100
I gather the only sex they're really good at is gay sex.

1035
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,066
(Laughing)
Really.

1036
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:39,600
Jeff Gannon
in the White House Press Room.

1037
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,734
Representative Mark Foley.

1038
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,300
The Reverend Ted Haggard.

1039
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,900
I mean, that's a lot of gay
when you're running against it

1040
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,367
in every election.

1041
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:53,166
And what is this campy fixation they have with all things Ronald Reagan?

1042
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:55,900
I mean, they talk about Reagan

1043
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,967
the way gay guys talk
about Barbra Streisand.

1044
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,066
(Laughing)

1045
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:02,333
They do.
(Applause)

1046
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,500
I think they want him on a stamp
so they can lick his ass.

1047
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,633
(Laughing)

1048
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,500
I think they want to name
airports after him

1049
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,800
so they can say,
"I'm coming into Reagan!"

1050
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,900
(Laughing)

1051
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,633
Hey, look, I was never
that big a fan of Ronald Reagan,

1052
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,200
but he did one thing
which I thought was fantastic,

1053
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,433
which was in 1983 we had
troops in the Middle East.

1054
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,066
Yes, in Lebanon,

1055
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:39,133
and they got
their barracks blown up.

1056
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,834
And what did Ronald Reagan do?

1057
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,867
He cut and ran.

1058
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:45,467
He said, "These people are fucking nuts.
(Laughing)

1059
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,734
"Let's get the hell
out of here."

1060
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,500
Thank you, Ronald Reagan,

1061
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,100
for that shining example of how
to behave in the Middle East.

1062
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,233
(Applause)

1063
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,233
Thank you, you're very nice.

1064
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,900
Whereas George Bush

1065
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,867
thinks that God speaks to him.

1066
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:10,166
And, by the way,
if God looked over the whole country,

1067
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,834
the whole world,
and made George Bush president,

1068
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:15,166
how good is God, seriously?

1069
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,300
(Laughing)

1070
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,900
But, yes, he thinks God
made him president.

1071
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,834
So he needs to have big ideas,

1072
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:27,133
like transforming
the Middle East.

1073
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,200
One State of the Union Address,
I swear to god,

1074
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,200
he said,
"We're going to Mars."

1075
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,133
(Laughing)

1076
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,500
Really?
In the middle of the War on Terror, we're--

1077
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
(laughing)

1078
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,233
He did--
What he actually said was,

1079
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,800
"We're going to Mars
and worlds beyond."

1080
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,300
(Gasps)

1081
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,734
Easy, little man.

1082
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:45,734
(Laughing)

1083
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,567
(chuckles)

1084
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,700
We can't get from Baghdad
to the Baghdad airport.

1085
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,433
(Laughing)

1086
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:55,734
We can't get the people out of the trailers in New Orleans,

1087
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,266
the trailers
that are killing them.

1088
00:49:57,266 --> 00:49:59,200
Did you see that yesterday?

1089
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,900
I mean, I know that Bill Clinton
was an evil man,

1090
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,767
who liked sex
and sex liked him...

1091
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:06,467
(laughing)

1092
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:10,133
...but does anybody doubt
that if he had been president

1093
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:13,500
when that storm hit,
that the people,

1094
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,467
you know, the actual people
of New Orleans,

1095
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:18,133
would have been better off?

1096
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:20,467
I mean, he would have,
first of all-- (cheering, applause)

1097
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:22,467
That's okay, but--
(applause continues)

1098
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,467
(cheering)

1099
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:34,100
First of all,
he would have read about it before it happened.

1100
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,400
You know, fag stuff.

1101
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,867
(Laughing)

1102
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:41,500
He would have been down there
before it happened.

1103
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,066
He would have not slept
for a week.

1104
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:46,233
He would have stayed up working on it.
That's who he was.

1105
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,333
Yes, he would have been
getting blown the whole time.

1106
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,133
Who cares?
(Laughing)

1107
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,000
Come on, it's New Orleans.

1108
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,300
(Laughing)

1109
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,133
You're not gonna send
Slick Willie to the Big Easy

1110
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,467
and have nothing happen.

1111
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:59,767
But so what?
(Laughing)

1112
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,633
(cheering, applause)

1113
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:04,867
He could handle it.
He was a multitasker.

1114
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,633
This numbnuts isn't
even a unitasker.

1115
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:10,200
(Laughing)

1116
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,767
(chuckles)

1117
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,767
You realize that
on the third day of Katrina,

1118
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:21,200
Fidel Castro offered aid
to America.

1119
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,734
I'm not kidding.
He had a big press conference and he said,

1120
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:26,400
"Some president in this hemisphere must do something."

1121
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,533
(Laughing)

1122
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,433
Now what do you think
Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh

1123
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:36,567
would have said if Bill Clinton was president when that happened?

1124
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:42,300
They would have said that Bill Clinton has brought this country so low

1125
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,767
that Fidel Castro,
a Mexican...

1126
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:48,767
(laughing)

1127
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:50,867
(applause)

1128
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:56,100
Is he the worst president ever?

1129
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,800
Ever!

1130
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,567
I mean...
Male audience member: Yes.

1131
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,100
...when this man's term is over,

1132
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,233
he has to walk back to Texas.

1133
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:05,000
(Laughing)

1134
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,967
The sheer volume...

1135
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:09,100
(cheering, applause)

1136
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,867
The volume of scandals,
of bloopers, boners,

1137
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,066
and practical jokes--

1138
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:22,233
Katrina, and Abu Ghraib,

1139
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:25,533
Walter Reed, Alberto Gonzales,

1140
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,300
not getting Bin Laden,

1141
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,433
outing a CIA agent,

1142
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:33,033
he tried to appoint his cleaning lady to the Supreme Court.

1143
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,734
(Laughing)

1144
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:38,467
I'm not making this shit up.

1145
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:45,600
He tried to sell the ports
to an Arab country.

1146
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,000
(Laughing) Because nothing ever gets in the way

1147
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,266
of crony capitalism.

1148
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:53,133
He would try to sell
the Red Cross to Dracula...

1149
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:54,333
(laughing)

1150
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,066
...if it brought in
campaign cash.

1151
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,600
He sat there
for seven minutes

1152
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,900
when he was told the words,

1153
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,200
"The country is under attack."

1154
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,333
(Laughing)

1155
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,900
"Not that I'm suggesting
you get up on it."

1156
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,233
(Laughing)

1157
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,567
"That was not
the implication at all.

1158
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:19,367
"I'm just saying, FYI,
the country..."

1159
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,800
I just hope the next time
people go into the voting booth

1160
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,834
they have one idea
in their head,

1161
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:28,367
which is that there is
a little more to this job

1162
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:31,367
than just not getting blown.

1163
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:33,033
(Laughing)

1164
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:37,700
(cheering, applause) Yeah,
not getting blown-- vital, I agree.

1165
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,600
Very important,
but there's a little more.

1166
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,767
Yes, we took a chance,
and we elected a guy who we wanted to have a beer with,

1167
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,667
but maybe next time
we'll understand,

1168
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:53,700
no, we need an exceptional person in this job.

1169
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,734
For all their flaws, Al Gore was
an exceptional person,

1170
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,300
John Kerry was
an exceptional person...

1171
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,433
(cheering, applause)

1172
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:05,934
...George Bush
is a special person.

1173
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,600
(Laughing)

1174
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,800
He is.
(Applause)

1175
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:14,567
And the most infuriating thing
about him

1176
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:18,767
is that he didn't even know
how bad he sucks.

1177
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,667
That's what I hate,
the way he ends every press conference,

1178
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,133
every language-mangling...

1179
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,367
(laughing)

1180
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,667
...embarrassing press
conference, by walking off

1181
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:32,333
with that smirk on his face,
like, "Nailed it."

1182
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,667
(Laughing)

1183
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,767
(applause)

1184
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,834
This man...

1185
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:40,100
This man!

1186
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,734
And you know he just dreads

1187
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:45,100
the next time
there is a disaster,

1188
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,500
because whenever
there's a disaster,

1189
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,767
then he has to bring in his dad
and Bill Clinton together.

1190
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:56,500
He's got a look on his face
like, "Not fair!

1191
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,967
(Laughing)
"They know things."

1192
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:01,100
(Laughing)

1193
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,567
And to me,
that's the ultimate key to George Bush.

1194
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:11,000
It's that he wants to be
the smartest guy in the room.

1195
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,934
But to be
the smartest guy in the room,

1196
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:18,333
you kind of have to fill that room with a bunch of dim bulbs.

1197
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,367
And that's how you get
the Alberto Gonzales',

1198
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:27,266
and the Harriet Miers, and the,
"You're doing a heck of a job," Brownies.

1199
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:30,367
(Applause)
And my favorite...

1200
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:33,066
My favorite Bush appointee
of all time,

1201
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,266
Dr. David Hager,

1202
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:39,767
who, to me,
sums up everything we've gone through in the last six and a half years,

1203
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:44,266
because Dr.
David Hager was on the advisory board of the FDA,

1204
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:49,000
making decisions about women's health and reproductive services.

1205
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,333
And Dr. Hager was
a super Christ-y,

1206
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,266
evangelical gynecologist.

1207
00:55:55,266 --> 00:55:56,734
(Laughing)

1208
00:55:56,734 --> 00:56:01,300
(chuckles) It's kind of hard to find one of those,

1209
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,700
but these are the Bush people.

1210
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,533
Back in 1991 they found a black guy for the Supreme Court

1211
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,400
who wasn't that crazy
about black people.

1212
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,533
(Laughing)

1213
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,233
So they're good, you know.
(Sparse applause)

1214
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:14,900
And...
(chuckles)

1215
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,633
what had attracted
the Bush team to Dr. Hager

1216
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:21,700
was that he and his wife
had written a book

1217
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,567
suggesting that a remedy for women experiencing menstrual pain--

1218
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,033
reading scripture.

1219
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:31,166
(Sparse laughing)

1220
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:37,700
How's that working out for you
gals, here, in the Boston area?

1221
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,500
Good?

1222
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,400
(Chuckles)

1223
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
But that's not the funny part.

1224
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,800
(Laughing)
Listen to this.

1225
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,867
So after 30 years of marriage,

1226
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:51,133
Dr. David Hager and his wife
get divorced,

1227
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:56,433
and she says that in the last few years of their marriage,

1228
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:59,734
he was anally raping her
in her sleep.

1229
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:01,767
(Crowd gasps)

1230
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:03,834
And she didn't even
take the pledge.

1231
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:06,233
You know, just...
(laughing)

1232
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:09,333
(chuckles)

1233
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,467
Now I assume she woke up at some point during the proceedings.

1234
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:15,500
I mean, if you can sleep
through that, you're a...

1235
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,934
(laughing)
Your ass is a little loose,

1236
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,600
I'm not gonna lie about--
(chuckles)

1237
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,734
(laughing)

1238
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,400
But that's not
the funny part either.

1239
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,000
(Laughing)

1240
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,200
The funny part is that when confronted with this accusation,

1241
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,033
Dr. David Hager did not
exactly deny it.

1242
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:38,367
She said his excuse was
he missed.

1243
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:40,500
(Laughing)

1244
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,667
Which-- okay, first of all,

1245
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:50,767
just sort of implies that it's okay to vaginally rape your wife in her sleep.

1246
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:51,967
(Laughing)
That's cool.

1247
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,900
Honey, sleep, I'm just
gonna fuck you.

1248
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,367
Please.

1249
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:57,333
I know, you got
a busy day tomorrow.

1250
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,567
I'm just gonna fuck you.
That's...

1251
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:01,367
As Christ would, you know.

1252
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:05,100
(Laughing)
Stabbing your wife unexpectedly,

1253
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,900
unwantedly in the pussy
in the middle of the night,

1254
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,133
that's okay.

1255
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:10,867
That's what the Christians
would do,

1256
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,867
but in the ass?
Please, no, that's animals.

1257
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,633
Who would do that?
A Hindu, a Jew,

1258
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,233
but not the Christians.

1259
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:20,367
(Laughing)
No.

1260
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:23,834
And two--
Oh my god, he missed.

1261
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,400
I mean, the Bush people
have been in power so long,

1262
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,233
they forgot how to lie.

1263
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:32,400
They're like zoo lions that don't know how to hunt anymore.

1264
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,734
He missed?

1265
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:38,467
So what you have here,
is a gynecologist...

1266
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:41,000
(laughing)
(chuckles)

1267
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,834
...claiming he cannot find
his own wife's vagina.

1268
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:49,767
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the Bush Administration.

1269
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:51,300
(Cheering, applause)

1270
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,533
And I thank you
very much.

1271
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,333
You were a terrific audience,

1272
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:58,000
as I knew you would be.
I appreciate it.

1273
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,333
Thank you very much.
