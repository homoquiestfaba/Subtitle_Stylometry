1
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,687
I hate this place.

2
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,619
Water?

3
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,486
Water.

4
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,487
Water.

5
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,687
Water!

6
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:29,127
Now that is sick.

7
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:37,397
- Are you watching this?
- No, Thanks. I don't look any more.

8
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,124
We've seen a lot of...
But this is just...

9
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,247
Oh, dear God!

10
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,086
Wow...

11
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:06,087
You know you shouldn't
be looking at the files.

12
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,487
- It's not against the rules.
- But it's not encouraged.

13
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:13,087
- Come on man, we've all...
- It's not encouraged.

14
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,847
Okay.

15
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,566
Okay, screw this.

16
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,276
- Pawn to King 2.
- Knight to Queen's Bishop 6.

17
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,807
- Check.
- What?

18
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,687
I didn't even see that.

19
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,563
I was just wondering...
When is Chickliss coming back?

20
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:15,197
Some time this week.
Probably all suntanned, the prick.

21
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,086
Let's see...

22
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,087
King to King's Bishop 8.

23
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,086
Rook takes Queen. Check.

24
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,087
Dammit.

25
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,246
Damn!

26
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,247
- Sorry.
- Shut up I don't need your sympathy.

27
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,327
And Owen?

28
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,606
- Where is Owen?
- You're trying to psych me out or what?

29
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,607
I can't hear myself think.

30
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,486
Owen is...

31
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:59,797
Owen is probably out sick again.
That would be my best guess.

32
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,206
You sure?

33
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,207
Yes.

34
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,246
Yes!

35
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:18,320
Despite your rather transparent tactics,
Brainman, prepare to die.

36
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,567
Bishop to Queen's Knight 7.
Checkski!

37
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,358
Queen takes Bishop. I believe
that's Checkski-Mateski.

38
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,886
What? No way.

39
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,887
Ah come on, how did you...?

40
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:35,007
You freak of nature!

41
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:48,807
You know the other night I heard some noise.

42
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,446
- Noise?
- Yeah.

43
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:54,447
In Owen's room, like a...
like a scuffle.

44
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

45
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,646
- You don't think that...?
- You dreamt it.

46
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,684
- No, look...
- You dreamt it.

47
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,487
You're always complaining
about your nightmares.

48
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,647
They come for you at night.

49
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,086
What?

50
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,087
- They come for you at night.
- Who does?

51
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:24,206
They do.

52
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,366
- Drop it.
- They do.

53
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,126
Enough!

54
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,127
What are you suicidal?

55
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,927
Good. They didn't forget
lunch this time.

56
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,366
Goat cheese salad with ginseng,

57
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:08,155
liver fricasée
and mango sorbet. Eeewh.

58
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:13,047
Must be you.

59
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,978
Steak frites. That's me.

60
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:19,467
Hey!

61
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,468
Wha..?
Oh! Sorry.

62
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,646
Bless us our Lord for these thy gifts
which we're about to receive,

63
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,326
from thy bounty through you, Lord.
Amen.

64
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,286
Amen.

65
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:34,287
Down the hatch.

66
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:47,402
"Please record REMsleeper
in room 17 24 09".

67
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:51,047
Let's go.

68
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:58,596
Okay.
Zooming out of 06, 12, 21.

69
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:03,758
And zooming in to 17, 24, 9.

70
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:08,397
Here we go.
Hot-patching gear works

71
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,366
and flipping to
REM reader mode.

72
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:15,155
Locating subject.
Subject located.

73
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,807
Zooming in.

74
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,726
Wow...

75
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,886
Keep your tongue in your mouth, Brainman.
We're on the clock.

76
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,887
Are we locked?

77
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:33,887
Sorry. Locked on.

78
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,927
Thank you.
Arm extension, Go.

79
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,727
Calibrating...

80
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:53,607
- Steady.
- I got it, I got it.

81
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,967
Light her up.

82
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:05,441
Interscan is locked.
Commencing REM read.

83
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,847
Mommy!

84
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,326
Mommy Help!

85
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,206
Anna!

86
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:42,207
No! No!

87
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,207
Anna!

88
00:14:56,967 --> 00:15:00,846
Okay.
Now let's cycle back.

89
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,527
And there you have it.

90
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,719
If you do this long enough,
you can do it in your sleep.

91
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,606
In your sleep...

92
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:16,607
Recording dreams in your sleep.
That's funny.

93
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,407
When's the last time you
remember being outside?

94
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,086
Last night.
I had a dream of being at the beach.

95
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,363
No, I mean really outside,
not a dream.

96
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:33,846
I... I don't remember.

97
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,246
I've been busy lately.

98
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,364
Overloaded, actually.
Picking up slack.

99
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:42,527
For you, I might add.

100
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,847
I don't remember either.

101
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:49,247
- Isn't that weird?
- You're weird.

102
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,847
Shut up and let me concentrate.

103
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,006
Dammit!

104
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,007
- You know, I was just thinking...
- Stop thinking.

105
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:02,527
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into me?

106
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:09,326
- You know who these are?
- They're Chickliss' kids.

107
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:13,400
- Arthur and Sunshine.
- Orphans. They're orphans.

108
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,527
You told me
Chickliss was on vacation.

109
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,927
I have to go to the can.

110
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:31,036
Try not to drool on the controls.
It screws up the calibration.

111
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,207
Bastards.

112
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,647
Where is she?

113
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:08,207
What have you done with her?

114
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:13,327
Where is...?

115
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,407
What have you done to me?

116
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,327
Why can't I remember?

117
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,367
Why can't I remember my
daughter's name?

118
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:07,138
Hey!

119
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,807
Let me go!

120
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,807
- Get off me!
- Okay. Okay. Sorry.

121
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,846
It's okay.

122
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,847
She's one of us.

123
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,446
Touch me again, soldier,
and you'll be eating your eyeballs.

124
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,526
Why soldier?
What do you know about me?

125
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:40,406
Tattoo, on you forehead.
You're on the squad, right killer?

126
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:43,727
You show up by night
and people disappear.

127
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:51,046
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're scum.

128
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:54,517
Look miss, you have a certain
disadvantage here.

129
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:58,047
None of us remembers how we got here,
or pretty much anything else.

130
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,483
Including who we are,
so whatever you think you know about me,

131
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,246
I don't even know myself.

132
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,046
I don't trust her. She knows something.

133
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:11,047
Thank God somebody does.

134
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,323
Have you seen any children?
A little girl?

135
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:21,486
No.

136
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,487
My God. I hope they
don't put kids in here.

137
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,927
- That would be horrible.
- What if they drop children in here?

138
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,806
I gotta keep moving.

139
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,807
Wait! you gotta be
careful climbing around here.

140
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,847
- Why?
- There are traps.

141
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,527
Traps?
How do you know?

142
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,207
Because of this.

143
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,563
That's good bandage.
Are you a doctor?

144
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,927
- I don't know.
- I did it.

145
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:07,237
I may be freakin' Mother Teresa for all I know,
But I don't remember.

146
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,486
You remember something.

147
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,487
Before all of this.

148
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,727
Not much.

149
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:21,356
Being chased through the woods,
by guys like you.

150
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,846
The tattoo set me off.

151
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:29,078
When I first woke up,
I don't think I would have known my own name

152
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,006
if it wasn't stitched on my shirt.

153
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:35,007
I don't even know if
this is my name.

154
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,962
I feel like we've been here for hours
and I still can't remember anything!

155
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,767
Give her a moment...

156
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:51,527
Fine. A moment.

157
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,486
We gotta get moving while
we still have our strength.

158
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,006
You guys have a plan?

159
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,007
We keep moving in the same
direction until we find the edge.

160
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,846
This place has got to end eventually.

161
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,847
What about the traps?

162
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,887
We test the rooms.
We have a system.

163
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,647
It's safe!

164
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,607
I'm going in!

165
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:16,647
Help!

166
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:20,047
Help!

167
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:39,167
What kind of animals
would do this?!

168
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:00,407
Does she look familiar to you?

169
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,887
I keep thinking I've seen her before...

170
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,807
- I wonder what she's in for.
- You're making a mistake.

171
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,606
Huh?

172
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,607
What the first rule
I taught you about this job?

173
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:20,724
- Neatness counts?
- Very funny.

174
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,886
Don't get involved.

175
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,163
I know, I'm not getting involved OK?
I'm drawing.

176
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,607
You have your chess,
Owen has his fish, Chickliss...

177
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:35,606
Can we spend 5 minutes without
bringing up Owen and Chickliss please?

178
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,967
And get us back on real-time.
You're gonna get us in trouble.

179
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,364
I'll show you three ways to beat that game
if you answer one question.

180
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,517
- Fine. What?
- Okay, what I wanna know...

181
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,566
Hold it. Show me.

182
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,567
Okay.

183
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:43,726
Check Mate.

184
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:46,727
You win.

185
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,206
That's brilliant.
Do that again.

186
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:55,207
- What do you know about a third exit?
- What?

187
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,166
A third exit.

188
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,926
An auxiliary exit that leads
directly outside.

189
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,046
- There's no such thing.
- Owen said there was.

190
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,566
- He said Chickliss found more plans...
- They were having you on.

191
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:09,720
No way. I think that that's why they're gone.
I think they've found something...

192
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,926
I think you'd better stop
listening to old wives' tales.

193
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,606
- Listen to me.
- This conversation in over.

194
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,607
- Don't you ever worry?
- About what?

195
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,287
One day, you're gonna wake up inside.

196
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,767
The only way I'm gonna wake up inside,
is if I keep on talking to you.

197
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:26,927
No.

198
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:31,006
These things are useless!

199
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,124
The sensors there must've been different.
Maybe they're not motion sensors.

200
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,962
Maybe they're triggered by heat,
or sound, or something...!

201
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,326
Why don't you just admit it?
We're dead!

202
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:43,327
He can't admit it.
It's the training.

203
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:47,164
- The army never admits defeat.
- You got a problem with me lady?

204
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,166
- Yeah.
- Why?

205
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,086
I don't trust you.

206
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:55,087
- Oh, how the hell did we miss this?
- What is it?

207
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,246
C-I-A.

208
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:03,247
What is that?
Clues to who built this place?

209
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:07,597
I think that's just a coincidence.
Try the other doors.

210
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,286
Y-Y-O.

211
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,766
U-D-S.

212
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,046
S-A-N.

213
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,646
What do they mean?

214
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:21,647
I think it's a mistake to think of these
letters as meaning something.

215
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:26,926
It's like some kind of code
or puzzle we have to figure out.

216
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:29,726
A puzzle?
They're playing with us!

217
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,086
- We should make a map.
- Using what?

218
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,526
- Our blood?
- I don't know.

219
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,246
Maybe.
You got a better idea?

220
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:39,247
I have a better idea.

221
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:43,047
I need something. I need...

222
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,167
Your hair pin.

223
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:57,087
They did us the favour
of polishing our boots.

224
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:03,127
Okay,
We'll find the safe rooms.

225
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,247
C-I-A. Give me the others.

226
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,406
Y-Y-O, U-D-S

227
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,366
And S-A-N.

228
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,966
- Good memory.
- Yeah, in the short term.

229
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:17,118
Now I wish I could remember what happened
to me between birth and about 3 hours ago.

230
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,206
Right.

231
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,646
I dunno...

232
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,647
Shoe polish and a hair pin.

233
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:29,727
Nothing in this place is random.

234
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,847
Maybe the bastards
just underestimated us.

235
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:53,447
So near and yet so far.

236
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,126
Yeah, but she's doing better than most.

237
00:28:57,127 --> 00:29:00,517
I mean half of them don't even notice the letters,
Let alone map them.

238
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,087
I meant the chess.

239
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:12,927
Give it up.
She doesn't stand a chance.

240
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,446
Of course she has a chance.

241
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:18,996
Yeah? You're gonna ride in on your
white horse and whisk her out?

242
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,726
The rooms can realign to zero position.

243
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:29,164
No it happens, and then she'll figure out
the letters and uhh... sail through.

244
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:33,002
And what's the first thing the program
does when the rooms realign to zero position?

245
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,807
- Clean sweep.
- Exactly.

246
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:42,087
The only thing that's gonna sail
through that is their ashes.

247
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:47,046
Cheer up buddy.
You'll catch you another one.

248
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:50,047
The boys upstairs like 'em
young and pretty.

249
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,207
Don't you ever feel guilty?

250
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:59,917
- Don't you ever feel?
- Son, you're outta line.

251
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,166
- Yeah whatever...
- Excuse me?

252
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,167
Why don't you stop your doodling
and do some work for a change?

253
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,926
Like what?

254
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:14,681
We're waiting for orders, it's what we
do best. It's what we do.

255
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,447
Clean up your space.
It's disgraceful.

256
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:22,564
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

257
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:36,407
This one's S-D-F.

258
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,246
Wait a minute.

259
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,247
- What?
- I don't know if this makes any difference,

260
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,247
But they're not periods,
They're commas.

261
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:54,366
He's right.
They're commas.

262
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:59,361
Okay, so they're commas.
What difference does it make?

263
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:03,487
We don't even know what
the letters mean yet.

264
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,846
I mean if they were numbers,
I'd understand the commas.

265
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,566
Understand the commas how?

266
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,766
Well isn't that how you plot
coordinates on a graph?

267
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,767
X coordinate, comma, Y coordinate,
comma, Z coordinate.

268
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,406
Right. So if the rooms were
labelled with numbers,

269
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,798
like "10,1,7", you'd know something
about the room's position.

270
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:24,317
Yeah but we've got letters that so
far tell us absolutely nothing.

271
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,966
That's where you're wrong, soldier.

272
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,967
The letters tell us one important
fact the number never would.

273
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:36,043
- What fact?
- There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.

274
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,646
So?

275
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,886
So we know the parameters.

276
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:46,881
Exactly. If each room has its own
unique letter combination,

277
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,723
Then it's a pretty good bet
that this whole place is a cube

278
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,366
with 26 rooms on each side.

279
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,046
Worst case scenario,
we're anywhere from

280
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,286
1 to 25 rooms away from the edge.

281
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:01,006
- Let's go!
- Great!

282
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:04,007
Actually, it's your turn to go first.

283
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:10,075
S-O-S. No kidding.

284
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:30,207
Ahh.. Guess we'll try another way.

285
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,847
Rains, Rains,
Rains, Rains...

286
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:12,327
Cassandra.

287
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,366
The little girl's name is Anna.

288
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:21,367
Protests and strikes.
Troublemakers up north.

289
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,806
The whole country's going to crap.

290
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,807
Ungrateful pigs.

291
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,006
Oh my God,
Oh my God...

292
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,686
What is it now?

293
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:36,687
Please tell me that's not...
Would you put that away?

294
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,406
There's no consent form.

295
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:41,407
- What?
- There is not pink page,
the consent form is missing!

296
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:44,886
- So?
- So?!

297
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,526
You know the rules. She can't
be in there without a consent form!

298
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,486
You think they're gonna stop this whole
operation because you lost a piece of paper?

299
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,366
I didn't lose it.

300
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:55,126
Look you know how
anal these guys are.

301
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,806
- Maybe she'll get another hearing.
- Listen to yourself!

302
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:00,046
But this could be huge!
A mistrial!

303
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:03,047
- Oh sure, anything you say.
- Look...

304
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,727
See?
Told you I recognized her.

305
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,206
"Opposition Leaders
Stage Illegal Strike"

306
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:17,207
She's a political.
So that would explain it.

307
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,567
What do you mean?

308
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:26,164
I mean, there might
not be a consent form.

309
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,327
Get it?

310
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,886
But that's illegal.

311
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:35,163
You know for a child prodigy,
you ain't too bright.

312
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:40,206
- We gotta do something.
- Like what?

313
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:43,244
- We gotta let 'em know upstairs.
- And how are we gonna do that?

314
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:46,887
Call up.

315
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,959
- It's just for emergencies.
- Well what do you think this is?

316
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,646
I don't see a fire.

317
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,686
I don't see a gas leak,
or flooding.

318
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:59,286
I don't see you writhing on the floor
in the throws of a heart attack

319
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:01,206
But God knows
right now I'd like to!

320
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:04,207
She's gonna die in there
and she's probably innocent!

321
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,166
None of them are innocent!

322
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,566
You read the files. You know what
kind of people end up in there!

323
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,567
Exactly! All we know is
what we read in the files...

324
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,046
Oh my God...

325
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,766
What if it's all bogus?
The files, the crimes, everything.

326
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,767
Maybe they're just putting anyone
in there they don't like, maybe...

327
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,006
There's a purpose, and there's a plan.

328
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:28,841
And I'm not so stupid to think that there's
no plan just because I don't understand it!

329
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,926
Here's a newsflash:
We're just the button men!

330
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:34,726
If we're meant to be analysts,
we'd be working upstairs!

331
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:38,276
Would you forget the party line
for once and make the call?

332
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:44,447
Okay.

333
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,687
You do it.
You're the hero.

334
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,966
Just remember,

335
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:57,686
She was in the news and
they made her disappear.

336
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:00,687
How much easier would it be to get to you.

337
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:04,807
No one even know you exist.

338
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:08,647
Who knows where you'll
wake up tomorrow?

339
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,127
Hello?

340
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,327
It's for you.

341
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,326
Yeah?

342
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,206
Sir.

343
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,846
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

344
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,246
Yes, sir.

345
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,247
I understand, sir. Yes, sir.

346
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,447
We've got work to do.
Someone's at the exit.

347
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,486
Our exit?
What do we do?

348
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,487
The exit procedure.

349
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:07,167
Wait a minute. I've never done this before.
Don't you usually do this with Owen?

350
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,637
That's right my friend,
but Owen is not here, is he?

351
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:13,847
And the rules clearly state

352
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:17,723
that two senior technicians
have to be present

353
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,766
at all exit procedures.

354
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,646
Right, but I'm not a senior technician.

355
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:26,117
Hey! I need help here.
That was a phone call from upstairs.

356
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,757
Personal contact. Direct orders from above.
They never do that.

357
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,007
We can't screw this up.

358
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,167
- We?
- Yes. We.

359
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,327
As far as I understand, sir,

360
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:50,244
only senior techs are allowed to
perform the exit procedure.

361
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,444
Perhaps it would be my be
interest to abstain until receiving

362
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,607
clearance from higher up.

363
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,407
You little prick.

364
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,566
Okay.

365
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,926
Okay, I get it.

366
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:13,159
Look, you help me with this,
I'll tell them about your girlfriend. Okay?

367
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:16,687
- When?
- What?

368
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,927
When will you let them know?

369
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,927
As soon as we're done
with this. All right?

370
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,726
Okay.

371
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:30,566
- What do I do?
- Just follow my lead.

372
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,567
Okay, here we go. Step one,

373
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:36,887
Visual confirmation of
subject in exit room.

374
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,006
Oh, no. Owen.

375
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,007
- It's Owen.
- Shut up.

376
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,287
Hello?

377
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,967
Hello?

378
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,687
Hello?

379
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:40,287
Hello!

380
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:45,966
Anyone there?

381
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,967
Hello?

382
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:51,806
What now?

383
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:54,406
Please!

384
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:57,407
Question one.
Please state your name.

385
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,046
Huh?

386
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:03,047
Who are you?

387
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:06,956
He doesn't recognise your voice.
They fried his brain.

388
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,526
Please state your name.

389
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,527
- They fried his brain like the rest.
- Shut up!

390
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,727
I think it's Owen.

391
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:23,207
Thank you.

392
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,486
Question two:

393
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,487
Do you believe in God?

394
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,206
What?

395
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:33,366
What?

396
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,367
Question two:
Do you believe in God?

397
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:40,727
What is this?
Screw you!

398
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:44,887
Please answer Yes or No.

399
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,886
What kind of god would
do this to people?

400
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:51,887
Please answer Yes or No.

401
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,006
No.

402
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,526
Okay?

403
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:59,366
No!

404
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,367
Now let me go.
Let me go!

405
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:06,207
God dammit.
Let me out of here!

406
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,646
Hit it.

407
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:10,966
I need a doctor.

408
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:13,766
- What does it do?
- Just hit it.

409
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:16,446
Please!

410
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,447
For Christ's sake!

411
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:54,287
Still want your girlfriend to
sail through to the exit?

412
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:03,406
He...

413
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:06,407
He's gone. It's over.

414
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,966
- He was one of us.
- No.

415
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,967
Once inside, he's one of them.

416
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:37,447
So this is your big exit procedure?

417
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:43,127
What are we doing here?

418
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,567
"Do you believe in God?"
It all hinges on that?

419
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:52,397
I just read the questions
and push the buttons, okay?

420
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:02,927
What happens if you push Yes?

421
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:05,246
I don't know.

422
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,247
No one's ever said Yes.

423
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,166
Here.

424
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:19,167
Send this upstairs.

425
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,367
Do it!

426
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,647
Do you believe in God?

427
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:23,167
What kind of animals would do this?

428
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:48,438
Owen is...
Owen is probably out sick again.

429
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:52,007
- You sure?
- Yes.

430
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:00,847
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in there.

431
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,406
I'm through pushing buttons.

432
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:10,407
No!

433
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:16,127
Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

434
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:52,807
I'm inside.

435
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:57,127
Okay...

436
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:35,487
Thank God.

437
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,487
You stupid jackass!

438
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:52,327
Good evening, Mr. Dodd.

439
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:57,247
I believe these belong to you.

440
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:03,325
Well, it looks that you got yourself a
little bit of a situation down here.

441
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:07,367
May we?

442
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,767
The boys upstairs felt
you could perhaps use a hand,

443
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:14,086
and so, here we are.

444
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:18,365
My name is Jax and these are my
associates Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley.

445
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:20,806
Right.

446
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:23,807
Gentleman, first things first,
we locate our mouse.

447
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:28,198
He has no implant and so we have to
do this the old fashioned way, I'm afraid.

448
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,367
Mr. Quigley, run a visual check on
all rooms, he couldn't have got far.

449
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:32,686
Yes, Sir.

450
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:36,202
Mr. Finn, run a probability tree
on his potential movements.

451
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,447
- Let's have some contingency, shall we.
- Right away, Sir.

452
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,647
Excuse me, Mr. Jax.

453
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:24,327
Excuse me, sir.

454
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,367
Yes Mr. Codd?

455
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:32,446
It's Dodd, sir.

456
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,447
What do I do?

457
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:37,646
- I'm sorry?
- What do...?

458
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:41,083
Yes I almost forgot I have
your orders from upstairs.

459
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:45,007
It's a personal delivery.

460
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,966
"Order number 7-9-3,
bla, bla, bla, bla... "

461
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:53,801
"Commence standard series
of needle tests on Rains group. "

462
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,807
- You do know what that means?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,366
Of course, sir.

464
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:07,367
All in a day's work, sir.
Right away, sir.

465
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:10,927
Do us a tinsy favour and use
Mr. Wynn's auxiliary monitor.

466
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:14,006
We'll need the big guns here
for our little mouse hunt.

467
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,686
Of course, Sir.
Anything I can do to help, sir...

468
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,526
That the spirit Mr. Modd, way to
keep the world safe for democracy.

469
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:22,527
- Have we got a visual yet?
- Still working on it, Sir.

470
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:32,442
Okay, K-G-K.
Three odds.

471
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:35,607
M-A-Q.
Three odds.

472
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:39,236
Safe.
Like taking candy from a baby.

473
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:47,126
A-Z-Z. A-Z-Z!

474
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:50,127
Got it.

475
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:59,687
I don't know why we bother
with these things anymore.

476
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,046
A-Z-Z.

477
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:04,886
It's the first time I've seen a Z.

478
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,887
- Do you think it means anything?
- I don't know.

479
00:52:08,887 --> 00:52:11,887
Ah, don't let the door close!

480
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:15,127
Dammit!

481
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:29,007
She's gone.

482
00:52:48,287 --> 00:52:50,046
Got it.

483
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,047
Subject is isolated.

484
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,247
And now the tricky part.

485
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,567
Okay. You were last seen here.

486
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:17,526
That was an hour ago.

487
00:54:17,527 --> 00:54:20,527
She should still be in the same coordinate.

488
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,086
The rooms move.
Do they have to?

489
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,841
She can't be that far.

490
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:52,363
Yeah but if we veer too far off course
looking for her we'll never find the edge.

491
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,246
What do you suggest, killer?
That we'll cut our loses?

492
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:58,247
Uh, Guys.

493
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:03,087
Are we sure this room is safe?

494
00:55:07,727 --> 00:55:12,198
Maybe he just starved to death.
God I'm hungry.

495
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:22,127
- What are you doing?
- We could use these.

496
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:25,398
- We have to keep moving.
- We have to get back on track.

497
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:28,718
We've already chased our tails
for an hour looking for her.

498
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,166
God! This headache is not going away...

499
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,167
- Maybe it's that chip in your head.
- What?

500
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:40,117
It's true isn't it? I mean they now put
bio-receivers in all you army boys.

501
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,206
Keeps you on a leash.

502
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,207
Lady you've got a hell of an imagination.

503
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,847
Jackpot. It's her.

504
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:52,966
Dammit.

505
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,846
Is she all right?

506
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:57,926
She's not moving.

507
00:55:57,927 --> 00:56:00,927
Great.

508
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:11,087
Wake up.

509
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,367
Are you all right?

510
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:17,006
Rise and shine...

511
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,007
Is she...?

512
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,926
There's a pulse.

513
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:25,646
She's burning up.

514
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:28,647
Can you hear me?

515
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:32,246
- Oh my God.
- What happened to you?

516
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:35,247
Help...

517
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,246
I need a doctor.

518
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:44,566
- Don't let her touch you!
- Let go!

519
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,286
- Watch it!
- Oh my God!

520
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:49,287
Don't leave me!

521
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,647
- You just...
- I didn't mean to...

522
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:06,767
She scratched and I...

523
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:10,647
You put her out of her misery.

524
00:57:11,207 --> 00:57:14,207
My headache's gone.

525
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,607
Something's eating her.

526
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:23,206
A chemical or a virus.

527
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,966
We never checked this room for traps.

528
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,967
I could be in the air.

529
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,087
- Let's see your arm.
- We've got to get outta here.

530
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,407
- Show me your arm.
- He's right, we've gotta get outta here.

531
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,966
Your arm. Where she scratched you,
Let's see it.

532
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,486
- Why, you think...?
- Yes, I think!

533
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:42,487
Fine! there, see?
Nothing!

534
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,127
Flesh wound.

535
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,606
Sure.

536
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:58,086
Nothing.

537
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,246
What do we do with him?

538
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,606
What do you mean?

539
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,046
I think whatever was eating away
at her, is spreading to him.

540
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,047
- Hey I'm still here!
- Not for long!

541
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,566
- I say we ditch him.
- Screw you!

542
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,567
Just relax guys,
nobody's ditching anyone.

543
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:16,766
Look at him.

544
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,726
Oh my God.

545
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,166
What?

546
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,167
Your face.

547
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,207
Crap.

548
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:41,166
Please don't leave me.

549
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,646
This is horrible.

550
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:45,006
You wanna baby-sit a dead man?
Be my guest.

551
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:48,007
Please. I'll do anything.

552
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,567
Anything?

553
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,607
From now on,
you test the rooms.

554
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,407
All of them.

555
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:04,647
Fine.

556
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:15,407
Well, we're not going down there.

557
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,567
No sense wasting a good boot.

558
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:35,086
Help me!

559
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:38,087
He's still alive down there!

560
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,407
Forget it, he's gone.

561
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:44,647
You heartless son of a bitch!

562
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:22,207
No!

563
01:00:26,607 --> 01:00:29,086
- Don't come near me.
- I was protecting us.

564
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:32,318
- You murdered him.
- He was infected.

565
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,763
You saw it, it was spreading.
We'd be dead by now.

566
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:39,317
- You don't know that.
- Actually, he's right.

567
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,847
It's a highly contagious form of a virus.

568
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:46,167
- Flesh eating disease.
- Who the hell are you?

569
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:51,520
I...
I've come to help.

570
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,527
- Damn.
- Problem, Mr. Scrod?

571
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:58,606
- No problem Sir.
- Anything of interest?

572
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:00,646
Actually Sir, I was about to...

573
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:03,647
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

574
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:05,886
Yes Sir.

575
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:09,038
As I was running my test series
as instructed Sir,

576
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:12,847
The query intersected with my subject, Sir.

577
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,806
Good work, Rod.

578
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,807
Who says they only hire the mentally
challenged down here?

579
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,566
Open.

580
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:23,567
- Thank you, Sir.
- Up on the main monitor now, Please.

581
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,720
We keep... They, collect data and run tests.

582
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,163
All kinds of tests. Testing
Chemical and Biological agents,

583
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:35,604
Measure brain activity, endurance,
most of it I don't even understand.

584
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,086
And that's just what
I see in my department.

585
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:42,087
I hear about others who
do different work.

586
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:46,007
I even heard there
are other facilities.

587
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:48,566
Cubes.

588
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,486
Christ.

589
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,406
I just heard rumours.

590
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,486
- Why can't we remember anything?
- I don't know,

591
01:01:54,487 --> 01:01:57,763
I always assumed that it was so they
could have a blank slate to work with.

592
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:01,556
Blank slate?  Bastards,
you've been using us as lab rats.

593
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:04,446
Hey man, not me.

594
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:06,486
I'm just the computer guy,
system checks. Stuff like that.

595
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:09,487
Oh yeah, you just followed orders.

596
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,406
Yeah.

597
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:15,407
- You make me sick.
- Look, you got it all wrong.

598
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:17,726
- I hate my job.
- You're job?

599
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,246
How can you do this to people.

600
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:22,766
It was your choice.

601
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,767
You volunteered, only you
don't remember anymore.

602
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:28,246
At least that what they told us.

603
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:30,206
And you believed them?

604
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,517
Well, yeah. I saw the consent forms.
Except for yours!

605
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,486
You're lying!

606
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:38,487
Who would volunteer for this?

607
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,686
Well it was either this
or execution so...

608
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,126
What?

609
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,086
They say you're all condemned prisoners,

610
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:48,087
who volunteer for the experiment
instead of facing the death penalty.

611
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:51,286
I never did anything to deserve this.

612
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:54,287
Yeah well, tell it to Meyerhold, Right?

613
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:03,197
- We're innocent, dammit!
- I didn't volunteer for this!

614
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,846
I know, because your
consent form is missing!

615
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:07,366
Shut up!

616
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,367
While you were doing your system checks,

617
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,567
did you happen to see a little girl?

618
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,926
No. Yes.

619
01:03:15,927 --> 01:03:18,886
I mean, I saw her.

620
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:21,887
I saw one little girl...

621
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:24,806
In your dreams.

622
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:27,046
- What?
- Yeah.

623
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:29,126
It's hard to explain.

624
01:03:29,127 --> 01:03:32,127
Here.

625
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,439
You see, another thing they have us
do, is record the subject's,

626
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,607
the people's dreams.

627
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:42,207
Her name's Anna, Right?

628
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,767
- They can see into our dreams?
- Yeah.

629
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:54,886
Where is my daughter, you piece of shit?!

630
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:56,406
- I don't know!
- You're lying!

631
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:58,406
No, Please!
I came to help!

632
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:01,407
Rains!

633
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:03,046
We need him.

634
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:06,047
- Why?
- I can show you the exits.

635
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:09,207
Go ahead, where are they?

636
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:12,326
You were wrong about the cube.

637
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:15,327
It's only 25 rooms all around.

638
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:18,447
Only 2 rooms have Z coordinates valued 26.

639
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,207
They periodically move to the perimeter,

640
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,447
but those 2 exit points are monitored.

641
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:28,798
And there's supposed
to be an auxiliary exit.

642
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:31,366
That leads directly outside the cube.

643
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,766
How do we get to that one?

644
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:35,126
I don't know.

645
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:38,127
So what use is he?

646
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:42,124
- Can you show us how to avoid the traps?
- Yes, definitely.

647
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,406
Okay.

648
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:48,797
Just read me the coordinates
from the surrounding rooms, please.

649
01:04:51,527 --> 01:04:54,527
I was right.
The coordinates.

650
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:58,526
Well, well...

651
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:02,918
It seems that our little mouse,
is a rat after all.

652
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:08,367
Mr. Finn, could you do
something about that, please?

653
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:11,687
Yes, Sir.

654
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:20,927
This one's C-F-P.

655
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:24,767
The hell...?

656
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:30,326
- Damn.
- What is it?

657
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,327
- The letters. They just disappeared.
- What?

658
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,767
They're all gone.

659
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:46,766
They know I'm here.

660
01:05:46,767 --> 01:05:50,396
- So now will be a good time to move.
- Good idea. You first.

661
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,206
Okay.

662
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:57,207
I can't make any promises,
but this should be the way.

663
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:01,562
Mr. Quigley, could you isolate
that quadrant for me please?

664
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,556
Mr. Finn, show me the current trap
configuration, "s'il vous plait".

665
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:25,007
"Merci".

666
01:06:25,887 --> 01:06:29,562
Let's make their life a little
more interesting, shall we?

667
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,887
Okay...

668
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:57,317
Trapped. Sure looked easy from my desk.

669
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:27,446
They trapped all the rooms around us.
Now what?

670
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,447
Really glad you
showed up to help.

671
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:37,403
My God. I'm actually
starting to enjoy myself.

672
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:41,842
You know what? I think we should keep
getting together and doing this more often.

673
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,447
God dammit.

674
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,806
What?

675
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:59,006
Sir.

676
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:01,526
Yes, Sir.

677
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,406
Yes, Sir.

678
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:07,366
Sorry, Sir.

679
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:10,326
Right away, Sir.

680
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:13,327
"Just finish it, you idiot."

681
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:15,006
Ungrateful cretins.

682
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,006
You didn't hear that.

683
01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:21,080
Okay gentleman, we have
the word from on high.

684
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:23,406
It's time to blow this popsicle stand.

685
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,086
- Mr. Quigley.
- Sir?

686
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:27,686
You heard the man.
Just finish it.

687
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,687
Yes Sir.

688
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,967
Okay, let me think,
let me think.

689
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:42,447
What the... ?

690
01:08:55,807 --> 01:08:58,166
Now what do we do?

691
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,167
The floor. the floor.

692
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:05,607
I'm sorry.

693
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:10,887
God dammit!
I don't wanna die in here!

694
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:24,167
What's happening?

695
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,846
What stopped it?

696
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:33,847
I don't know.

697
01:09:41,087 --> 01:09:44,087
Come on, you piece of...

698
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:50,607
- What the hell?
- I don't know Sir, we suddenly lost contact.

699
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:55,407
Yes, I can see that. Why?

700
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:58,717
Maybe the energy required for
the test itself blew out the capacitor.

701
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:01,206
I mean, we're not talking
state-of-the-art equipment.

702
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:04,961
Wrong. That's not how it works.
That's not how it was designed.

703
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:08,486
Someone is screwing with the connection.

704
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:10,926
I don't know Sir.
It isn't me.

705
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:13,927
Me neither, Sir.

706
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:21,607
What?
I have no idea.

707
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:25,247
It's not me, I swear.

708
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:34,283
You wouldn't lie to me,
Now would you Mr. Clodd?

709
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:39,367
No Sir. Wouldn't think of it.

710
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:50,206
Questions? Comments?
What are we waiting for?

711
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:53,207
Get us back online!

712
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,486
Damn.

713
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:16,487
- Nothing.
- "Nothing" is not an answer.

714
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,526
Excuse me, Sir.

715
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,527
- Excuse me?
- What is it?

716
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:28,127
Can I use the facilities, Sir?

717
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:31,406
Just go!

718
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:34,407
For the love of God,
where do they find these people?

719
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,126
I don't think it's software, Sir.

720
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,324
- It's definitely a hardware problem.
- Listen.

721
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:44,046
This is getting embarrassing now. Okay?

722
01:11:44,047 --> 01:11:46,326
I needn't remind you Gentlemen,
that in a few minutes

723
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:49,166
we'll have no choice but
to send people in there.

724
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,716
Call me impulsive but I could probably
think of a couple of names:

725
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:54,766
Quigley! Finn!

726
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:57,767
You know, right of the top.
What is that noise?!

727
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,486
Something's wrong with the main power source.

728
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,487
It's gone into reset mode.

729
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:07,647
What the hell is going on?

730
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:10,967
Boot.

731
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:34,327
- Damn.
- You can say that again.

732
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:36,806
What?

733
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:39,006
Power go out?

734
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:40,406
Yeah.

735
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:43,407
So the traps don't work.

736
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:47,247
- That's the good news, yeah.
- What's the bad news?

737
01:12:49,127 --> 01:12:52,127
It's gone into reset mode.

738
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,886
The system will restart
itself in 10 minutes,

739
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:59,436
the first routine that runs
on restart, is a clean sweep.

740
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:03,404
- Is that as bad as it sounds?
- The Clean sweep program flash-incinerates

741
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:05,646
anything still living in all the rooms.

742
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,684
- So, we gotta move.
- Which way do we go?

743
01:13:09,727 --> 01:13:10,966
I don't know.

744
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:13,686
Okay, last time I ran the numbers you were

745
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:15,806
pretty much in the centre of the structure.

746
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:19,356
So I guess we just keep going in the same direction

747
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:21,646
until we get to the edge, right?

748
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,246
Great, so we're back to square one!

749
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:25,326
- Do you have a better idea?!
- No.

750
01:13:25,327 --> 01:13:28,444
I don't. 'Cause I'm not the one who uses
people as a fucking guinea pigs!

751
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:31,126
Wait!

752
01:13:31,127 --> 01:13:33,446
Back to square one!

753
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:36,803
Dodd. Dodd is the only one who
can power down this quickly.

754
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:41,724
But he knows that reset would
kick in, so why would he...?

755
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:47,086
Of course.

756
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:50,238
Clean sweep happens after
they realign to zero position.

757
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:53,407
- What?
- Quick. Let me see your map.

758
01:13:55,087 --> 01:13:56,726
When the power comes
on, the rooms are programmed

759
01:13:56,727 --> 01:14:00,037
to realign back to their original positions
before the clean sweep starts.

760
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:03,279
now, if we're in one of
the exit room, Like A-Z-Z,

761
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,566
it will move us to the perimeter, and

762
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:08,366
we'll have about... 3 seconds to get out.

763
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,367
- Before it fries us.
- Yeah.

764
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:17,356
If that room hasn't moved,
we'd might just make it. Yeah.

765
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:25,400
You know Mr. Wod has been in the
little boy's room an awfully long time.

766
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:36,407
Come on.

767
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,807
Gotcha

768
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:45,757
A noble attempt to save
your protégé, Mr. Dodd.

769
01:14:47,807 --> 01:14:50,646
But quite foolish, ultimately.

770
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:53,647
May I have that widget back, please?

771
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:57,607
I don't think I can do that, Sir.

772
01:15:00,007 --> 01:15:03,363
Mr. Dodd, are you
disobeying a direct order?

773
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:10,287
Yes. There...

774
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,766
Cute, and rather, cliché,

775
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:25,246
in an endearing kind of way.

776
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:29,035
Unfortunately, I do believe there is penalty,

777
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:32,326
a rather strict penalty,

778
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,327
for sabotaging state property.

779
01:15:39,887 --> 01:15:42,887
Instant paralysis! They
weren't kidding, were they.

780
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:46,087
However, not to worry,
Mr. Dodd,

781
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:51,927
You still will be able to feel.

782
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:02,807
5 minutes to reset.

783
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:06,407
I think I found the source of our
power problem.

784
01:16:06,487 --> 01:16:09,086
Does anyone knows where this goes?

785
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,766
Anyone?

786
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,767
That the central coupling.
I got it, Sir.

787
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:19,525
Still doesn't solve our observation problem,
they could be escaping as we speak.

788
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:22,446
Sir, in less then 5 minutes from
now the clean sweep kicks in,

789
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:24,686
and then I think our problem will evaporate.

790
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:27,687
Mr. Finn, I don't trust machines.

791
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,716
I have a machine to
thank for this, and this.

792
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:35,477
I need to see them, with
my own God-given eye.

793
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,647
Of course Sir, I just, I don't know how...

794
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,966
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

795
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:47,563
Mr. Finn, one of our runaway rats
is a former squad soldier. Is he not?

796
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:49,686
Yes Sir, that would be
Haskell, the big fellow.

797
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:53,919
And they still bio-chip the enlisted men,
do they not?

798
01:16:54,887 --> 01:16:57,887
Of course. Sir, that's brilliant...

799
01:17:00,887 --> 01:17:02,486
Mr. Quigley comes through.

800
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:06,400
Mr. Finn, acquire us an uplink to
the squad surveillance network.

801
01:17:06,847 --> 01:17:09,847
Yes Sir. Right away, Sir.

802
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:20,807
- Time?
- We still have 4 minutes!

803
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:31,287
Hold on!

804
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:42,847
There's no way he survived that.

805
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:50,367
We gotta go. Come on.

806
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:04,884
- We're locked on.
- Sir, we have a visual.

807
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,047
It's a weak signal.

808
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:11,006
Your tax dollars hard at work.

809
01:18:11,007 --> 01:18:14,007
Transmit the kill code.

810
01:18:15,527 --> 01:18:18,286
Pain inhibiters, activated.

811
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:21,287
Neuro-cam enhancers, amplified.

812
01:18:30,047 --> 01:18:33,047
- Are we there yet?
- Almost.

813
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:42,287
Haskell?

814
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:48,047
Move it!

815
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:55,887
Get off her!

816
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:39,247
Thanks.

817
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:44,087
Okay, come on.

818
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,847
- How much further?
- We're almost there.

819
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:02,887
A-Z-Z. This is it!

820
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,566
It's okay.

821
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,567
The power's out.
The power's out.

822
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:19,446
Chickliss...

823
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:22,447
Oh man...

824
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:30,926
- There's over one minute!
- Can't this thing go any faster?

825
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:39,198
- Sir, we've got the grid display back.
- They're at the perimeter.

826
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:42,806
30 seconds to clean sweep.

827
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:45,807
Well I think it's time for our little surprise.

828
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,807
I hope your shortcut worked, Mr. Quigley.

829
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:11,207
- Water.
- The auxiliary exit.

830
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:14,526
Leads directly outside.

831
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:17,527
- Now what?
- Can you swim?

832
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:28,807
Jump!

833
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:38,167
Well?
Did we get them?

834
01:22:38,327 --> 01:22:41,717
Sorry Sir.
The signal got scrambled at flash point.

835
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:45,327
I think we got 'em

836
01:22:46,807 --> 01:22:48,766
I don't like it.

837
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:51,767
Get a squad to the exit point.

838
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:09,087
This way!

839
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:55,926
- Come on.
- Run! Run!

840
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:58,927
Go!

841
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:22,406
He's conscious.

842
01:24:22,407 --> 01:24:26,446
Thank God.
Well, welcome back Mr. Wynn.

843
01:24:26,607 --> 01:24:29,607
You're conscious.
So, we can begin now.

844
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:34,246
"Eric Wynn,

845
01:24:34,247 --> 01:24:37,523
"as you have been found guilty
of high treason, sabotage

846
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:40,687
"and various other crimes against
your country and your God,

847
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:43,847
"and so on,
bla, bla, bla...

848
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:47,247
"Your sentence has been
extended for two more lifetimes."

849
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:49,446
What sentence?
I don't remember the trial!

850
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:52,447
Well, you were found guilty.
No further questions.

851
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:59,046
Wait! What are you doing?

852
01:24:59,047 --> 01:25:02,562
Well, we've decided on a few modifications

853
01:25:02,727 --> 01:25:05,606
before putting you back inside.

854
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:09,077
- Wait!
- Mr. Wynn, you are holding up progress.

855
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:11,406
Don't I get a choice?

856
01:25:11,407 --> 01:25:14,922
Don't all the condemned get a choice?
I choose death!

857
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,886
No, Mr. Wynn.

858
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:22,086
You do not get a choice.

859
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,046
You have already made your choice.

860
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:27,047
I believe this is your signature?

861
01:25:34,887 --> 01:25:37,046
- I don't understand.
- "I don't understand".

862
01:25:37,047 --> 01:25:40,926
You chose to become a test subject.
Many years ago.

863
01:25:41,607 --> 01:25:44,446
And you simply don't remember that.

864
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:46,726
It's all standard procedure.

865
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:49,727
But my job?
Dodd? Owen? Chickliss?

866
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:51,806
All lab rats. Just Like you.

867
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:54,406
Observing the observers,
you know, that kind of thing.

868
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:57,407
Very interesting results.

869
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,726
Wait!

870
01:26:01,727 --> 01:26:05,322
- You're actually starting to bore me now.
- Where is she?

871
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:10,643
Oh, the allusive Ms. Rains.
Well, you needn't worry about her.

872
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,927
You didn't catch her.

873
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:42,246
He's all yours.

874
01:26:42,247 --> 01:26:45,364
- Don't touch me.
- Don't worry. This wont hurt.

875
01:26:46,287 --> 01:26:49,287
Wait!

876
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:12,203
Mommy, I'm cold.
Why can't we have a fire?

877
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:16,887
Because the bad people might find us.

878
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:22,447
I have something to show you.

879
01:27:24,927 --> 01:27:27,927
See. That's us.

880
01:27:28,447 --> 01:27:31,447
We're superheroes.

881
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:35,765
These are very special because they
were drawn by a very special person.

882
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:39,247
Is he a superhero too?

883
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:43,644
Yes. Yes, he is.

884
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:17,767
What wrong with him?

885
01:28:18,407 --> 01:28:21,407
He doesn't seem to know we're here.

886
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:24,607
This room is green.

887
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:47,007
Hi there.

888
01:28:48,527 --> 01:28:51,527
- This room is green.
- Yes, It is.

889
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:56,127
What is it, shock?

890
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:59,606
I wanna go back to the blue room.

891
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,206
I think he's mentally handicapped.

892
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:05,207
- That's all we need, a retard.
- Don't!

893
01:29:05,327 --> 01:29:08,327
How the hell did he survive in here?

894
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:11,886
I wanna go back.

895
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:13,246
I wanna go back.

896
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,686
Back. Back.

897
01:29:15,687 --> 01:29:18,246
I wanna go back.

898
01:29:18,247 --> 01:29:21,247
Wanna go back.
