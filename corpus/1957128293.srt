Three, two, one.

2
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,944
We live in amazing times...

3
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,912
That's what I'm talking about!

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,681
...Uncertain times,

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,449
Times that make us
scratch our heads

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,153
And wonder
what in the hell is that?

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,589
Join me on a search
for answers,

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,924
Answers that require puppets,

9
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,561
Tuba players,
unexpected discoveries,

10
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,596
And a little help...

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,730
- Oh!
- Whoo!

12
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,965
- ...From my old buddy chuck.
- Nope.

13
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,567
Together,
we're going to prove

14
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,936
That every single thing
in our crazy

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,672
And unpredictable world
is connected.

16
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:41,807
Genius.

17
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,908
I'm mike rowe...

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,909
It's alive!

19
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,911
...And this is "six degrees."

Welcome to another
15-hour day of organized chaos

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,358
Here on the set of
"six degrees."

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,663
This promises to be a most
interesting endeavor today.

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:05,864
How you doing, chuck?

26
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,666
Is the tuba necessary?

27
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,102
The tuba is critical
to what's about to happen.

28
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,537
Big night for chuck
last night.

29
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,705
He was full-on convention mode,
chuck,

30
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,541
And he's paying
the price today.

31
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,842
You gonna make it?

32
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,043
Eventually, yeah.

33
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,912
You will be assuming
the identity

34
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,346
Of at least six characters,

35
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,915
So we're going to need
your "a" game.

36
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,149
Okay.

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,086
This might help, though,
with the hangover.

38
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,353
What is it?

39
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:31,890
This is
an ancient mousetrap,

40
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,393
And it's guaranteed to cure
what ails you.

41
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:35,661
You trust me?

42
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,496
Not really.

43
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,865
Well, you should,
because this is how

44
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,835
A mousetrap
can cure your hangover.

45
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,136
Good luck.

46
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,239
Oh.

47
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,275
As always, we'll be taking
the scenic route to history,

48
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,745
Traversing switchbacks,
silver peaks and canyons,

49
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,049
And a few overlooked historical
figures along the way,

50
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,652
Figures that will help us
prove unequivocally

51
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,956
How a mouse trap
can cure your hangover.

52
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,425
Our story starts here somewhere
in the middle of maine,

53
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:12,097
1854-ish with this kid,
hiram maxim.

54
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,633
He's 14 years old,
and he works as an apprentice

55
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,069
In this carriage
manufacturing facility.

56
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,638
But at the moment,
hiram is not concerned

57
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,341
With the manufacturing
of carriages.

58
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:26,345
He is vexed by a far
more troubling problem --

59
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,213
The presence of mice.

60
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,582
Mice are everywhere.

61
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:34,353
They scamper, they run,
they chew at his boots,

62
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,055
Making him absolutely crazy.
Hiram's had enough.

63
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,092
So he's spending his lunch hour
today on a mission,

64
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:44,129
A mission to mass murder
all the mice in maine.

65
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,800
In other words, the kid's trying
to build a better mousetrap.

66
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:51,570
This curious kid
often went hunting,

67
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,106
Bringing with him his trusty gun

68
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,742
And the immutable laws
of physics.

69
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,811
When the gun fires,
an explosion in the shell

70
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:03,882
Propels the bullet forward with
a significant amount of force.

71
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,785
But the force of the bullet
moving forward

72
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,856
Is equal to the force
of the gun moving backwards.

73
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,391
This lesson has been learned

74
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,160
By anyone
who has ever fired a weapon.

75
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,931
A painful lesson made possible

76
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,867
By the one
and only sir isaac newton.

77
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,836
I refer, of course,
to newton's laws of motion,

78
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,406
Specifically the third law
that says every action

79
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,008
Has an equal
and opposite reaction.

80
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,377
That's the lesson
that young hiram learned

81
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,946
When his gun knocked
him on his butt.

82
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,349
Now he's applying
that lesson to the task at hand,

83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,885
Designing a better mousetrap.

84
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,386
Here's the essential problem.

85
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,590
The state-of-the-art mousetraps
of the day

86
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,425
Worked pretty much
like this one.

87
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,227
You'd set it and put some bait
on a hook

88
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,095
And the mouse would come in
and take the bait

89
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,330
And it would close,

90
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,433
Thereby trapping a single mouse
inside this cage.

91
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,368
Basically, you were one
and done.

92
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,803
That's not what hiram wants.

93
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,240
He wants to murder as many mice
as he possibly can,

94
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,641
And he's going to do it

95
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,876
With a little help

96
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,012
From newton's third law.

97
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,416
Just like a bullet, hiram's
mousetrap creates a recoil.

98
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,253
The mouse,
lured in by the cheese,

99
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,887
Falls onto the floor,

100
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,025
Which triggers a reaction,
a recoil that closes the door,

101
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,861
Resetting the trap
for its next victim.

102
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:26,131
In other words,
a repeating mouse trap.

103
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,267
Does he pull it off?
Yeah.

104
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,302
Does he catch a lot of mice?
Yep.

105
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,637
Does he patent it?

106
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,139
Does he make a fortune
by mass-producing it?

107
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,143
No. Hiram maxim leaves
a lot on the table

108
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,213
In the early part of his career,
literally.

109
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,316
If you look at
some of what he invented

110
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,718
Over the years,
it's kind of mind-blowing.

111
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,389
This is a lamp
for a locomotive.

112
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,524
This is an early curling iron.

113
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,594
This is reportedly
a better cup of coffee.

114
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,429
Mm!

115
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,930
Horrible miss on that one.

116
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,500
This is a pipe of peace.

117
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,402
It's basically an inhaler

118
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,971
To help with the bronchitis
that he suffered from.

119
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:10,108
This is a a gas engine,
one of the first of its kind.

120
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,978
He also invented
the automatic sprinkling system.

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,047
This is pure genius.

122
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,784
This technology is in buildings
all around the world today.

123
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:23,055
It puts the water
only where the fire is.

124
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,691
Right. He patents it.
Does he make any money?

125
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,125
No.
He lets the patent expire

126
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,761
And then other people
come in and make a fortune.

127
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,064
Here's another heartbreaker,
the light bulb.

128
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,435
According to maxim, it was he
who invented this, not edison.

129
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,104
He got ripped off in a patent
case that went to court.

130
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,641
And long story short,
he was shafted.

131
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,344
The story of the shafting starts
with a bottle of milk.

132
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,813
At least william sawyer said
it was milk,

133
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,615
But william sawyer may have been
filling his milk bottles

134
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,950
With something else.

135
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,786
According to his employer,
william sawyer was, quote,

136
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:59,057
"an expert electrician,
but also a great drunkard.

137
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,961
I made up my mind that
we had better get rid of him."

138
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,665
Well, william sawyer's employer
was hiram maxim.

139
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,201
Maxim fired sawyer,
but not before he made off

140
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,669
With something valuable --

141
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:15,340
The design for an electric lamp
which saw your patented in 1878.

142
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,709
Enter thomas edison.

143
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,912
If edison was good at inventing,
he was great at patent law.

144
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,081
And edison argued
that sawyer's patent

145
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,317
Wasn't novel enough to be valid

146
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,820
And also was fraudulently
and illegally procured.

147
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,991
After a protracted legal battle,
edison gets the patent revoked

148
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,826
And edison knows
when that happens,

149
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,628
The rights won't revert back

150
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,364
To hiram maxim
or to maxim's company.

151
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,667
Instead, they default
to another patent application

152
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,836
Edison had filed.

153
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,572
So edison becomes the accepted
inventor of the light bulb,

154
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,342
Leaving hiram maxim s.O.L. --

155
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,477
So out of lights.

156
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,812
But he never gives up.

157
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,448
He never stops tinkering.
He never stops drawing.

158
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,850
A few years later,
he's back at it again.

159
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,519
This is a helicopter,

160
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,423
The first design,
except for maybe da vinci,

161
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,691
But he's ready to
bring it to market.

162
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,160
He's got it done.

163
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,195
He just -- he just doesn't
put the ball through the hoop.

164
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,465
He's full of good ideas,
but he's not really executing.

165
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,300
And it really is enough
to make you wonder

166
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:20,005
If hiram maxim is ever going to
do anything to make a killing.

167
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,007
I'll give you a hint.

168
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,742
He does.

169
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:31,383
1881 -- it was an incredible
time for inventors,

170
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,686
The phonograph, jeans,
the cash register,

171
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,756
The light bulb, and more
had all just been released.

172
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,259
All of these would have
significant impacts on society,

173
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,729
But none inspired hiram
quite as much as the tidbit

174
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,332
He received
while walking around.

175

That led gsi out of the oil
fields and into electronics.

karcher's little oil company

00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,709
When computers were
the size of a room,

361
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,346
Texas instruments
released the transistor radio,

362
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,814
Which quickly became

363
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,484
The best-selling electronics
device of its time.

364
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,788
More importantly, this was proof
that electronics

365
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,790
Could fit
in the palm of your hand.

366
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,992
This simple radio
was made possible

367
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:45,463
By the invention of the
transistor by william shockley.

368
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,798
More on him later.

369
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,034
The transistor was smaller,
cooler, more durable,

370
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,337
And ran on less energy than
its vacuum-tube predecessor.

371
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,973
But it still had
one major problem.

372
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,609
It could only do one thing.

373
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,847
If you wanted to do 10 things,
you needed 10 transistors.

374
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,450
If you wanted to do
a thousand things,

375
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,319
Well, you needed
a really big building.

376
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,355
Engineers at the time
were able to design

377
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,126
Much more complex systems
than the transistor radio,

378
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,796
But without more
complex circuitry,

379
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,865
They were impossible to realize.

380
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,935
This problem is known
as the tyranny of numbers.

381
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,070
And in the summer of 1958,

382
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,840
Electronics companies
around the world

383
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,410
Are in a mad dash
to solve this problem,

384
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:36,114
Which brings us here to dallas,
texas,

385
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:40,184
Where the competition might not
seem so heated at the moment.

386
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,253
That's because
it's summer vacation

387

At the headquarters
of texas instruments.

388
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,726
Unfortunately, for new employee
jack kilby,

389
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,829
He doesn't have
any vacation time accrued.

390
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,165
Fortunately for the rest

391
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,168
He has the office

And so for the next two weeks,
jack kilby gets busy.

393
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:06,477
He integrates the circuitry
of individual transistors

394

Onto a single chip
using components

395
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,549
Made with an element
called germanium,

396
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,818
Which acts as a semiconductor.

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,587
It is a revolutionary idea,

398
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,258

That a mouse trap
will cure your hangover.

404
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,409
We started with the invention
of an automated mouse trap,

405
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,811
Which led to the first
fully automatic machine gun,

406
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,714
Which created the need for
something called a war tuba.

407
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,884
That tuba technology paved
the way for seismic reflection,

408
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,953
Which was used to find oil.

409
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,321
That oil spawned a tech company

410
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,323
That turned into
texas instruments,

411
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,092

To a gobsmacked audience of
2,000 people in san francisco

523
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,034
Who must have thought
that they, too,

524
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,738
Were on some kind of a trip,
because in that demo,

525
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,275
Engelbart introduces
the groundwork for windows,

526
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,845
Graphic user interface,
hypertext links,

527
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,848
Video conferencing,
and the mouse,

528
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,950
Which he himself created.

529
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:24,989
Right now, he's squirting lsd
into his eyes.

530
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,730
Want to have a look
inside his brain?

531
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,533
I know I do.

532
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,771
Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

533
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,542
Doug engelbart's brain
is a great place to understand

534
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,744
And demonstrate the effects
of lsd

535
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:52,049
Because doug engelbart
has dropped a lot of acid.

536
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,051
His brain, like yours,

537
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,520
Is divided up
into a series of sections.

538
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:00,824
Each one functions more or less
like its own separate computer.

539
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,160
Now, normally,
there's a governor over top

540
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,196
Of all of those sections --
that's called the ego.

541
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:10,834
What happens with lsd is that
the ego becomes compromised,

542
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,437
Allowing the individual parts
of your brain

543
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,005
To communicate with each other

544
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,275
In ways
they otherwise would not.

545
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,378
This opens up all sorts
of possibilities.

546
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,115
It also does some very strange
things to inanimate objects

547
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:29,286
And light and sound and space
and time and so forth.

548
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:34,024
But we here at "six degrees"
do not in any way condone

549
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,327
The illegal use of drugs.

550
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,997
We're not suggesting that you
should squirt lsd into your eye

551
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,066
Or your nose
or your ear or your mouth

552
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,301
Or any other hole in your body.

553
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,669
That's not what we're saying.

554
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,471
We're simply saying
that once upon a time,

555
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,374
This was perfectly legal
and some very smart people

556
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:53,544
Thought it was more
than a way to escape reality.

557
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:56,046
They thought it was a way
to solve problems.

558

A very central part of what we
have developed technologically

564
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,001

through this display to us.

565

After there, I might copy

567
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,278
And this point to that point,
and it will copy it.

If you're just joining us.
Man, you missed a lot.

693
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,722
It started
with a better mousetrap,

694
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,390
A better gun, a better tuba,

695
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,758
The traitorous eight,

696
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,227
And a scientist
who invented lsd.

697
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,229
Time now to land the plane.

698
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,697
All the colors.

699
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,370
It would be convenient to say
that lsd was responsible

700
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,338
For driving
the counterculture revolution

701
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,073
That defined the 1960s.

702
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,543
Some people think it did.
Many, in fact.

703
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,280
Drugs were certainly in many
places that defined that decade.

704
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,449
Can you imagine the summer
of love

705
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,886
Without a happy, heaping helping
of hallucinogens?

706
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,490
Fact is, drugs brought a lot of
like-minded people together,

707
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,659
People who began
to question societal norms,

708
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:54,464
Demand civil rights
and equal justice for everybody.

709
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,735
The same people who suggested
that maybe the war in vietnam

710
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,304
Might be something worth ending.

711
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,839
By the mid-'60s,

712
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:06,243
People were opposing the war
on moral grounds.

713
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,046
On October 21, 1967,

714
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:12,215
100,000 people
showed up in washington

715
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:15,552
To protest the war in vietnam.

716
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:24,327
By 1973, the vietnam war
was an unmitigated disaster

717
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,797
And there was only one man
with the courage

718
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,266
And the guts to get us out.

719
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,903
Richard milhous nixon.

720
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,405
True -- he wasn't perfect.

721
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,875
There were stories in the press
about his purported affection

722
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,578
For multiple martinis,

723
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,183
His alleged taste for the dog
biscuits he kept on his desk,

724
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,052
And, of course,
the legendary paranoia

725
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,856
That led him to tape every
conversation in the oval office.

726
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,626
But on January 23, 1973,

727
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,229
Richard nixon
was the man for the job.

728
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,499
At 3:00 a.M.
Eastern standard time,

729
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,436
Nixon was waiting for a phone
call from henry kissinger.

730
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,041
Sign it!

731
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,476
With that phone call,

732
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,278
Nixon saved
thousands of american lives.

733
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,849
Yes, he's remembered today for
that whole watergate situation

734
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,719
And for being the first sitting
president to resign from office

735
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,988
And for becoming
the butt of countless jokes

736
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,190
And mean-spirited aspersions.

737
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,260
But eating dog biscuits?
Come on.

738
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,196
Who among us hasn't been drawn
to the tasty treats

739
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:37,200
Typically reserved
for man's best friend?

740
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,803
No dog lover
is beyond such redemption.

741
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,572
Even the man who got us
out of vietnam.

742
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,607
That's right.

743
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,042
That was me, baby.

744
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,044
When the north vietnamese
agreed to a cease-fire,

745
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,279
We packed up and left

746
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,082
And everybody lived
happily ever after. Right?

747
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,285
Not if you were in
the south vietnamese army.

748
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,022
After the u.S. Withdrew,

749
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,526
Communist north vietnam
took over south vietnam,

750
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,028
And if you were
a south vietnamese officer,

751
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,764
In those days,
things look pretty bleak.

752
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,700
And if you were
of chinese descent,

753
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,270
You needed to find a boat fast.

754
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,239
With south vietnam on the brink
of an economic crisis

755
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,407
After the war,

756
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,243
Low consumer prices offered
by the chinese

757
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,746
Posed a real threat
to the hanoi government.

758
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,783
Vietnamese soldiers were sent
to raid chinese homes and shops,

759
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:31,121
Forcing the chinese to flee
with nothing to their name.

760
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,092
Enter david tran.

761
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,895
David's a refugee
and a former south vietnamese

762
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,397
Of chinese descent.

763
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:44,601
It's 1980, and david is feeling
pretty rad right now.

764
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,204
He just started a small business
out of his apartment

765
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,106
Making hot sauce,
and people are eating it up.

766
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,642
Soon he'll have enough saved
for a van,

767
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:57,180
And eventually a proper space
to mass-produce this hot sauce.

768
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,249
He'll name his company
after the freighter

769
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:02,352
That took him from vietnam
to the united states.

770
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:06,022
And eventually huey fong foods
will come out with a new flavor,

771
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,892
Sriracha,
a name synonymous with hot sauce

772
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:12,362
That made over $80 million
last year alone.

773
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:17,033
Oh, yeah, 1980, david tran is
feeling pretty rad indeed.

774
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,135
He's the epitome
of the american dream,

775
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:24,274
A refugee escaping communism,
coming to this country on a boat

776
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:28,445
With nothing in his pockets
but a recipe for hot sauce.

777
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:32,849
Here's to you, david tran,
a poster child for capitalism

778
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,584
And the american dream.

779
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,993
Of course, none of david tran's
accomplishments

780
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,329
Would have been possible
if he hadn't made it to america

781
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,233
After the united states
departed vietnam,

782
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:54,037
A departure made possible
by a counterculture revolution,

783
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,340
A revolution fueled
by free love, world peace,

784
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,476
And all the acid you could drop,

785
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,412
A drug that changed computers
forever

786
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,348
After two geniuses
independently invented

787
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,583
The microchip.

788
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,251
Thanks to another genius

789
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:12,789
Who used seismic technology
to find gunfire.

790
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:17,160
Machine gunfire made possible
by yet another genius

791
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,663
Who never got over
his burning desire

792
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,398
To build a better mousetrap,

793
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,633
Which is really just
a long way of saying

794
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,904
That is how a mousetrap can help
you cure your hangover,

795
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:31,775
Assuming, of course,
you have the secret ingredient.

796
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:34,144
I refer to sriracha
hot chili sauce.

797
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,979
Thank you, david tran.

798
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:39,883
Just the thing to spice up
a bloody mary

799
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,384
And change
your whole world view.

800
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,421
You know what I'm talking about?
- sock it to me.

801
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:52,495
♪ ♪

802
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,999
Spicy is good. Alex, play
something appropriate.

803
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,106
I love it
when a plan comes together.

804
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,513
Not bad.

805
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,450
You couldn't have given me this
this morning?

806
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,955
There were stories in the press

807
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,692
About his purported affection
for multiple martinis.

808
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,629
The press loved to write
about his sweaty --

809
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,004
Owha-ha-ha!

810
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,807
I see what you did there.

811
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,680
I'll tell you what, it's not
a bad martini, very dry.

812
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,885
I was halfway to --
to downing the whole thing...

813
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,987
...When suddenly
I felt the fire

814
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,523
In the back of my throat,

815
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,093
And I said, "jesus,
lord have mercy.

816
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,063
They put real vodka
in this drink."
