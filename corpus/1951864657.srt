1
04:15:12,550 --> 04:15:14,427
You're good at stuff like this.

2
04:15:14,630 --> 04:15:17,702
I have to find something
distinctive about myself.

3
04:15:19,550 --> 04:15:22,906
-You're beautiful, Audrey.
-Seriously.

4
04:15:24,350 --> 04:15:26,181
He's a cheeseball.

5
04:15:27,310 --> 04:15:29,062
I don't think so.

6
04:15:29,390 --> 04:15:31,699
Besides, that's just the role
he plays.

7
04:15:36,070 --> 04:15:39,426
Maybe we could work
on this together later?

8
04:15:43,710 --> 04:15:45,302
Hey.

9
04:15:53,510 --> 04:15:57,947
The ocean contains 97 percent
of the Earth's water...

10
04:15:58,150 --> 04:16:01,222
...and generates over 70 percent
of the Earth's oxygen...

11
04:16:01,430 --> 04:16:04,024
...and replenishes our fresh water
through the clouds.

12
04:16:04,230 --> 04:16:07,028
If our oceans are failing,
then so will we.

13
04:16:08,150 --> 04:16:11,301
Well done. Justin, rebuttal.

14
04:16:14,350 --> 04:16:16,341
-Justin?
-Actually, I....

15
04:16:16,550 --> 04:16:18,029
I agree with Rebecca.

16
04:16:18,390 --> 04:16:19,948
I saw this show on Animal Planet...

17
04:16:20,150 --> 04:16:23,301
...about how they were giving
depressed male baboons Prozac.

18
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:28,220
Justin, this isn't Agree Club.
It's Debate Club.

19
04:16:29,150 --> 04:16:31,106
If you had done your research...

20
04:16:31,310 --> 04:16:34,222
...you'd have the confidence
to have an opinion.

21
04:16:34,590 --> 04:16:38,503
And if you have an opinion that's based
on facts gathered from your research...

22
04:16:38,710 --> 04:16:40,985
...then you are confident to speak.

23
04:16:41,190 --> 04:16:43,863
And speaking confidently
does what, class?

24
04:16:45,030 --> 04:16:47,100
Speaking confidently...

25
04:16:47,590 --> 04:16:50,024
-Wins minds.
-...that's right, wins minds.

26
04:16:53,310 --> 04:16:54,789
Justin...

27
04:16:55,710 --> 04:16:59,703
...if you wanna admire Rebecca,
you can do that during recess.

28
04:17:00,390 --> 04:17:03,939
If you wanna compete here,
you're gonna have to apply yourself.

29
04:17:06,990 --> 04:17:08,742
You can have a seat, Rebecca.

30
04:17:08,950 --> 04:17:11,464
Sasha, Lewis. Well done, have a seat.

31
04:17:13,910 --> 04:17:16,470
I like the Animal Planet,
though, Justin.

32
04:17:17,630 --> 04:17:19,063
Great channel.

33
04:17:45,950 --> 04:17:49,420
Perry is ready for you, Justin.
Come on back.

34
04:17:49,670 --> 04:17:51,228
Open.

35
04:17:51,430 --> 04:17:53,022
Close.

36
04:17:59,430 --> 04:18:02,627
Justin, do they teach you about
the subconscious at school?

37
04:18:02,830 --> 04:18:06,823
-A little.
-Ever heard of subconscious pressure?

38
04:18:07,030 --> 04:18:10,705
-Involuntary behaviours?
-Like a serial killer.

39
04:18:11,470 --> 04:18:12,983
Perhaps.

40
04:18:13,910 --> 04:18:18,461
Justin, all of us carry
a certain weight.

41
04:18:18,670 --> 04:18:21,423
A weight we don't recognise.

42
04:18:21,750 --> 04:18:24,628
Some of us have heavy loads.

43
04:18:25,510 --> 04:18:29,264
-In our minds?
-Yeah. A force from inside.

44
04:18:29,470 --> 04:18:34,225
We don't know its name,
but it makes us do things.

45
04:18:34,910 --> 04:18:36,628
Things we don't...

46
04:18:38,070 --> 04:18:39,867
...like to admit.

47
04:18:45,270 --> 04:18:47,420
-Your dad still in the six-K?
-Yeah.

48
04:18:48,950 --> 04:18:51,384
He's very attached to the idea
of winning.

49
04:18:52,030 --> 04:18:54,021
He was gonna be
a pro football player.

50
04:18:54,230 --> 04:18:57,188
-He didn't get picked up?
-He injured his knee.

51
04:18:59,430 --> 04:19:01,739
I don't think he likes me
always beating him.

52
04:19:01,950 --> 04:19:03,827
It's just for fun.

53
04:19:40,310 --> 04:19:42,107
The Oregon State application
came in.

54
04:19:43,310 --> 04:19:45,380
-So?
-So...

55
04:19:45,590 --> 04:19:48,343
...there's nothing wrong
with staying close to home.

56
04:19:48,590 --> 04:19:50,899
-What about New York?
-You don't have those grades.

57
04:19:51,110 --> 04:19:54,659
You just haven't applied yourself in
a way admissions people recognise.

58
04:19:55,430 --> 04:19:57,944
You apply to some fancy,
far-off school...

59
04:19:58,150 --> 04:20:01,586
-...you might be disappointed.
-Whatever.

60
04:20:10,350 --> 04:20:12,989
Plate, honey. Okay....

61
04:20:13,190 --> 04:20:16,262
<i>--the front for the liberation</i>
<i>of Palestine. Natalie.</i>

62
04:20:16,470 --> 04:20:19,826
<i>And, Charles, this bombing comes</i>
<i>just one day after the Palestinians...</i>

63
04:20:20,030 --> 04:20:22,260
<i>...paved the way</i>
<i>for a U.S.-back ed peace plan...</i>

64
04:20:22,470 --> 04:20:26,258
<i>...by appointing that new cabinet.</i>
<i>How much of a setback could this be?</i>

65
04:20:26,510 --> 04:20:28,466
What is that? You're doing it.

66
04:20:30,110 --> 04:20:31,862
-Mike.
-What?

67
04:20:32,070 --> 04:20:35,824
-What--?
-What? It's pathetic.

68
04:20:36,270 --> 04:20:38,864
-Come on. Go easy on this, Audrey.
-Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

69
04:20:39,830 --> 04:20:44,028
-Maybe you could give yourself a break.
-Come on, stop with the feel-good shit.

70
04:21:09,230 --> 04:21:10,982
<i>Hold on a second, now.</i>

71
04:21:11,550 --> 04:21:13,859
<i>-What about T.J. ?
<i>-Well...</i>

72
04:21:14,470 --> 04:21:17,348
<i>...you know I love him. It's just</i>
<i>the drugs. He can't beat them.</i>

73
04:21:17,550 --> 04:21:19,063
<i>But he needs you, especially now.</i>

74
04:21:20,390 --> 04:21:22,267
<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>you gotta know...</i>

75
04:21:22,470 --> 04:21:24,859
<i>... under all those problems,</i>
<i>he's good people.</i>

76
04:21:25,070 --> 04:21:28,506
<i>-What about you?</i>
<i>-I don't need love.</i>

77
04:21:29,870 --> 04:21:31,940
<i>I'm looking for something else.</i>

78
04:21:35,350 --> 04:21:37,420
Why didn't we bring Joel?

79
04:21:39,190 --> 04:21:42,102
Isn't this nice, just the two of us?

80
04:21:51,310 --> 04:21:52,982
Hey, Justin, come here.

81
04:21:57,350 --> 04:21:58,988
What do you think?

82
04:21:59,630 --> 04:22:01,063
When are you gonna wear that?

83
04:22:01,270 --> 04:22:03,784
I have to take my picture
for the Health Valley contest.

84
04:22:03,990 --> 04:22:07,107
-It's the Matt Schramm thing.
-God, Audrey.

85
04:22:07,750 --> 04:22:10,139
You're very good at thinking
things are stupid.

86
04:22:10,710 --> 04:22:13,144
I just wanna see if I can win.

87
04:22:14,350 --> 04:22:16,147
Do I look stupid in this?

88
04:22:18,230 --> 04:22:20,061
You're my mother.

89
04:22:20,830 --> 04:22:25,142
-You're married to my father.
-Who I love. It's just a bit of fun.

90
04:22:26,030 --> 04:22:27,622
Not for me.

91
04:22:27,830 --> 04:22:32,540
Well.... Tragically, darling, you lost
your sense of humour at the age of 17.

92
04:22:46,070 --> 04:22:50,268
How did you fall in love?

93
04:22:50,470 --> 04:22:52,825
God, I don't know, Justin.

94
04:22:53,830 --> 04:22:55,866
When he hurt his knee, though,
right?

95
04:22:57,070 --> 04:23:01,427
Well, he was sort of an asshole
before he did.

96
04:23:03,390 --> 04:23:06,700
But I was a brat too. I let everybody
believe I was so upset...

97
04:23:06,910 --> 04:23:08,707
...because he wasn't
gonna play anymore.

98
04:23:08,910 --> 04:23:11,788
But I kind of think
that's when I fell for him.

99
04:23:13,750 --> 04:23:15,706
It's nice to be needed.

100
04:23:17,190 --> 04:23:19,658
I don't know. It's complicated.

101
04:23:19,870 --> 04:23:21,064
Can you help me?

102
04:23:24,070 --> 04:23:26,584
There's a little button on this one.

103
04:23:27,470 --> 04:23:28,823
Okay.

104
04:23:31,710 --> 04:23:33,063
What about that?

105
04:23:33,270 --> 04:23:35,500
You think someone like Matt
would like that?

106
04:23:35,710 --> 04:23:37,780
Matt Schramm is not
gonna look at the pictures.

107
04:23:37,990 --> 04:23:42,745
Justin, it's just a little fun.
It's just a little silly, ridiculous fun.

108
04:23:46,430 --> 04:23:48,022
<i>You never even had a girlfriend.</i>

109
04:23:49,510 --> 04:23:50,545
So what?

110
04:23:50,750 --> 04:23:54,299
You don't even hang out with girls. You
just hang out with your nerdy friends.

111
04:23:55,150 --> 04:23:56,708
<i>No, I do hang out with girls.</i>

112
04:23:56,910 --> 04:23:58,980
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

113
04:23:59,190 --> 04:24:01,306
<i>But how come you never</i>
<i>bring any over here?</i>

114
04:24:01,510 --> 04:24:04,582
<i>Or I never, lik e,</i> see <i>you walking</i>
<i>with any or anything.</i>

115
04:24:04,790 --> 04:24:07,258
<i>-I</i> see <i>you walking by yourself.</i>
<i>-Why do you care, Joel?</i>

116
04:24:07,470 --> 04:24:09,904
<i>I don't know, because I'm bored.</i>

117
04:24:10,670 --> 04:24:14,026
Creeps. They can't take
anything seriously.

118
04:24:14,310 --> 04:24:15,743
Yeah, I know.

119
04:24:16,310 --> 04:24:19,859
Guys in your grade have fucked girls.
You haven't even kissed one.

120
04:24:21,310 --> 04:24:24,108
-Leave.
-No.

121
04:24:26,430 --> 04:24:28,341
You like that book?

122
04:24:28,550 --> 04:24:29,824
Oh, yeah.

123
04:24:30,030 --> 04:24:31,986
It's got great stuff on Greenpeace.

124
04:24:33,350 --> 04:24:35,181
Yeah, it's a good introduction.

125
04:24:35,750 --> 04:24:38,548
Those Greenpeace guys
are really brave.

126
04:24:39,150 --> 04:24:42,745
-I wish I could do something like that.
-What?

127
04:24:42,950 --> 04:24:46,226
-Be brave?
-Yeah.

128
04:24:48,950 --> 04:24:50,429
Maybe you already are.

129
04:25:05,870 --> 04:25:07,622
Are you gonna fuck me now?

130
04:25:16,430 --> 04:25:20,105
When you gonna clean all your
old stuff from the garage like you said?

131
04:25:21,910 --> 04:25:23,707
Right. Sorry.

132
04:25:33,790 --> 04:25:36,065
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

133
04:25:45,590 --> 04:25:46,784
Justin.

134
04:25:48,270 --> 04:25:50,226
This is stupid.

135
04:25:52,870 --> 04:25:54,940
Why " MFC"?

136
04:25:55,150 --> 04:26:00,747
Michael Forrest Cobb.

137
04:26:00,950 --> 04:26:02,941
Why your name?

138
04:26:03,670 --> 04:26:07,948
I don't think you're in a position
to be asking the questions right now.

139
04:26:08,750 --> 04:26:10,627
You should stop.

140
04:26:11,470 --> 04:26:13,267
I want to.

141
04:26:13,470 --> 04:26:15,381
I'm trying.

142
04:26:16,470 --> 04:26:18,188
Well....

143
04:26:19,150 --> 04:26:21,345
Don't you think I want to?

144
04:26:21,550 --> 04:26:23,700
Things are gonna be different.

145
04:26:25,110 --> 04:26:27,419
Why can't you trust me?

146
04:26:35,230 --> 04:26:37,790
The Sierra Club made them
turn this back into a refuge...

147
04:26:37,990 --> 04:26:40,379
...because it was going to be
used for a development.

148
04:26:40,790 --> 04:26:42,985
How do you know so much
about the environment?

149
04:26:43,190 --> 04:26:44,987
My parents were activists.

150
04:26:45,190 --> 04:26:48,978
See, humans think that we're the centre
of the universe, but we're not.

151
04:26:49,550 --> 04:26:51,700
I guess we're trained
to think that way.

152
04:26:51,910 --> 04:26:54,185
Yeah. It causes a lot of problems.

153
04:26:55,630 --> 04:26:57,302
Yeah.

154
04:26:57,750 --> 04:27:00,662
-It's hot today.
-Yeah.

155
04:27:01,910 --> 04:27:04,663
Think I'm gonna take my shirt off.

156
04:27:04,870 --> 04:27:06,508
Yeah?

157
04:27:07,750 --> 04:27:10,344
-Go ahead.
-You should too.

158
04:27:13,070 --> 04:27:14,549
What are you trying, Justin?

159
04:27:14,750 --> 04:27:17,184
No, really. We're so uptight
in our clothes.

160
04:27:17,390 --> 04:27:21,429
It's just like wearing
a bathing suit at the beach.

161
04:27:22,950 --> 04:27:27,102
No. My stomach would get sunburned
and my mom would get mad.

162
04:27:27,310 --> 04:27:29,141
Your mom looks at you naked?

163
04:27:29,350 --> 04:27:32,228
Well, yeah.
I mean, don't your parents?

164
04:27:32,430 --> 04:27:35,069
Audrey? Mike? No.

165
04:27:35,510 --> 04:27:38,183
Why do you call your parents
by their first name?

166
04:27:40,630 --> 04:27:42,985
Mike says when I call him " Dad,"
he feels old...

167
04:27:43,190 --> 04:27:45,829
...and I sound like a child
or something.

168
04:27:46,030 --> 04:27:49,181
And when I call Audrey " Mom,"
she seems old to him.

169
04:27:52,230 --> 04:27:54,539
So are you gonna
take your shirt off?

170
04:27:54,750 --> 04:27:56,229
You?

171
04:27:57,390 --> 04:27:58,982
Yeah.

172
04:29:01,390 --> 04:29:03,665
What's " MFC"?

173
04:29:07,830 --> 04:29:09,548
Justin?

174
04:29:09,870 --> 04:29:11,098
Justin?

175
04:29:11,310 --> 04:29:13,062
Nothing.

176
04:29:14,430 --> 04:29:15,624
It's nothing?

177
04:29:17,510 --> 04:29:19,580
Well, then why don't you
just tell me?

178
04:29:22,910 --> 04:29:25,378
-Justin.
-" Motherfucking cocksucker."

179
04:29:29,670 --> 04:29:31,501
Why you acting like this?

180
04:29:32,350 --> 04:29:35,899
What's the point of us spending time
together if it can't lead to openness?

181
04:29:36,110 --> 04:29:37,748
I'm sorry.

182
04:29:41,270 --> 04:29:43,386
Maybe you should go.

183
04:29:46,390 --> 04:29:48,187
I'm sorry.

184
04:29:54,230 --> 04:29:57,700
-Should I call you?
-When you're ready to be open.

185
04:30:14,390 --> 04:30:16,984
You don't think it's okay for me
to be worried about this?

186
04:30:17,190 --> 04:30:20,023
We spent a fortune on the braces
to try and fix what he did.

187
04:30:20,470 --> 04:30:23,030
-He's 17.
-Yeah, but he's sucking his thumb.

188
04:30:23,230 --> 04:30:26,028
Let's see you fix it.
You seem to have all the answers.

189
04:30:26,230 --> 04:30:28,903
I think we need to get this thing
under control, that's all.

190
04:30:29,110 --> 04:30:30,987
Yeah, that's all.

191
04:31:54,750 --> 04:31:57,264
It's time we were honest
with each other.

192
04:31:58,430 --> 04:31:59,829
Yeah?

193
04:32:00,950 --> 04:32:03,589
I don't wanna fix your teeth
all over again.

194
04:32:04,110 --> 04:32:06,340
It's time to confront
the underlying issue.

195
04:32:07,430 --> 04:32:09,261
What do you mean?

196
04:32:10,110 --> 04:32:14,342
I know what your problem is.
It's an understandable habit.

197
04:32:14,550 --> 04:32:17,110
In fact, what's strange
is that people ever quit.

198
04:32:17,310 --> 04:32:19,699
It's nature's substitute
for your mother's breast.

199
04:32:21,590 --> 04:32:23,148
How were you fed as a baby?

200
04:32:23,750 --> 04:32:26,469
-From a bottle?
-I can't remember.

201
04:32:27,870 --> 04:32:31,579
Any tension at home? Anxiety?

202
04:32:32,310 --> 04:32:33,629
Any bad memories?

203
04:32:36,230 --> 04:32:37,458
-Justin.
-Justin.

204
04:32:38,070 --> 04:32:39,583
No conscious ones.

205
04:32:40,510 --> 04:32:43,024
We never remember
the big things anyway.

206
04:32:47,510 --> 04:32:50,070
Some babysitter holds your mouth
shut so she can watch...

207
04:32:50,270 --> 04:32:54,707
...her soap operas in peace. At 40, you
wonder why you can't stay married.

208
04:32:56,630 --> 04:32:59,622
There's only so much I can do
with traditional orthodontics.

209
04:32:59,830 --> 04:33:01,548
Justin.

210
04:33:01,750 --> 04:33:03,183
Justin.

211
04:33:03,870 --> 04:33:08,068
Are you ready to let go
of your thumb?

212
04:33:08,990 --> 04:33:12,983
-Why are you talking like that?
-Answer my question.

213
04:33:13,950 --> 04:33:17,579
-What are you gonna do?
-I wanna try hypnosis.

214
04:33:18,870 --> 04:33:22,499
-No way.
-Yeah. Really, I've seen it do wonders.

215
04:33:25,270 --> 04:33:27,147
You just try and relax.

216
04:33:30,030 --> 04:33:34,148
The more relaxed you are,
the deeper we can go.

217
04:33:35,070 --> 04:33:38,346
Focus on the moon
in the painting.

218
04:33:45,030 --> 04:33:47,544
A sense of peace...

219
04:33:48,030 --> 04:33:51,386
...like a white light
fills your body.

220
04:33:52,390 --> 04:33:56,463
Imagine the white light
filling your feet...

221
04:33:56,830 --> 04:33:58,946
...then your legs.

222
04:33:59,550 --> 04:34:01,541
Then your torso.

223
04:34:01,830 --> 04:34:05,505
Then your head.
Imagine you're on a path.

224
04:34:06,070 --> 04:34:08,504
You're deep in the forest.

225
04:34:08,710 --> 04:34:12,703
A shaft of light
illuminates a wild animal.

226
04:34:14,830 --> 04:34:16,821
This is your power animal.

227
04:34:17,350 --> 04:34:18,863
See it.

228
04:34:19,070 --> 04:34:20,788
Study it.

229
04:34:21,430 --> 04:34:24,228
When you feel like
sucking your thumb...

230
04:34:24,750 --> 04:34:27,310
...I want you to call on
your power animal.

231
04:34:27,510 --> 04:34:29,228
Call it now.

232
04:34:29,430 --> 04:34:31,148
Come here.

233
04:34:31,750 --> 04:34:33,502
Do it in your mind.

234
04:34:36,470 --> 04:34:40,907
<i>Whenever you feel afraid, alone...</i>

235
04:34:41,110 --> 04:34:42,941
<i>... call on your power animal.</i>

236
04:34:43,470 --> 04:34:46,985
You're not alone.
You're not afraid.

237
04:34:47,790 --> 04:34:49,985
You don't need your thumb.

238
04:34:50,190 --> 04:34:52,579
And your thumb doesn't need you.

239
04:34:56,310 --> 04:35:01,464
Justin, from now on, your thumb
will taste like echinacea.

240
04:35:05,750 --> 04:35:07,706
What's your power animal?

241
04:35:08,510 --> 04:35:10,182
That's personal.

242
04:35:36,230 --> 04:35:39,586
The mark of a secure nation is not
that conflicts are resolved quickly...

243
04:35:39,790 --> 04:35:42,350
...but that conflicts do not arise.

244
04:35:42,550 --> 04:35:45,110
Very nice, Ashley, thank you.

245
04:35:46,510 --> 04:35:48,068
Next is Justin...

246
04:35:48,270 --> 04:35:50,340
...with an introductory statement.

247
04:35:50,550 --> 04:35:52,825
The North American Free Trade
Agreement.

248
04:36:16,870 --> 04:36:19,828
All right, look over your notes.
I'll be right back.

249
04:36:22,510 --> 04:36:24,387
-Mr. Cobb.
-I have to go.

250
04:36:24,590 --> 04:36:26,626
-No, you have a speech to give.
-I can't stay.

251
04:36:26,830 --> 04:36:29,139
-Look, what's going on?
-Don't touch me.

252
04:36:51,990 --> 04:36:56,620
The Sierra Club website said
clear-cutting was up 15 percent.

253
04:36:56,830 --> 04:36:58,786
Justin.

254
04:36:59,150 --> 04:37:02,620
I think we should
write a letter together.

255
04:37:03,430 --> 04:37:05,864
What happened in Mr. Geary's class?

256
04:37:07,790 --> 04:37:09,781
I was just....

257
04:37:10,590 --> 04:37:12,581
I had to go.

258
04:37:13,950 --> 04:37:17,226
-Do you wanna write the letter?
-Why don't you just write one?

259
04:37:18,070 --> 04:37:20,743
Why are you all of a sudden
so interested in this anyways?

260
04:37:21,390 --> 04:37:23,540
Because it's important.

261
04:37:24,870 --> 04:37:28,021
Because people
should know this stuff, right?

262
04:37:28,230 --> 04:37:29,549
Yeah.

263
04:37:29,750 --> 04:37:34,062
So you're into getting the truth out,
being honest and open?

264
04:37:34,710 --> 04:37:36,189
Yeah.

265
04:37:36,550 --> 04:37:39,189
So why can't you tell me
what MFC means?

266
04:37:39,750 --> 04:37:42,184
Why can't you tell me
what happened in class?

267
04:37:43,030 --> 04:37:45,100
Because that's nothing.

268
04:37:50,590 --> 04:37:52,467
Nothing, right.

269
04:37:56,310 --> 04:37:58,187
Goodbye, Justin.

270
04:38:08,710 --> 04:38:09,938
Perry.

271
04:38:10,390 --> 04:38:12,824
<i>-It work ed.</i>
-That's wonderful.

272
04:38:13,230 --> 04:38:17,667
No, I didn't think it would be like this.
Can you put it back or something?

273
04:38:17,910 --> 04:38:20,822
Your subconscious
has taken its course.

274
04:38:21,110 --> 04:38:23,066
Please, I really feel crazy.

275
04:38:23,270 --> 04:38:24,749
<i>Stick with it, Justin.</i>

276
04:38:25,950 --> 04:38:28,145
Call on your power animal for help.

277
04:38:44,030 --> 04:38:47,306
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on, Justin?

278
04:38:48,230 --> 04:38:49,743
I don't know.

279
04:38:49,950 --> 04:38:52,100
It's okay. You're okay.

280
04:38:52,430 --> 04:38:54,227
I'll get this.

281
04:39:04,510 --> 04:39:07,070
This is gonna be stupid.
I thought you liked that guy.

282
04:39:07,270 --> 04:39:09,704
He just pretended
to be my friend, Joel.

283
04:39:09,910 --> 04:39:11,468
If you're scared, you can go home.

284
04:39:12,470 --> 04:39:14,062
All right.

285
04:39:14,270 --> 04:39:16,261
Joel.

286
04:39:19,270 --> 04:39:21,340
I'm sorry, okay?

287
04:39:21,950 --> 04:39:23,747
Perry fucked me up.

288
04:39:27,270 --> 04:39:28,783
How?

289
04:39:29,070 --> 04:39:30,298
He said he'd help me...

290
04:39:30,510 --> 04:39:33,343
...and then he just
fucked me up, okay?

291
04:39:35,310 --> 04:39:38,347
Joel. Just this once.

292
04:39:39,150 --> 04:39:40,663
Please.

293
04:39:42,110 --> 04:39:43,941
Goddamn it.

294
04:40:29,350 --> 04:40:33,502
Mr. and Mrs. Cobb, Justin's
always shown a lot of promise.

295
04:40:33,710 --> 04:40:38,147
But I feel that something comes
between him and his potential.

296
04:40:38,830 --> 04:40:40,229
And with college just ahead...

297
04:40:40,430 --> 04:40:43,502
-...Justin needs to maximise right now.
-Yes.

298
04:40:45,710 --> 04:40:49,385
-Well?
-Well, I feel that...

299
04:40:49,590 --> 04:40:53,822
...in light of recent behaviour,
that Justin needs an adjustment.

300
04:40:54,550 --> 04:40:57,428
Justin, have you ever suspected...

301
04:40:57,630 --> 04:41:00,747
...that you were different
from other teenagers?

302
04:41:01,230 --> 04:41:05,269
Not as patient,
can't finish what you've started.

303
04:41:05,470 --> 04:41:09,429
Terrified of being left alone,
but angry when you feel crowded.

304
04:41:09,630 --> 04:41:12,781
-A little.
-It's classic hyperactive teen.

305
04:41:12,990 --> 04:41:16,665
Attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder. ADHD.

306
04:41:16,870 --> 04:41:20,419
We'd like you to think about
a stimulant drug treatment for Justin.

307
04:41:20,630 --> 04:41:23,190
-You mean, like Ritalin?
-That's one of the many drugs...

308
04:41:23,390 --> 04:41:26,985
...that a doctor could prescribe.
There's Adderall, Clonidine, Tenex.

309
04:41:27,190 --> 04:41:30,546
If this is all just coming down
to medication--

310
04:41:30,750 --> 04:41:34,379
Look, I think that my son can
handle this if he puts his mind to it.

311
04:41:34,590 --> 04:41:37,980
Mr. Geary, don't you feel that Justin
could do much better?

312
04:41:39,150 --> 04:41:41,710
Justin has exhibited...

313
04:41:41,910 --> 04:41:45,346
...some of the behaviour
that fits this particular profile.

314
04:41:45,550 --> 04:41:50,783
Excuse me, these symptoms
they have here, they're pretty vague.

315
04:41:50,990 --> 04:41:54,266
" Ignores information.
Makes mistakes.

316
04:41:55,110 --> 04:41:58,261
Seems restless.
Avoids, dislikes or is reluctant...

317
04:41:58,470 --> 04:42:01,985
...to engage in work that requires
sustained mental effort."

318
04:42:07,470 --> 04:42:09,859
What'd you think, Justin?

319
04:42:12,990 --> 04:42:15,458
So my problems are
just because I'm hyper?

320
04:42:20,990 --> 04:42:24,585
It says I'll have more confidence
and self-control.

321
04:42:24,790 --> 04:42:29,227
-I'll have better relationships.
-Is that how you feel? Out of control?

322
04:42:29,430 --> 04:42:32,547
It just all sounds too easy to me.
You know, take a pill, change.

323
04:42:32,750 --> 04:42:34,183
What if Mrs. Wood is right?

324
04:42:34,390 --> 04:42:37,541
What if the trouble was, all along,
I just can't concentrate...

325
04:42:37,750 --> 04:42:40,264
...I can't focus on anything?

326
04:42:40,470 --> 04:42:42,779
It just still seems too easy.

327
04:42:43,310 --> 04:42:45,380
Haven't you ever wanted to change?

328
04:42:45,590 --> 04:42:49,742
-Yes, I have. But it's not that simple.
-Maybe it is.

329
04:44:50,310 --> 04:44:51,584
Amazing.

330
04:44:51,790 --> 04:44:53,462
Joel.

331
04:44:54,230 --> 04:44:56,186
What happened?

332
04:44:57,630 --> 04:44:59,302
I changed.

333
04:45:02,910 --> 04:45:07,267
-What do you mean, you've changed?
-I mean, it works.

334
04:45:07,470 --> 04:45:09,062
It really works.

335
04:45:09,430 --> 04:45:12,149
<i>-Your pills?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

336
04:45:12,670 --> 04:45:15,025
<i>I never thought that I
<i>would feel so clear.</i>

337
04:45:15,230 --> 04:45:18,905
-Who'd like to talk on whiteness?
-Whiteness stands for eternity.

338
04:45:19,230 --> 04:45:20,868
The blankness
of uninterrupted time.

339
04:45:21,070 --> 04:45:24,142
It represents both innocence
and extinction.

340
04:45:24,350 --> 04:45:25,829
The beginning and the end.

341
04:45:26,070 --> 04:45:28,265
How are you doing
with the medication?

342
04:45:28,510 --> 04:45:31,070
-I read <i>Moby Dick</i> straight through.
-That's great.

343
04:45:31,310 --> 04:45:33,904
-But how do you feel?
-I feel...

344
04:45:34,750 --> 04:45:37,822
...like me.
I never really did before.

345
04:45:39,190 --> 04:45:41,988
Have you had any other breakthroughs
besides the book?

346
04:45:42,230 --> 04:45:45,779
It used to be kind of a hassle
to put on underwear in the morning.

347
04:45:45,990 --> 04:45:47,867
But now it's kind of easy.

348
04:45:50,510 --> 04:45:53,229
I listened to the words
to the Pledge of Allegiance today...

349
04:45:53,430 --> 04:45:55,068
...and they gave me chills.

350
04:45:55,270 --> 04:45:59,866
I've always felt that you have a real
sensitivity when it comes to language.

351
04:46:00,070 --> 04:46:03,779
And I know that you're smart.
I think that you see a lot more...

352
04:46:03,990 --> 04:46:06,424
...than you take responsibility for.

353
04:46:06,670 --> 04:46:09,707
That kind of perception you have,
that can't be taught by anyone.

354
04:46:11,430 --> 04:46:13,182
Rebecca left the debate team.

355
04:46:13,390 --> 04:46:16,063
Did she say anything to you
about why or...?

356
04:46:16,590 --> 04:46:17,989
No.

357
04:46:18,190 --> 04:46:21,546
Well, I need somebody to step up
and take her place.

358
04:46:22,510 --> 04:46:24,865
I'd like for you to compete with us.

359
04:46:27,790 --> 04:46:29,508
You think I could do it?

360
04:46:30,670 --> 04:46:32,740
Yes, I do.

361
04:46:34,030 --> 04:46:38,148
-What happened to Mike?
-He tried his best. He couldn't make it.

362
04:46:38,910 --> 04:46:39,945
The door's up there.

363
04:46:40,150 --> 04:46:42,220
-I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

364
04:46:45,990 --> 04:46:47,503
Nervous?

365
04:46:48,150 --> 04:46:49,868
-Something.
-Completely understandable.

366
04:46:50,070 --> 04:46:52,903
This isn't a classroom situation.
And that's a whole other...

367
04:46:53,110 --> 04:46:55,260
...new thing for you to process.

368
04:46:56,270 --> 04:46:58,181
I wish I was bald.

369
04:46:58,390 --> 04:47:01,029
-Bitch.
-Your hair seems fine.

370
04:47:02,950 --> 04:47:05,384
-Okay, now you're making it worse.
-I'm sorry.

371
04:47:05,590 --> 04:47:08,104
-Did you see the girls?
-Yeah. I saw Rene in the hall.

372
04:47:08,310 --> 04:47:10,460
Okay, go round them up.
Bring them in here.

373
04:47:10,670 --> 04:47:12,183
-It's a men's room.
-That's okay.

374
04:47:12,390 --> 04:47:14,506
I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher.

375
04:47:16,630 --> 04:47:17,585
Nothing you can do.

376
04:47:17,790 --> 04:47:19,382
<i>Butterflies are understandable.</i>

377
04:47:19,630 --> 04:47:23,179
What I wanna do is go back to the
basics. Let's remember our posturing.

378
04:47:24,190 --> 04:47:25,942
Breathing.

379
04:47:26,430 --> 04:47:29,627
Rene, I really want you to use
your eye contact today.

380
04:47:29,830 --> 04:47:33,584
Let me emphasise your eyes. I got
some mascara. Lose the windows.

381
04:47:34,270 --> 04:47:36,989
Let's do some impromptus:
Maintenance.

382
04:47:37,230 --> 04:47:39,824
It is important in any system
to ensure that all pieces...

383
04:47:40,030 --> 04:47:44,103
...particularly the most important ones,
are working and properly maintained.

384
04:47:44,350 --> 04:47:46,625
Stop on a dime. Rebuttal.

385
04:47:46,830 --> 04:47:49,663
The Bill of Rights was intentionally
made by our forefathers...

386
04:47:49,870 --> 04:47:52,430
...to be useful for themselves
and posterity...

387
04:47:52,670 --> 04:47:55,104
-...as it says in the Declaration--
-You're a killer.

388
04:47:55,310 --> 04:47:57,346
You're a stone-faced killer.

389
04:47:57,550 --> 04:47:59,700
-What's not debatable?
-Our debating.

390
04:47:59,910 --> 04:48:01,980
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

391
04:48:02,190 --> 04:48:03,669
You guys are gonna do great.

392
04:48:14,590 --> 04:48:16,979
<i>Okay. Today's topic</i>
<i>for spar is the media...</i>

393
04:48:17,190 --> 04:48:19,181
<i>... with an emphasis on TV violence.</i>

394
04:48:19,710 --> 04:48:21,268
Elise Burns.

395
04:48:21,470 --> 04:48:25,509
It's just sick. TV violence kills morality,
particularly among teens.

396
04:48:25,710 --> 04:48:28,702
Studies prove it. Day after day,
kids watch shows with gunfights.

397
04:48:28,950 --> 04:48:31,066
And the next thing you know,
someone's dead.

398
04:48:31,310 --> 04:48:33,585
Television is a Trojan horse
in our homes.

399
04:48:33,790 --> 04:48:36,065
It claims to give us education
and entertainment...

400
04:48:36,310 --> 04:48:39,541
...but it really just takes the
imaginations of today's youth hostage.

401
04:48:39,790 --> 04:48:43,783
I agree. Media conglomerates say they
wanna change, but it's all double talk.

402
04:48:43,990 --> 04:48:46,663
I mean, accountability
needs to be enforced.

403
04:48:46,910 --> 04:48:48,582
I concur. But let's go further.

404
04:48:48,790 --> 04:48:51,099
TV contributes to the decay
of the American family.

405
04:48:51,310 --> 04:48:54,222
And once the family goes,
down goes our institutions...

406
04:48:54,430 --> 04:48:57,547
...and up goes our drug abuse.
Ditto, gambling and pornography.

407
04:48:57,750 --> 04:48:59,627
You have no evidence
to support that claim.

408
04:49:01,790 --> 04:49:03,542
Images aren't reality.

409
04:49:03,750 --> 04:49:06,867
Violence in art goes back to Egypt.

410
04:49:07,510 --> 04:49:09,978
What's important is teaching people
to be sceptical.

411
04:49:10,190 --> 04:49:14,980
To draw a line. To distinguish
between images and life.

412
04:49:16,670 --> 04:49:18,069
Lisa, what's your opinion?

413
04:49:18,590 --> 04:49:21,104
Well, you're right. TV's not real.

414
04:49:21,350 --> 04:49:24,308
Hold on. Reality is not the point here.
Social decline is.

415
04:49:24,550 --> 04:49:27,110
-Kate, reaction?
-Oh, no, go ahead.

416
04:49:27,310 --> 04:49:29,983
Mark, I understand the spirit
of your refutation.

417
04:49:30,230 --> 04:49:35,020
But society and its conception
of reality are inextricable.

418
04:49:38,110 --> 04:49:39,338
Well?

419
04:49:39,590 --> 04:49:41,262
-Did we live or die?
-You were right.

420
04:49:41,510 --> 04:49:43,501
-I was good.
-That's great, Justin.

421
04:49:43,710 --> 04:49:45,109
That's good to hear.

422
04:49:45,310 --> 04:49:46,902
You were....

423
04:49:47,110 --> 04:49:51,547
Yeah. I'd never seen you
look that way before. Yeah.

424
04:49:52,390 --> 04:49:54,028
You grew up.

425
04:49:59,270 --> 04:50:01,500
Passive acceptance of the impact
of genetic engineering...

426
04:50:01,710 --> 04:50:03,268
...is itself an act of aggression.

427
04:50:03,510 --> 04:50:06,388
But that's the problem.
Passive acceptance of the impact...

428
04:50:06,630 --> 04:50:09,827
...of genetic engineering
is itself an act of aggression.

429
04:50:11,510 --> 04:50:13,341
No, you should see him.

430
04:50:14,150 --> 04:50:15,947
And he wears this tie.

431
04:50:18,670 --> 04:50:21,264
It's important to be supportive.

432
04:50:22,630 --> 04:50:24,507
And seen.

433
04:50:27,470 --> 04:50:32,146
You know, it was almost easier
when he was always fucking up.

434
04:50:32,750 --> 04:50:34,263
Yeah.

435
04:50:39,470 --> 04:50:42,189
It's like he thinks
he's smarter than me.

436
04:50:46,670 --> 04:50:50,140
Well, maybe that's the way it goes.

437
04:50:57,910 --> 04:50:59,628
My worthy opponent.
My worthy opponent.

438
04:50:59,870 --> 04:51:01,542
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

439
04:51:01,790 --> 04:51:03,860
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

440
04:51:04,110 --> 04:51:06,544
Nations no longer exist independently
of one another.

441
04:51:06,750 --> 04:51:09,139
-And the name of this cell part?
-Mitochondria.

442
04:51:09,590 --> 04:51:12,343
The very existence
of weapons of mass destruction...

443
04:51:12,550 --> 04:51:15,110
...is in contradiction
to our idea of diplomacy.

444
04:51:15,950 --> 04:51:17,178
<i>Thank you for seeing</i> me.

445
04:51:17,430 --> 04:51:22,550
Well, I have a background in med surg,
but I've floated in orthopaedics.

446
04:51:22,790 --> 04:51:26,465
I've always had a great interest
in psych and rehab nursing.

447
04:51:26,670 --> 04:51:29,787
I think my RN skills
would be useful here.

448
04:51:29,990 --> 04:51:34,063
And I've taken continuing ed.
in psych and rehab.

449
04:51:34,670 --> 04:51:37,343
It's a thing that's
always interested me.

450
04:51:40,550 --> 04:51:43,064
You're angry, and that's human.
But it's not a solution.

451
04:51:43,270 --> 04:51:46,307
We have to overcome the idea
that everyone is the same.

452
04:51:49,110 --> 04:51:52,182
Andy Smalley said
your old girlfriend's a stoner now.

453
04:51:52,430 --> 04:51:53,943
Rebecca?

454
04:51:55,030 --> 04:51:56,463
She hates stoners.

455
04:52:16,910 --> 04:52:18,059
-Hi.
-Hello.

456
04:52:18,270 --> 04:52:19,498
-Last name is Geary.
-Okay.

457
04:52:19,710 --> 04:52:21,701
G as in Gerald, E-A-R-Y.

458
04:52:21,950 --> 04:52:24,145
-Here it is. Two rooms.
-Great.

459
04:52:24,350 --> 04:52:26,659
One for the boys
and one for the girls.

460
04:52:27,310 --> 04:52:29,778
Don't you think
we should do this by age?

461
04:52:29,990 --> 04:52:32,788
It's against school policy.
You can't have males with females.

462
04:52:32,990 --> 04:52:34,582
-Thank you.
-I'll say I sneaked in.

463
04:52:34,790 --> 04:52:36,985
-I'll take the blame.
-What's this about?

464
04:52:37,470 --> 04:52:39,540
I just wanna be with people
my own age.

465
04:52:39,870 --> 04:52:41,861
We can prepare better.

466
04:52:45,830 --> 04:52:47,866
Oh, my God.

467
04:52:51,990 --> 04:52:54,550
-I call my own bed.
-Which one of you is on the couch?

468
04:52:54,750 --> 04:52:55,739
-You.
-You.

469
04:52:55,950 --> 04:52:58,510
-Boys get the couch.
-Amen, sister.

470
04:52:58,750 --> 04:53:00,900
<i>And now our shocking</i>
Access Hollywood <i>exclusive:</i>

471
04:53:01,350 --> 04:53:04,581
<i>TV star Matt Schramm</i>
<i>check ed into drug rehab today.</i>

472
04:53:04,790 --> 04:53:08,942
<i>Schramm was suffering from</i>

473
04:53:09,190 --> 04:53:12,546
<i>On Friday, producers of his hit show,</i>
The <i>Line, staged an intervention...</i>

474
04:53:12,750 --> 04:53:15,105
<i>... with some of Matt's</i>
<i>closest family and friends.</i>

475
04:53:15,350 --> 04:53:17,545
<i>Schramm was receptive</i>
<i>to their pleas....</i>

476
04:53:17,750 --> 04:53:20,787
-Anybody want any peach schnapps?
-I only drink beer.

477
04:53:20,990 --> 04:53:23,345
-Yeah, me too.
-Come on.

478
04:53:23,550 --> 04:53:26,542
-Maybe we can order room service.
-We're minors.

479
04:53:28,190 --> 04:53:29,862
Why don't you ask Geary to get it.

480
04:53:30,110 --> 04:53:32,943
Yeah, Justin. He'll get it if you ask.

481
04:53:34,830 --> 04:53:37,708
<i>Are you putting me in a position</i>
<i>to buy alcohol for minors?</i>

482
04:53:37,910 --> 04:53:39,423
People do it all the time.

483
04:53:39,670 --> 04:53:42,867
Yes, I can understand
that you guys wanna unwind a little.

484
04:53:43,070 --> 04:53:44,344
You've worked hard...

485
04:53:44,550 --> 04:53:47,383
...and you'd like to enjoy yourselves.

486
04:53:47,630 --> 04:53:49,302
<i>But I am a teacher.</i>

487
04:53:49,550 --> 04:53:53,429
We think of you more as a peer.
A friend.

488
04:53:53,630 --> 04:53:57,862
<i>That's the line you're gonna use?</i>
<i>I hope your head's better tomorrow.</i>

489
04:53:58,070 --> 04:54:00,823
<i>Don't k eep me on.</i>
<i>You'll talk yourself out of a six-pack.</i>

490
04:54:03,110 --> 04:54:06,147
I thought about it.
I don't think it's a good idea.

491
04:54:06,350 --> 04:54:09,979
You should be doing your impromptus
and getting ready for the meet.

492
04:54:10,190 --> 04:54:11,669
What?

493
04:54:15,030 --> 04:54:16,827
-Here's your six-pack.
-That's messed up.

494
04:54:17,030 --> 04:54:19,703
One is gonna go a long way
with the pills you're on.

495
04:54:19,910 --> 04:54:23,903
-So go slow, okay? Have fun.
-I understand. Thank you.

496
04:54:26,670 --> 04:54:29,138
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

497
04:54:33,630 --> 04:54:35,302
Make room. Okay.

498
04:54:36,830 --> 04:54:38,229
It's all wet now. Take it off.

499
04:54:39,670 --> 04:54:40,739
Where did this go?

500
04:54:49,230 --> 04:54:50,583
Oh, my.

501
04:54:52,110 --> 04:54:54,180
Wait, I think that's your--

502
04:54:57,470 --> 04:54:59,301
Guys. Oh, guys.

503
04:55:00,390 --> 04:55:02,460
-Are you okay?
-Shit.

504
04:55:04,670 --> 04:55:06,422
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

505
04:55:06,630 --> 04:55:07,665
Oh, my God. Shit.

506
04:55:07,910 --> 04:55:10,470
Why am I getting a call
from the front desk?

507
04:55:10,670 --> 04:55:12,820
We were just having a normal time.

508
04:55:13,030 --> 04:55:14,907
Do you think I'm stupid?

509
04:55:15,910 --> 04:55:17,229
You're not stupid.

510
04:55:17,430 --> 04:55:20,422
You just feel left out,
and I can understand that.

511
04:55:20,630 --> 04:55:22,427
You see us having fun
and you feel alone.

512
04:55:22,630 --> 04:55:25,144
But that doesn't mean that we were
doing anything wrong.

513
04:55:26,110 --> 04:55:27,623
Look, Kevin.

514
04:55:27,830 --> 04:55:30,981
Your pro-disarmament views
do not reflect the international climate.

515
04:55:31,470 --> 04:55:34,189
They just reflect your need
for everything to be nice.

516
04:55:34,390 --> 04:55:35,618
To be friendly.

517
04:55:35,830 --> 04:55:38,708
-But humans are inherently hostile.
-You're missing my point.

518
04:55:38,950 --> 04:55:41,259
I don't think you know
what your point really is.

519
04:55:41,470 --> 04:55:44,030
If we're to take disarmament seriously,
I propose that...

520
04:55:44,630 --> 04:55:46,427
...we look at the real weapons.

521
04:55:46,630 --> 04:55:48,268
Our minds.

522
04:55:58,190 --> 04:55:59,418
How do you feel?

523
04:56:01,470 --> 04:56:04,064
Tired. But good.

524
04:56:04,630 --> 04:56:06,302
Why do you feel good?

525
04:56:06,790 --> 04:56:08,860
Because I'm winning.

526
04:56:09,110 --> 04:56:12,944
-What about learning?
-I'm learning how to win.

527
04:56:15,390 --> 04:56:17,506
You're so hungry, Justin.

528
04:56:18,310 --> 04:56:20,301
I never really took that into account.

529
04:56:25,910 --> 04:56:28,424
Here he goes, Mr. Lightning Dealer.

530
04:56:28,710 --> 04:56:30,382
-Hey.
-Hey.

531
04:56:30,630 --> 04:56:34,225
Yeah. Another Cobb success story
on our hands.

532
04:56:34,430 --> 04:56:36,421
Let me see that thing.

533
04:56:38,670 --> 04:56:40,979
-First.
-It's something, huh?

534
04:56:41,190 --> 04:56:42,908
That is something.

535
04:56:47,670 --> 04:56:50,582
How would you know?
You don't even show up.

536
04:56:52,190 --> 04:56:53,464
I work.

537
04:56:58,070 --> 04:57:00,061
Actually, I have some news.

538
04:57:00,430 --> 04:57:03,866
I'm being transferred
to the Maple Glen facility.

539
04:57:04,110 --> 04:57:05,668
-The celebrity rehab place.
-Yeah.

540
04:57:05,870 --> 04:57:08,259
I went today
for the introduction session.

541
04:57:08,710 --> 04:57:10,462
-This was in the works?
-Yeah.

542
04:57:10,670 --> 04:57:12,979
It's actually a pretty big promotion.

543
04:57:13,190 --> 04:57:15,021
So did you see any celebrities?

544
04:57:15,230 --> 04:57:17,664
-It's not just for celebrities.
-Right.

545
04:57:18,270 --> 04:57:21,068
-Well, you seem happy.
-Yeah.

546
04:57:21,270 --> 04:57:23,261
Yeah? That's great.

547
04:57:23,470 --> 04:57:27,145
So who'd you see? Matthew Perry?
Whitney Houston? Robert Downey Jr.?

548
04:57:27,350 --> 04:57:30,183
You know, I signed an agreement.
I'm can't leak names.

549
04:57:30,390 --> 04:57:34,986
-But you can tell us. We're your family.
-Well, I can't. I'm sorry.

550
04:57:35,230 --> 04:57:36,504
Come on.

551
04:57:36,710 --> 04:57:40,589
They're my patients, people with
problems. I'm there to help them.

552
04:57:42,070 --> 04:57:45,460
So now these celebrities
are more important than your family.

553
04:57:46,470 --> 04:57:48,461
Justin.

554
04:57:49,790 --> 04:57:52,429
I think working at Maple Glen
is a bad idea.

555
04:57:54,510 --> 04:57:56,978
Well, I don't think I asked you.

556
04:57:57,390 --> 04:57:58,869
I just won the regionals.

557
04:57:59,070 --> 04:58:02,028
I come home, you can't say
what celebrities you're working with?

558
04:58:02,270 --> 04:58:04,784
-Hey, easy.
-I'm done.

559
04:58:08,310 --> 04:58:10,824
-I'm out too.
-Where you going?

560
04:58:33,710 --> 04:58:37,828
I'm just afraid places like that
pamper to those big star egos.

561
04:58:39,510 --> 04:58:42,149
I mean, statistics show most addicts
don't recover anyway.

562
04:58:42,350 --> 04:58:43,942
What statistics?

563
04:58:44,950 --> 04:58:48,181
-I read it.
-Well, we're not having a debate.

564
04:58:48,390 --> 04:58:50,062
This is my life.

565
04:58:50,270 --> 04:58:52,022
You found something
to make you happy.

566
04:58:52,230 --> 04:58:53,868
Let me be happy.

567
04:58:54,870 --> 04:58:56,940
What happened
to that Health Valley contest?

568
04:58:57,150 --> 04:58:59,459
God, Justin. Nothing.

569
04:59:01,870 --> 04:59:03,667
You must have heard by now.

570
04:59:04,350 --> 04:59:06,022
You know,
it's none of your business.

571
04:59:06,230 --> 04:59:09,586
It was just a distraction.
It was something to do.

572
04:59:38,670 --> 04:59:40,422
My grades...

573
04:59:40,870 --> 04:59:43,668
...are below your standards.

574
04:59:44,390 --> 04:59:47,348
But I see this as....
As a strength.

575
04:59:47,950 --> 04:59:49,508
Not a weakness.

576
04:59:49,750 --> 04:59:52,025
I've had to overcome....

577
04:59:52,270 --> 04:59:54,067
Overcome. Overcome...

578
04:59:54,310 --> 04:59:55,743
...unusual obstacles.

579
04:59:58,990 --> 05:00:01,185
Both my parents....

580
05:00:03,270 --> 05:00:05,147
Both my parents...

581
05:00:07,510 --> 05:00:10,786
...suffer from mental illness.

582
05:00:13,710 --> 05:00:15,109
It's made my life difficult.

583
05:00:15,350 --> 05:00:17,022
Mental illness.

584
05:00:17,230 --> 05:00:21,189
This has made my life difficult.
But also...

585
05:00:21,390 --> 05:00:24,223
...given me a valuable perspective.

586
05:00:25,110 --> 05:00:27,226
I would like...

587
05:00:27,430 --> 05:00:31,742
...to apply this sensitivity
to a career in TV journalism.

588
05:00:32,950 --> 05:00:35,942
I wanna show the world
what's really happening...

589
05:00:36,150 --> 05:00:39,540
...the way I've had to with my family.

590
05:00:41,350 --> 05:00:43,784
I just can't deal with him right now.

591
05:00:43,990 --> 05:00:45,469
<i>Well, you two are arguing.</i>

592
05:00:45,670 --> 05:00:47,786
Oh, he can be such
a little shit sometimes.

593
05:00:47,990 --> 05:00:49,423
<i>Easy.</i>

594
05:00:50,150 --> 05:00:51,708
He doesn't need anybody to go.

595
05:00:51,950 --> 05:00:55,863
-Isn't it the state finals or something?
<i>-He'll be fine.</i>

596
05:00:57,510 --> 05:01:00,627
-Oh, I'll go.
<i>-No, you don't have to do that.</i>

597
05:01:02,350 --> 05:01:03,624
No, I wanna see him.

598
05:01:03,870 --> 05:01:08,102
-Really?
-God. Yeah, I'll go.

599
05:01:19,510 --> 05:01:21,899
That's $3.20. Thanks a lot.

600
05:01:25,550 --> 05:01:27,142
Perry.

601
05:01:29,190 --> 05:01:30,543
You look different.

602
05:01:31,110 --> 05:01:34,341
-Nice tie.
-Debate team.

603
05:01:34,590 --> 05:01:37,104
I've been meaning to call you.
I owe you an apology.

604
05:01:37,590 --> 05:01:41,139
I've been meaning to call you too.
I wanted to thank you.

605
05:01:41,870 --> 05:01:43,223
Really?

606
05:01:43,430 --> 05:01:47,139
I was lost in a cloud
of hippie psychobabble.

607
05:01:47,830 --> 05:01:50,298
You helped bring me
back down to earth.

608
05:01:51,590 --> 05:01:53,785
I've rewritten my whole philosophy
of life.

609
05:01:54,630 --> 05:01:57,667
Found new answers
to my questions.

610
05:01:58,950 --> 05:02:00,781
Yeah, me too.

611
05:02:01,870 --> 05:02:04,304
There's no try. There's only do.

612
05:02:05,630 --> 05:02:07,461
That's something that I've learned.

613
05:02:07,670 --> 05:02:08,739
What do you think?

614
05:02:12,950 --> 05:02:14,178
How's your dad?

615
05:02:15,510 --> 05:02:18,741
-He's fine. Same.
-Your mom?

616
05:02:19,710 --> 05:02:23,669
She's got a new job
working with drug addicts.

617
05:02:24,750 --> 05:02:26,103
And what about your thumb?

618
05:02:28,070 --> 05:02:29,981
Have you been sucking it?

619
05:02:37,630 --> 05:02:41,384
Actually, I was diagnosed
with attention deficit disorder.

620
05:02:41,590 --> 05:02:44,741
It's a real problem.
Now I'm on medication.

621
05:02:44,950 --> 05:02:46,941
I was just concerned.

622
05:02:47,950 --> 05:02:49,588
Well, I'm better.

623
05:02:50,030 --> 05:02:54,865
I'm leading the team
at the state debates tomorrow.

624
05:02:55,070 --> 05:02:56,947
Medication, huh?

625
05:02:57,390 --> 05:02:58,948
Yeah, I feel great.

626
05:02:59,270 --> 05:03:01,386
Euphoric, even?

627
05:03:04,550 --> 05:03:06,939
Aren't you just my orthodontist?

628
05:03:07,590 --> 05:03:09,945
I like to think of myself...

629
05:03:10,150 --> 05:03:11,947
...as more than that.

630
05:03:14,550 --> 05:03:16,506
Take care, Justin.

631
05:03:31,870 --> 05:03:35,146
-What are you doing?
-No wonder. This stuff's just speed.

632
05:03:35,350 --> 05:03:37,181
-It calms me down.
-That's what they say.

633
05:03:37,390 --> 05:03:40,143
But you focus. Three molecules
different than cocaine.

634
05:03:40,350 --> 05:03:41,578
A doctor gave it to me.

635
05:03:41,790 --> 05:03:44,862
I saw the special on PBS.
Teachers are overmedicating kids--

636
05:03:45,070 --> 05:03:48,107
TV is a great source
for our information, isn't it?

637
05:03:48,750 --> 05:03:50,627
Whatever, speed freak.

638
05:03:55,870 --> 05:03:58,020
<i>I think you're confusing tone</i>
<i>and content.</i>

639
05:03:58,270 --> 05:04:01,819
I mean, tone has tone,
but content is silent.

640
05:04:02,870 --> 05:04:04,542
Silent?

641
05:04:04,790 --> 05:04:08,385
It's not quite silent.
It's just that the tone is muted.

642
05:04:08,630 --> 05:04:11,144
A tone that you shouldn't hear
in the content.

643
05:04:11,390 --> 05:04:15,178
-You're missing the point.
-Look, if silence is neutral...

644
05:04:15,630 --> 05:04:17,825
...then the tone...

645
05:04:18,030 --> 05:04:19,668
...will be quieter.

646
05:04:19,870 --> 05:04:23,863
And the content
would be neutral but heard.

647
05:04:24,110 --> 05:04:25,668
What are you saying?

648
05:04:32,790 --> 05:04:34,143
Hey.

649
05:04:34,350 --> 05:04:36,386
-Finally got to see you.
-Don't patronise me.

650
05:04:36,590 --> 05:04:39,548
Come on, I'm just trying to say
something, you know?

651
05:04:39,750 --> 05:04:41,706
I think I'm gonna quit
the debate team.

652
05:04:41,910 --> 05:04:43,707
-You were doing well.
-Too much pressure.

653
05:04:43,910 --> 05:04:45,263
-It's no reason to quit.
-Mike.

654
05:04:45,470 --> 05:04:46,823
What?

655
05:04:48,150 --> 05:04:49,868
You're not helping.

656
05:04:51,990 --> 05:04:54,709
Well, you should....

657
05:04:55,430 --> 05:04:57,898
-What am I supposed to say?
-I don't know.

658
05:04:59,950 --> 05:05:02,748
All right, come on. Let's go home.
Come on.

659
05:05:04,150 --> 05:05:05,424
Come on.

660
05:05:07,870 --> 05:05:09,667
<i>Justin, it's...</i>

661
05:05:10,190 --> 05:05:13,785
...in my professional opinion
that you've become a monster.

662
05:05:14,750 --> 05:05:16,263
What?

663
05:05:17,430 --> 05:05:21,628
-You used to love me.
-Don't get grandiose with this.

664
05:05:21,830 --> 05:05:23,741
What was that all about my gift?

665
05:05:23,950 --> 05:05:25,622
And you told me--

666
05:05:25,830 --> 05:05:28,424
You built it up.
You told me I had a talent.

667
05:05:28,630 --> 05:05:30,666
Yeah, you do.
You have a real intensity.

668
05:05:30,910 --> 05:05:33,504
You have a great understanding
of group dynamics.

669
05:05:33,710 --> 05:05:36,702
But there's also a lot of things
that you need to work on, Justin.

670
05:05:36,910 --> 05:05:40,949
Like glibness,
arrogance, self-control.

671
05:05:41,550 --> 05:05:43,222
Shall I go on?

672
05:05:43,830 --> 05:05:45,263
At least I still have a dream.

673
05:05:46,830 --> 05:05:48,707
Well, that's great.

674
05:05:49,750 --> 05:05:51,741
Is that how you see me?

675
05:05:53,070 --> 05:05:55,504
That's what we've come to, Justin?

676
05:05:55,710 --> 05:05:58,383
I already decided.
I'm quitting the debate team.

677
05:06:02,910 --> 05:06:04,787
That's my fault.

678
05:06:09,030 --> 05:06:10,861
Thank you very much.

679
05:06:14,310 --> 05:06:15,948
Good luck to you.

680
05:07:36,870 --> 05:07:38,861
You look terrible.

681
05:07:39,350 --> 05:07:40,703
You okay?

682
05:07:42,510 --> 05:07:45,183
-I'm not sick.
-Let me see.

683
05:07:47,750 --> 05:07:49,866
I stopped taking my pills.

684
05:07:50,510 --> 05:07:52,546
They're just speed.

685
05:07:54,550 --> 05:07:58,020
They're just three molecules
different than cocaine.

686
05:08:00,510 --> 05:08:03,741
You know, it's not good for you
to quit cold turkey.

687
05:08:03,990 --> 05:08:05,503
But I can.

688
05:08:35,750 --> 05:08:37,183
What?

689
05:08:37,910 --> 05:08:39,866
I need to talk to you.

690
05:08:41,510 --> 05:08:43,148
Come in.

691
05:08:48,830 --> 05:08:50,229
What's up?

692
05:08:55,030 --> 05:08:58,022
How did you feel
when you had to quit football?

693
05:09:02,670 --> 05:09:04,342
Horrible.

694
05:09:04,990 --> 05:09:08,300
-How did you deal with it?
-You have to, you know, tough it out.

695
05:09:09,230 --> 05:09:10,982
You know, tough it out.

696
05:09:11,190 --> 05:09:12,862
-Mike.
-What?

697
05:09:14,390 --> 05:09:17,939
-I just thought you could help for once.
-Hey, I help.

698
05:09:18,150 --> 05:09:19,583
Then how did you do it?

699
05:09:22,630 --> 05:09:26,782
Why can't you ever tell me anything
about how you deal with things?

700
05:09:48,110 --> 05:09:52,388
-Hey, Justin.
-Hey. How's it going?

701
05:09:53,230 --> 05:09:56,666
-So I hear you're the debate star now.
-Not anymore.

702
05:09:57,470 --> 05:10:00,780
-You look the same.
-You don't.

703
05:10:01,270 --> 05:10:02,828
Not really.

704
05:10:03,550 --> 05:10:06,110
-I need to talk to you.
-Look, Justin, I'm sorry.

705
05:10:06,310 --> 05:10:08,540
-I just don't wanna--
-No, not that.

706
05:10:09,710 --> 05:10:11,541
Did you ever feel like...?

707
05:10:11,750 --> 05:10:14,503
Like you really wanted to...

708
05:10:15,150 --> 05:10:17,300
...I don't know, change?

709
05:10:20,110 --> 05:10:21,782
Maybe.

710
05:10:22,190 --> 05:10:24,260
Why are you telling this to me?

711
05:10:25,350 --> 05:10:28,899
Do you have any pot?
I heard you were doing it.

712
05:10:29,110 --> 05:10:30,748
Gossip.

713
05:10:31,190 --> 05:10:33,181
It's true, though, right?

714
05:10:34,430 --> 05:10:36,785
What, you want me to get you high?

715
05:10:37,430 --> 05:10:39,341
Yeah. Maybe.

716
05:10:40,870 --> 05:10:42,428
Really?

717
05:10:57,830 --> 05:10:59,900
-Hey.
-Hi.

718
05:11:00,150 --> 05:11:03,506
I finally found this.
I didn't know which house it was.

719
05:11:05,710 --> 05:11:07,985
Are you stoned right now?

720
05:11:09,510 --> 05:11:12,183
You don't make a big deal out of it.

721
05:11:13,350 --> 05:11:15,466
You still want some, right?

722
05:11:16,310 --> 05:11:17,982
Yeah.

723
05:11:18,590 --> 05:11:20,865
You're not still all weird, are you?

724
05:11:21,510 --> 05:11:23,262
I wasn't weird.

725
05:11:23,990 --> 05:11:25,309
Really?

726
05:11:26,910 --> 05:11:28,946
Suck.

727
05:11:29,750 --> 05:11:31,149
Suck.

728
05:11:37,750 --> 05:11:39,468
It gets easier.

729
05:11:44,550 --> 05:11:47,508
Did you just give that to him
for free?

730
05:11:49,830 --> 05:11:51,900
I would've made him pay.

731
05:11:56,230 --> 05:11:57,982
Do you want some?

732
05:11:58,950 --> 05:12:00,269
Yeah.

733
05:12:01,470 --> 05:12:03,506
Tell me the boys...

734
05:12:03,750 --> 05:12:05,820
...who have assne.

735
05:12:09,230 --> 05:12:11,300
-Have what?
-Assne.

736
05:12:11,510 --> 05:12:14,149
Ass acne.

737
05:12:14,350 --> 05:12:17,547
I'm sure that you've seen them
in your P.E. class.

738
05:12:23,310 --> 05:12:25,028
Billy Rydell.

739
05:12:29,350 --> 05:12:31,227
Mike Green.

740
05:12:32,350 --> 05:12:35,183
Rian Stevenson. Brent Bregman.

741
05:12:41,230 --> 05:12:42,629
Brent.

742
05:13:12,070 --> 05:13:16,586
" I will not compare my insides
to others' outsides."

743
05:13:29,470 --> 05:13:31,267
-What's that?
-Nothing.

744
05:13:31,470 --> 05:13:35,099
-No, it's something. What is it?
-It's nothing. Don't hassle me.

745
05:13:35,990 --> 05:13:38,345
You better get moving.
Audrey's working nights now--

746
05:13:38,550 --> 05:13:40,939
She's sleeping.
She doesn't even care.

747
05:13:46,590 --> 05:13:49,866
I don't know what
the two of you are thinking.

748
05:13:56,790 --> 05:13:58,667
What's your problem?

749
05:13:59,110 --> 05:14:01,749
-Nothing.
-Right.

750
05:14:05,470 --> 05:14:07,859
I think my mom's having an affair.

751
05:14:08,550 --> 05:14:10,142
Are you sure?

752
05:14:11,310 --> 05:14:12,982
Pretty sure.

753
05:14:27,950 --> 05:14:29,986
You could see it coming.

754
05:14:31,590 --> 05:14:33,421
Anybody could see it coming.

755
05:14:33,670 --> 05:14:35,626
Don't be so serious.

756
05:14:36,510 --> 05:14:38,182
Here.

757
05:14:38,430 --> 05:14:39,909
What?

758
05:14:42,950 --> 05:14:45,862
-We're gonna play a game.
-What kind of a game?

759
05:14:47,470 --> 05:14:48,983
You'll see.

760
05:14:49,750 --> 05:14:52,105
Well, actually, you won't.

761
05:15:20,910 --> 05:15:22,662
No, no, no.

762
05:15:22,870 --> 05:15:25,020
Just touch, don't look, okay?

763
05:15:25,790 --> 05:15:27,269
Why?

764
05:15:28,390 --> 05:15:31,382
Because those are the rules,
all right?

765
05:15:50,390 --> 05:15:52,187
How was work?

766
05:15:55,990 --> 05:15:57,742
How was work?

767
05:15:58,630 --> 05:16:00,905
It was really good, actually.

768
05:16:02,070 --> 05:16:03,708
It was really good.

769
05:16:04,470 --> 05:16:06,665
Doesn't it get depressing?

770
05:16:07,150 --> 05:16:10,699
Seeing all those people who have
everything just throw it all away?

771
05:16:10,910 --> 05:16:13,743
No. It's humbling.

772
05:16:14,750 --> 05:16:17,628
Last night, this guy said to me:

773
05:16:18,390 --> 05:16:20,221
" I was born...

774
05:16:20,430 --> 05:16:22,705
...addicted to fantasy."

775
05:16:30,470 --> 05:16:32,700
<i>Doing great, ma'am.</i>
<i>Push, okay? Push.</i>

776
05:16:32,910 --> 05:16:34,423
<i>We gotta ditch this wetback.</i>

777
05:16:34,630 --> 05:16:37,098
<i>Hey. There are no wetbacks out</i> here.
<i>Just people.</i>

778
05:16:41,830 --> 05:16:44,867
<i>-At least fire back.</i>
<i>-You know I don't use my gun.</i>

779
05:16:55,710 --> 05:16:58,429
-No.
-Just do it.

780
05:16:58,670 --> 05:17:00,945
Let me tell you something.

781
05:17:13,670 --> 05:17:15,820
Do you think Justin's had sex?

782
05:17:16,030 --> 05:17:18,749
That's just the image
I want in my head right now.

783
05:17:18,950 --> 05:17:22,465
Because we weren't much older
when we got married.

784
05:17:27,510 --> 05:17:29,785
How old do you feel?

785
05:17:37,550 --> 05:17:40,826
You have to tell me.
What's her pussy feel like?

786
05:17:41,030 --> 05:17:44,227
-That's gross, Joel.
-You're such a prude.

787
05:17:44,470 --> 05:17:48,179
-No. I care about her.
-I heard it's the softest thing ever.

788
05:17:51,590 --> 05:17:54,150
-I French-kissed a girl once.
-Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

789
05:17:57,470 --> 05:18:00,268
-That's not French-kissing a girl.
-Yeah? Then what is it?

790
05:18:00,510 --> 05:18:02,307
A guy and a girl take their tongues...

791
05:18:02,510 --> 05:18:04,740
...and they put them inside
each other's mouths...

792
05:18:04,950 --> 05:18:06,941
...and they move them around
just like this.

793
05:18:15,750 --> 05:18:17,547
This thing bugs me.

794
05:18:17,790 --> 05:18:19,382
Justin.

795
05:18:20,190 --> 05:18:22,146
No, seriously.

796
05:18:23,150 --> 05:18:24,868
Why can't I see you?

797
05:18:25,110 --> 05:18:27,863
Because I told you,
those are the rules.

798
05:18:29,430 --> 05:18:31,466
But why do you get to make up
all the rules?

799
05:18:32,710 --> 05:18:36,146
Why don't you tell other people
that we're in a relationship?

800
05:18:37,550 --> 05:18:39,745
We're not in a relationship, Justin.

801
05:18:41,110 --> 05:18:42,702
Why not?

802
05:18:52,150 --> 05:18:53,947
Rebecca...

803
05:18:55,390 --> 05:18:56,664
...I love you.

804
05:18:56,870 --> 05:18:59,464
God, you always have to make
everything so serious.

805
05:18:59,670 --> 05:19:02,901
This was just a teenage experiment,
that's all.

806
05:19:03,110 --> 05:19:05,021
An experiment?

807
05:19:06,870 --> 05:19:11,022
I needed to educate myself, Justin.

808
05:19:13,030 --> 05:19:14,622
So...

809
05:19:17,950 --> 05:19:21,738
...I decided to pick someone
like you.

810
05:19:22,470 --> 05:19:24,381
Like me?

811
05:19:27,110 --> 05:19:29,783
Someone I'd never get hurt by.

812
05:19:32,870 --> 05:19:36,260
That's just so fucked up.

813
05:19:40,110 --> 05:19:42,066
Yeah, I'm sorry.

814
05:19:43,790 --> 05:19:47,146
I'm really, really sorry.

815
05:19:48,750 --> 05:19:51,105
But maybe you should just go.

816
05:19:53,790 --> 05:19:55,746
Go, Justin.

817
05:20:30,350 --> 05:20:31,829
Hey.

818
05:20:32,390 --> 05:20:33,425
There you are.

819
05:20:33,630 --> 05:20:36,269
You're supposed to help me
clean the garage. Come on.

820
05:20:36,910 --> 05:20:38,468
Come here.

821
05:20:38,670 --> 05:20:40,467
You missed dinner.

822
05:20:48,270 --> 05:20:50,465
Why you acting so strange?

823
05:20:53,270 --> 05:20:55,830
She just pretends to like us.

824
05:20:57,110 --> 05:21:00,580
-What are you talking about?
-She just wants to have fun.

825
05:21:00,790 --> 05:21:05,227
-You wanna be so serious.
-Oh, I make everything so serious?

826
05:21:08,110 --> 05:21:09,668
She's not happy.

827
05:21:11,790 --> 05:21:13,508
You know, fuck--

828
05:21:13,710 --> 05:21:15,268
I know.

829
05:21:17,030 --> 05:21:19,988
-Then why don't you do something?
-What can I do?

830
05:21:21,110 --> 05:21:24,739
The whole fucking world
expected me to go pro.

831
05:21:26,270 --> 05:21:27,669
She doesn't care about that.

832
05:21:27,910 --> 05:21:31,744
Well, she'd never admit it,
but how could she have...?

833
05:21:32,350 --> 05:21:34,181
Not been disappointed.

834
05:21:34,390 --> 05:21:36,301
Everybody was.

835
05:21:37,430 --> 05:21:40,979
-You hurt your knee.
-Yeah, right.

836
05:21:42,670 --> 05:21:46,982
But what if it wasn't that bad, huh?
What if I could've kept on playing?

837
05:21:47,190 --> 05:21:49,863
What if your mother
was more important?

838
05:21:55,230 --> 05:21:57,141
Pizza in the kitchen.

839
05:21:57,350 --> 05:21:59,306
Go have your dinner.

840
05:22:04,190 --> 05:22:07,387
You know why she
got that job, right?

841
05:22:33,510 --> 05:22:34,989
What are you doing?

842
05:22:38,430 --> 05:22:40,944
I found a picture.

843
05:22:42,750 --> 05:22:44,820
A picture of that guy.

844
05:22:45,350 --> 05:22:47,386
Do you know about this?

845
05:22:54,710 --> 05:22:56,382
I'm sorry.

846
05:22:59,510 --> 05:23:05,904
You'd think she'd have better taste
than this Matt Schramm guy. Jesus.

847
05:23:10,790 --> 05:23:12,746
Dresses well.

848
05:23:15,190 --> 05:23:17,226
Well, you know...

849
05:23:19,030 --> 05:23:20,986
...it's all out there...

850
05:23:22,350 --> 05:23:24,500
...in picture land.

851
05:23:24,910 --> 05:23:28,107
You know, I can't reach that.

852
05:23:29,310 --> 05:23:31,221
I can't.

853
05:23:37,790 --> 05:23:41,669
The only way somebody like me
could ever get her attention...

854
05:23:41,870 --> 05:23:44,259
...was by being her kid.

855
05:25:21,470 --> 05:25:24,303
Stay away from the window, man.

856
05:25:26,150 --> 05:25:28,744
You're gonna get us busted
for curfew.

857
05:25:32,870 --> 05:25:35,668
Can't even smoke in peace
around here, huh?

858
05:25:36,390 --> 05:25:39,188
Hey, a guy can only kick
one thing at a time, right?

859
05:25:39,390 --> 05:25:40,948
Come on.

860
05:25:43,550 --> 05:25:44,983
So, what, you in juvie?

861
05:25:46,230 --> 05:25:47,788
Yeah.

862
05:25:48,150 --> 05:25:49,981
What's your poison?

863
05:25:51,070 --> 05:25:53,265
-Dope.
-What flavour?

864
05:25:53,470 --> 05:25:55,665
I don't know. Everything, I guess.

865
05:25:55,870 --> 05:25:59,658
Welcome to the fucking club.
Never met a drug I didn't like.

866
05:26:02,190 --> 05:26:03,703
Yeah, she's a tough one.

867
05:26:06,110 --> 05:26:09,227
In fact, I consider her
my guardian angel.

868
05:26:09,790 --> 05:26:11,621
Are you friends?

869
05:26:14,030 --> 05:26:15,702
It's deeper than that.

870
05:26:15,910 --> 05:26:19,107
A month or so ago, I fly in here.
I work in TV.

871
05:26:19,310 --> 05:26:21,141
My studio commits me.

872
05:26:21,350 --> 05:26:23,784
Maybe you've seen my show.
<i>The Line?</i>

873
05:26:25,110 --> 05:26:27,749
You know, sometimes
you gotta cross it.

874
05:26:27,950 --> 05:26:29,224
I don't know.

875
05:26:29,870 --> 05:26:34,022
Anyway. So, naturally,
I smuggle in a stash, right?

876
05:26:34,230 --> 05:26:36,061
Tucked up my ass.

877
05:26:36,270 --> 05:26:39,467
But it's too high up.
I can't get to it. So...

878
05:26:40,070 --> 05:26:42,061
...I take a spoon.

879
05:26:42,270 --> 05:26:44,340
Something goes wrong.
There's blood everywhere.

880
05:26:44,550 --> 05:26:45,505
That's a lot of blood.

881
05:26:45,710 --> 05:26:46,779
And there's Cobb there.

882
05:26:47,350 --> 05:26:48,783
<i>She runs into my room.</i>

883
05:26:48,990 --> 05:26:49,945
Okay.

884
05:26:50,150 --> 05:26:54,507
<i>Sticks her hand in there.</i>
<i>No Vaseline, just my blood.</i>

885
05:26:54,710 --> 05:26:56,189
There it is. There it is.

886
05:27:00,310 --> 05:27:02,983
-That's heavy, right?
-That's sick.

887
05:27:03,230 --> 05:27:04,868
Yeah.

888
05:27:08,910 --> 05:27:11,060
<i>She saved my life, though.</i>

889
05:27:11,750 --> 05:27:14,867
And that was the moment
I finally got real about myself.

890
05:27:15,870 --> 05:27:17,349
I'm Matt.

891
05:27:17,550 --> 05:27:19,506
And I'm an addict.

892
05:27:21,990 --> 05:27:24,584
The other night she said to me,
"We're all addicted--"

893
05:27:24,790 --> 05:27:27,429
--to something. Maybe an idea...

894
05:27:28,110 --> 05:27:31,546
...of ourselves or our lives.

895
05:27:31,750 --> 05:27:37,382
Maybe some idea of success
or failure.

896
05:27:37,590 --> 05:27:39,148
What, you're scared too?

897
05:27:40,190 --> 05:27:42,579
Being the mother of a 17-year-old
is a trip.

898
05:27:42,790 --> 05:27:44,985
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

899
05:27:45,910 --> 05:27:49,664
You're supposed to have all the
answers, and you don't have one.

900
05:27:51,750 --> 05:27:56,744
Even the idea that once you have a
family, you'll never be lonely again.

901
05:27:57,790 --> 05:27:59,348
Heavy, huh?

902
05:28:01,750 --> 05:28:04,423
We don't like to admit it...

903
05:28:05,110 --> 05:28:07,021
...but we're all just...

904
05:28:07,950 --> 05:28:10,180
...scared little animals.

905
05:28:16,190 --> 05:28:18,021
Hey, it was good to share.

906
05:28:24,070 --> 05:28:26,948
-You okay?
-Yeah.

907
05:28:30,470 --> 05:28:31,505
That's patchouli.

908
05:28:33,670 --> 05:28:35,103
Cool.

909
05:28:35,550 --> 05:28:38,189
So I'll leave you here.

910
05:28:38,670 --> 05:28:40,308
-You okay?
-Yeah.

911
05:28:41,950 --> 05:28:43,906
You sure? You okay?

912
05:28:44,110 --> 05:28:45,623
Yeah.

913
05:29:16,430 --> 05:29:18,068
What?

914
05:29:19,150 --> 05:29:20,788
Nothing.

915
05:29:21,470 --> 05:29:23,142
Ass.

916
05:29:23,430 --> 05:29:25,227
Be quiet.

917
05:29:30,630 --> 05:29:31,824
Joel.

918
05:29:33,790 --> 05:29:35,269
Yeah?

919
05:29:37,910 --> 05:29:42,062
I always kind of thought
Audrey was gonna leave Mike.

920
05:29:43,110 --> 05:29:45,180
They couldn't be apart.

921
05:29:47,110 --> 05:29:48,987
But is that love?

922
05:29:49,430 --> 05:29:51,148
I don't know.

923
05:29:51,630 --> 05:29:55,225
Well, don't you ever think about this
stuff? Doesn't it ever freak you out?

924
05:29:55,430 --> 05:29:57,705
Everything freaks you out.

925
05:29:59,110 --> 05:30:01,146
You don't even care.

926
05:30:01,590 --> 05:30:03,820
You have it so easy, Joel.

927
05:30:04,870 --> 05:30:08,704
-I hate it when you say shit like that.
-Like what?

928
05:30:08,950 --> 05:30:10,781
Like you're the only one
with problems.

929
05:30:10,990 --> 05:30:13,265
You ever think
maybe you're so busy being weird...

930
05:30:13,470 --> 05:30:15,426
...that I have to step up
and be normal?

931
05:30:16,310 --> 05:30:18,107
Everyone's worried about you.

932
05:30:18,310 --> 05:30:21,427
All the bullshit
you get yourself into.

933
05:30:22,830 --> 05:30:25,583
Why didn't you ever
just say anything?

934
05:30:32,070 --> 05:30:33,822
I'm sorry.

935
05:30:45,110 --> 05:30:46,429
<i>Justin.</i>

936
05:30:46,630 --> 05:30:49,622
-Yeah?
-Can you come here a minute?

937
05:31:03,270 --> 05:31:05,261
-Oh, no way.
-What?

938
05:31:07,030 --> 05:31:08,861
I got in.

939
05:31:09,310 --> 05:31:10,868
You applied?

940
05:31:17,270 --> 05:31:18,942
Yeah.

941
05:31:23,830 --> 05:31:26,424
Well, you didn't tell us
about this, huh?

942
05:31:27,750 --> 05:31:30,025
I thought you'd talk me out of it.

943
05:31:31,110 --> 05:31:33,783
Oh, honey, I wouldn't have
talked you out of it. I just....

944
05:31:34,030 --> 05:31:36,783
I thought your grades....

945
05:31:42,150 --> 05:31:43,868
I'm happy.

946
05:31:48,550 --> 05:31:50,108
Are you?

947
05:31:50,310 --> 05:31:53,507
Am I happy? You kidding?

948
05:32:00,550 --> 05:32:03,667
Well, what does it mean?

949
05:32:03,870 --> 05:32:06,065
It means I wanna go.

950
05:32:08,710 --> 05:32:10,143
Just like that?

951
05:32:10,350 --> 05:32:12,784
They want me to go
to their summer-school thing.

952
05:32:12,990 --> 05:32:18,428
They want me to make up some math
and language credits this summer.

953
05:32:30,790 --> 05:32:34,499
I was just getting used to you.

954
05:32:47,710 --> 05:32:50,144
I gotta go deal with this shipment.

955
05:33:24,910 --> 05:33:27,583
You know I'm happy for you.

956
05:33:29,390 --> 05:33:32,905
I am. It's just....

957
05:33:34,710 --> 05:33:36,462
I don't know.

958
05:33:39,910 --> 05:33:43,220
If it was Belgium...

959
05:33:43,870 --> 05:33:46,748
...or Chile...

960
05:33:46,950 --> 05:33:48,906
...or Mars.

961
05:33:49,990 --> 05:33:53,062
Somewhere I couldn't picture you.

962
05:33:53,270 --> 05:33:55,625
You'd just vanish.

963
05:33:56,950 --> 05:33:59,145
But New York...

964
05:33:59,670 --> 05:34:01,820
...I can see you.

965
05:34:03,590 --> 05:34:07,185
Justin in Central Park
by the fountain.

966
05:34:08,830 --> 05:34:11,583
Justin in a taxi on Fifth Avenue.

967
05:34:12,230 --> 05:34:15,700
Justin at Times Square.

968
05:34:15,910 --> 05:34:20,301
Justin eating a fucking hot dog
from a street vendor.

969
05:34:22,790 --> 05:34:24,906
You can always come to visit me.

970
05:34:27,150 --> 05:34:28,822
Yeah.

971
05:34:30,510 --> 05:34:32,068
Yeah.

972
05:34:33,430 --> 05:34:35,660
You're already gone.

973
05:34:36,750 --> 05:34:40,060
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

974
05:34:48,430 --> 05:34:50,819
I know you, Justin.

975
05:34:52,870 --> 05:34:56,146
I've been watching you
your whole life.

976
05:34:58,350 --> 05:34:59,544
You have?

977
05:35:28,070 --> 05:35:29,628
Justin.

978
05:35:29,830 --> 05:35:31,627
Perry.

979
05:35:32,270 --> 05:35:33,988
You found me.

980
05:35:34,390 --> 05:35:36,506
Yeah, in the phone book.

981
05:35:36,870 --> 05:35:39,748
To what do I deserve this honour?

982
05:35:40,110 --> 05:35:41,589
I'm leaving.

983
05:35:41,790 --> 05:35:45,066
-New York.
-Big city.

984
05:35:49,310 --> 05:35:52,461
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

985
05:35:53,030 --> 05:35:56,181
This place,
it looks a little depressing.

986
05:35:56,750 --> 05:35:58,706
I don't know, I....

987
05:35:59,350 --> 05:36:02,228
I guess I stopped trying
to be anything.

988
05:36:02,430 --> 05:36:06,343
I accepted myself
and all my human disorder.

989
05:36:10,830 --> 05:36:13,060
You might wanna do the same.

990
05:36:15,310 --> 05:36:20,589
Remember when you were
like 13 or something, you were....

991
05:36:20,950 --> 05:36:24,226
You were always doing an impression
of a newsman.

992
05:36:24,430 --> 05:36:26,261
I did?

993
05:36:26,870 --> 05:36:28,781
You were quite good.

994
05:36:29,630 --> 05:36:32,064
-Sorry.
-No.

995
05:36:32,270 --> 05:36:34,386
If that's what you wanna do...

996
05:36:34,790 --> 05:36:37,543
...New York is the perfect place
for you.

997
05:36:38,550 --> 05:36:41,542
Make the contacts, knock on doors.

998
05:36:43,950 --> 05:36:46,418
Get the right haircut,
take voice lessons.

999
05:36:46,790 --> 05:36:48,621
Might work.

1000
05:36:49,470 --> 05:36:50,983
But then again...

1001
05:36:52,230 --> 05:36:54,698
...you'll have to deal
with a lot of fear.

1002
05:36:55,790 --> 05:36:57,860
I just came here for a check-up.

1003
05:36:59,390 --> 05:37:00,903
Really?

1004
05:37:05,430 --> 05:37:08,149
Justin, I'm sorry if I contributed
to feelings of shame...

1005
05:37:08,350 --> 05:37:10,625
...you may have had
about your thumb.

1006
05:37:11,950 --> 05:37:14,145
I've been reading up on it.

1007
05:37:14,430 --> 05:37:18,059
Medically, psychologically...

1008
05:37:18,270 --> 05:37:21,580
...there's nothing really
wrong with thumbsucking.

1009
05:37:21,830 --> 05:37:24,742
-I don't think I can agree with that.
-No, really.

1010
05:37:24,950 --> 05:37:27,828
Look, Justin...

1011
05:37:28,030 --> 05:37:30,419
...there was nothing wrong with you.

1012
05:37:31,230 --> 05:37:33,824
It felt like everything
was wrong with me.

1013
05:37:35,830 --> 05:37:38,264
That's because we all
want to be problemless.

1014
05:37:38,670 --> 05:37:42,458
To fix ourselves. We look for some
magic solution to make us all better.

1015
05:37:42,670 --> 05:37:45,548
But none of us really know
what we're doing.

1016
05:37:46,030 --> 05:37:48,498
And why is that so bad?

1017
05:37:48,990 --> 05:37:51,379
That's all we humans can do.

1018
05:37:52,030 --> 05:37:53,224
Guess.

1019
05:37:53,430 --> 05:37:54,943
Try.

1020
05:37:55,150 --> 05:37:56,981
Hope.

1021
05:38:00,070 --> 05:38:02,345
Justin, I just pray
you don't fool yourself...

1022
05:38:02,550 --> 05:38:05,018
...into thinking
you've got the answer.

1023
05:38:07,550 --> 05:38:09,700
Because that's bullshit.

1024
05:38:11,150 --> 05:38:13,106
The trick...

1025
05:38:13,590 --> 05:38:16,058
...is living without an answer.

1026
05:38:19,870 --> 05:38:21,701
I think.

1027
05:38:28,390 --> 05:38:29,664
I think.

1028
05:39:18,470 --> 05:39:23,021
There is new evidence indicating
that the North Koreans have....

1029
05:40:13,710 --> 05:40:15,541
Hi.

1030
05:40:16,910 --> 05:40:18,628
Hi.

1031
05:40:19,990 --> 05:40:21,423
I'm Justin.

1032
05:40:21,830 --> 05:40:23,263
Hi.
