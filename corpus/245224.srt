- Hey!
-Go on.

366
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:15,430
Ill metbymoonlight,
proud Titania.

367
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,665
What,jealous Oberon!

368
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,070
Fairies, skip hence.

369
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:21,837
I have forsworn
his bed and company.

370
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,877
Tarry!

371
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,105
Rashwanton,

372
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,943
am not I thylord?

373
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:31,111
Then I mustbe thylady.

374
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,819
Why artthou here,

375
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,921
come from
the fartheststeppe ofIndia,

376
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:47,458
butthat, forsooth,
the bouncing Amazon,

377
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:51,370
yourbuskin'd mistress
and yourwarriorlove,

378
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,772
to Theseus mustbe wedded,

379
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:55,605
and you come to give theirbed

380
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:57,304
joy and prosperity.

381
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,280
How canstthouthus
forshame,Titania,

382
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,282
glance atmy credit
with Hippolyta,

383
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,318
knowing I know
thylove to Theseus?

384
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,718
These are the forgeries
ofjealousy.

385
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,519
And never, since
the middle summer's spring,

386
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:13,755
metwe on hill,
in dale, forest, ormead,

387
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,093
by paved fountain
orbyrushybrook,

388
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,064
butwith thybrawls

389
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,567
thou hastdisturbed oursport.

390
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,071
Therefore,the winds,
piping to us in vain,

391
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,367
as in revenge,

392
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,001
have sucked up from the sea
contagious fogs,

393
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:31,272
which, falling in the land,

394
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:34,509
hath everypelting river
made so proud

395
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,019
thattheyhave overborne
theircontinents.

396
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,520
And this same progeny
of evils comes

397
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:42,454
from ourdebate,

398
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,424
from ourdissension.

399
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,985
We are theirparents
and original.

400
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,553
Do you amend itthen?

401
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,092
Itlies in you.

402
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,297
Whyshould Titania
cross herOberon?

403
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:59,101
I do butbeg
a little changeling boy

404
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,607
to be myhenchman.

405
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,700
Setyourheartatrest.

406
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:07,305
The fairyland buys
notthe child ofme.

407
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:10,977
His motherwas
a votaress ofmy order,

408
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,486
and in the spiced Indian air,

409
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:18,424
bynight, full often
hath she gossiped bymyside

410
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:21,985
and satwith me
on Neptune'syellowsands,

411
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:26,261
marking the embarked traders
on the flood

412
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:30,327
when we have laughed
to see the sails conceive

413
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:33,863
and growbig-bellied
with the wanton wind.

414
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:40,238
Butshe, being mortal,
ofthatboy did die,

415
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:44,308
and forhersake
do I rearup herboy.

416
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,048
And forhersake

417
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:49,090
I will notpartwith him.

418
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:52,149
Howlong within thiswood
intend you stay?

419
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,128
Perchance till after
Theseus'wedding day.

420
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:02,334
Ifyouwill patiently
dance in ourround...

421
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,373
and see ourmoonlightrevels,

422
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,668
go with us.

423
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,039
Give me thatboy,
and I will go with thee.

424
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,906
Not forthy fairykingdom!

425
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,781
Fairies, away!

426
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:21,447
We shall chide downright
ifI longerstay.

427
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:26,889
Well, go thyway.

428
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:29,362
Thou shaltnot from this grove

429
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,865
till I tormentthee
forthis injury.

430
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,902
My gentle Puck, come hither.

431
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,074
Thou rememberest,

432
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,613
since once I sat
upon a promontory

433
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:49,206
and heard a mermaid
on a dolphin's back

434
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,845
uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath

435
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:56,288
thatthe rude sea
grew civil athersong.

436
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,320
Thatverytime, I saw,
butthou couldstnot,

437
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,798
flying between the cold
moon and the Earth,

438
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,700
Cupid all armed.

439
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,102
Acertain aim he took

440
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,572
and loosed his love shaftsmartly

441
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,269
from his bow.

442
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:19,040
Yet, marked I where
the boltofCupid fell.

443
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,049
It fell upon
a little western flower,

444
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:23,584
before milk-white,

445
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,677
nowpurple with love'swound.

446
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,415
Fetch me that flower.

447
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,584
The juice ofit,
on sleeping eyelids laid,

448
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,493
will make all man, all woman
madly dote

449
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,554
upon the next live creature
thatitsees.

450
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,200
Fetch me this herb

451
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,702
and be thou here again

452
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,932
ere the leviathan
can swim a league.

453
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,701
I'll puta girdle
round aboutthe Earth

454
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,208
in 40 minutes.

455
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,950
Having once this juice,

456
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,427
I'll watch Titania
when she's asleep

457
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:12,023
and drop the liquorofit
in hereyes.

458
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:18,234
The next thing then
she waking looks upon...

459
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:23,039
she shall pursue it
with the soul oflove.

460
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:27,571
And ere I take this charm
from offhersight,

461
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,118
I'll make herrenderup
herpage to me.

462
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:30,584
I'll make herrenderup
herpage to me.

463
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:33,849
Demetrius: I love thee not,
therefore pursue me not!

464
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,358
Where is Lysanderand fair Hermia?

465

Do I entice you?

474
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:14,218
Do I speak you fair?

475
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:17,264
Orrather, do I not

I will fawn on you.

Use me butasyourspaniel.

impeachyourmodesty

492
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,637
too much

493
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,368
to leave the city

494
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,807

To trustthe opportunity

503
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:30,166

512
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,720
Apollo flies,
and Daphne holds the chase.

513
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,850
The dove pursues the griffin.

514
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,757

but I shall do thee
mischiefin the wood!

518
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,166
Aye, in the temple,
in the town, in the field,

519
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,864
you do me mischief--oh!

520
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:07,305
Fie, Demetrius!

521
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:11,812
Yourwrongs do set
a scandal on mysex!

522
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,938
Oh!

523
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:17,007
We cannot fight forlove
as men may do.

524
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:23,122
We should be wooed

525
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:25,682
and were notmade to woo.

526
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:34,198
I'll followthee

527
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,430
and make a heaven ofhell

528
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:40,406
to die upon the hand
I love so well.

529
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:47,872
Fare thee well, nymph.

530
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,514
Ere he shall leave this grove,

531
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,519
thou shalt flyhim,

532
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,282
and he shall seek thylove.

533
00:36:58,293 --> 00:36:59,988
Hastthouthe flowerthere?

534
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,759
Ahh...

535
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:19,270
I know a bank where
the wild thyme blows,

536
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:23,613
where oxlips and
the nodding violet grows,

537
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:28,816
quite overcanopied
with the lusciouswoodbine,

538
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,053
with sweetmusk-roses
and with eglantine.

539
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:37,262
There sleeps Titania
sometime ofthe night.

540
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:41,564
Lulled in these flowers
with dances and delight.

541
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:46,164
And there the snake
throws herenameled skin,

542
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,108
