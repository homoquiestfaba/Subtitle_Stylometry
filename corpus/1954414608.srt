So, thank you for the tea.

<i>It was very good.</i>

182
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,157
How long have
you been renting
the room downstairs?

183
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,526
Uh, not long.

184
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,763
I mean, we just did it
'cause we needed help
with the rent.

185
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,765
Three months, maybe.
<i>Yeah.</i>

186
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:52,036
And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?

187
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,973
No, not really, no.

188
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,809
Did he, um,

189
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,278
did he have any visitors?

190
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:09,387
Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.

191
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,789
No.
He watched
a lot of television.

192
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,459
<i>Yeah, that's true.
Very loud.</i>

193
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,629
Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?

194
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,504
When you, um,

195
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,507
when you discovered
the body, did you...

196
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,676
did you find anything else?

197
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,482
Um...
no.

198
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,852
The reason I ask
is because the initial
police report

199
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,521
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,

200
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,923
and the team downstairs
are just looking
for evidence

201
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,092
that he may
have kept drugs there.

202
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,729
No, we had... I mean,
we had no idea.

203
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,735
Well, it's just, uh...
it's just routine.

323
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,827
We use cash where we can,

324
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,629
and we get Mike
to write an invoice.

325
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,832
You want to bring Mike
into this?

326
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,035
No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him
into it.

327
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:42,105
But when I do
a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,

328

and then writes an invoice.

329
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,610

That's enough.

522
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,214
Get up.

523
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,749
Up!

524
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,966
This is what Tommy has.

Tom's lying.

534
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,874
He's afraid that

you're going to kill us.

535

557
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,382
Do we need to get a lawyer?

558
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,484
A lawyer won't change that.

559
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:25,221
Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn
all of it in.

560
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,191
No, I didn't think so.

561
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:33,129
And Jack Witkowski
isn't the kind of guy
to forgive and forget.

562
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,365
He'd find a way to get
to you before we could even
bring you to trial.

563
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,568
I've tried to arrest him
for two years.

564
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,705
He's got ties to the police.

565
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,708
Someone who turns
a blind eye to what
he does.

566
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,710
There are some people
in Scotland yard that think

that Jack is doing us a service.

568
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,282
He kills his fair share
of bad people.

569
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,552
They believe
that one in the hand
is worth five in the street.

570
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,255

can... Control him.

That's his specialty.

579
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,756
There is a way out of it.

580
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:40,029
What?
You help me,
I'll help you.

581
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:46,068
When Jack
comes after you,
we set a trap.

582
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,205
How?
You say he took
your phone.

583
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,740
Yeah.
When he calls,

584
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:54,777
you agree to take
the money to him.

585
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,980
You want to use us as bait?

586
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,648
No.

587
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,351
All right, wait...
no.

588
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:07,156
Just... if we-if we do it,
that means we walk.
<i>This doesn't go in the books.</i>

589
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,725
If I took this
to headquarters,
Jack would get wind of it,

590
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,261
I'd be out of a job,
you two would be dead.

591

Before.

597
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:08,184
Why didn't you
just show him where
the money was?

598
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,686
Why didn't you
tell me somebody
broke into our house.

599
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,323
I just wanted us
to have a little money
so we wouldn't get evicted,

600
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,525
so we could have...
<i>[Pounding on wall]</i>

So we could have a life.

602
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:37,279
I went to the fertility clinic,
