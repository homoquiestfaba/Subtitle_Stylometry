1
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,007
Baby,
give me some chewing gum.

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,325
I don't have any.

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,898
You're gonna deny me some chewing gum?
Give me some.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,769
- You went through my purse.
- What?

5
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,204
- You went through my purse.
- When?

6
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,607
I hate it when you go through my things.

7
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,644
If you have nothing to hide,
that shouldn't worry you.

8
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,079
I'm not hiding anything.

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,716
But I've told you a thousand times,
stop invading my privacy.

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,019
I didn't go through your things!
When I asked you for gum...

11
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,890
I did it thinking that perhaps
you had bought some at the store.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,122
And why would I buy gum when
you know I don't like gum!

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,032
You don't, but I do.
You could've bought some for me.

14
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,093
Enough, all right?
Just let me read my newspaper in peace!

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,574
If you don't like gum...

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,737
then what's that pack of gum
doing in your purse?

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,481
Let that be the last time you
go through my things!

18
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,883
Fine, I went through your things,
but you lied about the gum.

19
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,120
You have no right to go through my things!
You hear me? No right!

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,558
I recognize that I made a mistake.
Now you recognize that you lied about the gum.

21
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,195
I don't have to recognize anything.
Don't go through my things!

22
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:40,100
If you have nothing to hide, it shouldn't
concern you if I go through your things.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,370
I have a right to privacy!
I don't have to tell you everything!

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,406
Why didn't you tell me about the gum?

25
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:51,070
If I feel like having a thousand packs
of gum in my purse, that's my problem!

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,347
And I don't wanna talk about this anymore!
I'm done arguing!

27
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:58,943
I just want to read the newspaper!
Why do you always have to upset me so?

28
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:03,223
I don't mean to upset you.
You're free to do whatever you want.

29
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,360
You can have all the gum you want in your
purse. That's not the point.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,196
The point is, you were hiding it from me!

31
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,801
The point is, I don't want to talk about
this anymore! You drive me insane!

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,462
Stop annoying me!

33
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,218
I just lost 50 cents in a
newspaper I never got to read!

34
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,888
- It's all your fault!
- 50 cents.

35
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,490
- You can read tomorrow's paper.
- I'm tired of listening to you.

36
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,425
- I'll buy you three.
- You're so unfair!

37
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,795
You're the one that's unfair.
All I want to know...

38
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,855
- You're pissing me off!
- Why can't you come clean?

39
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:57,944
Please come back, baby.
Why are you always doing this to me?

40
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,241
Come here.

41
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,883
Get that. It could be an emergency.

42
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,784
The woman's already dead. What else could
happen to her?

43
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,392
Ismael, please.

44
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,131
No one there. How does this work?

45
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,303
See who called, Ismaelito.

46
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,917
- Grandma's house.
- I told you.

47
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,078
Stop busting my balls. We're on our way.

48
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,547
- Want me to call them?
- Yes, please.

49
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,332
- Hello. Who's this?
- Tati. Who's this?

50
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,357
Tati, it's me, Ismaelito.

51
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,839
Give me that. Give me that. Hello, Tati?

52
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,535
- Lourdes?
- Oh, Tati!

53
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,370
I can't believe grandma's gone!

54
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,541
And Mom? Oh, Lord. She must be a wreck.

55
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,684
And I'm not there with her.

56
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,622
Yes, baby, we're on our way there.

57
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,086
So hard. This hit us so hard.

58
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,466
Ismaelito hasn't stopped crying. You know
how he loved his grandma.

59
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,088
He's gotta come with us!
He's gotta come with us!

60
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,576
I'm pregnant!

61
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,348
We're on our way.

62
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,513
Well, hurry up. Your mom's been asking
about you.

63
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,089
Big kiss.

64
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,070
Mercedes! Why did you leave us, Mercedes!

65
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,063
Christ Almighty, please
accept her in your bosom.

66
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,740
Good morning.

67
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,311
Good morning, ma'am.

68
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,316
Good morning. The gentleman cannot stand
there.

69
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,524
- I love you.
- What?

70
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,324
I love you.

71
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,329
Thanks. But really, you can't stand there.
You have to sit down.

72
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,896
You want me to sit down?

73
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,500
Sit down? I tell you that I love
you and you tell me to sit down?

74
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,037
Passengers cannot cross that line.

75
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,305
And you're crossing it.

76
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,339
Why do you talk to me as if you
didn't know me?

77
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,085
- Because I don't know you, sir.
- Of course you do.

78
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:31,045
I don't have time for your little games.
So sit down or get down.

79
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,614
I love you.

80
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,287
So what?

81
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,764
So I'm not leaving until we agree.

82
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,356
Agree to what?

83
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,165
I want to marry you.

84
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,102
And I'm not leaving until you say yes.

85
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,781
Then I'm gonna have to call the cops.

86
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,519
You can't do that! I'm telling you that
I love you and you're gonna call the cops?

87
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,889
- What's going on, man?
- None of your business.

88
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,379
Thank you, sir. Please sit down.

89
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,719
- This is between us.
- What is?

90
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,693
- What we talked about.
- What did we talk about?

91
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,025
- That you're gonna marry me.
- This guy's nuts.

92
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,503
I don't know him.
He's nuts. Get off my bus!

93
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,371
- I asked the Virgin.
- The Virgin?

94
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,862
Who are you to come and ruin my day?
Get off my bus!

95
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,112
- I love you.
- And I don't care, sir!

96
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,149
Buy yourself a dog.
I don't even know you! Get out!

97
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,685
Aren't you listening?
She doesn't love you.

98
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,674
Shut up!

99
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,881
Now you've done it.
Why don't you try that with me?

100
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,093
- Don't. You don't know me.
- You don't know me, either.

101
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,295
If you're gonna fight, take it outside.

102
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,865
- Can't you see he's reckless?
- Just get off the bus!

103
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,633
Violence is not the answer.

104
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,835
Don't make me kick you all off the bus.

105
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,806
- Tell him to get off!
- Yeah, get off the damn bus.

106
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,707
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Sit down or I'll sit you down.

107
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,745
Calm down. I'll take care of this.
Calm down.

108
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:03,849
- Leave.
- No.

109
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,316
Get out. Get out. Get out!

110
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,655
- Easy. Calm down.
- Don't touch me!

111
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,535
What are you looking at?
Sit down right now!

112
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,338
I dare you to cross that line again.
I dare you.

113
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,531
Cirilo looks good.

114
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,310
- You're really something else.
- I didn't come here to argue.

115
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,947
I just love it when someone comes
here and tells me what to do.

116
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,984
- Mi father's homeless.
- And what do you want me to do about it?

117
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,652
Well, this house also belongs to him.

118
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,918
Sorry. Do you know where
my suppositories are?

119
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,887
Cirilo, remember that last night
you used the last one?

120
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,457
True.

121
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,070
This house stopped
being your father's over 30 years ago.

122
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,038
The same day he decided to leave us.

123
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,109
What will Cirilo say if I bring an
old man to live with us?

124
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:42,915
Mi father is not an old man. He's the
father of your children and he's sick.

125
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,718
Doesn't it make you sad that he's
sleeping in the street?

126
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,889
If it makes you so sad, then why
don't you take him to live with you?

127
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,450
That's insane. You know our
house is barely big enough for us.

128
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,528
Look, Mom, if I'm here it's because
there's no other way out.

129
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,290
Flora. Excuse me.

130
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,337
I can't find my high
blood pressure pills.

131
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:10,297
They're in the bedroom, Cirilo, in the
nightstand drawer.

132
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,578
Your father was always very selfish.

133
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,821
And what's happening to him is
what he deserves!

134
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,948
Mom, you're no one to judge him.

135
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,727
When Dad left, you went out
with several men.

136
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,389
- So?
- So that's not right.

137
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,601
Look, sweetie, this is my pussy...

138
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,660
and I'll do with it what I want.

139
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,608
Do you know where the enema is?

140
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,278
Why the hell do you want all that stuff?
What are you making, a rocket?

141
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,714
It's just that I don't feel well.

142
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,979
I don't know. Maybe it's hanging
in the bathroom.

143
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,594
Think about it. It's time to forget
about the past.

144
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,290
Mi dad's all alone.

145
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,432
And he's dying.

146
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,043
And you haven't stopped to think...

147
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,535
that we're all on the way out!

148
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,719
What are you doing?

149
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,668
Had I known you were coming here,
I would've told you to leave me at Grandma's!

150
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,104
I won't take long.
I have to go to the bathroom.

151
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,307
And you can't wait five minutes
to get to her house?

152
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,174
You know I don't like shitting in
someone else's bathroom.

153
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,680
For once in your life, can't you stop
thinking only of yourself?

154
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,916
- I'm shitting my pants!
- Then hold it!

155
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,349
Then start walking!

156
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,284
- Please hurry.
- I'll be right back.

157
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,795
- What are you doing?
- Getting out.

158
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,864
- No.
- Mom, please...

159
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,832
- No.
- To stretch my legs!

160
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:18,098
I said no, Ismaelito. I have enough
problems with your dad.

161
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,316
- Be right back.
- Hurry up, please.

162
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,820
- Ismael!
- Macho!

163
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,925
Hey! What's going on?

164
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,267
How are things?

165
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,075
What's going on? Someone die?

166
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,772
That brother of yours is so thoughtless.

167
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,185
You heard?

168
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,082
They just called me.

169
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,225
No, my sister-in-law, don't.
Don't get like that. Don't worry.

170
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,131
Those things happen.

171
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,703
No, no, no.

172
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,639
I'll be honest with you.
Because I might be ugly, but I'm honest.

173
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,510
You shouldn't be crying
over such nonsense.

174
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,914
What do you mean "nonsense"?

175
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,550
Because it's nonsense.

176
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,987
I tell you, I knew it
would end up like this.

177
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,455
Problem here is that...

178
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,993
...that brother of mine was sold
a pig in a poke.

179
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,886
What?

180
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,602
You shouldn't be suffering
because of that woman.

181
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,799
If you stop an think about it,
Tati is a real bitch.

182
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,874
I'm coming!

183
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,407
- What?
- Mom, can I...

184
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,878
Ismaelito, shut up.

185
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,318
What are you saying?

186
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,220
That you shouldn't be suffering.
Let it go.

187
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,057
I'm coming!

188
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,193
- Mom...
- Ismaelito!

189
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,329
Wait, Macho, what are you trying to say?

190
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,831
I told Ismael...

191
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:30,791
not to get involved with that woman
because sooner or later you'd find out.

192
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,963
- Goddamnit.
- Give me that.

193
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:47,247
You blow that fucking horn again
and I'll beat the crap out of you!

194
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:54,283
Are you telling me that my husband
is having an affair with my cousin?

195
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,461
No.

196
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,123
- Since when have you known?
- No, I didn't...

197
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,360
Since when have you known?

198
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,604
Since they started going out, about six
months ago.

199
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,574
- Six months?
- Or eight months, I don't know.

200
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,276
- Eight months!
- What does it matter?

201
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,179
What's important here is that you
don't let this affect you.

202
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,875
That woman is nothing but a cheap whore.

203
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,149
Tatti es nothing but a tramp!
That's what she is!

204
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,119
A piece of shit is what she is.

205
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,694
- Get out!
- I want to stay in the car!

206
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,093
Get out!

207
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,431
Get out!

208
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,960
Do what your mother says! Goddamnit.

209
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,343
She's shameless.

210
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,109
She's shameless.

211
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,709
What are you doing? Put that gun away.

212
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,507
If you don't marry me, I'll shoot
myself right now.

213
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,571
Are you fucking blind

214
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,217
Fuck! He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

215
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,453
Put that away before you hurt somebody.

216
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,956
- Say yes or I shoot myself.
- You don't know what you're saying.

217
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,760
Yeah, buddy. Think it over.
We can work it out.

218
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,898
You're very young. Put that away.
Life is too precious.

219
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,866
Without love, life is worthless.

220
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,569
Please, buddy, put that away.
Put it away.

221
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,739
- You don't understand.
- Of course we understand!

222
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,075
We understand. But certain
things can't be forced.

223
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,203
Marry me, girl. Marry me.

224
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,706
Calm down. Calm down.

225
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,489
We're gonna get these people off the bus.
They have nothing to do with this.

226
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,492
Then you and I will talk.
I'm gonna open the door.

227
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,896
Sounds good. You open the door, we get out,
you guys take care of your business.

228
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,056
Shut up!

229
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,830
No one gets out of here!

230
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:54,439
Put that down before you shoot someone!
The devil doesn't miss!

231
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,465
Shut up! Next one to open his
mouth gets shot!

232
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,919
Turn it off.

233
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,135
Could you please turn
your cell phones off?

234
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,447
That horn is so annoying.

235
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,414
Who do you think it is?

236
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,022
Mom!

237
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,586
Of course.

238
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,766
Mom!

239
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,203
Mom!

240
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,693
Dad looks good, doesn't he?

241
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,853
Sure does.

242
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,490
Well, I gotta go now, but...

243
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,594
you guys catch up, okay? Bless you.

244
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,738
And I thought I'd never see you again.

245
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,114
That's life for you.

246
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,854
Wait. Let me call Cirilo and...

247
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,879
No, that won't be necessary.

248
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,855
There.

249
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,229
- What was that?
- What?

250
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,461
- Why the wheelchair?
- Oh, that.

251
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,227
Your daughter wants me to look
older than I really am.

252
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,272
Unbelievable.

253
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,509
So how have you been, Florita?

254
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,669
Just great. I can't complain.

255
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,641
It's good to see you, Florita.

256
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,765
Tell you the truth,
this soup is delicious!

257
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,666
Thank you. It's Cirilo's recipe.

258
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,007
But it needs a little salt.

259
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,347
- You don't like it?
- No, I do.

260
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,984
- You said it was bland.
- I said it's delicious.

261
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,219
It just needs a pinch of salt.

262
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,517
You said it was bland.

263
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,390
Wait here.

264
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,695
I'll go get the salt.

265
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,506
How many years has it been?
Thirty? Forty?

266
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,202
- Thirty-five, to be exact.
- Unbelievable.

267
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,275
How time flies.

268
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,853
Say when.

269
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,447
No, but it's... That's good. No!

270
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,950
Sorry. I put a little too much.

271
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,154
Look what you've done!

272
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,456
Sorry.

273
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,862
That's all right. I wasn't hungry.

274
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,770
I don't want any more.

275
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:01,304
My goodness. Look how late it is.

276
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,477
- Time to go to sleep.
- Cirilo.

277
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,641
Pellín is staying with us tonight.

278
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,021
I hope that's not a problem.

279
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,063
Looks like he didn't like the idea.

280
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,657
Cirilo's like that.
He'll get over it in a second.

281
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,003
Maybe tomorrow.

282
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,714
Here. This makes your problems go away.

283
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,715
Drink it slowly.
Beers don't taste so good in the beginning...

284
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,411
but later... you love them.

285
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,122
- Like girls?
- No, girls are just the opposite.

286
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,691
In the beginning,
you love them to death...

287
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,320
but later... who can stand them!

288
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,023
Mom.

289
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,768
I'm so happy you're here, baby

290
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:08,432
This is horrible.
I can't believe she's dead.

291
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,209
And she was so happy!

292
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,313
And when I went to see her this morning,
she was really stiff.

293
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,182
- Where's Tati?
- Poor thing.

294
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:22,187
Last night she ate some corn flakes and
asked about you. She was fine!

295
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,723
- But where's Tati?
- That poor girl.

296
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,128
She really loved your grandma. She's been
running around all day.

297
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,831
The one that doesn't care is Cuchi.

298
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,500
She called saying she couldn't
afford the bus fare.

299
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,236
She's not coming to her
own mother's funeral.

300
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,005
- Where's Tati?
- How should I know?

301
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:45,910
Last night I dreamt that Sandra got married,
and then your grandma dies!

302
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,780
- That was a premonition.
- You want some cheese?

303
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,482
No, thank you, baby. Margarita,
have you seen Tati?

304
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,985
- She's in Grandma's room.
- I'll be right back.

305
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,782
Yeah, go see her.

306
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:01,159
...in earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.

307
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,430
Forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us.

308
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,399
And lead us not into temptation.

309
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,935
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

310
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,371
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

311
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,109
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners...

312
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,010
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

313
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:31,189
Lourdes. Lourdes.

314
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,178
Lourdes!

315
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,588
She came to!

316
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,529
Where am I? What happened?

317
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,699
- Baby, you scared us!
- Are you all right?

318
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,235
I'm fine. What happened?

319
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,966
You fainted is what happened.
You're paler than a ghost.

320
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,600
- This has been so rough on me.
- On everyone. You need to rest.

321
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,038
Yes. Leave me alone for a
few minutes, please.

322
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,512
I'll go get you a glass of water.

323
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,986
Tati, baby, please close the door
and stay with me a moment, please.

324
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,439
Baby, wake up. It's seven o'clock.

325
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,539
I know you can hear me, son. Get up.

326
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,016
Last night you left the dog outside.

327
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,954
And I've told you that when the dog's in heat,
she has to sleep inside.

328
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,590
This morning, when I woke up,
I found her stuck to this mutt...

329
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,995
and I had to hit him away with a
stick until he finally let go of her!

330
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,598
I want to wash your sheets and towels.

331
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,836
Doña Tita is coming and I want to
wash them before she gets here.

332
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:56,432
That woman won't stop talking and when
she comes here, I can't do anything!

333
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:36,748
Attention, people inside the bus!
Attention! This is the police!

334
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,516
Now we're screwed.

335
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,552
Nobody move! We have you surrounded!

336
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,054
Crap.

337
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,057
I repeat, we have you surrounded!

338
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,321
All I want is to get married.

339
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,225
Back. Everybody back, come on.

340
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,144
We need to talk to you!

341
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,076
Please...

342
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,671
do not harm the passengers!

343
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,953
Look what you've done. It's a mess.
You're gonna have to surrender.

344
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,989
No. Either we get married or
I shoot myself right now.

345
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,929
You wanna shoot yourself?
Then do it and stop bugging me!

346
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,863
How could you say that?

347
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,493
You think I'm not capable of doing it?

348
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,968
I wouldn't marry you if I was dead.

349
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,638
We'll see about that.

350
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,004
We're gonna do this, one way or another.

351
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,218
Back off! Now!

352
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:52,223
Calm down. Don't do anything stupid.

353
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,359
We want to help you, but you
have to calm down.

354
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,428
Back off or I shoot!

355
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,063
Easy. Easy.

356
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,466
You don't know what I'm capable of!

357
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:06,471
Easy. No need to get violent.
Calm down. Calm down.

358
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,674
Why are you doing this? What's going on?

359
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,844
- We want to get married.
- I don't want to marry him!

360
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:17,281
And if I don't get what I want,
I don't mind dying!

361
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,513
No one's gonna die here.
What is it you want?

362
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,324
A priest. We need a priest to marry us!

363
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,292
- A priest.
- A priest?

364
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,895
Bring me a priest or everyone dies!

365
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,565
No, no, that's fine.
A priest. Don't worry...

366
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,558
Don't you leave me here with him!
Help me! This guy's crazy!

367
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,180
- Why did you bite me?
- You beast!

368
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,383
Relax, man. You're a little tense

369
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,045
Do you see this mess?
It's all your fault!

370
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,157
You make me look like the bad guy!
I'm not a bad guy!

371
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:04,117
I fell in love with you since the first time
I saw you! I don't understand why...

372
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,404
My bad. It was an accident.

373
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,151
Where did that woman go?

374
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:44,402
- To the funeral.
- And she couldn't wait a minute?

375
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:48,105
- Dad, if I told you...
- What have you done now?

376
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,198
Me? It was you.

377
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,745
For starters, what the hell are
you doing drinking beer?

378
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,305
Let him have a beer. He's an adult.

379
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,513
Your mother couldn't wait?

380
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,451
Your wife left all pissed off because
she found out about Tati.

381
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,692
Come here.

382
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,831
What did you tell her about Tati and me?

383
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:22,832
Nothing.

384
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:31,045
I'm going to ask you one more time.
What did you tell her about Tati and me?

385
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,318
Boy, you better patch things up.
You have a huge mess in your hands.

386
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,650
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

387
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,159
Is that your honey?

388
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,862
You moron! You moron!

389
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,064
Who told you to stick
your nose in my things?

390
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:51,435
Why did you hit me? What the
fuck is going on here? Hold this.

391
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:56,168
I hit you because I can!
Now you're gonna get it!

392
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,836
Who told you to stick
your nose in my things!

393
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,405
Come on!

394
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,791
Let go!

395
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,452
What's going on in there? Open this door
right now!

396
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,759
Don't run, honey.

397
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,903
Come here. Come here. Come here.

398
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,337
Come here! Come here!

399
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,168
- Enough!
- Stop it! Stop it!

400
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,477
- Here! Here!
- Here! Here! Here!

401
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:44,789
Give me that! Open this door right now!

402
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,393
Look at me! How dare you do this to me?

403
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,659
You've fucked up my life!
You've fucked up my life!

404
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,959
How dare you do this to me!

405
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,611
You tramp! You fucked up my life!

406
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,241
You fight like a...! You fight like a...!

407
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,589
Double chickenshit. Double chickenshit!

408
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,024
Damn.

409
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,430
You broke my chain, asshole!

410
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,443
The asshole broke my chain!

411
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,983
I was going to pick that up.

412
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,492
- Don't worry.
- And Pellín?

413
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,153
Outside, taking a shower.

414
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,298
I can't believe it, Flora.
Can't you see we have guests?

415
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,394
You could've worn something
a little more... decent.

416
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,207
But, Cirilo, take a look. This robe is
down to my ankles.

417
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:16,347
When women are 70, walking around in
their robes is like... wearing panties.

418
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,884
Cirilo, please, don't exaggerate.

419
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,181
Good Lord!

420
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,302
That's my towel.

421
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:45,976
- Florita gave it to me.
- Her name is Flora.

422
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,945
I've been calling her Florita for years.

423
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,175
You haven't called her anything in years.

424
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,275
- Wait!
- What?

425
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,420
You're not planning on getting
dressed before going into the house?

426
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,978
Can't you see I'm dressed?

427
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,527
Look. This is my house!

428
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,530
And you're going to respect me, you hear?

429
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,534
I bought this house some 40 years ago.

430
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,337
Well, okay. But the furniture's all mine.

431
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:17,975
- I bought that.
- Maybe the furniture, but not the house.

432
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,876
- Cirilo!
- Coming!

433
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,876
I'll be watching you.

434
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,445
Watching me? What you should
do is repair that roof.

435
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:35,252
Every time it rains, you get more wet
with the rain than with the shower.

436
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,318
You hear?

437
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,766
Almost ready.

438
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,778
At least for tonight, you're
going to sleep like a king.

439
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,522
Florita, I mean, having
to sleep in this room.

440
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,625
Don't you have a bedroom to spare?

441
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,794
No. Both bedrooms are taken.

442
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,631
One's mine and the other one's Cirilo's.

443
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,234
Good Lord. You guys don't sleep together?

444
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,328
No. We're no longer married.

445
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,673
- No?
- No, we're divorced.

446
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,709
Then why does Cirilo...

447
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,485
live with you here, in this house?

448
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:40,185
Because he needs a little time to
find another house to live in.

449
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,388
A little time. When did you two divorce?

450
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,588
About... 12 years ago.

451
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,163
A little time...

452
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,369
Look, to be really comfortable here...

453
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,142
you have to tuck the sheets like this.

454
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,805
There we go. Just like this.

455
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,458
- You're mistaken.
- But, Flora, I thought...

456
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,584
What?

457
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:20,024
That, after all these years, I was
going to spread my legs for you?

458
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:25,199
And stop looking like an idiot,
or I'll really get mad.

459
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,434
I'm sorry, Florita.

460
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,208
Flori, haven't you stopped to think...

461
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,278
...that we're all on the way out?

462
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,177
Yes. Go to sleep.

463
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,111
Basically, the bus skidded and I stopped
because I thought the driver was nuts.

464
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,914
And when I respectfully went to
ask the driver what was going on...

465
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:14,251
I see this crazy-looking guy
with a gun this big.

466
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,617
I was the first one here.

467
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,174
You, come here. Yeah, you.

468
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,452
Turn around.

469
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,206
You. Come here.

470
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,100
Come here! Come here!

471
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:18,849
Yes?

472
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,451
Is that priest coming?

473
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,454
Yeah, he's on his way.
It's all been arranged.

474
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,685
My patience's running out.
You think this is some kind of game?

475
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:32,691
Look, I'm trying to help you out here,
but you have to take it easy. Calm down.

476
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,209
Let's do this.
You release the passengers...

477
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,643
You take me for a fool?

478
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:51,081
If I let them go, I'm fucked. Besides,
I need witnesses for the ceremony.

479
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,814
Captain, we have a clear shot. They're
requesting authorization to proceed.

480
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,755
Request denied.

481
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,524
Do something or something
tragic will happen!

482
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:05,295
- We can get him.
- I said, request denied.

483
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,931
What the fuck is wrong with you? Enough!

484
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:12,129
You think this is an action movie? Do
something or everyone ends up dead!

485
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,744
And now?

486
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,283
We wait.

487
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,501
What happened?

488
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,073
You're kidding me. But what did she say?

489
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:03,153
No, no, no. She's insane.
What's going on?

490
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,451
Baby! Baby, come here.

491
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,651
Come here. Look...

492
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,495
Everyone's spreading
lies about me and Tati.

493
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,725
You know that none of that is true,
right, baby?

494
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,862
You know that Tati and I haven't done
anything, right?

495
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,181
Who you gonna believe, her or me?

496
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,113
Ismaelito!

497
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,247
That woman's insane.

498
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,929
A big fight broke out between Tati
and your mom at Grandma's house.

499
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:49,166
This one hit that one, that
one hit this one. A real mess.

500
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,656
They want to see your dad.

501
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,169
Now.

502
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,773
Ismaelito, what's wrong?
Are you listening?

503
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,839
Ismaelito!

504
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,455
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

505
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,141
What is it? Are you all right?

506
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,870
Better than ever.

507
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,437
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Like what?

508
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:42,844
- Wearing those pants.
- You don't like them?

509
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,189
- You look like a teenager.
- Thank you.

510
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,352
- And Pellín?
- Outside, taking a shower.

511
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,956
What's the deal with the shower?

512
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,398
If he keeps on showering like this,
he's gonna wear out.

513
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,894
If he wears out, that's his problem.

514
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,890
Estéban!

515
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,095
- What happened?
- Nothing!

516
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,667
Pellín! What's going on?
What's happening, Pellín?

517
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,040
What's going on?

518
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,087
Careful. Careful. Wait.

519
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,213
Right there. Right there.

520
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,914
- Does it hurt?
- No, it stings!

521
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,766
I tell you, that rooster was very unfriendly.
Look what he's done to you.

522
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,428
That damned rooster.

523
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,705
I think that's his way
of showing me his love.

524
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,299
Because there are many ways of
showing one's love.

525
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,332
Even with scratches.

526
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,479
That's what you think?

527
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,382
You know what I think, Florita?

528
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,685
I wish we could turn back the clock...

529
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,416
to that time when you and I had an
almost perfect relationship.

530
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,218
Who says anything about
turning back the clock?

531
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,426
With all the life we have ahead of us!

532
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,433
That's true.

533
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,569
You touch me again and I'll
shove the iodine down your throat!

534
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,934
No, but I'm just...

535
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,541
That damn rooster has disappeared.

536
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,645
Did you check the neighbor's house?
He likes to jump the fence.

537
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,409
Not this time.
I even searched the hillside. Nothing.

538
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,346
- Well...
- Hey, you.

539
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:30,420
What did you do to my rooster?
He's disappeared.

540
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,023
He's the one who attacked me.
That's the truth.

541
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:37,060
He better show up. Otherwise,
it'll be your fault!

542
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,190
- He'll show up, Cirilo.
- No. No, he won't.

543
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,767
I'm sick and tired of all of this.

544
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,635
I don't like having this
guy here all the time!

545
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,173
Don't you realize he has nowhere to go?

546
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,977
Forgive me, Flora, but what
the fuck do I care?

547
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,278
Wait a second...

548
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,747
Kick him out!
He has no place in my house!

549
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,251
I'm not gonna take this. I'm leaving.
You heard him.

550
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,754
- I don't want to be a bother.
- But you're no bother!

551
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:08,425
Of course he's a bother! He bothers me!

552
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:12,623
Look, I'm leaving. So don't worry
about me anymore.

553
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:18,090
Don't worry about me, Florita. I'll find
somewhere to go.

554
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,460
See what you've done?

555
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,401
So what? Let him go.

556
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,165
He wasn't gonna last long here anyway.
Let him go.

557
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,279
Remember, Cirilo, this isn't your house.

558
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,042
But the furniture is!

559
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,384
Don't you understand
he has nowhere to go!

560
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,818
I can't believe you're doing this to me!

561
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,193
Pellín, please wait.

562
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,857
Look, Florita...

563
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,759
you and this house are the only two
things that I have left in this world.

564
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,970
If I lose that...
I know I'm going to die.

565
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,480
Is he gone?

566
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:14,424
Forgive me, Cirilo, but if you're not
willing to accept him in this house...

567
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,085
then you'll have to leave.

568
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,795
You prefer him over me.

569
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,788
You're not doing your part, Cirilo.
You're also an old man.

570
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,998
You know what it's like not having
a place to live!

571
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,439
You, better than anyone, should know
what he's going through.

572
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,708
Why should I solve his problems?

573
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,767
He's also my friend. Do it for me.

574
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,148
We were so happy before he showed up.

575
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,809
Don't be so selfish!

576
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,248
What is it you want me to do?

577
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,989
I want you to go outside right now...

578
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,083
apologize, and ask him to stay.

579
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:08,407
Pellín!

580
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,237
Pellín, wait!

581
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:13,612
Pellín!

582
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,876
What do you want?

583
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,013
Don't you think we're a
little too old for this?

584
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,858
You're pretty old for this.

585
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:25,692
Besides, the only one that's suffering
because of all of this is Florita.

586
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,697
If you know I don't like it when you
call her Florita, why do you do it?

587
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,569
Well... so you get used to it.

588
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,045
Shake hands with me.
They're watching you.

589
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:46,209
You're the one who's gonna get kicked out of
the house. Shake hands and be done with it!

590
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,593
I only do this because I love Flora.

591
00:54:56,593 --> 00:55:00,051
But if it was up to me, you could
go fuck yourself.

592
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,900
Really? Wave. Wave.

593
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,061
Look over there and wave.

594
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,656
This silence would drive anyone crazy.

595
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:47,098
Hey, girl, marry him once and for all
so we can all go home.

596
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,405
Why don't you marry him?

597
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,976
I see a guy with a gun, I'll give
him my ass, if he asks for it.

598
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,188
- Then give it to him.
- It's not my ass he wants.

599
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,177
So do it.

600
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,159
Marry him, girl.

601
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,162
With what's available in this country,
one can't be too choosy.

602
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,722
What's the worst that can happen? If you
don't like it, you get a divorce.

603
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,597
But I don't want to get married!

604
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,274
All I want is to make you happy.
And you won't let me.

605
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,377
- You're just being selfish.
- Selfish, me?

606
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,972
I'm doing this because I love you.

607
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,641
You could've saved yourself the effort.

608
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:40,190
They say that there's seven women
to every man.

609
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,719
So?

610
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:49,694
Well, maybe one of the other
six wants to marry you.

611
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,743
Young man! I need to talk to you!

612
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,891
- I have the priest here with me.
- Have him come in.

613
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,795
No, no.
We've fulfilled our end of the bargain.

614
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:16,666
Now we need to see an act of
good faith from you...

615
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,998
and let the passengers go.

616
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,771
Yeah, sure. No.

617
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,103
Once the priest comes in,
I'll let someone go.

618
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,913
I can't do that.
I can't let the priest in there.

619
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,282
That would be one more person in there.

620
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,184
What a pain in the ass. Hang on.

621
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,565
- You can go.
- What?

622
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,800
Go ahead. You can go.

623
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,463
And miss the wedding?
Let someone else go.

624
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,867
- You can go.
- That would be against my principles.

625
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:05,344
I'm not going to abandon these people.
Pick someone else.

626
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,647
Who the hell wants to leave?

627
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,653
What's wrong with all of you?
Why won't you leave? Are you all stupid?

628
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,993
There's a guy threatening you with a
gun and no one wants to leave? Damn.

629
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,265
If that's the case, I'll go.

630
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,941
Go on. Get the hell outta here.

631
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,808
Go on.

632
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:42,913
Cool.

633
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,546
I'm leaving.

634
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,198
You're all fucking nuts!

635
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,903
- Your blessing, Father.
- God bless you, son.

636
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,645
We were waiting for you so
we could get married.

637
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,940
I'm Miguel, and this is the most
beautiful girl in the world, Marta.

638
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,254
What you pretend to do is not right.

639
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,519
Don't let evil thoughts cloud your mind.

640
00:59:55,458 --> 01:00:01,226
Think of the gift our Lord has blessed us with,
and that's the gift of reason.

641
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,801
I called you here so you could marry us!

642
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:10,707
I'm trying to tell you that your actions
are driven by passion, not by reason.

643
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,766
You can't force love.

644
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,971
You come here to marry us or to give a
sermon? Go ahead and marry us.

645
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,652
I'm sorry, son, but marriage is sacred...

646
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:26,589
and in order to take place,
both must be willing parties.

647
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,825
- Amen to that, Father.
- What do you think?

648
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:33,162
That after all this I'm going to leave
empty-handed? I promised the Virgin!

649
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:38,801
Please understand. A marriage cannot take
place under these conditions.

650
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,737
Damn. You can't trust
anyone in this country.

651
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,908
I thought priests were different,
but you're all the same.

652
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,502
- Please understand, son.
- No, you understand.

653
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,912
Either you marry us or you're
going to meet Saint Peter right now.

654
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:57,720
Dearly beloved, we are here to celebrate
the union of these two children of God...

655
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,956
in sacred matrimony.

656
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:04,027
You're going to pay attention to this guy,
Father? This guy's nuts!

657
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,396
Trust me, my child. We have no choice.

658
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,364
- Go on.
- What's your name?

659
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,668
- Her name's Marta.
- Marta, do you take...

660
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:15,968
- Miguel.
- Do you take Miguel as your husband...

661
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:21,644
...to love and protect,
in sickness and in health...

662
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:26,115
for richer for poorer, for better
for worse, till death do you part?

663
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,985
Can you hear me, Miguel?
It's your mother!

664
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,789
Mom. That's my mom. Excuse me-

665
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,257
Unbelievable!

666
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:38,023
Can you hear me, Miguel?
It's your mother!

667
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,197
What are you doing here?

668
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:45,401
Get out of there and let those people go!
What are you doing?

669
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,705
I'm getting married!
The priest is going to marry us!

670
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:53,904
Stop before someone gets hurt! You're
making a mess of everything!

671
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:58,147
I can't, Mom. The priest and
the witnesses are waiting for me.

672
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,050
Think, Miguel! Think!

673
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,187
Mom, if you don't agree, then go.
Go and let me live my life!

674
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:08,391
She's the woman I've always dreamt about.
You don't even let me dream.

675
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,893
I'm not leaving without you.

676
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,262
I'm the only woman who's ever loved you.

677
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,032
I've cared for you, cooked for you,
washed your clothes.

678
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:21,629
I wiped your ass when you were covered in
shit! I'm the only woman you need!

679
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,807
Look, Mom, I want to be with her
for the rest of my life.

680
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,310
Don't you see what I've done for her?

681
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,904
Think, son! Just stop and think!

682
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,579
Take her away. Take her away.

683
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:39,620
Freeze. Lower your weapon. Do it now.

684
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,892
- You fooled me.
- It's over. Lower your weapon.

685
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,557
- I'd rather die.
- Lower it, goddamnit!

686
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,063
You lower it.

687
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:55,002
- I don't want to shoot you!
- Shoot, you son of a bitch.

688
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:59,070
Lower your weapon! Do it!

689
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,935
- Shoot.
- I do!

690
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,106
Are you crying?

691
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,811
Want some gum?

692
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:58,429
That boy of yours is something else.
Check out his new girlfriend.

693
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:26,290
That's my car!
Come back here, you asshole!

694
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,231
Your dad is a son of a bitch!

695
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,136
Come on, Lola!

696
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,779
- Bless you.
- Where's your father?

697
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:17,768
He left.

698
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,983
Ismaelito, this is very important.

699
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:25,113
We need to know if what Macho told your
mom about Tati is true.

700
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,749
Answer your grandmother.

701
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,069
Yes, it's true.

702
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,470
Hurray! One candle!

703
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,518
- I have a surprise for you.
- Another one?

704
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,788
- What surprise could that be?
- My goodness...

705
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,346
I'll be right back.

706
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,932
A bottle of homemade rum.

707
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,338
What is that, Flora?

708
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,277
Now that's really good.

709
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,940
I want us to celebrate with rum
because it's a very special night.

710
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,104
Not only because it's my birthday...

711
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,742
but also because I'm next to the two
men I love the most.

712
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,845
May you both live a long time.

713
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,830
Just out of curiosity, how many years
are we talking about?

714
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,933
You don't ask a lady her age!

715
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,632
Please, Cirilo. Seventy-two years young

716
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,802
Young and beautiful.
That deserves a drink.

717
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:34,767
I would like to make a toast.

718
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:41,781
To you, Flora.
You're a goddess. A true angel.

719
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,688
I'd like to make a toast...

720
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,192
because I'm living the most glorious
day of my life...

721
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:54,492
having returned to where I belong...

722
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,689
my home.

723
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,136
And next to you, Florita.

724
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,660
Don't get carried away.

725
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,510
That was tough. Another one. Another one.

726
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,049
Another one.

727
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,854
Another one. Another one. This is good!

728
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,726
That's good. Drink up.

729
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:27,321
If we're going to have another one,
we have to do another toast.

730
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,833
I toast to my rooster, Esteban.

731
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:36,338
I hope he's still alive and that one
day he'll return home.

732
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,830
And I toast to old people...

733
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,876
and the time we have left.

734
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:48,148
- To life.
- To life!

735
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,887
- Damn!
- Another one?

736
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,093
- Another one.
- Another one. Cheers.

737
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,562
To life.

738
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,464
One more. No? Well, I'd like one.

739
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,469
Distinguished lady.

740
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:49,478
I was watching you dancing all alone,
and I said to myself...

741
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:54,438
"I wonder if she would care to dance with
me?"

742
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,987
It would be an honor, sir.

743
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:58,851
Thank you.

744
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,107
Come and dance with us, Cirilo.

745
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,440
How do you expect me to dance
when I can't even walk?

746
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,129
Florita...

747
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:55,008
if it was up to me,
I could die right now.

748
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,476
Shut up and dance.

749
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,855
- Look...
- What? Careful.

750
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,521
Come on, let's go.

751
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:20,527
You need to know what this guy's like.

752
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,763
You're a... coward!

753
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,069
You need to lie down. You're drunk.

754
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,699
Fight like a man.

755
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,270
What's that all about? Such nonsense.

756
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:34,482
- We just wanna have a good time.
- So do I!

757
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,241
- I wanna have a good time.
- Time for bed.

758
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,612
- I'm watching you.
- Come on, come on.

759
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,217
Let's go to the room.
You need to go to sleep.

760
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,383
You're way too drunk. Come on, come on.

761
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:11,587
- Time to go to sleep.
- I don't want to sleep.

762
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:15,324
But look at yourself. Your night's over.

763
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,521
Why don't you love me?

764
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,458
I do love you.

765
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:27,067
Y love you very much.
And I also need you very much.

766
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:41,194
You feel anything?

767
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,934
- Let's do it again, okay?
- Okay.

768
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,613
...said to His disciples...

769
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,842
"Do not fear. Believe in God.

770
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,546
And also believe in me.

771
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:06,790
In my father's house are many mansions.

772
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,929
I am going there to
prepare a place for you."

773
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,020
You have a visitor.

774
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,862
How are you, son? It's so
good to see you. God bless you.

775
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,595
Guess what? The dog's pregnant.

776
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:59,641
I thought the neighbor's dog
was neutered, but I was wrong.

777
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,209
I don't know what I'm going to do.

778
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:04,880
Maybe give her away. I can't have all
those dogs running around the house.

779
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,315
The guards over here are real nice.

780
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,485
I brought them some avocados so that they
treat you well.

781
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,885
Son, are you... are you eating enough?

782
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,749
That was my favorite song.

783
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,352
- I don't like that song.
- But it's my favorite.

784
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:40,455
- I bought you the CD.
- But I wanted to listen to it.

785
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,291
- Wait till we get home.
- You're so unfair.

786
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:46,261
- You're the one who's unfair.
- I was so relaxed.

787
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,130
- But I don't like that song!
- Why do you have to annoy me?

788
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,366
- I didn't do anything to you!
- I'm done listening to you!

789
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,732
- What about what I like?
- No!

790
