1
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,767
- Don't you dare cheat.
- I am not!

2
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,485
- I can't see shit.
- Great. Hold on.

3
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:28,435
Ok. Step in.

4
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,505
Charlotte, you know I don't wanna party.

5
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:32,973
Don't be such a bitch.

6
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:36,928
Ok. You ready?

7
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:38,656
Yes...

8
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:39,999
No

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,733
Happy Bacherlorette Party!

10
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,075
Guys...

11
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:53,646
Really?

12
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,231
I'm going to need a drink now.

13
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,411
You go girl!

14
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,158
He's coming, he's coming.

15
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:15,519
Hi, merci, merci.

16
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:17,324
Where's Magic Mike?

17
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,708
I don't know,
but this one is so not Channing Tatum.

18
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,709
Shut-up!

19
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,755
Oh come on, they don't understand us.

20
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,982
Tu ne pa comprends, right?

21
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:28,063
Yes.

22
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,454
'Yes' is the only thing you can say,
right?

23
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:31,455
Yes!

24
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,800
No fair.
You're having all the fun.

25
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,767
- Well it is my party!
- Come on you.

26
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,485
Go, go-go.

27
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,305
Viva France!

28
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,744
Can we touch?

29
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:57,634
You have no idea
how much I love him.

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,604
I love him so much I could eat his face.

31
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:04,384
You are so lucky to have Jim.

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,323
I can't believe you two
are getting married.

33
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,076
I'm getting married.

34
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:14,772
I'm getting married.

35
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:15,773
Tomorrow.

36
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,200
I- I'm getting married tomorrow.

37
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,665
She's getting married tomorrow!

38
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,627
Yeah.

39
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,119
What time is it?

40
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,422
Fifteen to eleven

41
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:29,645
God-Really?

42
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,367
Uh, I should go.

43
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,375
- What?
- I have to go.

44
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,607
No you don't.

45
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:37,473
Yes I do, I have to be fresh
for tomorrow!

46
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,524
No one's ever fresh at their wedding.

47
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,188
And that's why they all have
shitty wedding pictures.

48
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,189
Don't go.

49
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,382
Thank you for tonight ladies.

50
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:48,120
Enjoy your not-so-Magic-Mike stripper.

51
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,752
Merci beaucoup for the lap-dance.

52
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,656
Good night, sleep tight!

53
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,301
- Sweet sex dreams.
- Goodnight.

54
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:02,354
Judith. What the hell
are you doing here?

55
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,889
Going to sleep. What the hell
are you two doing here?

56
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:10,660
Forgot my credit card an-and your fiance
here is running out of cash.

57
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,135
Hey... whatever...

58
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,477
Hey.

59
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,404
Hey.

60
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,406
How was your night?

61
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,279
Ok.

62
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:21,932
And yours?

63
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:23,283
Ok.

64
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,918
Really annoying,
if you want to know the truth.

65
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:29,938
Me too.

66
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,233
Yeah

67
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:36,361
I mean this, isn't this the most
frustrating night you've ever had?

68
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,629
Yes

69
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:40,471
I missed you.

70
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,829
I know.

71
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,251
I can't wait to get married.

72
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,521
I know

73
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,624
I don't wanna be free.

74
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:59,553
Oh come on guys.
Stop it, both of you.

75
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,421
You're such a disapointment.

76
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,217
Found your card?
Yeah it was in my pocket.

77
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,552
But you knew
that already right?

78
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,712
K, let's go now!

79
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,691
Night

80
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:14,631
And don't you dare leave me at some club
to sneak into your room.

81
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:06,075
♪Knock on the door♪

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Bonsoir.

83
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:18,887
Bonsoir.

84
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,084
You speak French.

85
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,211
You don't speak French?

86
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,697
Un peu.

87
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,107
No, you don't

88
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:32,463
Thanks

89
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,378
Is this your first time in Paris?

90
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,222
No.
It's my second.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,063
I first came here when I was
a teen with my parents.

92
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,964
I love it here so much,
I always wanted to come back.

93
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,346
It's so beautiful

94
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,907
My fiance
always wanted to get married abroad.

95
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:57,576
So this is like,
the perfect occasion to come back

96
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,825
You're getting married?

97
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:02,672
Yeah...

98
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,341
Tomorrow.

99
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:11,214
I see.

100
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,057
♪Speaks in French♪

101
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:19,197
What?

102
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:20,982
You're shy.

103
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,850
That's ok.

104
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,977
We don't need to rush.

105
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:35,730
I have plenty of time.

106
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,323
This feels silly.

107
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,820
To be with a girl
or with an escort?

108
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:50,873
Both.

109
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,599
Why did you ask me to come then?

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,201
I'm not sure anymore

111
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:03,323
- Um, I'm sorry.
- That's ok.

112
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,859
You need some encouragement,
that's all.

113
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:53,091
I'm sorry, but...

114
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,024
But, does this actually work?

115
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:56,102
Fait ce qui marche?

116
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:58,105
This!

117
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:00,624
All this flirting.

118
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,171
Yes.

119
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:06,043
- Yes, of course it works.
- With men, I guess.

120
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,419
With men, with women. With everyone.

121
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,328
So you've been with a woman?

122
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,783
Of course.

123
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,570
As your client?

124
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:21,448
Of course as my client.
What else?

125
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,673
You didn't contact me to chat, right?

126
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:32,723
No.

127
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:34,962
No.

128
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,932
So let's do it. Ok.

129
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,056
Maybe this is a not the right time for you.

130
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,002
I'm getting married tomorrow.

131
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,470
This is the only time.

132
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:58,157
So you've never been with a woman?

133
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,158
Can't you tell?

134
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:04,102
Well you know it's,
it's not the fiftees anymore.

135
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:06,987
It's not that complicated
to get with a girl.

136
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:08,313
I know.

137
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,097
Looks to me like...

138
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,192
You don't really want to do it.

139
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,756
So...

140
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:26,163
How long have you been doing this for?

141
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,198
This?

142
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,721
You mean being an escort?

143
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,152
Yeah.

144
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,797
Is this an interview?

145
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,618
No.

146
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,729
Two years.

147
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,567
- Why?
- What do you think?

148
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:52,100
To meet extremely diversified and
intelligent people...

149
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,863
Money. Of course.

150
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:01,153
It's easy.
And it doesn't take long.

151
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,180
Usually.

152
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:06,213
So...

153
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,539
Why an escort?

154
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,461
Why not just going out
in a gay bar?

155
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,935
I guess it just seemed
easier to hire someone.

156
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Plu simple.

157
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:23,092
Yes...

158
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,418
Plu simple.

159
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:30,178
Am I different from
your other clients?

160
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:32,390
Women, you mean?

161
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:34,965
Yeah.

162
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:37,905
Yeah, of course you are.

163
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,116
In what way?

164
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:42,117
Well...

165
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:44,890
You are younger,

166
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,955
you are not married.

167
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,927
Not for long.

168
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:54,341
And they know what they're doing.

169
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,093
Funny.

170
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,154
You really know how to
talk to people.

171
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:59,155
Yes...

172
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:01,475
Yes, I believe I do.

173
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:04,133
Might be better in French though.

174
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:13,543
Well...

175
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,865
Here we are.

176
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,286
That moment.

177
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,263
That moment when,

178
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:26,077
everything that was completely sure to
happen is,

179
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,864
completely unsure.

180
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:32,926
We were certain to have sex tonight,
right?

181
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,213
That's why you hired me.

182
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,425
Plu simple.

183
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:41,109
Everything was planned and...

184
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,446
And then, we end up at that moment.

185
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,858
Well you know, in every um...

186
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,171
in every date...

187
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,779
you're always sure at first, to get what
you are here for.

188
00:11:58,525 --> 00:11:59,768
Sex?

189
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Yes.

190
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:03,788
Sex.

191
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,365
You're confident,

192
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:15,203
you're sure to be desired by the person
you're meeting.

193
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,299
Why would you two be dating if not, right?

194
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:22,796
Right.

195
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,729
And then, everytime...

196
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:31,445
there is that moment when you're
talking or

197
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,540
or doing something else and,

198
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,821
you come to realize that the people
you're meeting are not that into you

199
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,227
You might not be that into them,
'neither.

200
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:50,579
But when you come to realize that...

201
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,681
that they might not be interested in you,

202
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:00,308
that's when you start wanting
them more.

203
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:09,695
Suddenly when you realize that nothing
is going to happen that night...

204
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:13,527
that you actually
want it to happen.

205
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,632
It's like a challenge.

206
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,901
Un défaite

207
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:22,447
But isn't that the best moment?

208
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,354
When nothing is sure?

209
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,037
The best?

210
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,221
Yeah, the best.

211
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,995
That uncertainty...

212
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,202
and fear of being rejected.

213
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:37,829
It's exciting.

214
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,198
Yeah.

215
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:42,669
I guess it is.

216
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,372
We need that feeling so badly...

217
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,572
People are willing to pay for it...

218
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:51,167
- Or to see a girl...
- Or to cheat on their husband-to-be...

Because.

222
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:17,247
It's so embarrassing!

223
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,949
Do you remember?

224
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,697
We had so much fun.

225
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:22,702
I love this song.

226
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:25,910
Change the station. I can't stand that man.

227
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,911
What? You're so exaggerated...

228
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,964
The car is so old, the radio doesn't work.

229
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:34,215
It's so cool.

230
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:35,415
No way!

231
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,670
There's the call phone cable if you want...

232
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,914
What do you want to listen to?

233
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,667
Whatever you want.

234
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,065
Fuck, this guy is not answering.

235
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,816
Paula, come, not again.

236
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,562
No, seriously...

237
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:00,364
We went out, we had fun... and what now?

238
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:04,059
That's what you get when you
fuck someone the first night...

239
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:07,063
Don't be such a bitch.

240
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,066
I'm already feeling like shit.

241
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,068
He is online and he is not texting me...

242
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,602
Just put some music on.

243
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,323
What were you expecting?

244
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:26,342
To find the love of your life
on a dating app?

245
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,063
Not the love of my life...

246
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,567
but it works for some people.

247
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,817
It works to get laid.

248
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,151
You know that 'cause you already
fucked everyone.

249
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,720
Well, I think you're doing pretty much
the same...

250
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,324
Don't be upset.

251
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,366
You have to stop thinking about
that guy.

252
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:51,771
Maybe we meet a cute guy tonight.

253
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:52,847
Of course not.

254
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,571
We'll be the only spinsters in
that weddings.

255
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:58,596
I hate this...

256
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,595
At least we go together.

257
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,268
What's the matter?

258
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,285
What's that face?
Nothing

259
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,285
Is something bothering you?

260
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:32,153
You drink two shots and you get so foolish.

261
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,035
Does it bother?

262
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,636
'Cause is didn't seem so the other day.

263
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:37,859
Are you serious?

264
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,289
Why are you avoiding everything?

265
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,290
Stop.

266
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:42,305
Avoiding what?

267
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:45,788
Vicky...
Stop. You're so annoying.

268
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,289
I told you.
I don't want to talk about that.

269
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,302
So what should we do?

270
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:10,436
'Cause I want to.

271
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,468
Fuck, I've been thinking so much
about it.

272
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,411
It comes to my mind again and again.

273
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,230
It's past now.

274
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,927
Why do you keep thinking about it?

275
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:33,382
Fuck, Santiago and Cristina were behind us.

276
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:34,716
Vicky, wait...

277
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,126
Did you forget it or what?

278
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,721
I don't want to think about it...

279
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,214
but it's so weird.
Weird?

280
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,464
Yes...

281
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,465
What would people think?

282
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:52,459
No, no... Damn it.

283
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:54,768
This is not me.

284
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,471
Me neither.

285
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:01,711
It shouldn't have happened.

286
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,112
But I keep thinking about it.

287
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:07,113
But this can't be.

288
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:14,224
Why not?

289
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:18,523
Because.

290
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I don't know why we keep messing
things up.

291
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:29,644
You could have taken some
guy to this party...

292
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,378
and we wouldn't be in this situation.

293
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,260
But what should I do?

294
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,901
I am very confused.

295
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,635
I shouldn't said anything.

296
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:42,559
You're so messed up.

297
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,800
I told you...

298
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,556
and you told me...

299
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:54,545
Two minutes ago you were talking about
that jerk.

300
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,550
I know.

301
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,052
I don't know what to say.

302
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm trying to move on.

303
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,617
You're so messed up.

304
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:04,822
Nobody gets you.

305
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:06,823
You act like nothing happened.

306
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,539
And you flirted with everyone.

307
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,536
And you fucked them all.

308
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:15,690
And what did you want me to do?

309
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:16,783
Wait, for what?

310
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:21,539
I don't know Vicky.

311
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,782
I didn't start with this shit.

312
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:31,791
"Match with this guy, match with
this other guy..."

313
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,285
"How cute is this one..."

314
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:36,036
It wasn't me who started
flirting with everyone

315
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:39,040
and it was the day after Paula.

316
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,532
And you start with this?

317
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,790
Touching me in the car?

318
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,173
Don't say that.
Shut up.

319
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:47,453
It would be terrible if my
parents knew about this

320
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,357
Shut up.

321
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,256
You shut up.

322
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,527
This is serious

323
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,496
I should marry a good man,

324
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,550
have children, travel...

325
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,067
and what now?

326
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,213
Everything is fucked up because
I'm the town lesbian.

327
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,403
You? What about me? I'm "the maneater" of
the group!

328
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,500
I don't want to wear plaid shirts,

329
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,008
walk like a man

330
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,416
I don't like that. It's disgusting.

331
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,932
What are you talking about?
It's not me.

332
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,453
What if my parents find out about this
Paula shut up.

333
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:16,933
No more, please

334
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:17,934
I like it, ok?

335
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:28,200
I loved it.
What?

336
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:31,208
I loved it. Don't you hear me?

337
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,048
I don't know what to say

338
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,392
Vicky, I don't know

339
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,225
Let's go. We're gonna be late.

340
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:27,159
It's so embarrassing if they see us
arriving in this car.

341
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:50,645
Answer

342
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:56,165
Hello?

343
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:03,087
Fine, and you?

344
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,343
Yes...

345
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:11,011
I am going to that wedding I told about.

346
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:12,749
Yes, so lame.

347
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:19,208
We come back to Bogota. With a driver.

348
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:24,345
Tomorrow?

349
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:29,116
It could be.

350
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,268
Yes...

351
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,619
to recover from the hangover.

352
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,106
Why were you so lost?

353
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:45,691
Ah, poor baby

354
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:21,370
Love

355
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:26,329
Oh god... It's a happy feeling

356
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,324
It's whenever you want to be around
someone all the time

357
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:35,359
I think love is really just giving
everything else to another person

358
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,374
and doing so unconditionally

359
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:46,301
There's so many different kinds of love
and so many different ways to love

360
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:49,348
and so many different ways that people
show love, and people interpret love

361
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,693
that I think it's just one
of those things that no

362
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:56,112
one will ever really be
able to explain what it is.

363
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,366
Who am I?

364
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,340
Evita is

365
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:21,328
a mother, a wife

366
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:26,300
She's a big dork, nerdy

367
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:29,152
strange, ecclectic

368
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:30,386
unique

369
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:33,378
Evita is bisexual

370
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:38,384
I think those are big parts of who she is

371
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:41,396
She is Evita

372
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:46,348
I am 33 years old

373
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:51,304
and I have been married to
my husband Kevin for 12 years

374
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,372
I'm sitting next to you

375
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,312
Aww!
Pretend I like you

376
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:01,656
I remember the first day I saw her.
I walked into a church

377
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:05,358
and I looked across the room

378
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,398
and I heard her laugh, saw her smile

379
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:12,306
and her laugh, and immedietely
I was into her

380
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:17,384
It was a very conservative church, I would
even say borderline cult-ish

381
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:22,336
We couldn't have TVs,
we couldn't go to the movies

382
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:25,304
the men couldn't have beards.

383
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:31,318
And one of the things that was wrong
was being homosexual, you know, being gay

384
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:35,356
or being bisexual, or being a lesbian
or anything like that

385
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,373
So when you'd get up and give testimonies

386
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:42,306
about what things the Lord has
delivered you from

387
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,315
that was one of the things that he was to
have supposedly have delivered me from

388
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,315
which is having same-sex tendancies

389
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:50,316
but that was never really the case.

390
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,396
I am Brianna Garduno, I'm 26 years old

391
00:32:00,324 --> 00:32:01,564
and I'm in San Diego California

392
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,319
I dated boys up until high school

393
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,396
my very first sexual experience was not a
very good one

394
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:16,303
so I sworn off men

395
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:18,368
and I decided if this is what sex with men
is like

396
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,368
I don't want any part of it

397
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:27,318
It was a guy I'd known for a while,
so I kind of trusted him

398
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,376
and so I was like ok, we'll do it

399
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:36,388
and so he started and it hurt so I started
crying and was like I want to stop

400
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:42,394
and he said no, no, no. And he didn't stop
until I was like I think I'm a lesbian.

401
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,326
And he was like what?
So I don't trust men

402
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,326
that easily.

403
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:53,376
Well one of the things I love about you,
is your beauty, your intellect

404
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,188
We just kind of started talking, and
we would serve together in church

405
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,692
and that's how we
started interacting with eachother

406
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:05,453
we fell pretty hard for eachother

407
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:21,332
She's the spice to my life. My life
would be so very boring without Evita.

408
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:22,369
She's my spice.

409
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,176
As much as I love
my relationship with

410
00:33:28,177 --> 00:33:29,947
Kevin, one of the
issues that we had was

411
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:33,936
we had difficulty in our sexual life.

412
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:36,086
He'd never been a very sexual
person, at all.

413
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:39,686
I would beg him sometimes,
please, please please

414
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,302
I wanna do something and he'd be just like
"no, no, no"

415
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,447
And now - I'd go pray

416
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,324
I would literally go into the closet, and
just stay in the closet for hours and pray

417
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:51,391
and read his bible, study the bible.

418
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:55,340
And kind of leave me out there, hanging.

419
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:07,346
Being so closed up in regard to sexuality,
I just wasn't open.

420
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:13,281
I came out to my family
and everyone as a

421
00:34:13,306 --> 00:34:16,320
lesbian when I was
Sophomore in highschool

422
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:24,335
and I just dated women until then. I met my
ex fiance of five years in 2009

423
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,360
he and I ended things in May

424
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,340
I've always wanted to be a mom, I wanted
to have kids

425
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,310
the whole nine yards, so whenever I got
with JL

426
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:43,326
that's what I wanted, I wanted to have
kids, he wanted to have kids.

427
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:49,930
I have three children,
they are twin boys

428
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:52,694
that are 9 and a five
year old daughter.

429
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:57,881
Hi my name is Vivian,
so the tall one is named

430
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:02,870
Dimitrius and the medium
sized one is Darius

431
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,350
Do you want to start

432
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:18,866
In 2012, in September, Darius got diagnosed
with medulloblastoma

433
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,204
Which is a brain cancer

434
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:26,580
We got sent in the abulance to Los Angeles,
we spent two months in the hospital

435
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,638
because he had to get brain surgery,

436
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:33,059
and he had to go through
six weeks of radiation

437
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,648
and then about a year and
a half of chemotherapy.

438
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:44,676
The surgery left him a vegetable really,
for weeks

439
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,612
he had to re-learn how to talk,
how to eat

440
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:52,638
He couldn't even swallow his own spit.

441
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:56,466
You kinda say to yourself,
they're gonna get

442
00:35:56,467 --> 00:36:00,209
older and they're gonna
grow up and move on

443
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,842
and go and live their own lives,
and now we're looking

444
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:05,129
at... that may not
be possible for him

445
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:09,943
Sometimes I wonder if
he's gonna get to a place

446
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:12,189
where he starts to
feel sorry for himself

447
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,491
Or want to know why

448
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:22,241
Or be angry, that this happened to him.

449
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,770
And I don't really have a lot of answers,
I don't know how to help him with that

450
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:35,320
And when something like this happens, it's
like you try to fit this massive situation

451
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,623
into your box of religion and it
doesn't fit.

452
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:46,310
In that sense, I felt let down, I suppose.

453
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:53,239
And that what made me separate myself
from religion

454
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,437
because I felt like
when it came down to the

455
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:58,717
tough times in life,
it didn't help me out

456
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,346
I just can't believe it, this is our church

457
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:21,715
It's just funny because we're such
different people now

458
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:28,186
That environment overall is not a place
where I felt like we could stay

459
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:32,394
It was a lot, lot, lot to deal with

460
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:38,179
I think we got into the swinging thing,
just to kindof get away, and escape

461
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:42,904
I was on Meetup.com because I

462
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:45,691
was in a bisexual women's group

463
00:37:45,692 --> 00:37:50,689
and so it suggested some other groups that
were similar, so I joined one of the groups

464
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:57,692
and they had a party, a swinger party,
and so we decided to go

465
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:02,451
Swinging is always something
that I was like oh...

466
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:05,451
that sounds really sexy but I don't know
if I would ever do it

467
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,229
so once I became single I was like
well, if I'm gonna

468
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:10,696
try it, I might as well
try it while I'm single

469
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:14,322
I got invited to that swinger
party and that's basically what

470
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:17,971
it came down to, like "I'm scared
but I'm gonna do it anyway"

471
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:25,368
It was, honestly kind of surreal, because,
the environment we came from

472
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:31,700
and it was at a party and they're were
probably like 10 other people in the room.

473
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,344
Oh it was wild.

474
00:38:34,374 --> 00:38:38,282
I was actually thinking about
leaving, but then

475
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:41,969
Evita walks in,
I heard her before I saw her

476
00:38:44,374 --> 00:38:49,191
and then Kevin came up and he approached
me that night

477
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:54,451
and he was like "hey, what's going on,
do you wanna do something?"

478
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:59,452
and that was the night I was like, I think
I just wanna play with women.

479
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:03,694
He did try to talk to me first but I was
like eh.

480
00:39:03,695 --> 00:39:09,058
So he was like ok, ok. And then later on in
the evening is whenever Evita talked to me.

481
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:15,567
I never felt like I would ever find a
female that I like that liked me.

482
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,204
It was almost unbelievable for me,

483
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:26,215
that here it is this girl that I'm so into
and she likes me back.

484
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,827
That's how that world opened
up to us and then through the

485
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:35,231
world of Swinging we discovered
the world of Polyamory

486
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:40,221
I knew I liked women, I'd had sex with
women but I never had a girlfriend

487
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,692
So I wanted that experience. So we actually
got into Poly to date seperately

488
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,079
he was going to seek to
find a partner for himself,

489
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:50,950
and I was gonna seek to
find a partner for myself

490
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:55,698
but then we met Bri and she was just
someone that we both were into

491
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:59,177
and that's where our Poly stort went

492
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:16,177
She'd mentioned that
she wanted a girlfriend

493
00:40:16,178 --> 00:40:20,699
and I didn't know
if she meant me

494
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,925
I was thrown by the idea,
because she's married.

495
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,713
But we all just went
really well together

496
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:34,931
At first I did not want to, I told my wife

497
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,941
that that could be a relationship for her
to explore that side of herself

498
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:47,352
and I wanted to stay out of it, but they
both invited me in, so I willingly

499
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:52,710
decided to get involved in joining
the relationship.

500
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:05,191
It started off just swinging,
we were all just having a good

501
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:10,445
time together, it all started
from a sexual relationship.

502
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:16,192
We had threesomes,
I would come over to their house

503
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:18,446
occassionally,
I started spending the night there

504
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:22,394
and like I said the kids were at their
grandmother's house

505
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:27,682
for an entire month, so it was just an
entire month of fun and everything

506
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:29,710
So we were just running
around, cavorting around

507
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:32,440
San Diego, just acting
like everything was great

508
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:37,200
and once the kids came back it was like,
woah, this is real, this is a family.

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,953
Just from there,
spending so much time together

510
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:55,929
like that in an intimate
setting, feelings just developed from that

511
00:41:56,936 --> 00:41:59,066
it was just always the
trajectory of the relationship,

512
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:02,561
I don't think it was
any one person's idea

513
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,694
Really we got together and we just starting running.
- Yeah we punched it.

514
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:10,572
We got together and it was just went from
0 to 100, really quickly

515
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:40,832
My name's Kevin -I'm Evita -And I'm Brianna
And we're Polyamorous!

516
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:17,390
It's complicated in a sense, but the
children already had two stable parents.

517
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,197
So it was pretty much us
figuring out how to integrate

518
00:43:24,198 --> 00:43:29,120
Brianna into what we
already had established.

519
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:34,781
This is Bri, she's like
family, she doesn't always

520
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:38,843
stay but she'll come
over and act like a mom.

521
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:43,916
This is me winning a pumpkin.

522
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:51,917
This is Dad, this is Bri, this is me

523
00:43:56,308 --> 00:44:01,186
We told the kids-one day we sat them
down with Bri. It was funny because I

524
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:05,935
had to come out to the kids as bisexual,
they didn't know what that was.

525
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:11,954
And I explained that to them, and then
after that we told them who she was

526
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:14,302
and we just said she's our partner, the
way mommy and daddy are

527
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:18,461
romantically involved with eachother,
we're romantically involved with her.

528
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:23,414
And you're to respect her and
treat her like you would any adult,

529
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:25,662
care for her and love her.

530
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,914
And they were just like "O.K"
and that was the end of it.

531
00:44:28,328 --> 00:44:32,173
Sometimes she'll pick us
up from school

532
00:44:32,596 --> 00:44:36,103
Sometimes she'll take care of us when
mommy and daddy are gone

533
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:46,188
It's like living in a house
with your family

534
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:49,937
you're all there, you all pitch
in whenever you need to

535
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:52,265
Somebody does the dishes,
somebody does the cooking,

536
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,220
somebody helps the kids
with their homework

537
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:58,080
It's just like living with a big family.

538
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,978
The smart and intelligent the same thing?
I love you I love you babe - I love you

539
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,915
I'll see you ladies soon

540
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:10,694
What made Bri special was the fact that
both of us enjoy her

541
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:16,299
We're so opposite on so many
things

542
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:20,175
but there was this one person that
we could both get into

543
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,438
and that was exciting for us

544
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:28,578
I'd never had a girlfriend before that,
she was like a dream come true for me

545
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:46,911
Alright baby, I'm over here - I love you

546
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,667
We talked about having
a commitment ceremony,

547
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:53,710
and usually that's the
equivalent of a wedding.

548
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:59,332
Planning a life, having children together,
and things like that.

549
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:05,183
A lot of people think that because you're
in Polyamorous relationships

550
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,687
that jealousy doesn't happen, or it
shouldn't happen

551
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:11,438
and that is just not the case. It comes up
so often sometimes

552
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:13,430
you just learn to cope with it better.

553
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:17,444
I've done some pretty immature shit
in this relationship,

554
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:21,336
like I've done a lot of things that I'm
not particularly proud of

555
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:27,559
Kevin and Bri used to use condoms together
and I've shredded them up sometimes

556
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,916
because I was upset about something

557
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:34,416
and I'd go in his drawer and get them out
and I'd just rip em apart

558
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,673
If you're poly but you're dating seperately

559
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:41,175
a lot of what would be
happening with the person's

560
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,439
other partner is
happening apart from you.

561
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,944
But with a triad it's like right in your
face.

562
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:48,304
This is the first time I've made him
a salad

563
00:46:48,324 --> 00:46:51,687
and it almost sometimes feels like a
double betrayal

564
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:56,208
because both of your partners are with
someone else

565
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:58,200
and that someone else is eachother.

566
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,332
Can you scoop it in a bowl babe?
- sure

567
00:47:00,356 --> 00:47:04,448
Thank you, thank you - Are you talking to
this babe or that babe?

568
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:09,354
Any babe, ok, the first babe that responds

569
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,166
Oh did you hear that?

570
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:14,917
What?
- She said you talking to me because you don't call her babe.

571
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,286
Oh, what do I call you then?

572
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:24,310
One of the problems was just navigating
through a couple who are already married

573
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:31,189
and dealing with feelings that they had
about that and dealing with my own feelings

574
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,560
There were a lot of
things that she wanted

575
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,689
out of life that we
really couldn't give her

576
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:44,200
She wanted to have a baby, and it wasn't
that we weren't willing to give them to her

577
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,200
we just couldn't right now.

578
00:47:47,308 --> 00:47:53,163
I think the last year and a half of
us journeying through Polyamory

579
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:55,953
has been the most difficult time of our
marriage

580
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,428
Anyway, real quick you guys, just to let
you guys know.

581
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:12,450
Bri's not gonna be here for a little while

582
00:48:12,687 --> 00:48:15,937
for maybe just a couple of weeks.
Where's she going?

583
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:19,203
She's spending some time with her
grandma.

584
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:24,327
So, what happened yesterday

585
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:28,625
it started out with
something that was small

586
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,539
and it really just blew
out of proportion.

587
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,419
Evita and I got into a bit of a
disagreement and things just went

588
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,352
way further than they had before.

589
00:48:42,424 --> 00:48:45,923
So we decided it was just time to end
things

590
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:49,431
She was asleep and I was here in the house

591
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:53,837
and I was watching TV and putting a puzzle
together and waiting for her to wake up

592
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:55,184
so we could start our day

593
00:48:55,439 --> 00:48:59,940
And then she downstairs and she was visibly
upset

594
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:01,945
I was like "Good morning honey" and she
was just like "Hey."

595
00:49:01,946 --> 00:49:02,946
So I was like ok well, something is wrong.

596
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:05,313
I really like to deal
with things internally

597
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:07,468
and that's just not
always a good thing.

598
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,453
So it's something I still need to work on

599
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,920
But she never really did

600
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:13,914
she would say she was dealing with her
feeling internally

601
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:16,428
but it would always manifest itself in her
behaviour

602
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,926
so that's not really you dealing with your
feelings internally

603
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:20,420
that's you acting out

604
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:23,691
So I kept asking her what was wrong
and she said "nothing nothing nothing"

605
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:25,196
"I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine"

606
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:29,433
And at that moment, I just got really
pissed off

607
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:32,184
She was packing her things to leave

608
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:35,964
and I was like if you're gonna go, if you
walk out that door, we're done.

609
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,190
That's it, leave, go.

610
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:41,440
And she was like fine, I know that. So she
packed her stuff and she walked out.

611
00:49:41,566 --> 00:49:43,822
So I was like ok, well, now we're done.

612
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:49,209
We were just in very different places in
life.

613
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:57,210
In very different places of maturity,
in different places of financially

614
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:01,966
in just every area you could think of we
were just in different places.

615
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:06,442
And that's about it, that's all you guys
need to know for right now.

616
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:11,944
It's gonna be like we never met Bri!

617
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:15,691
- I wouldn't say that.
- Yeah me neither!

618
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:22,201
It's gonna be like we didn't even know
Bri when Mom told us of that

619
00:50:22,202 --> 00:50:24,326
No, it won't be that.

620
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,451
I don't think that this happened because of
Polyamory

621
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:32,704
I just think it's who we are as
individuals.

622
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:35,829
Maybe she and I just weren't meant to
be together.

623
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:44,428
I love what we had, I loved the little
family that we were creating

624
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:53,344
When I was in it, I felt like it was worth
the work that it took to keep it together

625
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:04,438
It sucks, you know. Because in this I was
building relationships with the kids

626
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:06,172
and I love them so much, and so now even

627
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:09,945
Kevin came to bring me my things last night

628
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:15,198
and I'm like it sucks because I don't even
get to see the kids anymore

629
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,701
It sucks.

630
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:24,161
I don't wanna say that I love them as
their mother

631
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:27,418
because I don't know what that feels
like as a true parent

632
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:32,179
but I love them as much as I could love
somebody else.

633
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:37,436
It hurts so much because you spent the
time and the effort

634
00:51:37,437 --> 00:51:39,940
and now where is it?

635
00:51:47,193 --> 00:51:51,949
I told Kevin that if I put myself in
his shoes

636
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,710
if I had a partner that I loved

637
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,451
or person that I loved that loved me

638
00:51:56,452 --> 00:52:03,221
that I wouldn't want to say goodbyr to that
until I was ready to

639
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:11,222
And... for that reason alone, I said I
think you should continue on with her.

640
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,198
Do you already know what you're going
to have? -

641
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:38,199
Yeah, I'm gonna get the white chicken
chillie

642
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:44,333
We got into Poly together, we dated this
person together

643
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:48,593
and now it feels like we're moving apart

644
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:51,257
it feels like a seperation, like he's
going on without me

645
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,676
And charting his course
and he knows where

646
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:56,175
it's going and he's
moving on without me

647
00:52:56,176 --> 00:53:00,192
and I feel like I'm steering off into this
Poly wilderness

648
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:05,705
and I don't know what it holds and I'm
all alone.

649
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:13,451
Tonight is Halloween and we're going
trick-or-treating with the kids.

650
00:53:13,452 --> 00:53:15,193
And we're gonna get ourselves some
candy

651
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:23,044
Trick or Treat!
- Hi, happy Halloween, there you go.

652
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:27,040
There's a Cookie Monster with cookies
inside

653
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,923
I'm dealing with the sadness of him having
another partner

654
00:53:29,924 --> 00:53:34,681
and me not having another partner, me
not knowing if I'll ever find someone...

655
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:36,926
find what he has with Bri with someone

656
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:41,929
and having to date again and meet people
and deal with all that bullshit

657
00:53:43,398 --> 00:53:46,686
- Hey!
- How's it going?

658
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:55,190
Mommy, look how much candy I have.
Wow that's incredible

659
00:53:55,382 --> 00:54:01,700
We're trying to work on our friendship
and I feel like as time goes further

660
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:03,203
it'll just be easier

661
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:20,943
And... we are back together

662
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:31,943
Bri and I kepy in contact throughout
the breakup

663
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:36,699
She asked me to go to dinner
and...

664
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:41,963
I was like OK, we can go to dinner. Then
I asked her if it was gonna be a date

665
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:46,340
and was like "I'd like it to be" so I was
like alright, we can do that

666
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:53,955
Oh so gently! -It's corny but she liked it,
you like being corny

667
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:55,446
Oh I love you!

668
00:54:55,447 --> 00:54:58,444
You know it's just another relatioship
option and that's really all it is

669
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:03,060
For me it's really about the freedom to
be who I am

670
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:05,128
That's what Polyamory is about for me.

671
00:55:18,697 --> 00:55:23,714
Polyamory is not for everyone, it's really
not

672
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:27,714
I wouldn't recommend just jumping in,
not knowing

673
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:32,916
because then you won't be as prepared for
some problems that arise

674
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:37,191
I think there is a hightened level of
communication in Polyamory

675
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:43,177
You don't really learn how to communicate
and in Poly you have to

676
00:55:43,178 --> 00:55:46,364
It has to be something that everyone is
willing

677
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,927
and is willing to participate in.

678
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:40,763
Where have you been?

679
00:56:40,787 --> 00:56:42,508
Don't you know we are having
guests tonight?

680
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:43,705
The bus was late!

681
00:56:43,745 --> 00:56:45,071
The village headman is here.

682
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:46,072
Hurry up!

683
00:56:47,564 --> 00:56:49,193
Diella, bring me the tray.

684
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:51,584
Faster.

685
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:30,291
If your sister is unmarried,
you are obliged to find a husband for her.

686
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:33,632
There is a further obligation that you
must fulfill

687
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:38,070
If she dies without having children,
you are obliged to organize her funeral.

688
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:41,095
A sister has no right to inherit
any wealth.

689
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:46,991
It is crucial to know that when brothers
want to divide the ancestral property,

690
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:55,047
they must distribute it among themselves,
whereas she, has no right to ingeritance.

691
00:57:55,969 --> 00:58:03,855
She shouldget marries and have children.

692
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,357
Once again, let me remind you that

693
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:13,346
brother are obliged to assist their sister
to find a husband and get married.

694
00:59:27,014 --> 00:59:31,318
I am very pleased to hear that you are legally
seeking your equal share of your ancestral property.

695
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:35,025
This is in accordance with the constitution,
thus your request is legitimate.

696
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,017
However, there is a problem,
a significant one.

697
00:59:39,018 --> 00:59:42,662
Usually these cases last for a very long
time in the court,

698
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:47,955
as a result they remain undecided,
since this is not the court's priority

699
00:59:47,956 --> 00:59:52,681
Take my advice, try to come to an
arrangement with your family members.

700
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:56,588
I insist this is the best and
most efficiant way.

701
00:59:58,004 --> 01:00:00,890
Have a good day.

702
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,688
Put some lipstick on.

703
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:45,852
Take it!

704
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:36,327
What would you like to drink?
A cup of tea.

705
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:38,790
Would you like the same?

706
01:01:39,392 --> 01:01:40,392
Make that two.

707
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:57,893
Hava, I believe Qazim already told
you about me.

708
01:01:57,918 --> 01:02:02,646
I am a mechanic. I fix cars.
My garage is nearby.

709
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:05,314
Our fathers used to know eachother well.

710
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:10,013
Did you have a conversation with
Muhamed?

711
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:14,179
He is a good and hardworking guy

712
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:18,950
Unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side,
his wife passed away recently.

713
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:27,929
Listen sister, he asked about you,
he is interested in you.

714
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:31,970
I gave him my aproval because I know
him personally.

715
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,530
I knew his father as well.

716
01:02:37,811 --> 01:02:42,078
Now that you are getting older,
I would like you to settle down

717
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:48,824
What's the matter?

718
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:53,386
Why are you so silent,
are you even listening to me?

719
01:02:54,216 --> 01:02:56,457
It's for your own good

720
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,962
Next week, they will ask you for your
hand in marriage.

721
01:02:59,963 --> 01:03:02,230
Be very careful with you decision.

722
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:05,297
No, I don't want to.

723
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,183
I am not interested in that man.

724
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:11,337
I don't want to get married.

725
01:03:11,402 --> 01:03:14,268
Nobody can decide my future,
not even you.

726
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:17,560
I never want to hear this
conversation again!

727
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:52,600
Add flour and slim it carefully.

728
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,558
Use you palm to add pressure.

729
01:03:56,172 --> 01:03:58,772
You have to learn before it's too late.

730
01:03:58,786 --> 01:04:01,559
You can't leave these things after
you get married.

731
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,627
That's more like it, well done.

732
01:04:13,624 --> 01:04:16,157
Hava?
Qazim wants to speak with you.

733
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,056
Is she learning?

734
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:30,956
Of course, she is doing better
than me.

735
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,524
How are you Hava?
Alright, how about you?

736
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:36,549
I'm good.

737
01:04:36,565 --> 01:04:38,455
Great.

738
01:04:38,456 --> 01:04:39,972
Are you going to work tomorrow?

739
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:41,477
Yes.

740
01:04:41,723 --> 01:04:42,723
At what time?

741
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:44,235
Evening shift.

742
01:04:44,236 --> 01:04:45,236
Very well.

743
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:48,934
Get you clothes ready, tomorrow at ten
we are going to our aunt's place

744
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:52,972
You will stay there for a couple of days,
until I find you a place to rent.

745
01:05:29,287 --> 01:05:36,460
Qaze, I don't know what to say.
It is difficult to find an apartment.

746
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:42,537
Considering her income,
expenses are quite high.

747
01:05:43,188 --> 01:05:47,428
She will have to pay for rent, electricity,
water and waste

748
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,291
I'm not sure she can cope with it.

749
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:55,105
I'll pay for the first six months,
no problem.

750
01:05:57,597 --> 01:06:00,275
Yes but Qaze, what about afterwards?

751
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:02,515
We will find a solution.

752
01:06:03,253 --> 01:06:07,425
She can stay at my place for a few days.

753
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:10,622
But, as you can see I don't
have enough space

754
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:13,879
Only a room to do everything,
eat, drink and sleep.

755
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:18,103
It's hard enough for me as it is.

756
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:19,237
It's suffocating!

757
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:25,603
However, I will do my best to find her
an apartment

758
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:16,839
How is the boy?

759
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:18,551
He is doing better

760
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,580
Yesterday he had a fever,
but he is feeling better now.

761
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:26,103
What's going on?

762
01:08:29,161 --> 01:08:31,348
He came back last night.

763
01:08:33,487 --> 01:08:36,850
We didn't know anything about it,
he just showed up.

764
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:41,470
They didn't give him the permanant
residency permit.

765
01:08:47,983 --> 01:08:51,352
I know that from now on it
will be difficult for us,

766
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:55,819
but we cannot see each other anymore.

767
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,846
Now that he is here,
it's dangerous for us to see each other.

768
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,089
My blood pressure is high
and it's killing me.

769
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,433
I am on medication,
but it doesn't seem to have an effect.

770
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:35,349
Don't worry,
the weather is changing constantly

771
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:38,448
it's probably something
to do with that.

772
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:39,556
I hope so.

773
01:09:39,557 --> 01:09:41,826
How are you doing my dear,
how was work?

774
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:44,470
Not bad aunty, how are you?

775
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:51,139
This is my niece Hava,
she is a really good girl,

776
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,577
you won't have any problems with her.

777
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,459
Thank you for renting your
apartment cheaper.

778
01:09:59,484 --> 01:10:01,602
May God reward you in return!

779
01:10:01,938 --> 01:10:04,343
Do no worry about it ma'am

780
01:10:04,348 --> 01:10:07,215
I am not using my apartment
at the moment.

781
01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:11,910
People say, who does good
finds good!

782
01:10:11,952 --> 01:10:13,892
Thank you!

783
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:18,271
I would have her stay here but
I have no space.

784
01:10:18,272 --> 01:10:20,471
I have health conditions

785
01:10:20,534 --> 01:10:23,868
I need to have my space,
she needs to have hers.

786
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,929
Her brothers divided
the ancestral property,

787
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,197
whereas she is not in a
very pleasant position.

788
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,827
Please, get in.

789
01:11:19,065 --> 01:11:21,750
This is the apartment you are going
to live.

790
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:29,179
You will find anything you need here.

791
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,392
In case you don't have enough money
to pay rent,

792
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:40,343
just call me.

793
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:42,864
I understand your situation

794
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:03,518
Go upstairs!

795
01:14:09,065 --> 01:14:10,065
What happened?

796
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,112
I'm back.

797
01:14:12,003 --> 01:14:13,003
Where?

798
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:18,518
In my home! I have just as much
right as you do to live here

799
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:21,986
was born in this house;
I have nowhere else to go.

800
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:26,814
Hava, I have taken care of you as you
were my own child

801
01:14:27,058 --> 01:14:28,518
I got you a job

802
01:14:29,182 --> 01:14:34,477
I wanted to find you a husband,
but you refused everyone that I proposed.

803
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:36,800
Isn't that right?

804
01:14:39,464 --> 01:14:40,864
What do you want now?

805
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:43,402
This is not your home!

806
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:45,308
I will not leave!

807
01:14:46,156 --> 01:14:49,370
Don't you understand what
I'm saying?

808
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:52,933
Your brother's property is not your
business.

809
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:56,073
I don't want to see you face around
here again!

810
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:58,892
If you have any complaints,

811
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:04,702
go to the courts,
they will find you a solution.

812
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,700
Get lost now!

813
01:16:34,946 --> 01:16:36,664
What's in the bag?

814
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:38,946
Where are you heading?

815
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,230
I have been kicked out.

816
01:16:46,697 --> 01:16:49,307
My brother divided the property
among themselves

817
01:16:49,323 --> 01:16:52,071
They have no place for me.

818
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:54,621
They don't need me anymore!

819
01:16:56,326 --> 01:16:58,558
What will you do now?

820
01:17:00,807 --> 01:17:02,558
I want to run away.

821
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:05,068
Where?

822
01:17:06,494 --> 01:17:09,325
As far as I can.

823
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,466
Please come with me.

824
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:21,068
I can't.

825
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:25,218
I can't leave my children!

826
01:17:39,452 --> 01:17:41,463
I know.

827
01:20:08,826 --> 01:20:09,826
Um...

828
01:20:09,869 --> 01:20:12,617
Actually, we need to talk to you about that

829
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,407
Oh well you don't have to pay me for lunch

830
01:20:17,644 --> 01:20:18,911
No, it's not that

831
01:20:22,566 --> 01:20:25,422
We're thinking about cutting back
on their painting lessons

832
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:30,070
I'm sorry, it's just...

833
01:20:31,555 --> 01:20:34,795
I know we probably should have talked to
you about it in advance, but

834
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,202
They're test is in two weeks

835
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:37,967
It's fine

836
01:20:37,992 --> 01:20:39,267
Dad!

837
01:20:39,431 --> 01:20:41,608
But Dad... please?

838
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:44,222
No argument.
That's the deal.

839
01:20:46,362 --> 01:20:48,289
I gotta make a phone call.

840
01:21:12,593 --> 01:21:17,316
Everything that happens between us,
stays in this room

841
01:21:27,442 --> 01:21:30,063
Um...
Will we see you next week?

842
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:33,719
Hmm... Aww, it's ok sweetheart,
you know what?

843
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:36,934
We'll paint something together really soon,
ok?

844
01:21:43,925 --> 01:21:45,219
Are you ok?

845
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:48,855
I needed a smoke break.

846
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:51,892
I'm sorry, we're not trying to be mean,
it's just-

847
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:54,425
I totally understand.

848
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:59,156
We can talk about their schedule when the
school year's over.

849
01:21:59,422 --> 01:22:02,297
Alright, I'll see you soon.

850
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,538
Come inside.

851
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,763
What the hell are you doing?

852
01:22:19,962 --> 01:22:20,962
Don't!

853
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,353
The neighbours might see

854
01:22:27,446 --> 01:22:28,846
I don't care

855
01:22:29,856 --> 01:22:32,904
Ariel, I'm sorry

856
01:22:32,929 --> 01:22:36,491
We talked about cutting the class, but
I didn't think he would do it so soon

857
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:39,487
I was going to tell you-
When are you going to tell him?

858
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:43,571
When!?

859
01:22:43,596 --> 01:22:48,094
I.. I was trying to tell you, Ariel.
I just need more time

860
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:51,263
You know what?

861
01:22:51,288 --> 01:22:53,547
Don't even worry about it

862
01:22:53,805 --> 01:22:54,835
It doesn't even matter

863
01:22:56,118 --> 01:22:57,688
Because we're just lovers

864
01:22:57,815 --> 01:22:59,282
We're not just lovers!

865
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,787
Please just try to understand

866
01:23:04,254 --> 01:23:09,514
I have a family to consider,
I am responsible for them.

867
01:23:10,413 --> 01:23:14,259
So, what about us?
Huh?

868
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:23,514
