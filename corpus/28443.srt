1
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,900
That’s very nice. Perfect.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
I love it.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
Look at that.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,100
The detail!

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,100
I like it.

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,500
-How much is there here?
-Four million dollars.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
It’s totally flawless.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,100
-Are you okay, dove?
-I gotta go to the bathroom.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,200
Jesus Christ!

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,800
Go with her and make sure
she doesn’t have the kid here.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,100
Keep you foreign feet off
my coffee table.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,900
-You think this is a brothel?
-It looks like one.

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,600
Who is this guy?

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,100
This is no way to
do business.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
You bring your pregnant woman
and this foreign termite.

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,500
That’s right.
You’re just a wet back.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,500
No, I’m not. I flew first class
from Moscow.

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,200
I even have a green card.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Fuck you and
whoever gave it you.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,800
-I love the noises you make.
-You’re heavy.

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,400
-Your gun jammed me in the tit.
-It wasn’t my gun, baby.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,400
You’re something. First you put
your feet on my table...

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
then wipe spit
on my $10,000 chair.

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
You’re the problem.

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,700
You come here and take
jobs from real Americans.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,700
We should put armies
on the borders...

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,000
so every time a shit like you
tries to cross, we shoot them.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Everybody relax.
We’re here to do business.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,000
-Immigration issues aside.
-Are you okay in there?

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,100
-I’ll pay 20 cents per dollar.
-Fifty.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,800
-0ne minute.
-Twenty five.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,900
-Forty.
-Thirty.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,300
0kay. But you take them all.
Tomorrow at noon.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
-You okay, dove?
-Let’s go.

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,500
Get her out of here before
she drops the kid in my room.

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,900
Come back tomorrow and leave
the communist scum at home.

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,700
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Move it.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,100
-Let’s go.
-Russian wanna be.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,600
Time to make the donuts.

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Check that.

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,600
Come on.

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,300
What the...

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,400
-Watch out.
-Shit.

44
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
It’s crawling with cops.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
It’s okay. We’ll lay low.
Everything will be fine.

46
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Sweet dreams, big guy.

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,800
The signal! I love you, Attilla.
Let’s go.

48
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,200
-What are you staring at?
-Don’t touch that.

49
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
-It was looking at me.
-Come on.

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
The whole place is wired.

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,800
-Everything’s okay.
-Nice work. Watch the door.

52
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Let’s find the cash.

53
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
-Where are you going?
-I’ll kill our host.

54
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,100
The cash is this way.
Leave him alone.

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,800
-Don’t say what I can do.
-We’re killing nobody.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,500
Give me the axe.
Let go!

57
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,900
What are you talking...
Give me the axe.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,600
-Cops. At the gate!
-We triggered the alarm.

59
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,300
Come on, let’s go.
0ut back.

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,100
Let’s go.

61
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,300
It’s locked.

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,000
-I’ll break the door.
-Not that!

63
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,300
This way, through the roof.

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,700
-They’ll get us out there.
-I’ll tie them up.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
-Taylor, no!
-Go, go.

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,100
Get her out of here.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,300
-Tell Megan I’m sorry.
-Come on.

68
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,500
Shit.

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,000
-I’m unarmed.
-There he is, guys.

70
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Get your hands up.

71
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,300
Check inside.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,200
We got him!
Hands behind your head.

73
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,700
Cuff him.

74
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,800
You’re going down, son.
Let’s go.

75
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,200
Good morning.
My name’s Jose.

76
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,100
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jose.

77
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,900
Glad to meet you.
My name is Taylor.

78
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
Good morning.

79
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
My name is Jose.

80
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,300
My name is...
My name.

81
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,000
This is the place.

82
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
Paige.

83
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,400
You’re out early!

84
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
I missed you.

85
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,800
You lied. You said you were
well. When did you move in here?

86
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,700
It’ll get better.
Don’t worry.

87
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
My God.

88
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,100
-Megan!
-Daddy!

89
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,300
You’re huge.
Unbelievable!

90
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,000
I brought you a card game
with little animals on it.

91
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Thanks...

92
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,800
but I don’t use these anymore.

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,900
I use big kids cards,
these are for little kids.

94
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,500
These are what I use.

95
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,300
Cool. Let’s play inside.

96
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,300
-Come back.
-Just a minute.

97
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,200
Come here.

98
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
-Come here.
-I’ve got to brush.

99
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
-Enough cards, kids. Come in.
-0ne more, Mrs Monty.

100
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,100
I’ll stick.

101
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,400
You’ve got sixteen.
And I have a face card.

102
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,600
You’ve lost.
You need to hit.

103
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,800
371 days, 23 hours
and 17 minutes.

104
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,800
-Wanna smoke?
-I gave up on the inside.

105
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,800
Do I double now?

106
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,300
If you want me
to take all your money.

107
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,200
-Thanks for taking care of her.
-We got along.

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,400
-We gotta get out of here.
-0pen Plan?

109
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,500
View of the dump?

110
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,300
I’m serious.
This isn’t what I want for us.

111
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,400
I thought about you both
so much.

112
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
Come in you two.

113
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,800
Megan, go on home.
I see your dad’s back.

114
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,600
It was a surprise. I guess they
shut the oil platform down.

115
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,300
If he worked on oil rigs
you wouldn’t live here.

116
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,900
You’re talking too much.
Get in.

117
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Come on, sis.
Let’s go play them horses.

118
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
I dreamed of escape
but I stayed...

119
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
Did the time and
kept quiet.

120
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Card shark, what’s up?

121
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Since the oil platform closed,
what ‘re you going to do?

122
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
-Make us some money.
-How?

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My buddy can get me a job
driving ambulances.

124
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,300
Come here.

125
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,500
Come on.

126
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,500
Get over here now.

127
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,600
Come on. Move it.
Hurry up.

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Go! Go!

129
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,100
I’m happy we teamed up.

130
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I’ve so much confidence in you.
You’re always in control.

131
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Hey man, what’s up.

132
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,800
I’m happy for you.

133
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,300
See what I’m saying?
The jar, the top of the jar.

134
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,300
Like this.
You can do this, this...

135
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
but not this.

136
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,100
Partners.
Not partners.

137
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
-0kay?
-0kay.

138
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,800
This music is making soup
out of my brains.

139
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,100
I need sleep and I haven’t slept
for three days.

140
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,300
Learn to flow.

141
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,800
Flow.

142
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,900
Check it out.

143
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Mark, over there.
There’s an ambulance.

144
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
Look Judd, steering wheel.

145
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,900
Street.

146
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,700
And don’t call me Mark.
Partners use first names.

147
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
Let’s go.

148
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,500
Coming through.

149
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,700
-Where the hell are you going?
-Heart attack.

150
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,000
-There’s no heart attack here.
-Someone called in.

151
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,900
No one called here.

152
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
-The third time this week.
-Not my problem.

153
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,500
-Nobody called.
-I’m betting this race.

154
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,500
What are you doing?
Get back here.

155
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,100
Move the stretcher.
It’s clogging up the place.

156
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,300
-I’ll wait up there with it.
-Fine. Let’s go.

157
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,900
Get in line
like the rest of us.

158
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,000
-I got to get back to work.
-I don’t believe this.

159
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,500
You’re not a good partner
unless you can prioritize.

160
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,200
-Prioritize?
-What to see and hear.

161
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,300
Like opera.

162
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,000
Let it in. What are you willing
to do to be a partner?

163
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,800


164
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,100
Can you?

165
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,400
-You may learn about yourself.
-Yeah, like how to kill myself.

166
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,700
Go!

167
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,100
A fat guy sings about the sex
he’d have if he weren’t so fat.

168
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,000
Expand my horizons!

169
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,600
-It’s so depressing.
-It’s a tragedy.

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
Tosca is my favorite.

171
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,900
-She’s in love with a painter.
-Nice.

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
-Avaradossi.
-Really nice.

173
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,300
Who’s killed by the betrayal
of the evil, wicked officer.

174
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,500
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

175
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,100
Get in line like everybody else.
Get in line.

176
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,800
-We’re all waiting.
-Back of the line, okay?

177
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,300
I’ve no problem with you.
We’re on the same team.

178
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,200
I put them down.
You patch them up.

179
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Whatever.

180
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,800
Can I get through? Sorry, I’m
not in line just need to get by.

181
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Excuse me. Sorry.

182
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,500
Don’t worry about it.

183
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Hi, boss man.

184
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,800
-Daddy, could you fire me up?
-My pleasure.

185
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
Meet me at the door.

186
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
-Hi, big daddy.
-You sure are pretty.

187
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,100
-Thank you.
-Let me light your fire.

188
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Great race, fine cigar,
pretty woman.

189
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,200
What else can go right?

190
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,700
Stay here.
I’ll get you a drink.

191
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Get the fuck down now!

192
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,300
-Alright.
-I said down!

193
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Thank you. Now stay down or
talk to my Uzi.

194
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Hit the floor.

195
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,500
-Did you hear something?
-Will you listen? Focus.

196
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,800
Who’s then murdered
by Tosca’s own hand...

197
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,400
who in turn...

198
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
commits suicide.

199
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,200
Here’s the deal,
you compulsive freaks!

200
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,000
No one moves, no heroes
and no one gets hurt.

201
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
Did you hear?

202
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,700
-Get the fuck down.
-Wanna do it?

203
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,600
-Get down.
-What’s this?

204
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,800
-How’s Yellow?
-I’m good.

205
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Pink, we’re good to go!

206
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,500
Listen, Mark.

207
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,800
What’s wrong with you?
No speaking.

208
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,600
Go!

209
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,200
We’re out of here.

210
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,100
Baby, behind you.

211
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,100
-I’ve got to go.
-I’m down.

212
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,500
Go!

213
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Stay down!

214
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,400
-Code three.
-Call it in.

215
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,200
Get back. Come on,
stand back.

216
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,300
Eddie.
Get over here.

217
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
-Ma’am? Check her pulse.
-Go check the perimeter.

218
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,100
Ma’am? Stand back.

219
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,300
-Can you see this?
-Her pulse is weak.

220
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,600
-She’s losing a lot of blood.
-Will she live?

221
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Think before you shoot.
Let’s get her outta here.

222
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,800
-You, get the stretcher.
-Hurry up and get it.

223
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,100
You don’t know what to see.
You don’t know what to hear.

224
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,900
You don’t see.

225
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
You don’t hear.

226
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,400
Fuck.

227
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,200
Fuck!

228
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,200
Get out of the way.

229
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,200
Move back.
Jesus Christ!

230
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,000
Let’s go!

231
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Pull that lever.

232
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,400
Pick her up.
1...2...3...

233
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,400
-FBl.
-What’s happening?

234
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,300
They’re shooting up the place.
They’re in the cage.

235
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
All right, out of the way.

236
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
FBl.

237
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
-0ut of the way, FBl.
-What’s this?

238
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
She was gonna rob the place.

239
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,200
We gotta get her to a hospital
or she’s gonna die.

240
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,100
You stay with them.
Let them through.

241
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,900
Coming through!

242
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
-Did they get the money?
-They got the money.

243
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,100
Took the surveillance chip.
Left not a trace. Smart as hell.

244
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,900
0fficer, I saw it all.
She was in bright pink...

245
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,900
The black cop shot the girl.

246
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,300
Where?

247
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,800
-Mind your business.
-Jump in.

248
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,400
-I need you as a witness.
-Get in!

249
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Get out of my way.

250
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,200
What’s wrong with these people?
Will she live? Die? Who shot her?

251
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
Shit!

252
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,100
I got a surprise for you.

253
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Let’s see the money!

254
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Hurry up.

255
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,000
Shit, that’s a lot of money.

256
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
-Am I good or what?
-How much is there?

257
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,500
0ne point nine million.

258
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,700
-What?
-Two million dollars!

259
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,600
I’m finally gonna finish my CD.

260
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,200
They said we’d never amount
to nothing.

261
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
My rap will be ready!

262
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,300
You went down hard.
You okay?

263
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,800
-I’m great.
-The look on his face.

264
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
The perve had his hands
all over me.

265
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,000
-We got two million bucks.
-US$200 dinners, US$500 suits...

266
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
US$1000 hookers.

267
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I got this from the 0TB.

268
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,200
Thief.

269
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,500
Marry me.
Get me pregnant.

270
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,900
My skins gonna be dark
as Rock’s.

271
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,600
Not on your best day,
white boy.

272
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,500
-When he goes, me and you?
-Get lost.

273
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,500
She knows your just my
little brother. Fuck off.

274
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,300
In God we trust.
Absolutely.

275
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,900
-I love you too, Rock.
-Smoke that.

276
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,200
I love you, baby.

277
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,700
-Kill the lights.
-Kill the lights.

278
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
I’m serious.

279
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,300
What the fuck is that?

280
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
-They’re marked.
-Shit.

281
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,900
What is this, Taylor?

282
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
What’s going on?

283
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,900
The money’s part of
a Fed operation.

284
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,100
I want my cut.

285
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,200
-Wanna get cut?
-Lay off him.

286
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,300
-Get off me.
-Everybody chill out.

287
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,100
I’m not going to prison.

288
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,600
-I wanna get my cut.
-Shut the fuck up.

289
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,500
They’re all marked.
We can’t pass them.

290
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,100
-We’ll have to clean them.
-Where’re we gonna clean them?

291
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,600
A guy I worked with before,
but it’s gonna cost. Heavy.

292
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,600
-Real heavy.
-Shit.

293
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,100
Is Nikita around?

294
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,500
Nikita, it’s for you.

295
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,400
Good morning.
My name is Jose.

296
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,500
-I sell oranges.
-This is a prayer meeting.

297
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,500
-I say my name is Jose.
-Jose, fuck off.

298
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,200
-Goodbye.
-We’re in a meeting.

299
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,500
You’re back from Siberia.

300
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I knew you’d come to see me.

301
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,200
I appreciate what you did.

302
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,600
I have a surprise for you,
I’ve been planning for a year.

303
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,600
-Do I need more surprises?
-I timed it perfectly.

304
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,500
-Where can we talk?
-Here.

305
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,000
Anything you have to say
can be said in front of them.

306
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
My Russian brothers. After what
Russia did for my Cuba.

307
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,400
I need to clean two million
marked bills.

308
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Not the big money.
They’ll want a rise.

309
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Back to work.
Come in here.

310
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,900
The Karamazov Brothers.
They can hear this.

311
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,900
Two million?

312
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,600
-Why didn’t you include me?
-You know why.

313
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,500
But you trust me
to clean your money.

314
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Trust has nothing to
do with it.

315
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Every time I want
to do something...

316
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,900
0ne minute, okay? Please.

317
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,500
Remember him?
The one with the big mouth.

318
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,600
0pen your mouth.

319
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
0pen like it was.
This is your surprise.

320
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
But you’re the one
who wanted to kill him.

321
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,900
You get me!

322
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,900
It’s not your surprise,
it’s everyone’s surprise.

323
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,300
Today’s my birthday. I want
to share the cake with everyone.

324
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,400
Remember me? You called me
wetback in my face, remember?

325
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
-I’m sorry.
-It’s too late.

326
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,000
Who’s a wetback? See this?
It’s an American passport.

327
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,100
Who the fuck is a wetback?
Wetback?

328
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,400
No problem. I’ll dry you off.

329
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,700
You’re still wet. No problem.

330
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Look at this fucking suit.
The sleeve is shrinking.

331
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,800
See here? Dry clean only.
And I launder his suit!

332
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,500
I could lose my business.
What am I gonna do?

333
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,300
Alteration. No problem.
It will look like new.

334
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Your sleeve is gonna fit
in no time.

335
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,200
What are you doing?

336
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Russian handshake.
I’m famous for this.

337
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,700
Care for a souvenir?
Take one, put in the fireplace.

338
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,500
See you around.

339
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,600
-I give you dime on the dollar.
-It’s thirty across the boarder.

340
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,400
We’re talking
a lot of money!

341
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,500
That’s the deal.
Take it or leave it.

342
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,900
Let’s shake on it.

343
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,000
Bring me the big one.
He has big hands.

344
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,600
-Thirty cents on the buck.
-What? That price?

345
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Not bad for money marked
by the FBl.

346
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Thirty on the buck? I got
a quarter of two mill coming.

347
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,000
There’s five of us. Don’t count
Virginia and me as one.

348
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
-Why not? You’re fucking her.
-And she’s loving it.

349
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,300
-Shut up!
-There’s five even slices.

350
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,800
At thirty cents? I worked
too hard for 150 grand.

351
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,700
$125 grand.

352
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,400
-Fuck that!
-No, it’s a good deal.

353
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,700
-I’m in. When?
-At least another day.

354
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,700
-What do I do until then?
-The usual. Whack off.

355
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,100
-Stay out of trouble.
-Who holds the money?

356
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,200
I’m going nowhere
until I get my cut.

357
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,600
He’ll spend it,
they’ll catch us.

358
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,900
-Shut up.
-The money will stay together.

359
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,800
I’ll hold it, 0K?

360
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,400
-That’s a great idea.
-We should hide it.

361
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,400
In a bus station,
in one of the lockers.

362
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,400
Good idea.

363
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,500
-Is that what we’ll do?
-Not exactly.

364
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,700
Bus station?

365
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,700
My name is Jose.
I sell oranges for money.

366
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,900
What do you want?

367
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,100
Give me your money.

368
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,100
Come on.

369
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,400
My name is Jose.

370
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,200
I sell oranges for money.
Son of a bitch!

371
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,700
The package stays in a P0 box
until we can get it out.

372
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,600
-We need a fake I.D.
-I got it.

373
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,100
We’ll use mine.

374
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,900
-I don’t get it.
-What a surprise.

375
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,800
I’ll rent a P0 box
and mail this package.

376
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,400
He’ll mail it to his fake l.D.
and wait to get it out.

377
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,900
You will get it?
Can anybody get it?

378
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,700
Will you rip off a post office?
This place is open 24 hours!

379
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,500
Thousands of packages, people,
are you gonna kill everybody?

380
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,700
Taylor has the only key?

381
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,500
I don’t trust you with
the only key. Do you, guys?

382
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,300
You got a better idea?

383
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,400
Camp out and watch the place
for the next 20 hours.

384
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,100
Bring your vaseline and spend
the night staking out.

385
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,000
Exactly what I’ll do.

386
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,500
-Will you mail to this office?
-Writing a fucking book?

387
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,600
Just mail it.

388
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,800
-I’m watching you.
-I’m watching you, too.

389
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Nobody’s gonna camp
out here, 0K?

390
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
We’ll meet here
tomorrow at noon. Got it?

391
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Stay invisible until then.

392
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,700
-Not exactly how I thought.
-Not exactly.

393
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,500
-Twelve o’clock tomorrow.
-Geez.

394
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
Wake up.

395
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,300
-Wake up.
-Paige, let her sleep.

396
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,600
What’s wrong?
Did you get the money?

397
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Two million.

398
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I had it in my hands.

399
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,000
What do you mean?
Did you get it or not?

400
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
I got it.

401
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,200
-Where is it?
-Hidden.

402
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,500
Why?

403
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,600
It’s marked. FBI money,
we can’t spend it.

404
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,100
Let me guess.
You’ve seen Nikita.

405
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,700
How much do we get?

406
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,800
Thirty percent.

407
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Works out to $125 grand.

408
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
Jesus!

409
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,100
Nikita, the FBl...
All this for $125 grand?

410
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,300
You know where it is?

411
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,900
Let’s go get all of it.

412
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,900
-What about the others?
-What about them?

413
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,400
They’d take it if they could.

414
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,900
You can’t trust them,
let’s get it for us.

415
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
-I can’t do that.
-Why not?

416
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,500
You told me to pack my bags.

417
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,900
I’m ready to go, let’s go!

418
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,000
I thought you would get us
out of here. Nothing even works.

419
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,200
-I can’t stay anymore.
-It’s 0K, we can stay longer.

420
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
That’s what I get for
wiping your nose last year.

421
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I understand.

422
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,900
You have your daughter.
You two together...

423
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I don’t fit in here.

424
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
You should fix that faucet.

425
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,900
What are you doing here?
I’ve hired another girl.

426
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,800
I’m not here to work.
A vodka, straight up, no ice.

427
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
You don’t look good.
What’s wrong?

428
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,500
I’m fine. Make it double.

429
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Are you working
the day shift?

430
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
A little early for vodka.

431
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,800
It’s not your fucking
business, is it?

432
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,800
It’s for you.

433
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,900
Hello?

434
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,300
What did you do at school?

435
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,800
I did Math,
but that’s just boring.

436
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,800
I always hated Math.

437
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,300
What did you do
when you were away?

438
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,400
I thought about you,
Paige, about life in general.

439
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Ever think about mommy?

440
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,700
All the time.

441
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,700
She was a beautiful lady.

442
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,600
I miss her everyday.

443
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,100
Paige took good care of me.

444
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,500
But she’s so young.

445
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,900
I’m glad you like her.
Do you want a soda?

446
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,600
-Two sodas.
-Sure.

447
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,900
Sorry I couldn’t be there
for you.

448
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,800
It’s 0K, I’m not stupid.
I know you were in jail.

449
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,700
And I know you want us out
of the trailer park.

450
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,900
I’m afraid of
how you will do it.

451
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,900
-What are you talking about?
-Come on, daddy.

452
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I know you’re up to something.

453
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,900
I just don’t know what.

454
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,100
-You can’t do that.
-Why not? ‘Cause it’s stealing?

455
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,300
Let’s get aseat.

456
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,000
Right here.

457
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,200
Listen, I want you
to know something.

458
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,300
I can’t live like this.

459
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
I’m afraid you go back to jail.

460
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,200
My daddy being a thief!
I don’t want money you stole.

461
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Promise you won’t go back.

462
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,800
-Listen...
-Promise me.

463
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,300
-I promise.
-Thank you.

464
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,300
Megan!
Come on over!

465
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,600
Sweety, go play with
Darone and Arie, 0K?

466
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
0K, dad.

467
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,100
0utside. Now!

468
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I told you to stay away.
I got a kid.

469
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,800
Relax, I told no one
where you live...

470
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,500
and that you have a kid.

471
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,100
-What do you want?
-My money.

472
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,700
I started cutting my CD
and now I’m broke.

473
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,900
My producers are getting itchy
and they’re gonna fuck me up.

474
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,400
-I need my money today.
-Tomorrow you’ll have plenty.

475
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,200
I need you to get out of here.
Please.

476
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,200
Hi, Dad.

477
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,000
Sorry about that.
I told him to stay away.

478
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,800
But he came anyway.
Soon they’ll all be here.

479
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,100
God!

480
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,200
-What’s wrong?
-I have a bad feeling about it.

481
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,300
Can we get out of here?
Take off and forget about this.

482
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,000
You wanted all the cash and
now you want to take off?

483
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,500
It’s too dangerous.

484
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,100
-Let’s drop it.
-I’m right in the middle of it.

485
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,300
Give me one more day.

486
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,300
Let’s do it.

487
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,000
I wanna pick up this package.

488
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,200
-No, the one by your feet.
-Relax, ass mouth.

489
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,600
Down there!

490
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,400
Let’s go to your place.

491
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
Let’s go.

492
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,800
I love what you did with
the place. It’s like grandma’s.

493
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Virginia decorated it.

494
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,400
-Your bunny collection!
-I like my bunnies.

495
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,200
-What the fuck is that?
-Relax, it’s the cleaner.

496
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,700
I bring detergent.

497
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,600
-So fresh, so clean.
-Looks good.

498
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,400
0f course it’s good.
Everything is always good.

499
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,500
What is this? Planning to track
your two million?

500
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,300
You come back later
and rip me off?

501
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,000
In case you get greedy
and decide to rip me off.

502
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,500
No need for this, we’re friends,
we have trust.

503
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,500
Look at this. Everyone!

504
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,900
Man, woman, black, white...

505
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,300
so much diversity! Unity!

506
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,400
What is it
that keep us together?

507
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,100
The money.

508
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,200
The magic word.

509
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,200
Fuck! What is this shit?
No cash, no nothing!

510
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,100
That’s why I hate
fucking with you.

511
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
What are you trying to pull?

512
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,800
What’s going on?

513
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,600
Who fucking took it?
You did!

514
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
What were you doing
at the post office?

515
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,900
I saw you there.

516
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:05,100
-Are you saying it’s my fault?
-Yes! Where is the money?

517
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,200
I’m confused, and when
I’m confused people get hurt!

518
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,200
-What is going on?
-What is that?

519
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,500
-Are you playing games?
-Let me see.

520
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,300
-What is this?
-Butch.

521
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,100
-He pulled his gun on me.
-You shot my ear!

522
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,300
-I want my money.
-Did you see this?

523
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,900
Were you planning to
to fuck off with her?

524
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800
You!

525
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,600
-I want some answers now.
-Don’t touch me.

526
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,600
I leave here with two million
or with your head.

527
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,100
-Expecting a call?
-Are you expecting a call?

528
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,800
-It’s one of his whores.
-Answer the damn phone!

529
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,800
Fuck.

530
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Hello.

531
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,400
It’s for you.

532
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,200
Be smart.

533
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,700
I’m listening.

534
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,200
I’m on my way.

535
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,200
What are you doing?

536
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,600
Don’t shoot.
He knows where the money is.

537
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,500
-Give me the fucking hand.
-Fuck you! I’ll get out of here.

538
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,700
-Come on!
-Go!

539
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,400
He shoot me. He shoot me.

540
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,000
When I get Taylor, he’s dead.
Steals my gun and pulls this!

541
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,600
Leave me alone.

542
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,200
-Don’t touch me, you cheap...
-Shut up!

543
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
You fucking bitch!

544
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,700
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

545
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,100
-We’re losing him.
-I’m not losing him!

546
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,100
Would you relax?
We’ll go to his house!

547
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,300
And where’s that?
Where the fuck does he live?

548
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,500
Rock knows.

549
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,300
I don’t know. He contacted me,
same as you. Don’t give me that!

550
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,200
Don’t lose him.
Watch out!

551
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,000


552
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,000
Fucker! Pull over!

553
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,800
-Fuck.
-Shit.

554
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,400
Look out, Eddie.

555
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,500
Fuck.

556
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,100
We should be after the other guy
with the real money.

557
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,700
You fucked up,
you can’t do shit right.

558
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,400
Come on.

559
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,100
Move this asshole!
Go around him! Around him!

560
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,700
If we don’t get the money,
we’re all dead!

561
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,600
Taylor, you’re dead,
you hear me?

562
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,400
You earned a free alteration
in my shop.

563
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,800
-Three times in a row.
-Megan!

564
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,600
-Can you hear me?
-I don’t know how...

565
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,700
but I know you’re doing it.

566
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,100
My friend will take you
to your daddy now.

567
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,200
Great.

568
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,100
Or not.

569
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,100
I know what you’re thinking.
Don’t think it.

570
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Hundreds of hotel rooms here.
She could be anywhere.

571
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,700
A very smart daughter you got.
She is very smart.

572
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,500
She won every hand.

573
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,600
-Are you gonna say anything?
-If you hurt her, I’ll kill you.

574
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,700
-Relax, we’re gonna be friends.
-Who the hell are you?

575
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,700
You don’t remember me?

576
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,900
Mark Cornell?

577
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,000
-FBl.
-That’s right.

578
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,900
You were at the OTB.
What do you want?

579
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,000
Your talent.

580
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,900
When you stole my money,
everything became clear to me.

581
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,500
What do you mean, your money?

582
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,300
I was gonna launder it a bit
and make money on the side.

583
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,900
And then you steal it!
You ruined my life.

584
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,300
The worst thing became
the best thing! We’re partners.

585
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,700
You’re kidding me.

586
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,000
No, never more serious.

587
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,600
I was tracking you down...

588
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,600
your name came up under
the smart guys. You’re good.

589
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,000
You’re perfect.

590
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,300
I know you smoke...

591
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,500
so I got you some, they’re
on the counter, help yourself.

592
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,300
-I don’t do that anymore.
-You quit?

593
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,700
I know they’re killers.

594
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,800
-How did you do it? The patch?
-What the hell do you want?

595
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,800
Every night, a boat comes into
the docks...

596
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
with the Atlantic City
casinos’ profits.

597
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,600


598
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,000
It’s gonna be six million
totally untraceable.

599
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,800
I deliver you the money,
and I get my kid back?

600
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,000
You’re a good thief.

601
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
I respect you.

602
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,400
It’s the beginning of a long
and prosperous future together.

603
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,400
You kidnapped my daughter.
I can’t see a bright future.

604
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,500
That’s just a formality.

605
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Prove yourself trustworthy and
she’ll be with you on Saturday.

606
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,300
It’s up to you,
but this is perfect.

607
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,600
I’ve got the contacts, can’t get
busted. Secure information.

608
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,900
You do the heist, I set up
the gigs, split it 50/50.

609
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,600
You will be able to buy her
whatever she wants.

610
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,800
-50/50 is fair, isn’t it?
-I can’t do this job alone.

611
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,400
-Your crew? Whatever you want.
-They won’t do it.

612
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,900
The stuff in the envelope
will help convince them.

613
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,200
Is this money from the heist?

614
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,500
-How did you get it back?
-It’s what I do. Surveillance.

615
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,500
I’m not gonna take it.
It’s too risky.

616
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,300
Listen...

617
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,600
just give me back my kid.
You don’t need her, you got me.

618
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,700
I’m gonna do the job. I can’t
do it unless I know she’s safe.

619
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,100
I’ll be in touch.

620
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,600
Stay with the money.

621
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,200
Stupid.

622
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,700
Stupid, stupid.

623
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,800
What do you think you’re doing?
Get Megan on the phone.

624
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,100
Put her on the phone.
Here.

625
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,000
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

626
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,100
I’m being a nice guy and
letting you say goodbye to her.

627
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,700
Don’t do that, you don’t have
to kill her. I’ll do the job.

628
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,000
-Please.
-Hang on.

629
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,000
You start
a partnership like this?

630
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,600
-I’m sorry.
-Are you?

631
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,800
Very, very sorry.

632
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,500
I’m disappointed.

633
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,800
Call you back.

634
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,300
I went to pick up Megan
from school, she wasn’t there.

635
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,300
-She’s missing.
-I know.

636
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,100
Are you okay?

637
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,800
Tell me nothing
is gonna happen to her.

638
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,500
Tell me.

639
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,800
0k, let’s go!

640
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,000
0ver here.

641
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,500
My God.

642
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,200
You scared the shit out
of me. Do you want a beer?

643
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,300
Got it all figured out?
How are you doing?

644
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,500
-Just great.
-You look worried.

645
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,400
You got a plan?
And the guys with the guns?

646
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,400
You got enough guys?
And your crew?

647
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,200
-Maybe you’re not so smart.
-I got it all figured out.

648
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,200
Megan asks about you
all the time.

649
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,800
A said you’re on a trip,
working hard...

650
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,300
but might be away
for a long time.

651
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,800
I can’t forget about you trying
to follow me at the hotel.

652
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,300
That wasn’t smart.
And I have to trust you.

653
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,500
I can’t be up all night
thinking about this.

654
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,400
I’m no good without sleep.
I could do anything like...

655
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,000
What are you like?

656
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,100
-Not good.
-I’m like a mush.

657
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,500
Like... Like a mush man.

658
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,000
Sleep easy.

659
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,100
-This won’t be a problem.
-Great. I feel better already.

660
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,900
My man, Taylor.
Here’s the next time and place.

661
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,500
Smoke?

662
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,000
Wanna get a beer? No, I can’t.
There’s no one watching Megan.

663
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,400
-Any message?
-Just tell her I love her.

664
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,300
I’ll tell her you said hi.

665
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,600
She better be there,
you son of a bitch.

666
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,100
It’s Taylor.

667
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,100
I need you, my friend.
In my contingency plan.

668
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,200
I know your price.

669
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,300
Jesus.

670
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,900
Paige?

671
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,400
-Are you hurt?
-He thought we had the money.

672
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,900
You did this?

673
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,800
He attacked me,
and I screamed...

674
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,400
no one heard me
so I started swinging...

675
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,300
Get yourself cleaned up.
We’re out of here now!

676
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,300
Come on.

677
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,800
Hurry up.

678
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,900
Jesus!
You scared the hell out of me.

679
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,000
Why are you up so early?
What’s that?

680
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,700
Just a little trash, that’s all.

681
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,100
-Sorry for the noise last night.
-I heard no noise.

682
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,200
What are you doing?
Going somewhere?

683
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,400
We’ll take a short vacation.
We’ll be back soon.

684
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,900
Paige! Get in the car!

685
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,900
-We gotta go! Come on.
-Why?

686
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,200
-What?
-Nikita.

687
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,000
There he is
and here we are.

688
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,000
My fucking shoulder.

689
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,400
Congratulations, Taylor.
You’ll get a cheap laundry...

690
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,100
and a quick alteration.

691
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,500
-Where?
-This is it.

692
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,900
Hold on.

693
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,100
Watch out for the lake!
Come on!

694
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,900
What are you doing?
Let’s get out of here!

695
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,800
You fucking stupid!

696
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,300
You mother fucker.

697
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,500
Answer the phone.

698
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,800
-You got a good driver.
-Do you think it’s funny?

699
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,600
Relax, I’ll make this up to you.
You’ll get the two million.

700
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,600
I need you to be
my contingency plan.

701
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,500
-Your contingency plan?
-I’ll be in touch.

702
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,900
I’m gonna cut
your balls off.

703
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,900
Thanks for finally calling.

704
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,300
-Did you bring my money?
-Where’s our money?

705
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,400
I brought you a message and
I want to give you your gun.

706
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,800
-Where is my two mill?
-What the fuck is this mess?

707
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,800
FBI guys, on their own.
They tracked us down.

708
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,500
Why?

709
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,900
They were laundering money
and we screwed it up.

710
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,800
Remember the counter boss?
He had a heart attack.

711
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,100
The autopsy connected
the death to the robbery.

712
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,900
What does it mean?

713
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,000
A report hasn’t been filed.
We aren’t wanted for murder.

714
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,700
-Yet.
-What?

715
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,900
-Felony murder rule.
-They want us to pull a job.

716
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,400
-Six million.
-No fucking way.

717
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,300
This is bullshit, brother.

718
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,200
Let’s take off.

719
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,200
Let’s run to Mexico.
We’ll get married.

720
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,800
-I want my fucking money.
-Listen...

721
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,300
These are dirty FBI guys.
If we don’t do this...

722
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,300
they’ll track us down
one by one.

723
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,400
I’m not gonna get arrested.

724
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,400
They might not want
to arrest you.

725
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,300
Holy shit.

726
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,100
It’s Rock.

727
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,600
My God.

728
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,900
We get one shot,
let’s get it right.

729
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,700
Butch, go to the empty repair
shop by the docks...

730
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,200
and get me a cheap arc welder.
This is the last of my cash.

731
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,900
Virginia, buy a sexy outfit.

732
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,900
-Short skirt.
-Shorter than usual?

733
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,500
I’ll meet you at the post office
around eleven.

734
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,700
-I’ll tell you the rest there.
-And what do I do?

735
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,700
Do what you normally do.
Whack off.

736
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,900
-I’m serious. What do I do?
-Do what you normally do.

737
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,400
What do you think
of his story?

738
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,700
Is he telling the truth?

739
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,500
Those FBI guys?
I think he’s lying.

740
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,000
It’s dangerous. I don’t want
them to know you two exist.

741
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,900
Hand me my vest.

742
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,600
Who gives a shit?

743
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,300
We’re gonna jack that money
and give it to the Feds?

744
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,700
I don’t think so. We’re gonna
keep it for ourselves.

745
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,200
Just me and you,
me and you.

746
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,900
-Me and you.
-Six million dollars!

747
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,900
Who’s the little brother now?
Who’s the little brother?

748
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,300
Wait here,
I’ll be back soon.

749
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,400
Be careful.

750
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,700
Let’s go, boys.

751
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,000
-Evening, ma’am.
-Thank the Lord it’s the 5-0.

752
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,300
Howdy y’all?

753
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,700
How did I end up
at the water again?

754
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,400
You have to move your car
out of the way.

755
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,900
0k, but could you tell me
where I can find Hershey.

756
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,400
I don’t know where it is.
You have to move your car.

757
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,900
-I will, but...
-You have to move your car.

758
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,600
Watch out!

759
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,500
We gotta help them.

760
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,300
Give me your hand.

761
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,100
Butch, is that you?

762
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,700
Yeah, baby, it’s your Butch.

763
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,500
Look at you.
Look a little surprised.

764
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,000
You were expecting Eddie?

765
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,900
Double-crossing bitch.

766
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,700
Suck on it.

767
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
At least your brother
could deliver.

768
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,900
The only testosterone you had
was from the steroids you take.

769
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,400
-I said to stay at the motel.
-She is like my daughter too.

770
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,100
I can’t sit around and wait
for something to happen.

771
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,100
How did you find me?

772
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,300
A boat rental receit
in your wallet.

773
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,600
Catch.

774
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,900
Thanks.

775
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,600
Thanks for saving me.

776
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,500
I told you
you couldn’t trust them.

777
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,000
How about you?

778
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,200
What do you mean?

779
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,200
The old lady didn’t hear
anything the night Rock died.

780
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:19,100
-Tell me what happened.
-Cornell’s guy killed Rock.

781
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,500
-Why did you lie?
-I didn’t know what to do.

782
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:28,300
Cornell said that if I didn’t
show him where the money was...

783
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,100
he was gonna send you to jail.

784
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,300
I had to work with him.

785
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,900
So Rock told you which P0 box
and you told Cornell?

786
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,100
I figured that
he would leave us alone.

787
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,100
I was stupid to think
he would go away.

788
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,100
You’ve never been stupid.

789
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,800
You’re saying I’m into this
for the money?

790
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,500
I don’t know
what to think anymore.

791
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,200
Take the wheel.

792
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,000
I screwed up and I can
make it up. I know how.

793
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:12,100
There’s his boat. You hide
and I take the money onboard.

794
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,300
I’m not gonna let you get
near this money!

795
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,600
Move. Go on.

796
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,100
-You have to trust me.
-Right.

797
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,500
Wave to your daddy.

798
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,200
-Ahoy, there!
-Daddy!

799
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
Daddy!

800
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,400
It’s 0K, sweetie.
Are you alright?

801
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,400
Move her back inside.

802
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,300
Let me go.

803
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,800
Daddy!

804
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,800
Daddy!
Daddy, help!

805
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,000
Give me a hand. I got
the money. Where’s my daughter?

806
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,800
-Leave the money. You come up.
-We had a deal.

807
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,700
Now we got a new one.

808
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,700
We don’t have all night.

809
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,800
Stay in the boat,
I’ll be there in a minute.

810
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,400
Go in the back
and take a look-see.

811
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,100
Daddy.

812
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,200
Daddy, help me!
Daddy, help me!

813
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,900
It’s 0K, I’m gonna
get you out of there.

814
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,900
Actually it’s not.

815
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,200
There’s enough explosive
to blow up a battleship.

816
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,800
And this remote gives me 90 secs
to enjoy the fireworks.

817
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,500
-Jesus.
-Did you check the money?

818
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,900
I hate boats.

819
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,500
-Don’t do this.
-You’re doing it.

820
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,300
I like you.

821
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,300
I can’t trust you.

822
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,900
And I got a new partner
I can trust.

823
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,300
What the fuck is this?

824
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,800
-It’s the contingency plan.
-You little shit.

825
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,100
Daddy!

826
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,300
Shoot him.

827
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,900
You don’t believe it,
but I waited for you.

828
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,100
Do you think I’d work
with a lunatic like this?

829
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,600
Lunatic?

830
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,300
-What is it with you two?
-Give me the remote.

831
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,800
Don’t make me shoot you.

832
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,500
I was looking forward
to working with you.

833
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,600
Shoot him.

834
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,500
Shoot him!

835
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:20,800
Blanks. Do you think
I’d give you a loaded gun?

836
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,100
Do I look like an idiot?

837
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,600
Get away from the boat! Swim!

838
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,100
-Don’t!
-Daddy!

839
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,100
Stay away from that thing.
Don’t touch it.

840
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,300
-Help me!
-Maybe I ran over with your girlfriend.

841
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,300
-Cornell, give me the key.
-I don’t think so.

842
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,000
Don’t bother trying to break in.
The cabin’s secured.

843
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,600
Come on,
pull on the door.

844
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,100
Pull, alright?
You can do this.

845
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,900
Just pull on the door.

846
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:11,500
-Give me one of those things.
-I knew you couldn’t quit.

847
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,300
Careful,
those things are killers.

848
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
It’s late to worry
about my health.

849
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,500
-You’re right.
-What’s that?

850
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,800
These things are killers.

851
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,900
Daddy!

852
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,900
Find something there to help me
jimmy this lock.

853
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,300
Go on, keep looking.

854
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
Anything you can find.

855
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,300
Don’t touch the bomb! Jesus!

856
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,300
Anything on you?
ln your purse?

857
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,500
Look, quick!

858
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,400
-My cards.
-Slip them through here.

859
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,300
Through the door.

860
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Daddy, hurry!

861
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,400
Let’s go!

862
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,900
Daddy!

863
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,500
-Sweetie, are you 0K?
-I’m really so cold.

864
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,700
We’re gonna get out of here.

865
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,700
-0ver here.
-What are you doing?

866
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,300
Right here!

867
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,900
Damn you, Taylor.

868
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,000
I’ll keep you above water.
Just kick your feet.

869
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,600
-Here we go.
-Be careful.

870
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,200
Grab her hands.

871
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,200
Pull her up. That’s it.

872
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,900
-Wrap her up in this.
-You’re all right.

873
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,200
Taylor, over here.

874
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,400
There’s Atilla.
Head over to him.

875
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,400
-Take me.
-You got him?

876
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,200
Now you got me.
Work me over, baby.

877
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,700
I’ll keep track of you.

878
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,800


879
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,800
I didn’t know...

880
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,100
He said you sent him
to pick me up.

881
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,100
It’s all right.

882
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,700
I’m sorry I got you
involved in this.

883
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,400
Nice.

884
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,800
Very nice.

885
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,800
What is this?
Where’s the money?

886
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,400
-This is shredded paper.
-No sweat, it’s safe.

887
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,200
-You couldn’t be near the money.
-I almost took off!

888
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,800
But you didn’t.
You came back for us.

889
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,500
I know it’s heartbreaking,
but that’s my price.

890
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,700
-That’s your cut.
-Come on, baby.

891
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,800
Pile on another bundle.
You know the shit’s wet.

892
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,800
And so are you.

893
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,400
You bet I am.
You got me all horny.

894
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,600
-Come here and warm me up.
-You little shit.

895
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,000
Throw on another for him.

896
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,500
-That’s it.
-Thanks, sweetie.

897
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,500
You feel good.

898
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,600
Thank God.

899
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,100
-Now we’re square. Thanks.
-Absolutely.

900
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,400


901
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,700
So long’s right.

902
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,400
Look at this money!
So much!

903
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,900
What are we gonna do?

904
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,700
-What are you doing?
-Stolen money.

905
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,900
-We could have kept some.
-We gotta let it go.

906
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,000
We could have used that.

907
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,300
It nearly cost me
everything I care about.

908
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,400
I promised her.

909
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,800
We’re gonna be 0K.

910
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,700
Jesus! Who the fuck are you?

911
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,400
The contingency plan.
I see you have the two mill.

912
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,200
Two million? No.

913
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,400
Your suit is wet,
that’s a big problem.

914
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,000
I happen to be
in the laundry business.

915
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,500
We’ll make quick alteration.
No problem.

916
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,500
Jesus Christ!

917
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,100
Do you want one?

918
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,700
Here.

919
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,500
Lighter.

920
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,900
Do you know why I love you?

921
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,200
-Why?
-You bring out the best in me.

922
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,900
Do you have any idea...

923
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,200
what we’re gonna do in Canada?

924
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,000
What are we gonna do?

925
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,300
Tell me.
Come on, Daddy.

926
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,100
I gotta make us some money.

927
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,800
Fast.

928
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,900
Good morning.

929
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,300
My name is Jose.

930
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,900
Fucking Mexican.

931
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,700
Dicks...

932
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,800
my name is Jose
and I kill people for money.

933
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:34,500
Jose, there’s no need
to kill us. We are friends.

934
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,900
Friends?

935
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,700
Good.

936
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,500
Then I kill you for nothing.
