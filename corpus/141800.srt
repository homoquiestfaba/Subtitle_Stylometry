1
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,414
Here it is!

2
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,250
Thanks.

3
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,251
Did you guys sign it?

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,107
Did you sign the card?

5
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,848
And five and four and...

6
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,317
Hey, girls, sign!

7
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,022
All right! Here you go!

8
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,937
- Elle's gonna love it!
- Thanks.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,031
You go, girl!

10
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,266
Hi, girls! Here, sign!

11
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,333
Thanks!

12
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,839
There she is.

13
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,368
Thank you.

14
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,748
I love that restaurant!

15
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,381
I heard Madonna
went into labor there.

16
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,824
Oh, gosh!
I have to go shopping!

17
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,590
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

18
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,722
Bruiser, what's this?

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,694
"Good luck tonight.
Elle and Warner forever."

20
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,933
Oh, that's so cute.

21
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,719
Oh, my gosh!
You guys are so sweet!

22
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,387
But I'm not positive
it'll happen tonight.

23
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,897
Hello! He just had lunch
with his grandmother.

24
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,228
You know he got the rock.

25
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,200
Why else would she have flown in
from Newport?

26
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,999
It's not like she'd Fed Ex
a six-carat diamond.

27
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,163
Do you really think?

28
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,799
I can't believe
you're getting engaged!

29
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,468
Oh, my gosh...

30
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,205
you guys have to help me
pick out the perfect outfit.

31
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,146
Come on!

32
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,910
I think you should go
with the red.

33
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,439
It's the color of confidence.

34
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,577
I don't understand
why you're disregarding...

35
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,917
your signature color.

36
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,185
He's proposing. I can't look
like I would on any other date.

37
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,955
This is the date...
the night I'll always remember.

38
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,589
I want to look special.

39
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,098
Bridal.

40
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,793
But not like I expect anything.

41
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,165
There's nothing I love more...

42
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,727
than a dumb blonde
with daddy's plastic.

43
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,571
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

44
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,936
Is this low-viscosity rayon?

45
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,469
Yes. Of course.

46
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,175
With a half-loop
top-stitching on the hem?

47
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,946
Absolutely. It's one of a kind.

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,948
It's impossible to use
a half-loop top-stitching...

49
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,321
on low-viscosity rayon.
It would snag the fabric.

50
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,451
And you didn't just get it in.

51
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,018
I saw it in the June Vogue
a year ago.

52
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,462
So if you're trying to sell it
for full price...

53
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,125
you picked the wrong girl.

54
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,599
Girls, this is it.

55
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,006
In a few hours...

56
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,308
I'll be the future
Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

57
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,934
Wow. You look so beautiful.

58
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,675
So do you.

59
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,455
Let's get out of here.

60
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,970
Must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

61
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,273
God, you're so wonderful.
Elle, thank you.

62
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,012
Here's to us.

63
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:32,352
To us.

64
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,132
One of the reasons I wanted
to come here tonight...

65
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,103
was to discuss our future.

66
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:50,733
And I am fully amenable
to that discussion.

67
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,538
Good. You know how
we've been having...

68
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,841
all kinds of fun lately?

69
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,609
Well, Harvard
is gonna be different.

70
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:00,708
Law school is
a completely different world...

71
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,743
and I need to be serious.

72
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:03,981
Of course.

73
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:07,422
My family expects a lot from me.

74
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,052
- Right.
- I expect a lot from me.

75
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,255
I plan on running
for office someday.

76
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:14,890
I fully support that.
You know that.

77
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:16,900
Absolutely.
But the thing is...

78
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:20,131
if I'm going to be a senator
by the time I'm thirty...

79
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,230
I need to stop dicking around.

80
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:26,471
Warner, I completely agree.

81
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,610
That's why I think
it's time for us...

82
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:33,481
Elle, pooh bear...

83
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,316
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

84
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,991
What?

85
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,758
I've been thinking,
and it's the right thing to do.

86
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,062
You're breaking up with me?

87
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,962
I thought you were proposing.

88
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,903
Proposing?

89
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:56,907
Elle, if I'm going to be
a senator...

90
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:00,775
I need to marry a Jackie,
not a Marilyn.

91
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:04,441
You're breaking up with me
because I'm too blonde?

92
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,882
No. That's not entirely true.

93
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,216
Then what?
My boobs are too big?

94
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:12,222
Elle, your boobs are fine.

95
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:14,622
So when you said
that you would always love me...

96
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,320
you were just dicking around?

97
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,885
Elle, I do love you.

98
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,694
I just can't marry you.

99
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:24,565
You have no idea
of the pressure that I am under.

100
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,729
My family has
five generations of senators.

101
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,331
My brother's in the top three
at Yale Law.

102
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:32,035
He just got engaged to
a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.

103
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:45,579
Bad salad.

104
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:49,185
Sweetie...

105
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,558
Pooh bear?

106
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,193
It's not like I have a choice
here, sweetheart!

107
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,303
You get the car,
I'll get the check.

108
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,238
I won't be having the salad.

109
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,671
Let me take you home.

110
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,448
Elle, believe me.
I never expected to do this...

111
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,852
but I think
it's the right thing.

112
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,188
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

113
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,216
I have to think of my future...

114
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,058
and what my family expects
of me.

115
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,427
So you're breaking up with me...

116
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,955
because you're afraid
your family won't like me?

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,059
Everybody likes me.

118
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,070
East Coast people are different.

119
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:36,164
Because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly I'm white trash?

120
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,970
I grew up in Bel Air!

121
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,738
Across the street
from Aaron Spelling!

122
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,472
Most people would agree
that's a lot better...

123
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:43,707
than some stinky old Vanderbilt!

124
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:47,445
I told you.
I need someone serious.

125
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:51,816
But I'm seriously in love
with you.

126
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:55,924
Isn't that enough?

127
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,895
Pooh bear, just get in the car.

128
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,600
You'll ruin your shoes.

129
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,153
Morning, Amy.

130
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,232
Elle, it's Amy.

131
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,736
I'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

132
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,797
- Sweetie, didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

133
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,469
It's terrible.
He dumped her.

134
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,909
Why me?

135
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,178
Because you're not gonna
remember anything after tonight.

136
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,911
Oh, you're wrong.

137
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:34,683
I will remember, no matter what.

138
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,422
And I'm never gonna lose you
again.

139
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:39,986
You couldn't.

140
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,693
You're a part of me.

141
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,395
I love you.

142
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,400
Liar!

143
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,737
Honey,
you have to leave this room.

144
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:53,335
It's been, like, a week.

145
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:56,141
- So?
- Drink this.

146
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,512
What always makes us
feel better...

147
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,710
no matter what?

148
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,885
She had eight
grilled cheese sandwiches.

149
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,949
She stuffed them
in her mouth all at once.

150
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,585
It was so sad.

151
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,858
We thought she'd be the first
to walk down the aisle...

152
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,297
and now she's totally adrift.

153
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,822
Totally.

154
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:21,268
She hasn't conditioned
her hair in a week.

155
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,569
Maybe she's going
for the grunge look.

156
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:26,007
And her nails
are full-on chipped.

157
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,203
So trailer park.

158
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:42,658
Oh, my God!
Do you know who this is?

159
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:45,821
- That's Warner's older brother!
- Who?

160
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:49,390
"Third year Yale Law student
Putnam Bowes Huntington III...

161
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,732
"and his fiancée
Layne Walker Vanderbilt...

162
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,103
"first year Yale Law."

163
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,976
This is the type of girl
that Warner wants to marry!

164
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,673
This is what I need to become
to be serious!

165
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,308
What?
Practically deformed?

166
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,253
No. A law student.

167
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,661
Law school?

168
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,188
It's a perfectly
respectable place, daddy.

169
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,168
Honey,
you were first runner up...

170
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,636
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics
contest.

171
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,696
Why are you gonna
throw that all away?

172
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,230
Going to Harvard
is the only way...

173
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,038
I'll get
the love of my life back.

174
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,443
Sweetheart,
you don't need law school.

175
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,106
Law school is for people...

176
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,312
who are boring and ugly
and serious.

177
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,616
And you, Button,
are none of those things.

178
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,849
Harvard Law School?

179
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,794
That's right.

180
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,964
But that's a top three school.

181
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,092
Oh, I have a 4.0.

182
00:13:56,134 --> 00:14:00,002
Yes, but your major
is fashion merchandising.

183
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,036
Harvard won't be impressed that
you aced History of Polka Dots.

184
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:10,974
What are your back-ups?

185
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,008
I don't need back-ups.
I'm going to Harvard.

186
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,518
Well, then, you'll need...

187
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,024
excellent recommendations
from your professors.

188
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,924
And a heck
of an admissions essay.

189
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,361
Right.

190
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,357
And at least a 175
on your LSATs.

191
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,368
I once had to judge
a tighty-whitey contest...

192
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,702
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

193
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:37,503
Trust me, I can handle anything.

194
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,242
Thanks!

195
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,011
You're welcome.

196
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,353
Because I have a metrabolism...

197
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:54,085
- I have a really high metrab...
- It's metabol...

198
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,696
Oh, my God.

199
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,392
What are you doing?

200
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,762
Reading about the LSATs.

201
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,600
My cousin had that.

202
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:09,300
Apparently, you get
a really bad rash on your...

203
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:13,203
The LSATs are an exam.

204
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,543
Girls, I'm going to Harvard!

205
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,980
- You mean like on vay-kay?
- Let's all go!

206
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,449
Road trip!

207
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,983
No. I'm going
to Harvard Law School.

208
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,386
Why?

209
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:31,156
Elle, now, I know
you're upset about all this...

210
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,096
but can't you just take
a Percoset?

211
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:38,234
Once Warner sees me
as a serious law student...

212
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,396
he'll totally want me back.

213
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,166
It's a completely brilliant
plan!

214
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,403
But isn't it hard
to get into law school?

215
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,637
I had the highest GPA
in Delta Nu.

216
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,438
Oh, well.
Here, you're gonna need this.

217
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,679
Your scrunchy?

218
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:58,917
My lucky scrunchy.
It helped me pass Spanish.

219
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,517
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya...

220
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,459
a lap dance after the final.

221
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,931
Yeah... luckily.

222
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,738
My name is Elle Woods,
and for my admissions essay...

223
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,746
I'm gonna tell all of you
at Harvard...

224
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,943
why I'm gonna make
an amazing lawyer.

225
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,110
As president of my sorority...

226
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,211
I'm skilled at commanding
the attention of a room...

227
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,188
and discussing
very important issues.

228
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,554
It has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff...

229
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,855
is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin...

230
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,556
to generic.

231
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,689
All those opposed to chafing
please say "aye."

232
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,060
A... neither type of opera...

233
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,968
or neither type of rap
is on sale.

234
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,495
B... neither type of jazz...

235
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,235
and neither type of opera
is on sale.

236
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,574
C... neither type of opera
and neither type of soul...

237
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:58,173
Party!
Delta Nu, we love you!

238
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,222
I'm able to recall
hundreds of important details...

239
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,518
at the drop of a hat.

240
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,617
Hey, Elle,
do you know what happened...

241
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,026
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

242
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,859
Why, yes, Margot, I do.

243
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,627
Once again, we join Hope
in the search for her identity.

244
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,000
As you know, she's been
brainwashed by the evil Stefano.

245
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,738
Get set and go!

246
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,982
One forty-three.

247
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,825
I feel comfortable using
legal jargon in everyday life.

248
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,956
I object!

249
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,311
It's here!

250
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,145
- What?
- It's here!

251
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,947
The LSAT scores! It's here!

252
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,283
Open the scores!

253
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,480
What's the score?

254
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,786
- This is so exciting.
- Tell us!

255
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,988
What is it?

256
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,923
One seventy-nine!

257
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,237
One seventy-nine!

258
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,653
And that's why
you should vote for me...

259
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:48,182
Elle Woods, future lawyer
for the class of 2004.

260
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,331
She does have a 4.0 from CULA...

261
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:00,337
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

262
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,134
A fashion major?

263
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,505
Well, sir,
we've never had one before...

264
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,067
and aren’t we always
looking for diversity?

265
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:10,342
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

266
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,645
She was in a Ricky Martin video.

267
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,517
Clearly,
she's interested in music.

268
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:20,490
She also designed
a line of faux fur panties...

269
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,516
for her sorority's
charity project.

270
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,291
She's a friend to the animals
as well as a philanthropist.

271
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,126
Elle Woods...

272
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,731
welcome to Harvard.

273
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,098
Bruiser, it's so exciting!
Look! Harvard!

274
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,127
Are you excited?

275
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,183
This is our new house
for the next three years.

276
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,243
Are you thirsty?

277
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,551
Let's get you some water.

278
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,387
Sweetheart,
you just look parched.

279
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:04,417
Hey, Brad,
check out Malibu Barbie!

280
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,156
Where's the beach, honey?

281
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,027
Here you go.

282
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:12,263
Good boy. Warner's gonna be
so excited to see you.

283
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,464
Guys, this way.

284
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,496
- This ain't L.A.!
- Come on, Bruiser.

285
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,672
Check her out.
Look at the way she walks.

286
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:23,873
It's gonna be so exciting.

287
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,405
Now, don't be scared.
Everyone will love you.

288
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,621
Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.

289
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,854
Class schedule, map, book list.

290
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,866
Wait a second. My social events
calendar is missing.

291
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,668
Your what?

292
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,699
Social events...
you know, mixers, formals...

293
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,836
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

294
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:01,879
Has Warner Huntington III
checked in yet?

295
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,324
Maybe you should check
with the cruise director...

296
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,882
on the Lido deck.

297
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,789
Welcome to law school.

298
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,891
This is the part where
we go around in a circle...

299
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:20,199
and everyone says a little bit
about themselves.

300
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,704
Let's start with you.

301
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:24,537
My name is David Kidney.

302
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:28,238
I have a masters
in Russian literature...

303
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,939
a Ph. D in biochemistry...

304
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,346
and for the last
eighteen months...

305
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:36,012
I've been deworming orphans
in Somalia.

306
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,681
Awesome. What about you?

307
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,850
Hey. How you doin'?
I'm Enid Wexler.

308
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,883
I got a Ph.D. from Berkeley
in women's studies...

309
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,088
emphasis
in the history of combat...

310
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,826
and last year,
I single-handedly organized...

311
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,096
the march for
Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.

312
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,899
- Killer.
- Thanks. Good times.

313
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:56,030
Aaron Mitchell.

314
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:58,064
I graduated first in my class
from Princeton.

315
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:00,099
I have an I.Q. of 187...

316
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:02,772
and it's been suggested
that Stephen Hawking...

317
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:04,872
stole
his Brief History of Time...

318
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,846
from my fourth grade paper.

319
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:09,182
Cool.

320
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:12,348
- Me?
- Yeah.

321
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:16,951
Hi. I'm Elle Woods
and this is Bruiser Woods...

322
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,224
and we're both
Gemini vegetarians.

323
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:22,357
I have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising...

324
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,732
from CULA, and I was
a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart...

325
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:27,930
president of my sorority,
Delta Nu...

326
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,405
and last year,
I was homecoming queen.

327
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,406
Two weeks ago I saw
Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal...

328
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:35,571
and I talked her
out of buying...

329
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:37,637
this truly heinous
angora sweater.

330
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,912
Whoever said orange was the new
pink was seriously disturbed.

331
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:47,618
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

332
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:50,627
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

333
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:59,494
I totally look the part.

334
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,740
There is no way
she got in here on her own.

335
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,598
I totally forgot you go here.

336
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,041
What are you talking about?

337
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:42,511
I'm sorry.
Are you here to see me?

338
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:45,538
No, silly. I go here.

339
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,106
You go where?

340
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,119
Harvard. Law school.

341
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:53,054
You got into Harvard Law?

342
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,024
What, like it's hard?

343
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:57,390
Oh, my gosh, Warner,
it'll be so great.

344
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,691
I'm planning this great mixer.
You have to help me.

345
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,699
I'm thinking like
a luau or casino night.

346
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:05,566
It'll be just like senior year
except funnier.

347
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:10,064
Time to go.
I have to go to class...

348
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,836
but meet me after
on the benches.

349
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,206
All right, bye!

350
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:34,128
A legal education
means you will learn...

351
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,826
to speak in a new language.

352
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,935
You will be taught
to achieve insight...

353
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,167
into the world around you...

354
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:47,438
and to sharply question
what you know.

355
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:52,147
The seat you have picked
will be yours...

356
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:56,209
for the next nine months
of your life.

357
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:58,016
And those of you
in the front row...

358
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:01,219
beware.

359
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:07,695
"The law is reason
free from passion."

360
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,292
Does anyone know
who spoke those immortal words?

361
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,739
- Yes?
- Aristotle.

362
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,612
Are you sure?

363
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:28,543
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

364
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,285
I think so.

365
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:38,116
What about his life?

366
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,792
I don't know.

367
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:49,067
Well, I recommend
knowing before speaking.

368
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:54,134
The law leaves much room
for interpretation...

369
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:58,113
but very little for self-doubt.

370
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,116
And you were right.

371
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,911
It was Aristotle.

372
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:05,215
Good job.

373
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:10,052
Now, I assume all of you
have read pages 1-48...

374
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:13,323
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

375
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:17,196
Who can tell us about
Gordon vs. Steele?

376
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,225
Let's call on someone
from the hot zone.

377
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:39,287
Elle Woods?

378
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:47,223
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

379
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:01,066
Vivian Kensington.

380
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,103
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

381
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:11,915
I don't.

382
00:28:11,954 --> 00:28:15,890
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class...

383
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,361
and to return
only when she is prepared?

384
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:21,056
Absolutely.

385
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:41,514
Now, Ms. Kensington...

386
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,883
did diversity jurisdiction
exist in this case?

387
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,378
No, it did not.

388
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:51,518
Good. How about in the case
of Owens vs. McCullogh?

389
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,051
I can't believe that girl.

390
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,121
So stupid!

391
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,097
Who does she think she is?

392
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,631
Excuse me. Are you OK?

393
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:13,779
Do they put you on the spot
like that all the time?

394
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:14,942
The professors?

395
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:18,511
They tend to do that.
Socratic method.

396
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:22,650
If you don't know the answers,
they just kick you out?

397
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,158
You have Stromwell, huh?

398
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,559
Yes!
Did she do that to you, too?

399
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:28,654
No.
But she did make me cry once.

400
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:31,222
Not in class. I waited
till I got back to my room...

401
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:33,394
but she'll kick you
right in the ball...

402
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:34,868
Or wherever, you know.

403
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,428
She's really tough.

404
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,441
Great.

405
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,841
Don’t worry, it gets better.
Who else do you have?

406
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:46,974
I have Callahan, Royalton,
and Levinthal.

407
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:49,314
Let's see, speak up
in Callahan's class.

408
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,911
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

409
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:54,616
And in Royalton's class...

410
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:57,251
try to get a seat in the back.

411
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:00,490
He spits when he talks
about products liability.

412
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:04,590
And for Levinthal, make sure
you read the footnotes.

413
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,329
That's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions.

414
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:09,132
Right.

415
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:13,937
Wow.
I'm really glad I met you.

416
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,673
Are you a third year?

417
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:20,147
- Well...
- Hey, Elle.

418
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:24,047
Hi!
Thanks for all your help.

419
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,246
Good luck.

420
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,961
So...

421
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:34,826
how was your first class?

422
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:36,990
It was good, except for
this horrible preppy girl...

423
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:38,897
who made me look bad
in front of the professor.

424
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,629
But no biggie.

425
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,160
You're here now.
So, how was your summer?

426
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,230
Good. It was good.

427
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:47,674
Did you do anything exciting?

428
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,709
Have you met Vivian?

429
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,913
Hi. Vivian Kensington.

430
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:01,153
Do you know her?

431
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,648
- She's...
- I'm his fiancée.

432
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:15,026
I'm sorry.
I just hallucinated. What?

433
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:20,101
She was my girlfriend
in prep school.

434
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:22,667
And, well, we got back together
this summer...

435
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,578
at my grandmother's
birthday party.

436
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,707
Warner told me all about you.

437
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,913
You're famous at our club.

438
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,047
But he didn't tell me
you'd be here.

439
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:37,115
Pooh bear,
I didn't know she would be here.

440
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:41,923
Excuse me.

441
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,209
Oh, thank God!

442
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,624
Are you free?
It's an emergency.

443
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:21,295
Bad day?

444
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:24,464
You can't even imagine.

445
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:28,302
Spill.

446
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:32,211
I worked so hard
to get into law school.

447
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:34,477
I blew off Greek week
to study for the LSATs.

448
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:37,246
I even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

449
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:39,186
All to get
my boyfriend Warner back.

450
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:42,019
And now he's engaged
to this awful girl Vivian...

451
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:44,150
so it was all for nothing,
and I...

452
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:46,889
I just wish...

453
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,864
I just wish
I had never gone to Harvard.

454
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:52,628
After you went
to all that trouble.

455
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:54,192
He's engaged!

456
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:56,397
She's got
the six-carat Harry Winston...

457
00:32:56,438 --> 00:32:58,998
on her bony, unpolished finger.

458
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:04,011
What am I supposed to do?

459
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,514
You're asking the wrong girl.

460
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,812
I mean, I'm with my guy
eight years...

461
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:10,751
and then one day, it's...

462
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:13,448
"I met someone else.
Move out."

463
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:17,016
Oh, no. That's awful.

464
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:20,517
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby Rufus.

465
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:25,858
I didn't even get to throw him
a birthday party.

466
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:30,470
What's a girl to do?

467
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,599
He's a guy
who followed his pecker...

468
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,609
to greener pastures...

469
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:37,669
and I'm a middle-aged
high-school dropout...

470
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,580
who's got stretch marks
and a fat ass.

471
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,846
That's terrible.

472
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:45,547
Yep. Happens every day.

473
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:50,414
So what's this Vivian got
that you don't have?

474
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:51,756
Three tits?

475
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:53,818
She's from Connecticut.

476
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:56,057
She belongs
to his stupid country club.

477
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:57,827
Is she as pretty as you?

478
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:02,102
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights...

479
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:06,096
but she's not completely
unfortunate looking.

480
00:34:07,442 --> 00:34:08,910
Hello, ladies.

481
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:11,705
- Hey, there.
- How you doing? Sign here.

482
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:20,611
Oh, jeez.

483
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:22,555
Look what I did.

484
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,751
- See you later.
- Bye-bye, sugar.

485
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:28,091
Aw, shit.

486
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:31,565
Could I have been
any more goddamn spastic?

487
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,089
It's OK.

488
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:38,131
Are you sure this
Warner guy is, like, the one?

489
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:41,300
Definitely. I love him.

490
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:47,881
Well, if a girl like you
can't hold on to her man...

491
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:51,681
then there sure as hell isn't
any hope for the rest of us.

492
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,817
What are you waiting for?

493
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:59,317
Steal the bastard back.

494
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,764
I should warn you...

495
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:04,389
I should warn you...

496
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:06,366
that in addition to competing
against each other...

497
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,891
for the top grade
in this class...

498
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,700
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's...

499
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:15,470
highly coveted four
internship spots next year...

500
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:19,172
where you will get to assist
on actual cases.

501
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:22,182
Let the bloodbath begin.

502
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,479
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

503
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:30,583
Ms. Woods...

504
00:35:30,624 --> 00:35:33,184
would you rather have a client
who committed a crime...

505
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:36,162
malum in se
or malum prohibitum?

506
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,993
Neither.

507
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,663
And why is that?

508
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:47,037
I would rather have a client
who's innocent.

509
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:51,812
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

510
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:57,014
Ms. Kensington,
which would you prefer?

511
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,685
Malum prohibitum.

512
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:03,514
Because then the client
would have committed...

513
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:07,357
a regulatory infraction as
opposed to a dangerous crime.

514
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:10,057
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

515
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:12,861
You've obviously done
your homework.

516
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,368
Now let us look
at malum prohibitum...

517
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,166
a little more closely.

518
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:19,900
It has been said...
Yes, Ms. Woods?

519
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,036
I changed my mind.
I'd pick the dangerous one...

520
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:26,239
'cause I'm not afraid
of a challenge.

521
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,059
Who is that?

522
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,995
Wow.

523
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:50,003
Guys.

524
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:52,232
- Can she play?
- Hi!

525
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:56,533
Get outta here.

526
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:07,510
- Hi, everybody.
- Elle, what are you doing here?

527
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,147
I've come to join
your study group.

528
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,715
Look, I brought sustenance.
Who's first?

529
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,125
Our group is full.

530
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:17,754
Is this like an RSVP thing?

531
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:20,289
No. It's like
a smart people thing.

532
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:22,734
And as Viv said, we're full.

533
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,931
Come on, we can make room
for one more.

534
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,205
We've already assigned
the outlines.

535
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,710
The answer is no.

536
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:42,451
Oh, OK.
I'll just leave, then.

537
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:52,964
Hey, maybe
there's, like, a sorority...

538
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,558
you could, like,
join instead, like?

539
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,093
If you had come
to a rush party...

540
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:58,628
I would have at least
been nice to you.

541
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,106
Is that before
you voted against me...

542
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,837
and then called me a dyke
behind my back?

543
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:05,744
I don't use that word.

544
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,179
You must have heard it
from Vivian.

545
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:36,466
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

546
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,412
It's Elle! Guess what
I'm doing right this second!

547
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,039
I don't know. What?

548
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm picking out
my wedding dress!

549
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:47,717
- What?
- Josh proposed!

550
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:50,351
Did you get the rock yet?

551
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,786
Almost.

552
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:55,658
Well, hurry up,
so you can come home!

553
00:38:55,696 --> 00:38:57,027
We miss you!

554
00:38:57,064 --> 00:39:00,465
I miss you guys, too.
The people here are so vile.

555
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,025
Hardly anybody speaks to me...

556
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:04,697
Oh, my God!
I almost forgot to tell you!

557
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,000
What?

558
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,804
I got bangs!
My hair is so now.

559
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:09,968
Really?

560
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,205
OK, so just listen to me.

561
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:15,613
Keep June 1st open,
you're one of my bridesmaids...

562
00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:17,913
and give Warner our love...

563
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:20,785
because I'm getting married!

564
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,827
So don’t forget. Eight o'clock
at 45 Dunston Street.

565
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:36,427
- It'll be a really nice party.
- We'll be there.

566
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,530
And don’t forget
to bring your own merlot!

567
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:42,906
No way! Is somebody at this
school actually having a party?

568
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:45,434
Yes...

569
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:48,411
But it's a costume party.

570
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,144
You probably
wouldn’t want to come.

571
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,910
I love costume parties.

572
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:58,119
Well, then I guess
we'll see you there.

573
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:04,861
Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.

574
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:25,245
Oh, my God!

575
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:46,465
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is superfun.

576
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:49,841
Nice outfit.

577
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:51,344
I like your outfit, too.

578
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:53,505
Except when I dress up
as a frigid bitch...

579
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:55,572
I try not to look
so constipated.

580
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:02,656
Oh, she's horrible.

581
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,351
You've got the ring, sweetie.

582
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:10,390
- Nice ears.
- How you doin'?

583
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,295
Warner,
the English language...

584
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:14,459
is all about
subliminal domination.

585
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,435
Take the word semester.

586
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,301
A perfect example
of this school's...

587
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:20,363
discriminatory preference
of semen to ovaries.

588
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,170
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term...

589
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,973
be referred to
as the winter ovester.

590
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:28,277
- Excuse me. Hey, Warner.
- Wow!

591
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:30,647
Don't you look like
a walking felony?

592
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:32,345
Thank you. You're so sweet.

593
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:35,285
Are you having fun?

594
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:38,519
I am now.
What's with the costume?

595
00:41:38,558 --> 00:41:40,958
I just decided to dress up.

596
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:42,120
Really.

597
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:44,153
I feel like we barely
get to see each other...

598
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,391
since we've been here.

599
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:48,458
I know. I'm so busy with
these case studies and hypos.

600
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:50,493
I know what you mean.
I can't imagine doing...

601
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:53,199
all this and Callahan's
internship next year.

602
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,299
That's gonna be so much.

603
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:58,311
Elle, come on,
you'll never get the grades...

604
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,575
to qualify
for one of those spots.

605
00:42:00,614 --> 00:42:02,878
You're not smart enough,
sweetie.

606
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:06,008
Wait, am I on glue...

607
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,351
or did we not get into
the same law school?

608
00:42:08,388 --> 00:42:09,912
Yeah, but...

609
00:42:09,956 --> 00:42:12,322
But what?
We took the same LSATs...

610
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,384
and we're taking
the same classes.

611
00:42:14,428 --> 00:42:18,524
I know, but come on,
Elle, be serious.

612
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:20,931
You can do something
more valuable with your time.

613
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:28,504
I'm never going to be
good enough for you, am I?

614
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:35,207
- Oh, come on.
- Just forget it!

615
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:41,679
I'll show you how valuable
Elle Woods can be!

616
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,596
- Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.

617
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:10,139
I love that sweater.
It's Chanel.

618
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:12,648
Look.

619
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:15,152
Was she carrying books?

620
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:25,292
Thanks.

621
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,469
So, you've filed a claim.

622
00:43:30,604 --> 00:43:32,003
What next?

623
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,570
Ms. Woods?

624
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:39,275
Don't you need to have evidence?

625
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:41,610
Meaning?

626
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:44,640
Meaning you need
reasonable belief...

627
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:50,145
that your claim should have,
like, evidenciary support?

628
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:55,261
And what kind
of evidenciary support...

629
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:56,853
does this case require?

630
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:13,243
All sorts of things...

631
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,545
corrupt cops
who are wheeling and dealing...

632
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:29,053
And the purpose
of diminished capacity is?

633
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:33,060
To negate mens rea?

634
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:54,153
Are you ready?

635
00:44:57,357 --> 00:44:59,552
Yes, you are!

636
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:02,084
Go. You can do this.

637
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,861
Listen to me, Dewey.
You shut your mouth.

638
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:10,529
No, you shut your big mouth.

639
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:13,605
I'm doing all the talking.

640
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,713
What the hell do you want?

641
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,811
We're eating lunch.

642
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:30,687
I just thought that...

643
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:33,192
You just thought
you could come here...

644
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:35,456
and show me what
I'm definitely not missing?

645
00:45:37,464 --> 00:45:39,932
That's not why I came by.

646
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,627
How many times
you gonna come over here...

647
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:43,397
begging me
to take you back, huh?

648
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,904
I was...

649
00:45:45,939 --> 00:45:47,702
Dewey Newcombe?

650
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:50,106
Who's asking?

651
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:54,636
I'm Elle Woods.
Miss Bonifante's attorney.

652
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:57,707
And I'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

653
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,048
Come again?

654
00:45:59,085 --> 00:46:03,078
Do you understand what
subject matter jurisdiction is?

655
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:05,421
- No.
- I didn't think so.

656
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:09,326
Well, due to habeas corpus...

657
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:12,490
you and Miss Bonifante
had a common law marriage...

658
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:15,695
which heretofore
entitles her...

659
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:17,225
to what is
legally referred to...

660
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,398
as equitable division
of the assets.

661
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,340
Come again?

662
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:26,539
Due to the fact that you've
retained this residence...

663
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,706
Miss Bonifante is entitled...

664
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:31,012
to full canine
property ownership...

665
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:35,010
and will be enforcing
said ownership right now.

666
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,924
Tell him, Paulette.

667
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:48,094
I'm taking the dog, dumbass!

668
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:51,404
That's awesome! We did it!

669
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,802
Come here.

670
00:46:57,877 --> 00:46:59,003
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?

671
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:01,036
He's probably still
scratching his head.

672
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,948
Which must be a nice vacation
for his balls.

673
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,223
Thank you.

674
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:22,862
According to
Swinney vs. Neubert...

675
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:25,371
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor...

676
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:28,135
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms...

677
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:30,074
with the hours
set forth by the parents.

678
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,203
So, if we're sticking
to past precedent...

679
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:35,703
Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

680
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:38,741
He was clearly within his rights
to ask for visitation.

681
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:42,118
But Swinney was
a one-time sperm donor...

682
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:45,886
and our defendant
was an habitual sperm donor...

683
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:48,588
who also happens to be
harassing the parents...

684
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:49,890
in his quest for visitation.

685
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,990
But without this man's sperm...

686
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:55,900
the child in question
wouldn't exist.

687
00:47:55,936 --> 00:47:57,870
Now you're
thinking like a lawyer.

688
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:04,308
Yes, Ms. Woods?

689
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:07,780
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point...

690
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:09,907
I have to wonder
if the defendant...

691
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,350
kept a thorough record
of every sperm emission...

692
00:48:12,385 --> 00:48:14,785
made throughout his life.

693
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,488
Interesting. Why do you ask?

694
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:22,518
Unless the defendant
attempted to contact...

695
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:24,257
every single one-night stand
to determine...

696
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,561
if a child resulted
in those unions...

697
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,569
he has no parental claim
over this child whatsoever.

698
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,594
Why now? Why this sperm?

699
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:34,735
I see your point.

700
00:48:34,774 --> 00:48:38,175
And for that matter,
all masturbatory emissions...

701
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:40,042
where his sperm was clearly
not seeking an egg...

702
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,140
could be termed
reckless abandonment.

703
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:45,947
I believe
you've just won your case.

704
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,783
Ms. Woods, you did well today.

705
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:53,952
Really?

706
00:48:53,994 --> 00:48:56,485
You're applying
for my internship, aren't you?

707
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:58,793
I don't know.

708
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,823
You should.
Do you have a résumé?

709
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:03,028
Yes, I do.

710
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,505
Here it is.

711
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:11,302
It's pink.

712
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:12,641
And it's scented.

713
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,113
I think it gives
it a little something extra.

714
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:19,376
See you next class.

715
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:26,289
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said...

716
00:49:26,326 --> 00:49:28,954
"I think I'll go
to law school today."

717
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:31,088
That lapse in judgment aside...

718
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:32,621
I think
she's got a lot of potential.

719
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:36,158
Here's the Windham file.

720
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:37,794
Smell this.

721
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:40,804
What's that?

722
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,501
It's her résumé.

723
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,033
Smells good.

724
00:50:09,402 --> 00:50:10,664
What's going on?

725
00:50:10,704 --> 00:50:13,434
Callahan's firm
is defending a murder trial.

726
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:17,239
His case load is so big,
he's taking first year interns.

727
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:18,505
He picked them already?

728
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:20,911
My God,
I can't believe it, Warner!

729
00:50:20,947 --> 00:50:23,074
We got it!

730
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:26,881
That only leaves one for...

731
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:34,349
Me!

732
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:36,328
Yes!

733
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:49,968
Remember when we spent
those four amazing hours...

734
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,943
in the hot tub
after winter formal?

735
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:54,071
Yeah... No.

736
00:50:54,114 --> 00:50:57,982
This is so much better
than that!

737
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:00,815
Excuse me.
I have some shopping to do.

738
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:04,986
Four hours?

739
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:27,773
You look very nice today,
Vivian.

740
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:30,572
Thank you.

741
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:32,107
You're welcome.

742
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:44,753
We're defending
Brooke Windham...

743
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:47,392
whose very wealthy husband
was found shot to death...

744
00:51:47,433 --> 00:51:48,798
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

745
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:49,824
Gold digger?

746
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,235
You'd think so
since the stiff was 60...

747
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:54,331
but she was rich on her own.

748
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:55,705
Some kind of fitness empire.

749
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:58,609
You can buy her exercise tapes
on infomercials.

750
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:00,840
Are you talking about
Brooke Taylor?

751
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,782
Maiden name... Taylor.

752
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:06,285
You know her?

753
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,843
She's a Delta Nu!

754
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:09,320
She wasn't in my pledge class.

755
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:11,323
She graduated
four years before me.

756
00:52:11,357 --> 00:52:14,087
But I used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

757
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,560
She's amazing!

758
00:52:15,595 --> 00:52:17,529
Amazing? How?

759
00:52:17,564 --> 00:52:19,964
She can make you lose
three pounds in one class.

760
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:22,194
She's completely gifted.

761
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:25,398
In all likelihood,
she's completely guilty.

762
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:27,929
She was seen standing over
her husband's dead body.

763
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:28,963
By who?

764
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:32,068
His 26-year-old daughter
and the pool boy.

765
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:35,205
Sorry, I'm late.
Excuse me.

766
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:37,512
This is Emmett Richmond,
another associate...

767
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,017
top three in his class...

768
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:41,077
and former editor of
"Harvard Law Review."

769
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,553
You've probably seen him...

770
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:44,750
lurking around campus
doing my research.

771
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:46,383
Thanks for the introduction.

772
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:48,553
What about the murder weapon?

773
00:52:48,595 --> 00:52:50,358
The gun is missing.

774
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:52,023
The coroner said
he'd been dead 30 minutes...

775
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:53,054
when the cops arrived.

776
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:55,067
Giving Brooke
plenty of time to stash it.

777
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:58,161
I just don't think
Brooke could have done this.

778
00:52:58,204 --> 00:53:00,104
Exercise gives you endorphins.

779
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:01,629
Endorphins make you happy.

780
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:05,007
Happy people
don't shoot their husbands.

781
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:07,569
They just don't.

782
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:09,605
I didn't do it.

783
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:11,446
I walked in...

784
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:13,679
I saw my husband
lying on the floor...

785
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,712
I bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off...

786
00:53:16,756 --> 00:53:18,348
then Enrique and Chutney
ran inside.

787
00:53:18,391 --> 00:53:20,689
Your step-daughter
and the pool boy came in...

788
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,524
where they saw you
standing over the body...

789
00:53:22,562 --> 00:53:24,086
covered in his blood.

790
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:28,934
Why would I kill my husband?

791
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:32,460
Insurance, a love affair,
pure unadulterated hatred.

792
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:34,735
The D.A. will come up
with plenty of reasons.

793
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:36,708
I loved him.

794
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:41,146
He was 34 years older
than you.

795
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,580
That doesn't
look so good to a jury.

796
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:46,244
Then show them
a picture of his dick.

797
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:49,915
That might clear
a few things up.

798
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:53,221
Brooke, I believe you...

799
00:53:53,259 --> 00:53:56,456
but a jury
is going to want an alibi.

800
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:58,361
I can't give you that...

801
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:02,095
and if you put me
on the stand, I'll lie.

802
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:05,593
Then I guess
we're done for today.

803
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:16,777
I know you.

804
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:19,182
I'm a Delta Nu,
and I'm a huge fan of yours.

805
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:20,453
You took my class in L.A.

806
00:54:20,453 --> 00:54:22,978
You took my class in L.A.

807
00:54:23,022 --> 00:54:25,320
You had the best high-kick
I've ever seen.

808
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:27,791
Are you one of my lawyers?

809
00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:29,089
Sort of.

810
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:31,926
Well, thank God
one of you has a brain.

811
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,761
Let's go.

812
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,165
I'm the only one
that believes her.

813
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,332
Callahan totally thinks
she's guilty.

814
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:44,501
That's because men are
big fat retards who don't...

815
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:46,477
Afternoon, ladies.

816
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,776
It's him.

817
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:51,806
Paulette Bonifante.

818
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,614
Oh, my God.

819
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:57,484
He's coming over here.

820
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,790
I've got a package.

821
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:08,231
He's got a package.

822
00:55:20,613 --> 00:55:21,875
How you doing today?

823
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:24,042
Fine.

824
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:31,746
Take it easy.

825
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:34,419
See you later.

826
00:55:36,629 --> 00:55:37,789
That's great, Paulette.

827
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,230
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

828
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:45,329
No. Sometimes I say
"OK" instead of "fine."

829
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:48,465
Why don't you offer him
a cold beverage...

830
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:50,498
or a neck massage
or something?

831
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,374
What's the point?

832
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:55,278
Trust me, Paulette.
You have all the equipment...

833
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:57,714
you just need
to read the manual.

834
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,115
Do you know what I'm saying?

835
00:56:00,386 --> 00:56:02,411
I'll show you
a little maneuver...

836
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:04,081
my mother taught me
in junior high.

837
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:07,092
In my experience,
it has a 98% success rate...

838
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:08,525
of getting a man's attention...

839
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:10,586
and when used appropriately...

840
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:13,757
it has an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

841
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:15,096
Wow!

842
00:56:15,134 --> 00:56:17,864
It's called "the bend and snap."

843
00:56:17,903 --> 00:56:19,131
Watch this.

844
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:25,642
"Oh! I think I dropped
something on the floor."

845
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:29,478
So you bend... and snap!

846
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,073
See?

847
00:56:31,116 --> 00:56:32,845
Come on. You try it.

848
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:39,720
Bend... and snap!

849
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,658
OK...

850
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:44,754
a little less bend,
a little more snap.

851
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:46,389
Like this?

852
00:56:46,432 --> 00:56:48,423
Good snap.

853
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:50,697
Come on.

854
00:56:50,736 --> 00:56:54,467
You! Come on, you can do it.

855
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:56,838
Bend... and snap.

856
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,502
Very, very good.

857
00:56:58,544 --> 00:57:01,479
We can all do it!

858
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:03,913
- Come on, guys.
- I can't do that.

859
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:06,247
You're gonna bend...

860
00:57:06,285 --> 00:57:07,547
and snap!

861
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:08,780
Now put your head into it.

862
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:11,813
Bend... and snap!

863
00:57:11,857 --> 00:57:15,486
Bend... and snap! Good job!

864
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:17,427
A little attitude, please.

865
00:57:17,463 --> 00:57:20,762
Now, everybody smile.
That's very important.

866
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,029
Pump! Pump! Pump!

867
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,593
Bend... and snap!

868
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:27,469
Good job, everybody!

869
00:57:27,506 --> 00:57:30,600
Work it out! Work it out!

870
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:33,635
That's it! Wow!

871
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:36,674
Come on, Paulette!

872
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:40,852
Bend and snap!

873
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:45,118
Oh, my God! The bend and snap!
Works every time!

874
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:49,658
If Brooke didn't kill the guy,
then who did?

875
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:52,493
My money is on the angry
daughter or the ex-wife.

876
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:54,123
Chutney has a trust fund.

877
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:56,361
She didn't need the insurance
payoff or the inheritance.

878
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:57,494
What about the mother?

879
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,060
Covered.
She was in Aspen at the time.

880
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,969
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

881
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:02,974
Ten people saw her
downing cosmopolitans...

882
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:04,805
at the Caribou Club.

883
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:06,401
All I know is it's not Brooke.

884
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:09,312
That's touching,
but we need an alibi.

885
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:14,241
I brought you
some necessities...

886
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,754
some Calvin Klein
720-count sheets...

887
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:19,519
the entire Clinique
skin care line...

888
00:58:19,558 --> 00:58:22,823
some aromatherapy candles,
a loofah...

889
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:26,831
And the Bible.

890
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:28,696
You're an angel.

891
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:32,397
So how are you?
Are you all right?

892
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:35,236
You look so... orange.

893
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:38,402
I'm just glad
it's you and not Callahan.

894
00:58:38,444 --> 00:58:41,345
He means well.
He's very brilliant.

895
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,905
He better be for what
I'm paying for him.

896
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:47,646
I have to tell you
the real reason I came here.

897
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:50,746
Professor Callahan says
we really need your alibi.

898
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:54,953
Elle, I can't.

899
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,120
You don't understand.

900
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,221
Who could understand
better than me?

901
00:58:59,264 --> 00:59:02,256
It's so shameful.

902
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:05,202
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

903
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:07,865
That's just it.
It would ruin me.

904
00:59:07,906 --> 00:59:09,430
How?

905
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:15,209
I've made my fortune
on the ability...

906
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:17,977
to perfect women’s bodies with
Brooke's Butt-Busterworkout.

907
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,916
You helped me
go from a six to a four.

908
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:22,443
That's great!

909
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:27,658
On the day of
Heyworth's murder...

910
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:34,790
I was getting...

911
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,892
What?

912
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:40,427
I was getting liposuction.

913
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:43,566
Liposuction!

914
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:45,634
Oh, God!

915
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:47,304
I know! I'm a fraud!

916
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:49,837
It's not like normal women
can have this ass!

917
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:51,782
If my fans
knew that I bought it...

918
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:55,253
I would lose everything!

919
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:58,450
I've already lost my husband.

920
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:04,484
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

921
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:09,365
Brooke...
your secret's safe with me.

922
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:14,539
Thank you.

923
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:18,368
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

924
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,037
We got two interviews
tomorrow...

925
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:21,875
that Gerard and Bobby
will handle.

926
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,381
The ex-wife in an hour.

927
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,440
According to this communiqué
from the prison...

928
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:28,453
our client apparently
had a visit from her sister...

929
01:00:28,487 --> 01:00:32,446
a Miss Delta Nu.

930
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:35,656
Anyone you know?

931
01:00:35,694 --> 01:00:37,662
Yes. I went to visit her.

932
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:39,823
What the hell do you mean
you went to visit her?

933
01:00:39,865 --> 01:00:41,230
I went to get her alibi.

934
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:43,325
Did you get it?

935
01:00:43,368 --> 01:00:44,858
It's really good.

936
01:00:44,903 --> 01:00:47,463
Great. What is it?

937
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:49,440
I can't tell you.

938
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:51,203
Why the hell not?

939
01:00:51,243 --> 01:00:53,575
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret...

940
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:55,409
and I can't break the bonds
of sisterhood.

941
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,041
Screw sisterhood!
This is a murder trial...

942
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,074
not some scandal
at the sorority house.

943
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:01,483
I want the alibi!

944
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,351
I can't give it to you...

945
01:01:03,388 --> 01:01:06,323
but I can tell you
she is innocent.

946
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:10,260
Mrs. Windham Vandermark
is on line two for you.

947
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,492
Someone reason with her
while I take this.

948
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:17,468
Are you crazy?
Just tell him the alibi.

949
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:19,902
We'll lose this case
if you don't.

950
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:21,872
Then we're not
very good lawyers.

951
01:01:21,907 --> 01:01:24,899
If you tell him, he'll probably
hire you as a summer associate.

952
01:01:24,943 --> 01:01:26,378
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

953
01:01:26,378 --> 01:01:27,845
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

954
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:31,849
I gave her my word, Warner.

955
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:33,510
So what?

956
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:39,588
The ex-wife seems
to be unconcerned...

957
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:41,751
with the fact
that her interview is today.

958
01:01:41,793 --> 01:01:43,454
She's at a spa
in the Berkshires.

959
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:47,397
A spa? Isn't that
like your mothership?

960
01:01:47,432 --> 01:01:49,491
I could go if you want me to.

961
01:01:49,534 --> 01:01:51,729
Emmett? Go with her.

962
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:06,047
She seems completely
untrustworthy to me.

963
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:07,210
Why?

964
01:02:07,252 --> 01:02:09,550
This is a person
who's made her living...

965
01:02:09,587 --> 01:02:11,748
by telling women
that they're too fat.

966
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,258
Brooke would never tell
a woman she was too fat.

967
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:17,125
And she seems like
she's hiding something.

968
01:02:17,162 --> 01:02:19,323
Maybe it's not what you think.

969
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:21,594
Maybe it's exactly what I think.

970
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:24,659
You're really being a butthead.

971
01:02:24,702 --> 01:02:26,397
A butthead?

972
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:28,099
Why would you call me that?

973
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:30,869
You need to have
a little more faith in people.

974
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:32,103
You might be surprised.

975
01:02:34,112 --> 01:02:36,080
I can't believe
you called me a butthead.

976
01:02:36,114 --> 01:02:38,605
No one's called me that
since the ninth grade.

977
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,946
Maybe not to your face.

978
01:02:44,522 --> 01:02:47,184
So this is what a spa
looks like. Wow.

979
01:02:47,225 --> 01:02:48,385
How do we find her?

980
01:02:48,426 --> 01:02:50,223
I called ahead.
She's in the mud room.

981
01:02:50,261 --> 01:02:52,695
She's not naked, is she?

982
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,000
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

983
01:02:59,637 --> 01:03:01,867
So you found me.

984
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:05,899
We're from Austen, Platt,
Jaret, and Callahan...

985
01:03:05,944 --> 01:03:08,037
and we're here to ask you
a few questions.

986
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,014
So I hear that little tart
from California...

987
01:03:11,049 --> 01:03:12,641
shot poor Heyworth.

988
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:16,142
That's what we’re trying
to prove didn't happen.

989
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:17,984
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

990
01:03:18,022 --> 01:03:20,752
I've never
actually met the woman...

991
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,419
but my daughter tells me...

992
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,018
she can be
quite the little bitch.

993
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:27,031
Did your daughter
ever mention anything...

994
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:30,193
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

995
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:34,331
She did say that
they humped like gorillas.

996
01:03:34,372 --> 01:03:38,809
I guess it wasn’t enough,
though, for Brooke.

997
01:03:38,843 --> 01:03:40,572
Why do you say that?

998
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,739
Well...

999
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,374
haven't you seen
the cabana boy?

1000
01:03:46,384 --> 01:03:47,976
She's lying.

1001
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:50,146
And you know this for a fact?

1002
01:03:50,188 --> 01:03:52,656
Did you see the icky
brown color of her hair?

1003
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,887
So? Now you discriminate
against brunettes?

1004
01:03:55,927 --> 01:03:58,452
Why not? I'm discriminated
against as a blonde.

1005
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,260
Being a blonde is actually
a pretty powerful thing.

1006
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:02,789
You hold more cards
than you think you do.

1007
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:05,701
I personally would like
to see you take that power...

1008
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:08,865
and channel it
towards the greater good.

1009
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:12,240
Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1010
01:04:12,277 --> 01:04:13,869
All right.

1011
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:18,138
How do you think
I'd look as a blonde?

1012
01:04:18,182 --> 01:04:20,844
I'm not sure
you could handle it.

1013
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:22,910
- Good night.
- Bye.

1014
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:34,297
So, I called your room
last night.

1015
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:35,390
I heard.

1016
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:37,697
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1017
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:39,669
No. You're a dork.

1018
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:42,298
I'm in law school.

1019
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,740
Look, I'm not going out
with you.

1020
01:04:44,776 --> 01:04:46,641
I can't believe you'd even ask.

1021
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:50,011
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

1022
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:51,811
Let's get out of here.

1023
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:53,373
Excuse me.

1024
01:04:57,322 --> 01:04:58,380
Why didn't you call me?

1025
01:04:58,423 --> 01:04:59,822
What?

1026
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:01,449
We spent a beautiful
night together...

1027
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:02,925
and I never hear from you again?

1028
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:04,929
I...

1029
01:05:06,164 --> 01:05:08,394
I'm sorry?

1030
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:10,401
Sorry for what?
For breaking my heart...

1031
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:11,834
or for giving me
the greatest pleasure...

1032
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:16,135
I've ever known and then
just taking it away?

1033
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:18,665
Both?

1034
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,109
Well, forget it.

1035
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,237
I've spent too many hours
crying over you.

1036
01:05:26,684 --> 01:05:29,482
So... when did
you want to go out?

1037
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,527
Come in.

1038
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:44,701
Are you done with
that deposition yet?

1039
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,897
Yeah. Here, take it.

1040
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:48,667
I've read it 20 times.

1041
01:05:58,149 --> 01:06:02,677
You know, Elle,
I still can't believe...

1042
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,654
you didn't tell
Callahan the alibi.

1043
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:07,783
It's not my alibi to tell.

1044
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:09,759
I know.

1045
01:06:09,794 --> 01:06:13,787
And I thought
that was very classy of you.

1046
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:16,460
Really?

1047
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:18,469
Sure.

1048
01:06:18,503 --> 01:06:20,869
Thanks.

1049
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,209
Did you ever notice how
Callahan never asks Warner...

1050
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,512
to bring him his coffee?

1051
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:36,679
He's asked me at least
ten times.

1052
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:39,189
Men are helpless.
You know that.

1053
01:06:39,223 --> 01:06:42,818
I know. Warner doesn't
even do his own laundry.

1054
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,725
He has to have it sent out.

1055
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:47,060
I know.

1056
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,234
Did you know
when he first applied...

1057
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:52,827
he got wait-listed.

1058
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,701
What?

1059
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:58,675
His father had to make a call.

1060
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,644
You're kidding.

1061
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:04,842
No way!

1062
01:07:08,252 --> 01:07:12,348
God, that is
such a precious dog.

1063
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,950
His name is Bruiser.
Do you want to hold him?

1064
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:17,927
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

1065
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:23,562
Look, he likes you.

1066
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:26,365
He's giving me kisses.

1067
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:29,972
Thanks, Jeff.

1068
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:32,874
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1069
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,811
She's charged with
the murder of her husband...

1070
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:38,077
Boston millionaire
Heyworth Windham.

1071
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:41,643
First to testify are the
victim's daughter and ex-wife.

1072
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:44,177
The Superior Court of Suffolk
County is now in session.

1073
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:46,782
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1074
01:07:46,824 --> 01:07:48,348
You may be seated.

1075
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,825
And where was she exactly?

1076
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,464
Standing over
my father's dead body.

1077
01:08:03,007 --> 01:08:05,134
And what was
the defendant doing?

1078
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:08,805
She was sitting
next to the pool, topless...

1079
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:11,906
while the Latin boy
handed her a drink.

1080
01:08:14,385 --> 01:08:18,116
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

1081
01:08:19,557 --> 01:08:20,790
My uniform.

1082
01:08:20,923 --> 01:08:24,256
This is the uniform...

1083
01:08:24,293 --> 01:08:28,320
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear
while cleaning her pool?

1084
01:08:33,035 --> 01:08:36,630
Are you having an affair
with Brooke Windham?

1085
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:41,742
Define "affair."

1086
01:08:41,777 --> 01:08:45,543
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1087
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:50,018
Yes. OK? Yes.

1088
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:56,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
court will reconvene...

1089
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:59,224
tomorrow morning at9 A.M.

1090
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,525
We're adjourned.

1091
01:09:03,465 --> 01:09:06,866
A Delta Nu would never sleep
with a man who wears a thong.

1092
01:09:06,902 --> 01:09:07,960
Never!

1093
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:10,164
I just liked watching
him clean the filter.

1094
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:12,367
I believe you, Brooke.

1095
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:15,673
- Take care of me, Elle.
- I will.

1096
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,762
I got a big one for you.

1097
01:09:43,105 --> 01:09:44,936
Can you sign?

1098
01:10:20,976 --> 01:10:22,534
I got it.

1099
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,547
You broke his nose?

1100
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:30,381
I blew it, Elle.

1101
01:10:30,419 --> 01:10:32,683
My snap was
all over the place.

1102
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:34,120
I'll be there
as soon as court is out.

1103
01:10:34,156 --> 01:10:35,817
We have to
cross-examine Enrique.

1104
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:37,325
But don’t worry.
My girlfriend Serena...

1105
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:39,088
barfed on a guy during
"The Blair Witch Project"...

1106
01:10:39,128 --> 01:10:40,755
and they ended up dating
for three months.

1107
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:43,128
Really?
All right. Bye-bye.

1108
01:10:43,165 --> 01:10:44,257
OK. Bye.

1109
01:10:54,877 --> 01:11:00,179
Don't stomp your little
last-season Prada shoes at me.

1110
01:11:01,183 --> 01:11:02,741
These aren't last season.

1111
01:11:10,492 --> 01:11:13,950
- He's gay! Enrique's gay!
- What?

1112
01:11:13,996 --> 01:11:16,794
What kind of shoes are these?

1113
01:11:16,832 --> 01:11:18,424
Black ones.

1114
01:11:18,467 --> 01:11:20,264
- See!
- What are you talking about?

1115
01:11:20,302 --> 01:11:23,703
He isn't Brooke's lover.
He's making it up.

1116
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:26,264
Back up.
How do you know he's gay?

1117
01:11:26,308 --> 01:11:29,141
Gay men know designers.
Straight men don't.

1118
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:30,645
Know what?

1119
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:32,738
He left a Chertape
in the poolhouse one time.

1120
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:37,485
While I appreciate
your masterful legal theory...

1121
01:11:37,519 --> 01:11:40,181
I have a murder trial
to attend to.

1122
01:11:44,393 --> 01:11:46,691
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.

1123
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:49,493
The courtwill come to order.

1124
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:58,974
Mr. Salvatore,
do you have any proof...

1125
01:11:59,008 --> 01:12:02,739
that you and Mrs. Windham
were having an affair?

1126
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:04,973
Only the love in my heart.

1127
01:12:05,014 --> 01:12:09,383
If that's all the proof
that he has, Your Honor...

1128
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:10,544
I think I'm done here.

1129
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:12,918
You may step down.

1130
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,082
I'd like to ask a couple
of questions, Your Honor.

1131
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:17,649
Just give me a couple minutes.

1132
01:12:20,129 --> 01:12:22,723
Did you ever take
Mrs. Windham on a date?

1133
01:12:22,765 --> 01:12:24,892
- Yes.
- Where?

1134
01:12:24,933 --> 01:12:27,663
A restaurant where
no one could recognize us.

1135
01:12:27,703 --> 01:12:29,671
How long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1136
01:12:29,705 --> 01:12:30,672
Three months.

1137
01:12:30,706 --> 01:12:33,004
- And your boyfriend's name is...
- Chuck.

1138
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:39,373
Silence!

1139
01:12:39,415 --> 01:12:40,382
Pardon me!

1140
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:41,781
Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1141
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:43,079
I was confused.

1142
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:46,212
I thought you said friend.
Chuck is just a friend.

1143
01:12:47,556 --> 01:12:49,786
You bitch!

1144
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:51,417
Chuck, wait!

1145
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,554
Silence in my court!
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1146
01:12:57,132 --> 01:13:00,863
Silence in my courtroom!

1147
01:13:00,903 --> 01:13:03,633
How did I miss that?
You were great.

1148
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,936
Silence in my courtroom!

1149
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:09,276
Thanks.

1150
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:14,672
- Good night.
- Good night.

1151
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:21,020
Callahan asked to see you
before you leave.

1152
01:13:21,056 --> 01:13:22,523
Really?

1153
01:13:22,558 --> 01:13:25,493
He already has coffee,
but maybe he needs a doughnut.

1154
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:28,428
- Do you need any help?
- No. I'm fine.

1155
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:29,658
OK. Bye.

1156
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,069
Come on in.

1157
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:40,434
Sit down.

1158
01:13:49,017 --> 01:13:50,575
Is everything all right?

1159
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:53,087
You followed
your intuition today...

1160
01:13:53,122 --> 01:13:55,818
and you were right on target.

1161
01:13:55,858 --> 01:13:59,021
I should have listened.

1162
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,790
Thank you.

1163
01:14:00,829 --> 01:14:03,161
About the alibi...

1164
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:04,665
I'm sorry...

1165
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,601
I'm impressed you took
the initiative to go get it.

1166
01:14:07,636 --> 01:14:09,604
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1167
01:14:09,638 --> 01:14:12,698
On top of that,
you gained the client's trust...

1168
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:15,266
and kept it... that's what
makes a great lawyer.

1169
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,370
You're smart, Elle.

1170
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,938
Smarter than most of
the guys on my payroll.

1171
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:23,178
Wow.

1172
01:14:23,218 --> 01:14:26,654
I think it's time
to discuss your career path.

1173
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:30,852
Have you thought about where
you might be a summer associate?

1174
01:14:30,893 --> 01:14:33,657
Not really.

1175
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:35,629
I know it's very competitive.

1176
01:14:35,664 --> 01:14:39,327
You know what competition's
really about?

1177
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:43,998
It's about ferocity, carnage.

1178
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:50,137
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1179
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:53,376
Knowing exactly what you want...

1180
01:14:53,415 --> 01:14:57,351
and how far you'll go
to get it.

1181
01:14:57,386 --> 01:15:00,583
How far will Elle go?

1182
01:15:04,226 --> 01:15:05,523
Are you hitting on me?

1183
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:08,155
You're a beautiful girl.

1184
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:10,597
So everything you just said...

1185
01:15:10,632 --> 01:15:12,691
I'm a man
who knows what he wants.

1186
01:15:12,734 --> 01:15:15,498
And I'm a law student
who just realized...

1187
01:15:15,537 --> 01:15:17,903
her professor
is a pathetic asshole.

1188
01:15:19,174 --> 01:15:21,108
Too bad. I thought
you were a law student...

1189
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:22,838
who wanted to be a lawyer!

1190
01:15:39,695 --> 01:15:41,856
You almost had me fooled.

1191
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,262
What?

1192
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:45,766
Maybe you should sleep
with the jury, too.

1193
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:48,065
Then we can win the case.

1194
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:05,646
I'm quitting.

1195
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:07,154
Why?

1196
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:09,885
Law school was a mistake.
This internship was a mistake.

1197
01:16:09,925 --> 01:16:11,756
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

1198
01:16:11,793 --> 01:16:14,261
I didn't earn anything.

1199
01:16:14,296 --> 01:16:16,264
Callahan only gave me
that internship...

1200
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:17,822
because he liked the way
I looked.

1201
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:20,460
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

1202
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:23,938
Callahan did what?

1203
01:16:25,774 --> 01:16:28,140
Just forget about it.
I'm going back to L.A.

1204
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:30,440
No more boring suits.
No more pantyhose.

1205
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:32,879
No more trying to be
something that I'm just...

1206
01:16:32,914 --> 01:16:34,643
I'm just not.

1207
01:16:34,683 --> 01:16:38,346
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

1208
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:41,913
The hell with Callahan.

1209
01:16:41,957 --> 01:16:45,256
Stay.

1210
01:16:48,463 --> 01:16:51,626
Call me if you're ever
in California.

1211
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:10,576
What's the point in staying,
Paulette?

1212
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:13,782
All people see
when they look at me...

1213
01:17:13,822 --> 01:17:15,790
is blond hair and big boobs.

1214
01:17:15,824 --> 01:17:18,122
No one's ever gonna
take me seriously.

1215
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:21,560
The people at law school don't.
Warner doesn't.

1216
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:25,293
I don't think my own parents
take me seriously.

1217
01:17:27,168 --> 01:17:31,036
I just felt, like,
for the first time...

1218
01:17:31,072 --> 01:17:33,939
that someone expected me to...

1219
01:17:33,975 --> 01:17:35,465
to do something more
with my life...

1220
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,570
than become
a Victoria's Secret model.

1221
01:17:40,215 --> 01:17:43,343
But I was just kidding myself.

1222
01:17:43,385 --> 01:17:45,080
Callahan never saw me
as a lawyer...

1223
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,815
just as a piece of ass.

1224
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:49,323
Just like everybody else.

1225
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:54,086
Turns out I am a joke.

1226
01:17:54,129 --> 01:17:57,895
No, you're not a joke.

1227
01:18:05,373 --> 01:18:07,568
The hell with law school.

1228
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:09,804
I just wanted to say good-bye.

1229
01:18:11,112 --> 01:18:15,208
If you're going to let one
stupid prick ruin your life...

1230
01:18:21,122 --> 01:18:23,784
you're not the girl
I thought you were.

1231
01:18:41,242 --> 01:18:44,643
Did you go in there knowing how
to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1232
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:46,169
Absolutely.

1233
01:18:46,214 --> 01:18:49,115
It's a little thing
I'd like to call strategy.

1234
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,449
I had a feeling
about Mr. Salvatore...

1235
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:53,749
Is he always such an ass?

1236
01:18:53,788 --> 01:18:56,120
He's the top defense
attorney in the state.

1237
01:18:56,157 --> 01:18:57,283
Of course he's an ass.

1238
01:18:57,325 --> 01:18:59,725
Fine. Is he an ass
that'll win my case?

1239
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:02,889
He's an ass that'll try.

1240
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:04,626
He thinks I'm guilty.

1241
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:06,258
That's not what's important.

1242
01:19:06,301 --> 01:19:08,861
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

1243
01:19:08,903 --> 01:19:12,066
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

1244
01:19:12,107 --> 01:19:16,771
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1245
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:18,472
What's going on here?

1246
01:19:18,513 --> 01:19:21,744
- Elle quit.
- What?

1247
01:19:21,783 --> 01:19:24,843
Callahan hit on her,
so she quit.

1248
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:28,845
My God. Scumbag.

1249
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:31,324
- Oh, God.
- What?

1250
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:36,661
I feel terrible.
I made a huge mistake.

1251
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,903
Maybe there's something
we can do about it.

1252
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:51,210
Thank you.

1253
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:58,985
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

1254
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,318
Get up.

1255
01:20:01,356 --> 01:20:02,653
What?

1256
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:06,127
You're fired.
I have new representation.

1257
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:08,061
Who?

1258
01:20:30,985 --> 01:20:33,146
Excuse you,
you're in my way.

1259
01:20:33,188 --> 01:20:35,713
She's a law student.
She can't defend you.

1260
01:20:35,757 --> 01:20:40,490
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruling 3.03.

1261
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:43,759
See? Thank you, David.

1262
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:46,426
Counselors,
approach the bench.

1263
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:49,995
- You're not going up there.
- Yes, I am.

1264
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:52,666
Maybe you didn't hear me.
You're fired.

1265
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:56,438
Counselors, now.
All of you.

1266
01:21:00,749 --> 01:21:02,239
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1267
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:05,150
Rule 3.03 of
Supreme Judicial Court...

1268
01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:07,416
states that a law student
may appear on behalf...

1269
01:21:07,455 --> 01:21:08,888
of a defendant
in criminal proceedings.

1270
01:21:08,923 --> 01:21:11,255
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

1271
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:12,782
I do.
I'm not allowing it.

1272
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:15,796
But you agreed last night.
In your office...

1273
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,355
when we were discussing
my career.

1274
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:20,264
The ruling also states...

1275
01:21:20,301 --> 01:21:23,702
that you need a licensed
attorney to supervise you.

1276
01:21:23,738 --> 01:21:26,730
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

1277
01:21:26,775 --> 01:21:29,744
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1278
01:21:29,778 --> 01:21:33,043
Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1279
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:35,049
Thank you, Your Honor.

1280
01:21:49,097 --> 01:21:50,587
Enjoy prison.

1281
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,668
Mrs. Windham, you do realize
what you're doing?

1282
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:57,193
Absolutely.

1283
01:21:59,974 --> 01:22:01,441
Oh, my God! There she is!

1284
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:04,707
We came to see your trial!

1285
01:22:04,746 --> 01:22:08,341
Look how cute.
There's a judge and everything.

1286
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:11,648
- And jury people.
- Vote for Elle!

1287
01:22:11,686 --> 01:22:13,153
Ladies, take a seat.

1288
01:22:13,188 --> 01:22:15,019
Go, girl.

1289
01:22:20,195 --> 01:22:21,890
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

1290
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,795
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1291
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:25,424
- I do.
- Be seated.

1292
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:30,027
Ms. Woods, you may begin
your questioning.

1293
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,843
First of all
I would like to point out...

1294
01:22:36,878 --> 01:22:39,870
that not only is there
no proof in this case...

1295
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:43,941
but there is a complete
lack of mens rea...

1296
01:22:43,985 --> 01:22:47,819
which by definition tells us
there can be no crime...

1297
01:22:47,856 --> 01:22:50,916
without a vicious will.

1298
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:53,860
I am aware of the meaning
of mens rea.

1299
01:22:53,895 --> 01:22:55,362
What I'm unaware of...

1300
01:22:55,396 --> 01:22:57,864
is why you're giving me
a vocabulary lesson...

1301
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:00,035
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1302
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,497
Yes, Your Honor.

1303
01:23:06,841 --> 01:23:08,399
Miss Windham...

1304
01:23:08,443 --> 01:23:11,378
when you arrived
back at the house...

1305
01:23:11,413 --> 01:23:13,904
was your father there?

1306
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:16,576
Not that I saw,
but like I said...

1307
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:19,485
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

1308
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:24,720
And when you came downstairs,
what happened?

1309
01:23:24,759 --> 01:23:28,354
I saw Brooke
standing over his body...

1310
01:23:28,396 --> 01:23:30,990
drenched in his blood.

1311
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:39,265
But Mrs. Windham
didn't have a gun?

1312
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:41,332
No. She'd stashed it
by then.

1313
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:43,276
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

1314
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:45,279
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

1315
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,080
Go ahead.

1316
01:23:54,022 --> 01:23:57,355
Miss Windham,
did you hear a shot fired?

1317
01:23:57,392 --> 01:23:59,792
No. I was in the shower.

1318
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:06,298
So, sometime
in the 20 minutes...

1319
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:09,929
that you were in the shower,
your father was shot.

1320
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:11,632
I guess.

1321
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:15,769
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

1322
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:20,338
but you didn't hear
the shot because...

1323
01:24:23,318 --> 01:24:25,377
because you were in the shower?

1324
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:30,458
I was washing my hair.

1325
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:34,951
Where is she going with this?

1326
01:24:34,996 --> 01:24:37,590
Have a little faith, Gerard.

1327
01:24:45,306 --> 01:24:47,171
Miss Windham...

1328
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,472
what had you done
earlier that day?

1329
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:52,105
I got up...

1330
01:24:52,147 --> 01:24:54,445
got a latte,
went to the gym...

1331
01:24:54,482 --> 01:24:56,677
got a perm, and came home.

1332
01:24:58,019 --> 01:25:00,817
Where you got in the shower?

1333
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:03,619
I believe the witness
has made it clear...

1334
01:25:03,658 --> 01:25:06,855
that she was in the shower.

1335
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:13,225
Yes, Your Honor.

1336
01:25:13,268 --> 01:25:17,364
Miss Windham, had you
ever gotten a perm before?

1337
01:25:18,673 --> 01:25:20,766
How many would you say?

1338
01:25:20,808 --> 01:25:24,175
Two a year since I was 12.

1339
01:25:24,212 --> 01:25:26,840
You do the math.

1340
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:30,442
A girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1341
01:25:30,485 --> 01:25:32,282
We all tried
to talk her out of it.

1342
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,651
Curls weren't
a good look for her.

1343
01:25:33,688 --> 01:25:35,952
She didn't have
your bone structure.

1344
01:25:37,025 --> 01:25:39,493
But, thankfully,
that same day...

1345
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:41,722
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet t-shirt contest...

1346
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:43,993
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1347
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:46,865
Objection!
Why is this relevant?

1348
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:48,698
I have a point, I promise.

1349
01:25:48,736 --> 01:25:50,033
Then make it.

1350
01:25:50,071 --> 01:25:52,505
Yes, ma'am.

1351
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,873
Chutney, why were
Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined...

1352
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:58,640
when she got hosed down?

1353
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,079
Because they got wet?

1354
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:02,446
Exactly. Isn't it
the first cardinal rule...

1355
01:26:02,483 --> 01:26:04,610
of perm maintenance that you're
forbidden to wet your hair...

1356
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:06,620
for at least 24 hours
after getting a perm...

1357
01:26:06,654 --> 01:26:09,350
at the risk of deactivating
the ammonium thioglycolate?

1358
01:26:12,393 --> 01:26:14,827
And wouldn't somebody
who's had, say,30 perms...

1359
01:26:14,862 --> 01:26:17,092
in their life
be well aware of this rule?

1360
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:20,032
And if in fact
you weren’t washing your hair...

1361
01:26:20,068 --> 01:26:22,593
as I suspect, because
your curls are still intact...

1362
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:24,036
wouldn't you have heard
the gunshot?

1363
01:26:24,072 --> 01:26:26,131
And if in fact
you had heard the gunshot...

1364
01:26:26,174 --> 01:26:28,665
Brooke Windham wouldn't have
had time to hide the gun...

1365
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:30,234
before you got downstairs...

1366
01:26:30,278 --> 01:26:32,269
which would mean you would
have had to have found...

1367
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:33,780
Mrs. Windham
with a gun in her hand...

1368
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:36,545
to make your story plausible.
Isn't that right?

1369
01:26:36,584 --> 01:26:38,916
She's my age!
Did she tell you that?

1370
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:41,547
How would you feel if your
father married someone your age?

1371
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:44,353
You, however,
had time to hide the gun...

1372
01:26:44,392 --> 01:26:45,518
after you shot your father.

1373
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,857
I didn't mean to shoot him.

1374
01:26:46,894 --> 01:26:49,226
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

1375
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:54,533
Order! Order!

1376
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:56,662
Order!

1377
01:26:56,704 --> 01:26:58,569
Oh, my God.

1378
01:26:58,606 --> 01:26:59,868
Oh, my God.

1379
01:26:59,907 --> 01:27:01,738
Oh, my God.

1380
01:27:03,311 --> 01:27:05,802
Bailiff,
take the witness into custody...

1381
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:09,214
where she will be charged for
the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1382
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,413
In the matter of
The State vs. Brooke Windham...

1383
01:27:12,453 --> 01:27:14,250
this case is dismissed.

1384
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:16,484
Mrs. Windham,
you are free to go.

1385
01:27:27,769 --> 01:27:29,803
Thank you!

1386
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,899
Elle, how did you know
Chutney was lying?

1387
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:37,534
Because she's brilliant,
of course.

1388
01:27:37,577 --> 01:27:39,602
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

1389
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:41,409
Any Cosmo Girl
would have known.

1390
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:48,654
What?

1391
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:50,315
I just wanted to say...

1392
01:27:50,356 --> 01:27:52,756
that you were
so brilliant in there.

1393
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:56,523
And that I was wrong.

1394
01:27:56,563 --> 01:28:01,057
And you are the girl for me.

1395
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,762
Really?

1396
01:28:03,803 --> 01:28:07,933
Pooh bear... I love you.

1397
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:13,775
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

1398
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:18,710
But if I'm gonna be a partner at
a law firm by the time I'm 30...

1399
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:21,379
I need a boyfriend who's not
such a complete bonehead.

1400
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:27,926
Thank you, boys.

1401
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,631
Ladies and gentlemen...

1402
01:28:35,869 --> 01:28:39,498
I present the graduates
of Harvard Law School...

1403
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:42,736
Class of 2004.

1404
01:28:44,577 --> 01:28:48,013
I am personally
very honored to introduce...

1405
01:28:48,047 --> 01:28:50,709
this year's
class-elected speaker.

1406
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,379
After getting off
to a quite interesting start...

1407
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,648
here at Harvard...

1408
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:59,454
she graduates today
with an invitation to join...

1409
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:02,757
one of Boston's
most prestigious law firms.

1410
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:07,528
I'm sure we are going to see
great things from her.

1411
01:29:07,567 --> 01:29:11,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elle Woods.

1412
01:29:32,759 --> 01:29:34,920
On our very first day
at Harvard...

1413
01:29:34,961 --> 01:29:38,727
a very wise professor
quoted Aristotle.

1414
01:29:38,765 --> 01:29:42,292
"The law is reason
free from passion."

1415
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,771
Well, no offense
to Aristotle...

1416
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:47,568
but in my three years
at Harvard...

1417
01:29:47,607 --> 01:29:50,974
I have come to find that passion
is a key ingredient...

1418
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:55,572
to the study and practice
of law and of life.

1419
01:29:55,615 --> 01:29:58,846
It is with passion,
courage of conviction...

1420
01:29:58,885 --> 01:30:00,876
and strong sense of self...

1421
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,480
that we take our next steps
into the world...

1422
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,423
remembering
that first impressions...

1423
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,722
are not always correct...

1424
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,196
you must always have faith
in people...

1425
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:14,097
and most importantly...

1426
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:19,667
you must always have faith
in yourself.

1427
01:30:21,174 --> 01:30:24,405
Congratulations, Class of 2004.

1428
01:30:24,444 --> 01:30:26,435
We did it!
