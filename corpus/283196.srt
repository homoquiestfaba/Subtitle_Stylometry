1
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:29,370
I'm rich!

2
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:06,877
Master.

3
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:14,344
Sir, I think you had a good time.

4
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,142
Come again.

5
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,739
Hurry up, Cuihong,
come to serve the master.

6
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,974
The ladies will be here soon, please wait.

7
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:23,207
Lady boss...

8
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,144
Just a minute.

9
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:25,643
How may I help you?

10
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,009
Where are the two ladies?

11
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:28,172
They'll be here soon.

12
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,045
Come here, Cuibing, Cuihong.

13
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:34,743
Yes. Excuse me sir.

14
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,680
Hurry up, Master He is waiting, go on in.

15
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay...

16
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:43,112
Master He.

17
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,977
What took you so long?

18
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,413
We...

19
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,613
Sorry we are late.

20
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,444
Don't be angry, Master He.

21
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,346
Since they are here, sit down.

22
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,882
Let me drink to you, Master He.

23
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,217
Sorry I'm late.

24
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,146
You can punish us all you want.

25
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,015
Have something to eat first.

26
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:14,710
It's alright with me,

27
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,977
but my mates have waited for a long time.

28
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:23,684
Sorry, let me drink to you.

29
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:31,385
Thick branch, small green leaves,
lovely...

30
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,219
Hulu shaped vase with blue floral prints,

31
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:43,719
it's from the Ming Dynasty,
very nice vase.

32
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:46,873
Where's Cuihong and the others?

33
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,808
Lady boss.

34
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,942
Yes, Master Wang, how can I help you?

35
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,574
Where's Cuihong?

36
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,981
Sorry about that, I'll call them here.

37
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:00,945
They go in and out
while I'm admiring the antiques,

38
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,677
that's not very nice.

39
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,082
Right...

40
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:08,513
Lady Boss, I've reserved this room.

41
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:11,246
Bullshit, I can afford it too!

42
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:15,612
It's not that, but Master Wang...

43
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,515
Master Wang has...

44
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,017
So you're saying that

45
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,847
I can't afford the girls' company?

46
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:22,082
It's not that.

47
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:22,549
Did you mean that?

48
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:26,382
I didn't mean that,
please don't be mistaken.

49
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,681
Quiet.

50
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:35,678
What's all the noise about?

51
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,981
It's nothing, please continue.

52
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,944
If you could pick up the gold,

53
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:50,681
drink up the wine, and the gold is yours,

54
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:51,980
and you may leave.

55
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:53,975
Then we will.

56
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,785
Good...

57
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:12,546
It's real.

58
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:14,019
Thanks.

59
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,611
There are two more here, who wants it?

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,711
I do...

61
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,447
And more...

62
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,579
It's my turn.

63
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,384
Why aren't they over yet?

64
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:34,318
Master Wang, sorry.

65
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,514
Master He is giving out gold ingots
over there.

66
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,145
Gold ingots?

67
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:44,554
And why would he do that?

68
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,485
Cuihong and the girls only need to
have a cup of wine,

69
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:49,750
and they'll get a piece of gold
weighing five taels.

70
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,822
Master Wang, we...

71
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,013
Sit down first.

72
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,485
A gold ingot only weighs five taels.

73
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,153
These are money orders.

74
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:08,556
Guess how much each of them is worth?

75
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:11,415
How could we guess?

76
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:12,887
Let me have a look.

77
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,719
Tell you what,

78
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:18,620
the smallest amount is ten taels,

79
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,088
and there're ones with fifteen
to thirty taels,

80
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,052
there's one with fifty taels,

81
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:30,120
depends on your luck.

82
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,058
Wait, it's more fun
when we have more people.

83
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:38,421
Got it...

84
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,583
I want more.

85
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:46,212
Cuibing.

86
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:46,914
I want more.

87
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,218
Cuibing, Cuihong, come here.

88
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:50,312
What is it?

89
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:52,653
Hurry over to Master Wang,
there's a draw for...

90
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,156
money orders; whatever you pick is yours.

91
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,656
But it's gold here!

92
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:58,726
Silly girl, there'll be at least
ten to twenty taels,

93
00:07:58,824 --> 00:07:59,791
and fifty taels the most.

94
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:00,482
Fifty taels?

95
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,522
Yes.

96
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,785
Hurry...

97
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,652
Where are the money orders?

98
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,822
Alright...

99
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,084
Let's begin.

100
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:19,956
Twenty.

101
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,522
Fifteen.

102
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,217
Twenty five.

103
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,222
Good for you.

104
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,218
Only ten.

105
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,355
And you?

106
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,686
Thirty?

107
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,656
Me too.

108
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:32,986
And me.

109
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,455
What about you?

110
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,423
Ten.

111
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:43,188
Damn it!

112
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:48,292
Those cheap whores!

113
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,257
Cheap whores!

114
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,356
There's one with fifty taels, go on.

115
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,221
Wait.

116
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:03,059
Draw? Whatever you get from this pile,

117
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,391
you'll get fifty taels at the most.

118
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:10,782
Wow! They are gorgeous.

119
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:17,157
This pearl necklace alone is worth
100 taels.

120
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,955
100 taels? Really?

121
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:28,731
There's more, emerald, ruby, coral... etc.

122
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,727
Those would worth more.

123
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,019
I think you'll like these.

124
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,561
Yes, we do!

125
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,718
Follow me.

126
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,089
Wait.

127
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:48,225
Wait, jewelry? I've got those too. Look.

128
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,956
They are really gorgeous.

129
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,318
Move away.

130
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:07,454
So you're in the same business.

131
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,520
That's right.

132
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,955
Where are you based?

133
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:20,655
Beijing. It's my 1st time south
in Guangdong province.

134
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,691
Is that how you do business in the north?

135
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,923
In our line of business,

136
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,157
there're no rules as long as
the goods are genuine.

137
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,289
No rules in doing business?

138
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,887
I want to see how good you are.

139
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:37,059
What are you doing?

140
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,361
Beating folks; is that your business
way down south?

141
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,857
You've got to be equipped.

142
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,525
We sit down to do business in the north.

143
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,324
Go to hell!

144
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,496
Stop it!

145
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:02,490
Stop it!

146
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,061
Stop it!

147
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,093
Stop the fight!

148
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,421
Stop!

149
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:15,690
Move away...

150
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:20,757
Stop it!

151
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:23,332
Surround the boat!

152
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,355
Move away...

153
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:27,295
Stop it!

154
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:31,127
What is it, officer?

155
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,495
Someone reported that one of
the two cases in here was

156
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:36,465
the one missing in magistrate's office
a few days back.

157
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,596
It's stolen?

158
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,695
Whose is this big one?

159
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,130
It's mine.

160
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:54,460
What about the small case?

161
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,256
Is it yours?

162
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,124
Speak up.

163
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:02,028
No...

164
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:02,860
Is it yours?

165
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,865
Arrest them all.

166
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,093
It's mine.

167
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:13,393
Is that the truth?

168
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,329
Yes.

169
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,557
My friend, you're drunk.

170
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,598
You...

171
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,624
I'm a jeweler,

172
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,531
I brought these two cases from Beijing.

173
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,430
I don't care whether you're from
Nanjing or Beijing.

174
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,297
Wait.

175
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:32,860
I've got proof.

176
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,660
This is my proof.

177
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,027
Yes.

178
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:54,337
There's nothing under my feet,
you needn't search.

179
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,332
Yes.

180
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:58,835
Wang Qinqin is an honorable business man.

181
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,528
We can wrap up and leave now.

182
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,503
This jeweler is quite resourceful.

183
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,166
Wait.

184
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:12,895
What is it?

185
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,402
My friend is really drunk,

186
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,937
he has lots of valuable belongings on him,

187
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:26,799
it's unsafe on the road,

188
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:29,200
please escort him home.

189
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:29,996
Certainly.

190
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,195
Come on, let's go.

191
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,327
I'm not drunk, it's fine.

192
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,160
This is mine.

193
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:39,533
You're really drunk, my friend.

194
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,264
I'll take care of this.

195
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,495
Go.

196
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,604
I'm not drunk, let me go.

197
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,233
Move aside...

198
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:53,897
Master Wang.

199
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:56,869
Bastard, you played a joke on me

200
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,436
just because you've got connections?

201
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,503
You're dead the next time I see you.

202
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:07,162
My head is clear.

203
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,237
Clear?

204
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:11,433
Yes, I feel much better now being
in the fresh air.

205
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,704
Are you sure?

206
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,169
Of course.

207
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,569
Look! It's my place over the bridge.

208
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,800
Are you sure?

209
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,872
Yes, of course, I'll show you.

210
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,037
Look! I can walk straight.

211
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:30,069
You can go now, buddies.

212
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,370
What's to watch? Get lost.

213
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,766
Let's go.

214
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:44,262
I'm not drunk.

215
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,632
You con artist from Beijing,

216
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:55,469
Don't trick me just because
you've connections, okay!

217
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,267
This is Guangdong.

218
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,033
It's good wine.

219
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:29,999
Boss Li, I've been to a lot of places,

220
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:32,199
and I've tried all types of wine.

221
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,536
But this is my first time

222
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,107
to try old wine in Guangdong.

223
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:39,540
Right, and it's my first time
I was made a fool.

224
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,805
Oh, it's you, Brother He.

225
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,407
Why are you dressed like this?

226
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:49,865
We often change attire in our line
of business.

227
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:53,175
Don't tell me you don't even know that.

228
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:55,165
Boss Li,

229
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:57,139
this friend was also

230
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,071
in the jewelry business,

231
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,803
but now... he's become a fisherman.

232
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,569
You! Damn it!

233
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,039
It's been a while, Brother He.

234
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:12,939
How have you been? Please sit...

235
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,703
Since you are friends,

236
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,900
and meeting here today by coincidence,

237
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:20,000
why don't you join us for a drink?

238
00:16:21,408 --> 00:16:22,773
Get the wine.

239
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,705
Here.

240
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,233
I think you can return

241
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,831
my jewelry to me now.

242
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:33,441
Let's not talk about business today.

243
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,270
Yes, we...

244
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,809
Put the pot here.

245
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:37,568
Yes.

246
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,607
Please...

247
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,834
I'm done drinking, now I want to
get my merchandise.

248
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,368
There's no need to rush.
Everything takes time.

249
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:58,504
Fortune Telling,

250
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:03,103
ask me anything about your future,

251
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:10,642
I'm "Wrath of Ten Thousand Buddhas"

252
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,372
Pay up...

253
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:18,001
Refill...

254
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:21,068
Anyone needs his fortune told?

255
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:23,633
Why didn't you carry the case with you?

256
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,678
How could I carry jewelry around?

257
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,139
How could you?

258
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:30,405
How could I carry jewelry around?

259
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,138
Lower your voice, just lead me to it.

260
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:32,972
Sure...

261
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:38,876
So these handicapped people
are your friends.

262
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,172
Move away, we're not his friends.

263
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,237
He Zhen.

264
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,642
The "Four Handicapped Devils"

265
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,075
That's right, you stole our
godfather's jewelry,

266
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:53,008
hand it out.

267
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:55,910
But he stole it from someone,

268
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:57,741
I just borrowed it temporarily.

269
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:58,607
What's the big deal?

270
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,769
Bastard.

271
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,835
You have a short lifeline.

272
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,174
A blind person could read the palm?

273
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,770
Even a blind guy can see that
you can't escape doom.

274
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,644
1st stroke of Buddha's Palm,
"Buddha's Light 1st Ray"

275
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,269
Second stroke,
"Buddha's Palm moves mountain"

276
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,043
Third stroke, "Buddha's Palm
penetrating the heart"

277
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,848
Fourth stroke...

278
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,404
It must be
"Buddha's Palm having a seizure"

279
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,507
Fifth, "Buddha's Palm fanning"

280
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
I won't fall for that,
you think I'm really blind?

281
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,343
Damn kid, playing Drunken Fists

282
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:04,436
Can you do it well?

283
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:08,010
You can't fight while drunk,
it's the Waken Fists.

284
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,240
Waken Fists? Good.

285
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,539
Sixth stroke,
"Buddha's Palm squashing flies"

286
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,711
And this can be
"Clasping Buddha's Feet at last minute"

287
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:31,982
Take a break,

288
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,446
next.

289
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:39,447
Cripple, watch out!

290
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:07,583
Stand still.

291
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:15,841
Also a fake?

292
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,848
You'll need this now.

293
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,282
And it's the third round.

294
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:23,019
Left... right...

295
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,509
Come on.

296
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:28,343
How come?

297
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,153
That was a strange move.

298
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,186
What do you know?

299
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:49,588
I'm "One-Armed"; this is
"Backhand penetrating heart"

300
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:51,622
only a few can dodge this.

301
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,521
I'm dying.

302
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,616
Blood is everywhere,
I think we know who won.

303
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,849
Silly, that's Wujiapi (liquor).

304
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,015
Why are you using two hands?

305
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:22,317
I feel numb if I hide it too long.

306
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:24,555
You ruined your image.

307
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:27,519
Hide it.

308
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:32,555
That's right.

309
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,724
Tenth stroke,
"Buddha jumping over the wall".

310
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,192
This is the best place for wine.

311
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,021
Of course, we're good people,
we deserve the best.

312
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,417
Excuse me.

313
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:02,222
Come back.

314
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,591
We're here to drink, what's wrong?

315
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,125
A source informed us that
there's a jewelry thief here.

316
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,755
Ajewelry thief? Where?

317
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:12,120
Say no more, go to the
magistrate's office.

318
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,156
Let me explain.

319
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,783
You can explain in front of
the magistrate, go.

320
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,092
Wait, I'll be right back.

321
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:26,757
He Zhen is a good man.

322
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,293
Take him with you, and set him free
right away.

323
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:30,051
Yes.

324
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:31,757
Go.

325
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:32,689
Yes.

326
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,982
You can go now.

327
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,289
Master He is out.

328
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:46,492
Master He, thank you.

329
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:47,025
Thank you...

330
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:49,856
What for?

331
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:53,055
You sent a jeweler to our village,

332
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,650
and has donated a lot for
our Chen Village.

333
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,660
Thank you so much...

334
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,352
What did I donate?

335
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,990
Jewelry.

336
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:03,889
Really?

337
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:36,494
Shut up, continue.

338
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,019
You...

339
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,186
Old Wang.

340
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,227
How did you know me?

341
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:43,659
Not only that I know you.

342
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:44,854
Your voice...

343
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:49,788
Sounds familiar to you?

344
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:52,420
Oh it's you!

345
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,759
You must be here to thank me

346
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:57,887
since I've done a good deed
on behalf of you.

347
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:00,389
Being a Robin hood... I can do that
on my own.

348
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,190
You donated my jewelry,

349
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:03,456
why didn't you donate yours?

350
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,793
Brother He, yours were all stolen goods.

351
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:07,919
And yours...

352
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,226
I'm a jeweler.

353
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,597
Fine, then I'll rob you now.

354
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,220
How can you?

355
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,057
Can't I?

356
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:17,226
Hand it out.

357
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,897
My bonsai.

358
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:23,829
Cuihong, help.

359
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,755
Cuihong, you...

360
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:28,057
I...

361
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,357
She's my bodyguard.

362
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:32,889
500 taels, quite a lot, right?

363
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:33,621
Right.

364
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,193
Bodyguard? Then you must know
martial arts.

365
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:43,494
But you couldn't be my match,

366
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:46,498
you know this is no joke.

367
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:47,495
Are you scared?

368
00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:48,495
Yes.

369
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:49,564
Scared to kill him?

370
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:52,159
You don't need to kill him,

371
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:53,662
just teach him a lesson.

372
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:54,890
Teach him a lesson?

373
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,225
You want to teach me a lesson?

374
00:26:58,564 --> 00:26:59,462
Nice.

375
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,391
You're good.

376
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,191
Your martial arts is as good as
playing Pipa.

377
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:20,966
Right, don't hit so hard.

378
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:30,825
Pipa.

379
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:35,292
You're quite deft at pipa

380
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,526
You know internal kung fu?

381
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,325
Watch out, this vase is from Ming Dynasty.

382
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,069
That must be "the Hen spreads her wings"

383
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,623
Impressive.

384
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,065
He grabs a knife.

385
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,664
Help! Help!

386
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:48,200
Call the officers.

387
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:53,692
Madam Wang.

388
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:07,464
It's fair that both of you are armed.

389
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:24,967
Get out from the window.

390
00:29:27,703 --> 00:29:28,431
Give up evil and do good deeds.

391
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,468
What for?

392
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,265
Alright, there's no need to go after him.

393
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,202
I'll thank your supervisor another day.

394
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:39,863
Head back, I'll finish this.

395
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,664
Yes.

396
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:43,437
Let's go...

397
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:47,732
Cuihong, are you alright?

398
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:13,467
Queer, it isn't a big wound,
why does it hurt so much?

399
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:17,963
These painkillers aren't working.

400
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:22,728
Calm down.

401
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,100
You said that my forehead wound
will cure in 3 days;

402
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,002
It's been five days, and it keeps
bleeding...

403
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:27,594
what should I do?

404
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,434
We've given you the best medicine.

405
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,903
What kind of head do you have?

406
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:35,269
Niuhuang, Shexiang (musk),
it's only getting worse.

407
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:41,475
It's a strange wound,

408
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,266
I can't heal it.

409
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:44,135
What? It's not curable?

410
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,968
No, I can refer you to a famous doctor.

411
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:46,766
Where?

412
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,631
Don't move.

413
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:06,995
Not good.

414
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,437
What's wrong, doctor?

415
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,370
The wound's been poisoned.

416
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:12,598
Poisoned? What kind?

417
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,238
I have no idea.

418
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,331
Can you do something, doctor?

419
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,375
I can't, but I think

420
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,439
you find the guy who did this to you
for the antidote.

421
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:29,265
Cuihong.

422
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,672
Move away...

423
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,674
Where's Cuihong?

424
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:49,469
Where's Cuihong?

425
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,535
Who's looking for Cuihong? Oh, it's you.

426
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:54,874
How's your head?

427
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,273
I'm here to look for her because of that.

428
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,306
Where is she?

429
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:03,168
She's real lucky, Master Wang has paid
for her freedom.

430
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,835
She's free? Where's that Wang?

431
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,699
He...

432
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:08,570
Tell me, hurry.

433
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:10,643
Okay...

434
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:14,575
He lives in Fuan Inn in Xiguan area.

435
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,868
Master Wang, this landscape painting

436
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,535
is by Liu Wenchuan of Song Dynasty.

437
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:28,036
It's rare you can collect the works
of Liu Wenchuan.

438
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:29,938
I heard Boss Yang is the only person

439
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:32,910
besides Prince Qinqin,

440
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,671
who owns his work.

441
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,437
Yes...

442
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:41,535
Prince Qinqin is a well-known collector,

443
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:44,406
if only we could befriend him,

444
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,705
that's a real blessing.

445
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,868
Yes...

446
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:49,238
It's not as difficult as it seems.

447
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,174
I heard that the prince likes to befriend

448
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:54,302
antiques and art collectors.

449
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,106
And he likes the good wines of Guangdong.

450
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,938
Also...

451
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:00,842
Also, a friend like me in the
trading business.

452
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:03,542
Oh, Brother He.

453
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,969
Why are you dressed like this?

454
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:07,669
Are you in some kind of a new trade?

455
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,801
You sly fox, I'm gonna beat you

456
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,967
It's fine...

457
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,679
We're mates. This is our way of
saying 'Hello'

458
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:17,211
Who's your mate?

459
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:19,867
Where are you hiding Cuihong?

460
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,474
Who... Cuihong?

461
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,170
The girl on the boat.

462
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:29,345
Oh, you mean Lady Cuihong.

463
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:31,735
We only collect art and antiques,

464
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,073
we don't collect women.

465
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,009
Right...

466
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:37,878
Stop playing dumb.

467
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:39,711
Where are you hiding Cuihong?

468
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:40,778
I really have no idea.

469
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,441
Be careful.

470
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:45,072
Will you tell me?

471
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,670
How's your head?

472
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,406
My head...

473
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:56,643
What are you doing?

474
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,807
Cuihong's sword had a poisonous tip,
that's what

475
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,311
happened to my wound.

476
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:04,574
I've been to all the doctors,
they couldn't help.

477
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:07,173
That's bad.

478
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,278
She must hand me the antidote.

479
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:11,713
She's long gone.

480
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:12,905
Sorry?

481
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:18,844
Wait, don't take this wrong.

482
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,574
What he just did

483
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,113
was part of our way to do business.

484
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:22,872
My head...

485
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,878
I have the antidote.

486
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,907
He's here today

487
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:30,038
is to ask me about herbal medicine,

488
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:33,412
I'm sorry that I can't entertain you.

489
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:36,176
Sorry about it, excuse me...

490
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,008
No problem.

491
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:38,978
We'll come back another day.

492
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,672
Yes, another day.

493
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,942
Goodbye...

494
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,571
Pack up...

495
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:50,448
I didn't learn any of Cuihong's
martial arts skills,

496
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:54,483
but she's passed me the prescription
of the antidote.

497
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:56,242
Hand it out.

498
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,443
No rush, let's talk about terms first.

499
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,536
Conditions...

500
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:04,541
Cuihong mentioned that if you're poisoned,

501
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:07,583
it will only get worse if you're angry.

502
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,008
What are the terms?

503
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:13,747
Take me as your master.

504
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:14,941
Shit!

505
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,515
Look at my fist,

506
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:21,412
do you think you're good enough
to be my master?

507
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:25,282
Maybe not this, but for this, yes.

508
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:27,580
You're playing a trick on me again.

509
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:35,947
Right...

510
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:38,711
you must kneel in front of your master.

511
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:40,776
Kneel...

512
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,212
And kowtow...

513
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,079
Antidote.

514
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:55,040
Second kowtow.

515
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,680
Oh no, this is the last packet.

516
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,818
Third kowtows.

517
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:08,875
Where's the prescription?

518
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:10,075
In here.

519
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:12,040
You...

520
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,482
If you break my head, then I won't be
able to tell you.

521
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,049
Come here.

522
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:18,949
Write it down.

523
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,518
I can't.

524
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,644
I promised Cuihong

525
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,151
that I wouldn't leak the prescription,

526
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,685
or I'll be destroyed by heaven and earth.

527
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,251
Where's Cuihong now?

528
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:34,447
She's become a hermit.

529
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,212
Then I...

530
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,846
If you follow me everyday,

531
00:36:38,952 --> 00:36:41,978
I'll give you the antidote once every
three days,

532
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:44,781
and your wound will slowly heal.

533
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:47,853
I'll move in then.

534
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,785
No, I've already

535
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:52,216
prepared another room for you.

536
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:55,718
So it's premeditated.

537
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:58,582
Right, I want you to be a good person.

538
00:36:58,686 --> 00:36:59,550
You...

539
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,883
Wait for me in room 'yu',

540
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,111
I'll give you the antidote.

541
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:10,683
Come back, you haven't greeted me
as your master.

542
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:13,116
Yes, master.

543
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,077
Fourth Prince.

544
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,552
I've done what you asked me to,

545
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,347
I've placed informants all around
the province,

546
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,683
we'll kill him when there's any
sight of him.

547
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:25,879
There's no need for you to travel

548
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,385
so far to Guangdong.

549
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:27,952
Slave.

550
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:28,747
Yes.

551
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:32,284
What you did was too obvious.

552
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,684
I rushed here because of that.

553
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,778
If the news spread to the Court,

554
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,515
they will execute me, you useless thing.

555
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,954
Yes, I could deal with it by myself.

556
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:47,956
Not you, you're a general,
and he recognizes you.

557
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:50,716
Don't show your face until
the last minute.

558
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:54,418
Fourth Prince, you mean...

559
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,455
I know his trip to Guangdong

560
00:37:57,554 --> 00:37:59,545
is about wine tasting,

561
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,054
and collecting paintings and antiques,

562
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,179
you can start with that.

563
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:05,515
Think up a plan.

564
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,213
Yes.

565
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:29,944
There's more over there.

566
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:32,983
Where are you going, student?

567
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:35,890
My so-called master, I'm bored here,

568
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:38,048
you keep drinking and admiring antiques

569
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,249
and all those paintings all day.

570
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:41,583
I'm not interested,

571
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:44,385
I've got to go out and stretch, bye.

572
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:49,754
Kid.

573
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,823
Who're you talking to?

574
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:51,786
You!

575
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,680
Do I look like a kid to you?

576
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,088
Sorry, where's Master Wang?

577
00:38:57,423 --> 00:38:58,151
Over there.

578
00:38:58,256 --> 00:38:59,120
Who's looking for me?

579
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,082
He is.

580
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:05,920
Student, you must treat our guests
politely.

581
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:09,318
Please walk him in.

582
00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:11,516
Walk him in? Come.

583
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:13,381
Be careful.

584
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,282
I'm here to deliver an invitation.

585
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,357
From whom?

586
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,057
What's his name?

587
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,057
From my master Fan Tiangang.

588
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:32,955
Fan Tiangang, owner of a winery,

589
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:33,888
he often hosts parties.

590
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:40,323
Student.

591
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:42,421
What now?

592
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,356
Aren't you bored?

593
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:47,256
Boss Fan has invited me to
the floating brothel

594
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:49,758
for a wine tasting,

595
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:50,984
you can tag along.

596
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,285
Fine, since I haven't been there
for a while.

597
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,885
Thank you for

598
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:05,324
treating me to wine tasting here.

599
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,117
You're very welcome.

600
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:10,218
I heard that you're a wine-tasting expert,

601
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:13,090
since you've traveled all the way here
from Beijing,

602
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,888
I'm honored that

603
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:16,822
you've accepted my invitation.

604
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:17,619
The pleasure is mine.

605
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:18,852
Come, let's drink another glass.

606
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,618
Sure.

607
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:20,215
Refill.

608
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:21,224
Yes.

609
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,291
Master.

610
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,291
Student...

611
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:38,788
You really lack etiquette!

612
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:40,986
Come and stand by your master.

613
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:43,186
You really think I take you for my master?

614
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:44,521
I'm only here because of this...

615
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,121
Isn't that enough?

616
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,127
Come here and greet Mr. Fan.

617
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,551
That's fine,

618
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,686
just let him sit there and listen
to the tunes.

619
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:55,651
Master Wang, let's have another drink.

620
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,454
Good idea.

621
00:40:57,427 --> 00:40:57,950
Cheers.

622
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,789
Cheers.

623
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,854
So smooth.

624
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,852
Master Wang, the wine isn't good enough.

625
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:09,187
Xiaolu.

626
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:09,817
Here.

627
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,792
Do we have something special
for the guest?

628
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:14,385
Yes, nine different old wines.

629
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,252
What's the first one?

630
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,521
Celestial tortoise and deer wine.

631
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,994
That's a strange name.

632
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:25,723
Master Wang, want to try?

633
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:26,726
Sure.

634
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,157
Please.

635
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:28,921
Okay.

636
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,386
Please.

637
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:34,720
Please sit.

638
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:35,658
Please.

639
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:38,758
Here's the wine.

640
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:48,428
Very special.

641
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:49,291
Please.

642
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:54,852
Is this how I drink it?

643
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:56,362
Not like that,

644
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,427
like this.

645
00:42:02,662 --> 00:42:04,391
It's not fun to drink alone,

646
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,622
let me drink to you.

647
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:07,492
You are very kind.

648
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:10,130
Xiaolu, bring the wine.

649
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,889
Yes.

650
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:23,056
Master Wang, please.

651
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:36,526
What do you think of this wine?

652
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:39,657
Mellow taste, smells good, good wine.

653
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:42,261
Another one

654
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:42,955
Yes.

655
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:52,499
Mr. Fan, this is the first one,
what's the second?

656
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,726
Five Dragons Two Tigers wine.

657
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,693
Dragon and tiger, must be very strong.

658
00:42:58,798 --> 00:42:59,492
That's right.

659
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:12,527
Please.

660
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:14,495
Please.

661
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,397
Very fragrant.

662
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,590
Thank you.

663
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:31,296
The taste is infinite.

664
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,692
Please have some more.

665
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:41,658
Dragon rising.

666
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:44,891
Tiger leaping.

667
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,926
This doesn't seem like a Guangdong wine.

668
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:53,067
You know a lot about wines.

669
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,294
We have plenty more.

670
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,061
Let's go over there.

671
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,029
What's the name of this, Mr. Fan?

672
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:09,193
The famous Three Snakes Wine of Guangdong.

673
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,623
Which three types of snakes?

674
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:14,332
The galls of cobras,
striped kraits, spotted vipers

675
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:17,198
This wine is especially for
impotent problem.

676
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,333
He knows a lot.

677
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:27,399
You're from Beijing?

678
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,526
This fan weighs three taels.

679
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:34,032
Good guess.

680
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:34,600
Then...

681
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:36,795
Shut up, don't interrupt.

682
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:39,894
We're tasting wine here,

683
00:44:40,002 --> 00:44:40,900
go play outside.

684
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:42,733
I'm off then.

685
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:46,624
Watch your head.

686
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:50,565
Got it, I'll wait for you outside.

687
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:55,234
Please.

688
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,397
The mix of the taste is different.

689
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,236
- Please.
- Please.

690
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,661
Master Wang, you're quite a drinker.

691
00:45:30,003 --> 00:45:31,402
Five Chickens White Phoenix Wine.

692
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:32,299
Yes.

693
00:45:33,804 --> 00:45:34,498
Please.

694
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,465
Very unique pair of cup.

695
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:10,067
Don't go.

696
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:11,936
Fox bone and papaya wine.

697
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:20,967
Fox bone and papaya wine?

698
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:22,967
Please.

699
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:23,731
Alright.

700
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:27,231
Still drinking even when so drunk.

701
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:30,873
My so-called Master, could we go now?

702
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,668
Student, once you get to taste
some good wines,

703
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:36,933
you should try to locate its source.

704
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,337
What's to find out? It's all from
Guangdong.

705
00:46:39,873 --> 00:46:42,307
You're not from Beijing, what do you know.

706
00:46:42,939 --> 00:46:43,803
Just a second.

707
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:46,568
Wait... what's the big deal even
it's from Beijing?

708
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:47,969
So arrogant.

709
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,173
This is monkey...

710
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:00,365
Monkey embryo deerhorn wine.

711
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,205
I think we should wrap up today, Mr. Fan.

712
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:29,367
All your wines are from Beijing, right?

713
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,072
Sit.

714
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:49,004
So you've arranged everything.

715
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:51,804
That's right, until you drop.

716
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:56,240
Whose idea is this anyway?

717
00:47:56,909 --> 00:48:01,073
It's my idea. You don't need
to know the rest.

718
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:04,344
I have a few more, do you want to try?

719
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:07,570
I might not be the one who's drunk.

720
00:48:11,876 --> 00:48:12,968
Xiaolu.

721
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,041
He's drunk.

722
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,341
And you're getting there.

723
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:32,077
Mr. Fan, you're really drunk.

724
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:35,969
Stop drinking.

725
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:39,478
Thanks for treating me to so much
Guangdong wine.

726
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:42,101
We'll drink again another time, goodbye.

727
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,303
I'll walk myself out, Mr. Fan.

728
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:58,872
Don't push...

729
00:49:00,444 --> 00:49:01,877
Let's go, master.

730
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:05,774
They...

731
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,537
They're drunk.

732
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:09,702
And you?

733
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:13,247
A little.

734
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:17,376
Hey, you take care of them.

735
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:18,410
Yes, Master Wang.

736
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:19,773
Let's go, student.

737
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:27,809
They sacrificed for the fourth prince,

738
00:49:27,912 --> 00:49:30,472
and they didn't reveal their identities.

739
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:33,206
You should learn from them.

740
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:37,146
Yes, I'll follow your orders, General.

741
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:39,214
Are you confident?

742
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,908
Absolutely.

743
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,904
Even if he could dodge my shoes,

744
00:49:56,813 --> 00:49:58,713
he won't be able to dodge the painting.

745
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,108
Your wound won't heal that soon.

746
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:24,410
How much longer?

747
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:27,309
Do you know him?

748
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:29,276
"To Master Wang"

749
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,747
It's an invitation.

750
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:32,205
Zhu Yifeng.

751
00:50:32,314 --> 00:50:34,282
Zhu Yifeng, who's he?

752
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:35,871
Owner of an antique store.

753
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:37,278
I don't know guys like him,

754
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:39,042
I've zero interest in antiques.

755
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,078
This will heal your wound.

756
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:48,047
What are you up to now?

757
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:49,910
How do I know whether this is genuine

758
00:50:50,015 --> 00:50:50,879
or fake?

759
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:53,608
Just like before.

760
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:56,445
Give me the antidote once every
three days.

761
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:58,277
You must follow me then.

762
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,510
Fine, since you're so loyal,

763
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:04,584
I'll take care of you.

764
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:07,310
Of course! What if my wound goes bad?

765
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:09,816
Hey, messenger.

766
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:12,274
Master Wang.

767
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:14,714
Go back and tell your master

768
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:19,082
to get his most precious antiques out
for my review.

769
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:20,607
Yes.

770
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:21,877
Please.

771
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:24,347
Master, they're here.

772
00:51:24,883 --> 00:51:27,147
Are you Mr. Zhu?

773
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,846
Yes, and he is...

774
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:33,180
I'm Master Wang's... student.

775
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:34,181
And he is Master Wang.

776
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,880
Master Wang, please.

777
00:51:48,117 --> 00:51:50,847
These are the so-called antiques?

778
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,815
He Zhen, what do you know?

779
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,009
You're so rude.

780
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:55,742
Rude?

781
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:00,914
Please sit.

782
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:03,743
Please.

783
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:30,855
Boss Zhu, the antiques seem quite
impressive.

784
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:34,010
Thanks.

785
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,210
Let's go look at something else.

786
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:35,943
Sure.

787
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:42,282
He Zhen,

788
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,810
we admire antiques, not use them.

789
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:49,079
Do you agree, Boss Zhu?

790
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:51,277
Please help yourself.

791
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:02,385
This is Song Dynasty's...

792
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:03,882
Ming Dynasty's.

793
00:53:04,786 --> 00:53:07,414
Master Wang, this is stone carved.

794
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:11,451
Ancient, from two dynasties before,

795
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:14,620
it's impossible to find these days.

796
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:17,278
And this piece,

797
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,181
first-grade carving, and...

798
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:29,353
it's made by thirty catty green stone.

799
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:31,513
Guess how heavy it is?

800
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:38,379
Master, it must be two catty!

801
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:39,454
What do you know?

802
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:43,055
Only a catty, right?

803
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:48,448
Better be careful.

804
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:50,415
Right.

805
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:57,353
Master Wang, those are of ordinary grade.

806
00:53:57,788 --> 00:54:01,986
I do have more precious ones
from Tang & Ming Dynasty.

807
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:04,445
Please take a look.

808
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:09,254
Since I'm here to admire your antiques,

809
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:13,086
I need to see more to determine
the source.

810
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,784
Right... please.

811
00:54:16,155 --> 00:54:19,750
Boss Zhu, my student is not
interested in antiques,

812
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:21,379
maybe he should wait for me outside.

813
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,787
Good idea. Since I know nothing about

814
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:26,449
admiring and playing with antiques.

815
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:34,124
What are you looking at?
I'm not a piece of antique.

816
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:37,618
It's fine that Master Wang's here,
let him go.

817
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:38,621
Yes.

818
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,686
Please continue.

819
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,484
That was strange, why did they
block my way?

820
00:54:56,724 --> 00:55:00,160
White jade from Tang Dynasty,

821
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,691
Nice carving.

822
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,814
Thank you.

823
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:17,051
It's very hard. Nicely made...

824
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,458
Thank you for your compliment.

825
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:25,225
Boss Zhu, this was passed down
from the Court.

826
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,291
They're fine.

827
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:43,750
Do you have anything else?

828
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:48,027
Daffodil's pot with sunflower pattern
from Song Dynasty

829
00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:50,258
South Song or North Song?

830
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:51,348
Late South Song period.

831
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,589
Nice pot...

832
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:07,957
Impressive, Master Wang.

833
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:10,391
Who gave you these antiques?

834
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:13,018
It will only ruin our day if I tell you.

835
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,323
Please continue.

836
00:56:17,426 --> 00:56:18,518
What else?

837
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,761
Rare calligraphy paintings.

838
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,690
Please.

839
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:43,256
Please.

840
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,386
Icy breeze and famous springs.

841
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,961
Impressive.

842
00:56:53,227 --> 00:56:53,955
And...

843
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:03,653
Sharp brush, really made an impression,

844
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:06,421
Yes, it's difficult to find now.

845
00:57:09,128 --> 00:57:12,097
Why are they going in circles?

846
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,628
Shoes with blades?

847
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,319
Why are you fighting?

848
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:26,398
So my Master knows kungfu.

849
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:31,161
Good moves.

850
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,830
Spare my life, prince.

851
00:59:02,932 --> 00:59:06,698
Boss Zhu, who sent you to kill me
in the court?

852
00:59:07,766 --> 00:59:09,631
I dare not to say.

853
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:15,530
Slave, speak up before
the Eleventh prince.

854
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:18,024
Eleventh Prince?

855
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:19,055
Come on, speak.

856
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,498
It's Prince...

857
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,598
Which one?

858
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,824
I've sworn that I wouldn't tell,

859
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,230
or he'd kill me.

860
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,700
You know I'd kill you too!

861
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,532
Okay...

862
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:36,634
I tell you... his order is inside
this calligraphic art

863
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,998
you'll know after you've read it.

864
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,226
Hand it over.

865
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:40,958
Yes.

866
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,868
Master...

867
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:08,128
Help me, we must get out now.

868
01:00:27,935 --> 01:00:31,962
Student He Zhen...

869
01:00:36,135 --> 01:00:38,467
General, I've found out that
the person who helped him

870
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:40,537
was his servant he hired in Guangdong.

871
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:44,226
Do you know who he is?

872
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:47,267
General, he's a thug, doing some
illegal trading.

873
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:48,700
That's easy,

874
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:50,269
you two split up,

875
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,235
& focus on the places where
illegal traders gather,

876
01:00:52,336 --> 01:00:53,496
ask around about him.

877
01:01:06,004 --> 01:01:07,028
Doctor...

878
01:01:08,103 --> 01:01:09,661
When will he heal?

879
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:14,095
The wound's deep, and his bone's
wounded too,

880
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,762
so are his tenderloins.

881
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:18,737
He couldn't walk easily even
the wound closes.

882
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:20,771
Is he going to be a cripple?

883
01:01:21,271 --> 01:01:22,499
It's not that bad,

884
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:25,299
he can walk normally after a while.

885
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:26,393
Then...

886
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,634
Say no more.

887
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:30,797
I know my condition, walk the doctor out.

888
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:31,563
Yes, Master.

889
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,264
"Mountain God Temple"

890
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:38,833
You know the drill, don't tell anyone

891
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:39,927
that we live here.

892
01:01:40,337 --> 01:01:43,135
Don't worry, it's not my first time

893
01:01:43,238 --> 01:01:45,229
dealing with people like you.

894
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:46,703
This is your pay.

895
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:47,532
Thanks.

896
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,838
And...

897
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:51,502
What?

898
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:55,598
Are there eleven princes...

899
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:57,465
Princes?

900
01:01:58,171 --> 01:02:00,503
There are fourteen.

901
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:02,698
Right... fourteen.

902
01:02:02,805 --> 01:02:05,899
But who will the Majesty pass
his throne to?

903
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:09,969
So they're fighting for it.

904
01:02:10,072 --> 01:02:11,562
They all want to be the next emperor.

905
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:12,366
Enough.

906
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:14,934
Got it. Please.

907
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,233
Okay...

908
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:22,266
Fourteen, the throne.

909
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:28,667
I didn't fight for the throne.

910
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:31,264
I'm not interested in the throne.

911
01:02:32,573 --> 01:02:36,669
I only love antiques and paintings,

912
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:38,001
and all kinds of good wine.

913
01:02:38,773 --> 01:02:41,469
The most important things is
practising martial arts.

914
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,209
No wonder you came to Guangdong,
your kungfu...

915
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,768
You must use your
martial arts skills right,

916
01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:51,500
if you abuse it,

917
01:02:51,607 --> 01:02:53,871
and gain by taking others' lives,

918
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:55,600
shame on those.

919
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,041
Remember that.

920
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,038
You can go now.

921
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:05,631
I'll leave after you're healed.

922
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,035
I can take care of myself.

923
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:09,999
You can't heal on your own.

924
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:12,234
If they are here,

925
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:13,603
I'll fight with them.

926
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:15,666
Your skills?

927
01:03:16,974 --> 01:03:19,841
Yes, I know it's inadequate, but...

928
01:03:21,808 --> 01:03:23,969
I must learn from you, Master.

929
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:25,868
Kick.

930
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:35,669
Stop, the angle is too wide.

931
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,640
It won't be powerful if the range
is not big.

932
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,669
If you kick like this,

933
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,074
your opponent will notice.

934
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:43,937
What?

935
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:50,976
Turn around.

936
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:55,934
Kick to both sides.

937
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:00,698
Watch your shoulders.

938
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:04,841
Kick.

939
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,334
Faster.

940
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:23,537
Go on.

941
01:04:31,543 --> 01:04:32,703
Kick backwards.

942
01:04:37,844 --> 01:04:40,813
You broke all the oil lamps,
why the clapping?

943
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,811
I wasn't clapping, master,

944
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:44,606
I was burnt by the wax.

945
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:48,107
Do you want to continue?

946
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:49,838
Yes.

947
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:12,672
Stop.

948
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:16,606
You only use your thigh

949
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,475
but not your lower leg,

950
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:20,638
that's why your shoulders move.

951
01:05:32,113 --> 01:05:35,571
Do you have any idea that

952
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,147
the deal is worth 5,000 taels of gold?

953
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:42,138
It's huge,

954
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:43,645
can we handle that?

955
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:46,778
Listen...

956
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,247
It's easy money,

957
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,211
do you know a guy named

958
01:05:52,313 --> 01:05:55,009
He Zhen in your business?

959
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:57,014
He Zhen? Who?

960
01:05:57,114 --> 01:05:58,138
He is worth five thousand taels?

961
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,043
He Zhen?

962
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,479
Not him,

963
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,640
but a wounded person next to him,

964
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:07,580
he's the target.

965
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:09,503
Master.

966
01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:11,513
Listen.

967
01:06:12,314 --> 01:06:18,480
I want him dead or alive.

968
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:21,311
And you will be rewarded,

969
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:26,944
but you must know that

970
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:29,915
it will be a fifty fifty split.

971
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,983
Do the math,

972
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:38,252
if I hand it to him, the money
will be halved;

973
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:41,909
but by handing it to the General
I'll get all.

974
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:45,345
Seven Bitters of East River, sit...

975
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:47,645
What's the matter?

976
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:52,675
I want to talk to you about some business.

977
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:32,416
Not bad, kicks and retreats fast,

978
01:07:32,517 --> 01:07:33,950
keep the shoulders level.

979
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:36,941
My leg's on fire, master.

980
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,075
I must kick faster to make it go out.

981
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:41,014
Shut up and keep going.

982
01:07:58,084 --> 01:07:59,176
Back kick.

983
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,687
Right, the hands above, kicks below.

984
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:14,480
This kicking style

985
01:08:14,585 --> 01:08:18,021
is called Shadow less Feet.

986
01:08:20,585 --> 01:08:23,418
If I continue like this,

987
01:08:23,518 --> 01:08:24,951
I'll end up as a roasted pig.

988
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,712
Come on.

989
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:55,243
Calm down.

990
01:09:06,253 --> 01:09:07,185
Someone's here.

991
01:09:08,453 --> 01:09:09,442
Who is it?

992
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:10,485
It's me.

993
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:13,380
Master, it's a woman.

994
01:09:14,054 --> 01:09:15,282
Notjust one,

995
01:09:16,754 --> 01:09:18,016
there are seven or eight of them.

996
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:18,951
Seven or eight?

997
01:09:20,154 --> 01:09:23,055
You must stay away from women
while you're practising.

998
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,551
Master, I guess they've got
the wrong address.

999
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:27,851
Who're you looking for?

1000
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:31,087
He Zhen.

1001
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:34,213
Master, they're looking for me.

1002
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,920
Why would they know about this place?

1003
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:38,114
I didn't...

1004
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:42,047
Who are you?

1005
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:45,151
Seven Bitters (sounds the same
as tiger) of East River

1006
01:09:45,922 --> 01:09:47,981
Master, there're seven tigresses.

1007
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:49,817
Ask them what they want?

1008
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:53,656
What do you want to see me for?

1009
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:58,522
I want to talk business with you.

1010
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:00,783
Master, I've never worked with
women before,

1011
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:03,849
I guess they must be something.

1012
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:05,253
Master, you go inside first,

1013
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:06,379
let me deal with them.

1014
01:10:07,489 --> 01:10:10,424
Why are you men so slow?

1015
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,786
I'll charge in if you won't open the door.

1016
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:17,215
Open up... hurry.

1017
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:18,381
I can't wait any longer, I'm coming in.

1018
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,616
Coming.

1019
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:24,850
Hurry...

1020
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:32,257
What do you ladies want?

1021
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:37,755
Where are the ladies?

1022
01:10:39,124 --> 01:10:41,115
All you can think of are the ladies.

1023
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:44,516
So you're the Seven Tigers of East River?

1024
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:47,558
We're not that vicious.

1025
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:52,321
We're the Seven Bitters, not Tigers.

1026
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:58,991
Worshipping the deities so late!
You're very pious.

1027
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,216
I was practising...

1028
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,948
Practising to be a celestial being.

1029
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,822
Shut up, what do you want?

1030
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:08,086
You're very bold.

1031
01:11:08,191 --> 01:11:10,455
I heard you have something good.

1032
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,615
Something good?

1033
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:15,387
Very valuable,

1034
01:11:15,492 --> 01:11:18,723
a total worth of five thousand taels.

1035
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:20,223
What's so valuable?

1036
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:23,761
The one with you called Wang...

1037
01:11:30,026 --> 01:11:34,656
He Zhen, if you work with us,

1038
01:11:34,759 --> 01:11:39,696
then we can split the five thousand.

1039
01:11:40,092 --> 01:11:41,753
Work with me?

1040
01:11:43,559 --> 01:11:47,495
Are you worthy enough for me
to work with you lot?

1041
01:11:47,593 --> 01:11:49,356
Of course.

1042
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:54,226
We all are very skilled,

1043
01:11:54,326 --> 01:11:58,490
but of course I'm the most gentle one,

1044
01:11:58,593 --> 01:12:04,156
They all call me "Suku" (complain).

1045
01:12:04,693 --> 01:12:08,390
No wonder you have so much bullshits,
cousin.

1046
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:13,595
You want to beat someone up?

1047
01:12:13,693 --> 01:12:17,060
Right... we have one called "Aiku" (endure)

1048
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:28,987
Don't worry, he won't fight back,
just begin.

1049
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:32,154
That's where he got his name from.

1050
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:49,258
That's right, you've worked hard.

1051
01:12:49,361 --> 01:12:51,454
We have one called "Kukou" (bitter mouth)

1052
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:21,465
And of course we have
"Kumian" (bitter face)

1053
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:51,066
Kumian (Sad expression),
and there's "Waku" (ridicule)

1054
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:11,292
Have you had enough? What for?

1055
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:15,689
What for?

1056
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:23,834
Sparkling gold, you're all dizzy.

1057
01:14:23,932 --> 01:14:26,298
Why not?

1058
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:34,291
I like...

1059
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:36,390
And you?

1060
01:14:36,699 --> 01:14:39,793
Too heavy, I don't.

1061
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:43,129
If you're still so stubborn,
drink bitter tea, come.

1062
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,095
Drink up, brat.

1063
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,500
After you've tried our bitter tea,

1064
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,534
and you'll change.

1065
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:18,703
Come on, and... change!

1066
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,200
Now you should work with us.

1067
01:15:25,566 --> 01:15:28,194
Whatever you say, dear.

1068
01:15:29,434 --> 01:15:32,369
Are you impressed now?

1069
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:35,528
Yes.

1070
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,296
What happened?

1071
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,967
Old devil, you can't play me.

1072
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,763
So you don't want to team up with us?

1073
01:15:44,868 --> 01:15:45,732
Sure.

1074
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:51,265
Have you seen an arm like this?

1075
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:53,660
I've seen bigger.

1076
01:15:53,768 --> 01:15:56,862
But not so muscular.

1077
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:03,195
You're in this for real..."Aiku" (endure)

1078
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:13,399
Student, come inside.

1079
01:16:26,635 --> 01:16:28,102
That's him, catch him.

1080
01:16:28,603 --> 01:16:29,467
Don't let him run.

1081
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:35,272
Wait, don't panic.

1082
01:16:35,703 --> 01:16:36,829
With these stack of money orders,

1083
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:40,304
you don't need to worry about
anything from now on.

1084
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:42,871
My master knows that you're only
doing it for money,

1085
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,835
with these,

1086
01:16:44,937 --> 01:16:48,703
you can go wherever you want.

1087
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:50,701
Money orders.

1088
01:16:51,636 --> 01:16:53,866
They could be fake.

1089
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:56,336
Fake? These are used by royalty.

1090
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,701
You can cash them all over the country,
Beijing, Yunan,

1091
01:16:58,803 --> 01:17:02,330
Sizuan, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Chaozhou,
anywhere.

1092
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:04,200
How much?

1093
01:17:05,304 --> 01:17:06,737
Fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty,

1094
01:17:06,837 --> 01:17:12,070
ninety, one hundred, two hundred,
a total of 500 taels.

1095
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:13,495
Silver or gold?

1096
01:17:13,604 --> 01:17:14,332
Gold of course.

1097
01:17:14,437 --> 01:17:15,768
Gold.

1098
01:17:18,704 --> 01:17:19,830
What are you doing?

1099
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:21,871
I was right, master.

1100
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:24,902
Hand those to them.

1101
01:17:25,004 --> 01:17:25,527
Yes.

1102
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:32,669
Search.

1103
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:33,534
Yes.

1104
01:17:52,272 --> 01:17:54,399
He's good.

1105
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:59,135
He can hide away from the surveillance.

1106
01:18:00,572 --> 01:18:03,700
It's the 3rd of July,

1107
01:18:04,272 --> 01:18:07,730
His Majesty will announce
his successor in two months,

1108
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:10,539
pass the orders down,

1109
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:15,201
increase security on all the roads,

1110
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:17,935
I don't think he could make it.

1111
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,699
Yes.

1112
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,434
That's right, keep it up.

1113
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:31,639
Why did you stop?

1114
01:19:31,742 --> 01:19:33,369
Master, there's only half a month

1115
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:35,705
until His Majesty announces his successor.

1116
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:38,243
I fear that you're still not healed
by then.

1117
01:19:38,343 --> 01:19:39,776
And because of this,

1118
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,002
I've pushed you

1119
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,576
to practise everyday.

1120
01:19:42,676 --> 01:19:44,200
We've been practising here

1121
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,641
for over a month already,

1122
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:47,209
why there's no signs of anything?

1123
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:50,873
Maybe they're scared of you.

1124
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:52,871
I doubt that,

1125
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:55,176
they're up to some conspiracy.

1126
01:19:55,977 --> 01:19:56,909
What conspiracy?

1127
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,372
Find a tough bamboo rod

1128
01:20:03,476 --> 01:20:03,999
for my walking stick tomorrow.

1129
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:04,701
Yes.

1130
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:10,768
I need a wheelchair.

1131
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:11,468
Yes.

1132
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,637
And plenty of paper umbrellas.

1133
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:16,438
Yes.

1134
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:30,910
The walking stick is done.

1135
01:20:39,245 --> 01:20:40,439
And the rest?

1136
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:42,672
We've umbrellas & wheelchair ready;
can leave tomorrow.

1137
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:45,638
Anything unusual?

1138
01:20:45,745 --> 01:20:46,837
Nothing.

1139
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:48,810
No sightings of those people,

1140
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:51,213
I've guessed right,

1141
01:20:51,312 --> 01:20:53,610
Surely they'll intercept on
our way back to Beijing.

1142
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:54,736
There's nothing to be scared about,
master,

1143
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:56,710
we've got everything ready.

1144
01:20:56,812 --> 01:21:00,077
Never underestimate them, student.

1145
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,875
There are many kung fu experts
working for the court,

1146
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:06,278
and you've trained for long.

1147
01:21:06,379 --> 01:21:09,974
Remember, when you fight the opponent,

1148
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:11,478
be sure to stand close to me.

1149
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:12,170
Yes.

1150
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,842
My master the prince,
this is a strange deserted town,

1151
01:21:48,948 --> 01:21:51,007
it's so windy since we entered.

1152
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:54,415
This is a windy area,

1153
01:21:54,514 --> 01:21:57,449
its former residents built this town
to block the wind,

1154
01:21:58,181 --> 01:22:00,046
in the end it couldn't resist the storm,

1155
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:01,308
and fell apart.

1156
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:06,742
No wonder it's deserted now.

1157
01:22:07,648 --> 01:22:10,014
I've told you to stay close to me.

1158
01:22:10,648 --> 01:22:13,139
My master the prince, why did you
pick this road?

1159
01:22:13,248 --> 01:22:15,375
It's not a good road, and no one's around.

1160
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,915
It's a shortcut, saves up to 1

1161
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,609
that's why we must go through, push.

1162
01:22:31,782 --> 01:22:32,646
Back.

1163
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:01,375
Nice umbrellas!

1164
01:24:23,986 --> 01:24:26,250
Mongolian iron beads cape, watch out!

1165
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:09,351
Mongolian guard.

1166
01:26:12,324 --> 01:26:13,951
Who sent you here to kill the 11th Prince?

1167
01:26:17,023 --> 01:26:19,253
Did General Liang Jingcheng send you?
Speak.

1168
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,749
Come on.

1169
01:26:25,324 --> 01:26:27,952
It's late, take him with us.

1170
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:28,546
Yes.

1171
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:39,950
No arrows...

1172
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:56,291
Fourth Prince...

1173
01:26:58,725 --> 01:26:59,623
My fourth brother.

1174
01:27:00,124 --> 01:27:00,590
Why would he?

1175
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:01,249
Come on.

1176
01:27:01,358 --> 01:27:02,017
Yes.

1177
01:27:24,826 --> 01:27:26,191
My master the prince,
there are so many soldiers here,

1178
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:27,759
are they here to welcome you?

1179
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:31,124
He must have sent them to guard the gates,

1180
01:27:31,225 --> 01:27:32,920
so that I couldn't go into Yangxin Hall.

1181
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:35,018
We fight our way in.

1182
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:37,754
No, if we do that,

1183
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:39,053
it will alarm the whole Court,

1184
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:42,557
and if my father finds out about my trip,

1185
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:43,648
he'll lecture me.

1186
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,226
We'll walk further and go in
through Beiping Hall.

1187
01:27:49,193 --> 01:27:50,660
Close the door.

1188
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,289
Ninth Brother, where's Eleventh brother?

1189
01:28:05,794 --> 01:28:07,022
How would I know?

1190
01:28:07,927 --> 01:28:08,586
Do you?

1191
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:09,786
It's an important day...

1192
01:28:10,194 --> 01:28:11,718
He must have gone out to play.

1193
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:39,188
It's been a while, Eleventh Prince.

1194
01:28:40,128 --> 01:28:41,618
General Liang Jingcheng.

1195
01:28:43,495 --> 01:28:45,963
Are you here to welcome us
or to block our way?

1196
01:28:46,062 --> 01:28:47,051
Both.

1197
01:28:48,262 --> 01:28:50,662
You've got some nerves, you dare to block

1198
01:28:50,762 --> 01:28:53,890
the 11th Prince from attending
the ceremony?

1199
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:55,327
Who gave you the orders?

1200
01:28:55,429 --> 01:28:56,123
He Zhen.

1201
01:28:56,228 --> 01:28:56,887
Yes.

1202
01:28:57,362 --> 01:28:59,660
That's between me and the other princes,

1203
01:28:59,762 --> 01:29:01,662
it's none of you slaves' business.

1204
01:29:01,762 --> 01:29:02,387
Yes.

1205
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:16,660
He Zhen.

1206
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:17,730
Yes.

1207
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:20,663
Those two are experts, be careful.

1208
01:29:20,763 --> 01:29:21,422
Got it.

1209
01:30:29,732 --> 01:30:30,699
Attack on both sides.

1210
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:42,793
Tsai Yang Blade.

1211
01:31:03,233 --> 01:31:04,097
Come.

1212
01:31:05,033 --> 01:31:05,965
Be careful his blade.

1213
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:19,534
You deal with them.

1214
01:33:19,638 --> 01:33:20,366
Yes.

1215
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:57,207
My master the prince.

1216
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:59,938
General Liang's Tsai Yang Blade skill

1217
01:36:01,344 --> 01:36:02,368
has reached perfection.

1218
01:36:04,144 --> 01:36:07,773
Of course, General Liang contributed
a lot when

1219
01:36:07,877 --> 01:36:10,539
he was guarding the borders.

1220
01:36:10,644 --> 01:36:11,542
What kind of contributions?

1221
01:36:11,877 --> 01:36:15,040
Hundreds of our enemy died in his hands.

1222
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,133
Impressive.

1223
01:36:21,244 --> 01:36:22,268
General Liang.

1224
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:26,740
Who gave you the orders?

1225
01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:28,642
Shut up, it's not a slave's question.

1226
01:36:44,812 --> 01:36:48,771
His Majesty is here.

1227
01:36:56,646 --> 01:36:58,375
Here comes Eleventh brother.

1228
01:36:59,312 --> 01:37:00,244
Fourth Brother.

1229
01:37:02,946 --> 01:37:03,674
Your hat.

1230
01:37:12,146 --> 01:37:16,674
Long live our royal father...

1231
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,304
Arise...

1232
01:37:18,413 --> 01:37:19,880
Thank you, royal father.

1233
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,276
Pearls.

1234
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:26,306
Your walking stick.
