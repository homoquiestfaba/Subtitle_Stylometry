00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:45,609
But... do you consider yourself
<i>as</i> a happy person?

179
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,611
Is this because I'm not ready
to be a mother?

- Other hand, please.
- Absolutely not.

181

- But I've only done the left one.
- Sorry.

This has nothing... nothing to do
with you not being a mother.

See the future. Yes.

- Cool.

1390
01:35:45,144 --> 01:35:47,236
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing,

1391
01:35:47,311 --> 01:35:50,107
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa.
See you Monday."

1392
01:35:50,186 --> 01:35:52,584
I mean, I'm just some kind of
box you had to check, aren't I?

1393
01:35:52,644 --> 01:35:54,236
No...

1394
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:08,853
I did love you, Hector.

1395
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:16,811
But I love Alan now.

1396
01:36:18,644 --> 01:36:20,895
Guess what?

1397
01:36:20,977 --> 01:36:24,819
Whatever it is you think
you're in love with...

1398
01:36:24,894 --> 01:36:26,815
it's not me.

1399
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:59,278
I know what you're thinking,

(CHUCKLING)

1403
01:37:05,228 --> 01:37:08,195
yet happiness is going down.

1404
01:37:08,269 --> 01:37:11,361
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

1405
01:37:11,436 --> 01:37:15,312
How many of us, I wonder,
can recall

1406
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:20,317
a childhood moment
when we experienced happiness

1407
01:37:20,395 --> 01:37:22,145
<i>as</i> a state of being?

1408
01:37:22,228 --> 01:37:25,979
That single moment
of untarnished joy.

1409
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:32,687
That moment when everything
in our world inside and out...

1410
01:37:34,353 --> 01:37:36,899
was alright.

1411
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:40,194
Everything was alright.

1412
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:47,232
But, now, we become
a colony of adults

1413
01:37:47,311 --> 01:37:50,607
and everything is all wrong
all the time.

1414
01:37:50,685 --> 01:37:51,936
(CHUCKLING)

1415
01:37:52,019 --> 01:37:56,486
It's <i>as</i> if we were on a quest
to get it back,

1416
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,731
and yet the more we focus
on our own personal happiness,

1417
01:37:59,811 --> 01:38:01,732
the more it eludes us.

1418
01:38:01,811 --> 01:38:05,403
In fact, it's only when
we are otherwise engaged,

1419
01:38:05,478 --> 01:38:09,694
you know, focused, absorbed,
inspired, communicating,

1420
01:38:09,769 --> 01:38:12,940
discovering, learning,
dancing, for heaven's sake,

1421
01:38:13,019 --> 01:38:18,565
that we experience happiness
as a by-product, a side effect.

1422
01:38:18,644 --> 01:38:19,860
Oh, no.

1423
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:21,811
We should concern ourselves

1424
01:38:21,894 --> 01:38:24,895
not so much with the pursuit
of happiness,

1425
01:38:24,977 --> 01:38:28,319
but with the happiness
of pursuit.

1426
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:33,604
But how do we
measure happiness?

1427
01:38:33,685 --> 01:38:36,481
Emotions are like colors, you know.

1428
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,403
Difficult to explain once
but not now, not anymore.

1429
01:38:41,477 --> 01:38:45,523
All those who read auras,
step aside,

1430
01:38:45,602 --> 01:38:47,694
- this is science.

My portal into the mysterious
minutiae of human emotions.

1436

Emotions that
for the very first time,

1437
01:39:06,311 --> 01:39:10,982
we can separate, specify
and quantify in actual units.

1438

Now, this male subject
is Japanese.

1439
01:39:14,061 --> 01:39:16,481
Look at the abundance
of bright orange

1440
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,527
around the happiness area,
verging on ecstasy.

1441
01:39:20,602 --> 01:39:23,478
It's <i>as</i> if the brain

And here we go again,
same Japanese gentleman,

1445
01:39:30,644 --> 01:39:32,770
eleven hours later,

1446
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:37,354
the color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide,

1447
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:40,436
otherwise known
as an excruciating hangover.

1448
01:39:40,519 --> 01:39:44,895
Ask yourselves,
is this worth that?

1449
01:39:44,977 --> 01:39:46,693
(APPLAUSE)

1450
01:39:49,477 --> 01:39:52,523
Oh, thank you!
You first, Agnes.

1451
01:39:52,602 --> 01:39:55,569
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes, we made a deal.

1452
01:39:55,644 --> 01:39:57,895
Off you go into

1453
01:39:57,977 --> 01:39:59,477
Helmet on.

1454
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,232
I want you to imagine yourself
in three situations.

1455
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:04,982
One that makes you
very happy, one very sad,

1456
01:40:05,061 --> 01:40:08,107
and one very scared.
Recent memories can be useful.

1457
01:40:08,269 --> 01:40:12,440
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

1458
01:40:14,477 --> 01:40:16,353
They say I'm a mind reader.

1459
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:17,651
It's a bloody lie, I'm not.

1460

As I thought,
you're an open book.

1464
01:40:50,936 --> 01:40:52,561
Sad, scared, happy
in that order.

1465
01:40:52,644 --> 01:40:55,440
- Final answer.
- Wow, yeah!

1466
01:40:55,519 --> 01:40:59,191
- You're good.
- Your turn, Hector.

1467
01:40:59,269 --> 01:41:00,940
Um, you know what,
I think I'm gonna...

1468
01:41:01,019 --> 01:41:03,690
- Your turn, Hector.
- Okay.

1469
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:07,278
Get over yourself.
You weren't in any of mine.

1470

Oh, right.

Sit, my dear.

1472
01:41:13,352 --> 01:41:15,944
By way of identifying
the emotions,

1473
01:41:16,019 --> 01:41:19,440
I've assigned a color to each
corresponding part of the brain.

1474
01:41:19,519 --> 01:41:20,895
It's pretty obvious, really.

1475
01:41:20,977 --> 01:41:23,568
Sunny yellow, happy,
ice blue, sad,

1476
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:27,020
battery-acid green, fear.

1477
01:41:27,103 --> 01:41:29,819
It corrodes you, you know.

That's odd.

1485
01:42:03,186 --> 01:42:07,062
It's as if he's filtering,
moderating his feelings.

1486
01:42:07,144 --> 01:42:10,940
Something's holding him back,
some kind of barrier.

1487
01:42:21,519 --> 01:42:25,315
No, no, no, these are not
the emotions of a grown man.

1488
01:42:25,394 --> 01:42:26,736
Tell me about it.

1489
01:42:26,811 --> 01:42:28,482
He's going to have
to dig a lot deeper.

1490

There is no deeper.

Would you take me
to the airport, please?

Warrior.

1560
01:49:24,185 --> 01:49:25,901
(Agnes laughing) Oh!

1561
01:49:28,352 --> 01:49:30,352
Oh, Jesus!

1562
01:49:31,268 --> 01:49:33,439
- Oh, I love you.
- I love you.

1563
01:49:33,519 --> 01:49:35,394
- Bye, bye, bye.
- I'll ship your bags.

1564
01:49:35,477 --> 01:49:37,648
Go, go. Passport!

What did you learn?</i>

1569
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:04,770
(STAMMERING) It was amazing.
Amazing!

1570
01:50:04,851 --> 01:50:07,147
I am so ready to go home,

1571
01:50:07,227 --> 01:50:10,353
to get back to my girl,
my work.

1572
01:50:10,435 --> 01:50:11,731
I can't wait to tell
my patients.

1573
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,482
<i>Tell them what?</i>

1574
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:18,811
That we all, all of us
have the capacity to be happy.

1575
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:22,231
<i>Higher than that, Hector.</i>

1576
01:50:25,768 --> 01:50:29,769
That we all have a right
to be happy?

1577
01:50:35,851 --> 01:50:37,568
Oh.

1578
01:50:39,602 --> 01:50:41,568
I see.

1579
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,980
We all have an obligation
to be happy.

<i>NARRATOR: Once upon</i> a <i>time,</i>

1581
01:51:01,602 --> 01:51:05,102
<i>there was a young psychiatrist
called Hector</i>

1582
01:51:05,185 --> 01:51:08,061
<i>who was very satisfied
with his life.</i>

1583
01:51:08,143 --> 01:51:10,519
And far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking,

1584
01:51:10,602 --> 01:51:11,772
and I don't mean to pry,

1585
01:51:11,851 --> 01:51:14,272

go any faster?

His world was complex,</i>

1591
01:51:36,435 --> 01:51:39,151

- Ooh!

And he <i>liked it</i> that way.

1595

<i>Sometimes with surprising results.</i>

1601
01:52:09,227 --> 01:52:11,852
It looks...
it looks acceptable.

1602
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:17,894
Now then, Anjali,
beware the ego's need

1603
01:52:17,976 --> 01:52:19,817
for shaping hallucinations.

1604
01:52:19,893 --> 01:52:24,940
Huh, looks like somebody's ego shaped
a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

1605
01:52:27,352 --> 01:52:29,603
What?!

1606
01:52:29,684 --> 01:52:30,730
Mm-hmm.

No more pretending.
