1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,173
(whooshing)

2
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:07,941
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,222
(somber piano music)

4
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:37,438
(inspiring instrumental music)

5
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,584
- That's what you fucking
 said the last time.

6
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,520
- You're making a big
 deal out of nothing.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,524
- Oh, you can just go to
hell, you motherfucker.

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,265
- It's just Melony Proctor.

9
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,667
She's a fucking whore anyway.

10
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,735
It's her job.

11
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,443
- How am I supposed to have
 a real conversation with you

12
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:19,046
when you're dressed
like this fucking Bozo?

13
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,686
- Bitch, don't you
 ever fucking mock me.

14
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,654
- Why not?

15
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,456
Who else is laughing?

16
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,791
Except maybe Melony Proctor.

17
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,501
- You come back
 here and take it.

18
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,170
Come on.

19
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,206
So you think I'm a joke, huh?

20
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,340
I'm the man around here.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,008
I'm the fucking man.

22
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:58,919
Fuck.

23
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,929
(somber music)

24
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,542
What you doing?

25
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,677
- Nothing.

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,282
- I don't know.

27
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,219
Doesn't look like nothing to me.

28
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,520
Here, let me see.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,888
- Hey, give it back!

30
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,989
- Wait.

31
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,924
- Give it!

32
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,259
- This ain't so impressive.

33
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,460
(laughing)

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,961
Calm down, why don't you?

35
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,196
Just calm down.

36
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,798
Wait a minute.

37
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,014
Nah, this is shit.

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,723
Don't get all weepy now.

39
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,560
You don't want to be labeled
 a cunt like your mother.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,861
Do you?

41
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,096
(laughing)

42
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,714
What do you think, Larry?

43
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,949
You think I'm funny, right?

44
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,361
What's the matter with you, kid?

45
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,696
You never laugh.

46
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,565
All the times I've known you,

47
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,735
I can't even get you
 to crack a smile.

48
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,675
You must be as fucking dense

49
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,646
as these ignorant pig
 fuckers around here.

50
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,215
- You're the worst clown ever.

51
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,049
- Really?

52
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,118
Not funny?

53
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,354
Not funny?!

54
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,022
I'll show you funny, kid!

55
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,023
- Let me go!

56
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,160
Stop!

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,830
(ominous music)

58
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,865
- Give me that.

59
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,866
- Let me go.

60
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,936
- You want funny? You got it.

61
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,671
(laughing)

62
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,905
- Get off me.

63
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,173
- Am I touching you?
 Am I touching you?

64
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,042
Am I touching you?
 Am I touching you?

65
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,611
Am I touching you?
 Am I touching you?

66
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,879
Coochie, coochie-choo.

67
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,514
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

68
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,650
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

69
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,418
You wanted funny! You got it!

70
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,453
(laughing)

71
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,487
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

72
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,555
Coochie, coochie-coo.

73
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,889
I work so hard.

74
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,958
I slave away for you bastards

75
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,426
to get a descent wage.

76
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,396
You'd think I'd get
 a little support.

77
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,997
A little kindness?

78
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,566
A little glad?

79
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,434
(laughing)

80
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,135
Look at this bullshit.

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,070
I don't know what's
 going on here.

82
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,672
What is this?

83
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,840
(gasping)

84
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,249
Hey, what's going on here?

85
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,419
(gagging)

86
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,996
There's something
 wrong with the kid!

87
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,830
Lyla!

88
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:32,900
- Larry!

89
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:38,606
What did you do to my baby?

90
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,440
Oh my god.

91
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,943
God damn it, call 911.

92
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,944
- All right.

93
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
- Baby, look at me.

94
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,950
Baby, it's okay, honey.

95
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,553
- Yeah, is this the police?

96
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,655
Yeah, this is Dale again.

97
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,393
We've got a bit of an emergency.

98
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,494
It's my girlfriend's kid.

99
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,095
He's having a
brainstorm or something.

100
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,330
I don't know.

101
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,799
Look, we need an ambulance.

102
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,802
Maybe he's dying or something.

103
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,070
I don't know.

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,273
I told you before,
 the kid's a tard.

105
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,107
Yeah.

106
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,678
A few minutes?

107
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,312
All right, I'll
 be expecting you.

108
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,147
All right.

109
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,520
(dramatic piano music)

110
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,604
- Hey.

111
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,772
I thought I'd try
 you one last time

112
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,307
before I leave in the morning.

113
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,141
I know.

114
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,178
Peyton, I know.

115
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,013
Would you cut me some slack?

116
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,514
We're just chilling
 one last time

117
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,017
before I leave in the morning.

118
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm flying out first
 thing in the morning.

119
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,321
No excuses.

120
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,423
(radio rock music)

121
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,492
Hey, I gotta go.

122
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,827
Yeah, I'll call you after--

123
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,928
- You ready to roll?

124
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,229
- I love you too, bye.

125
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,198
What's up, guys?
 - [Guy] What up, dude?

126
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,465
- How you been, man?

127
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,300
Good to see you.

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,602
- Good to see you guys.

129
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,535
What's up?

130
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
- All right, before we go,

131
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,373
I got some shit
 you guys gotta see.

132
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,077
- He's been going on and
 on about this shit all day.

133
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,679
- Well, what is it?

134
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,115
- You know my cousin upstate?

135
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,085
He's being paroled.

136
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,353
- Paroled?

137
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,988
- Come on, fucker,
 get to the point.

138
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,790
- All right, don't
 rush me, Jesus.

139
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,558
You're fucking up my story here.

140
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,060
- Story?

141
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,229
You're not exactly Hemingway.

142
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,230
- Hemingway?

143
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,465
Whatever.

144
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,301
Before he got taken away,

145
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,136
his crew

146
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,440
they planted some shit
 out here, you feel me?

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,942
Some good shit.

148
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:35,776
- No shit.

149
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,344
- No shit, indeed.

150
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,146
- Listen, it's your
 call, college boy.

151
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,081
You're the one whose gotta
 catch a flight in the morning,

152
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,751
but if you say the
 word, we'll split.

153
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,718
- Come on, man.

154
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,486
Xbox and beer our last night?

155
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,320
Fuck that.

156
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,691
Come on, for old times sake.

157
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,524
- I guess.

158
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,628
Why bother flying if you
can't fly high, right?

159
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,663
(laughing)

160
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,397
- That's my boy.

161
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:01,935
Tony, you better be right
 about this shit though.

162
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,936
- Follow me.

163
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,892
(somber piano music)

164
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,500
(enchanting instrumental music)

165
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,197
Motherfucker.

166
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,832
- What is that?

167
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,067
- That guy over there.

168
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,003
He's pissing all
 over the product.

169
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,104
- Fuck it, let's
 just get out of here.

170
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,739
- No, fuck that shit.

171
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,607
That's your cousin's
 legacy, right?

172
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,142
You're gonna let some
 asshole come out here

173
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,744
and piss all over his legacy?

174
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,145
- Fuck no.

175
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,380
- Yeah, that's right, boy.

176
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,948
You go get that shit
and while you're at it,

177
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,117
show that fucker who's boss.

178
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,451
- Fucking right.

179
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,687
Hey, asshole.

180
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,527
What the fuck you
 think you're doing?

181
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,362
- Taking a piss.

182
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,598
- You asking or
 telling, old man?

183
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,267
(ominous music)

184
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,772
You ain't going nowhere.

185
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,276
- I didn't realize
 you wanted to watch.

186
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:27,447
I could try to take another
 pee if it'll make you happy.

187
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,184
- You motherfucker.

188
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,986
(intense music)

189
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,822
- Tony, what the fuck?

190
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,925
- You motherfucker!

191
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,359
You fucking scum!

192
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:45,532
Fucking ruined the fucking
 shit, you motherfucker!

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,103
You fucking pissed on my shit!

194
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,440
You hear that guy?

195
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,042
He's a fucking fag or some shit.

196
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,343
- Calm down.

197
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,911
What the fuck is wrong with you?

198
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,547
(intense music)

199
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,458
(eerie music)

200
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,035
- Whatever.

201
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,771
When you two are done
 stroking each other's cocks.

202
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,007
You know, fuck both you guys.

203
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,341
- What the fuck? Fuck you.

204
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,542
- You're fucking psycho.

205
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,510
I didn't think you'd
 actually do it.

206
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,711
- Did you hear?

207
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,645
He called me a fucking
 fag or something?

208
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,947
He's just a fucking old man.

209
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:34,848
- You okay?

210
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,685
(gagging)

211
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,455
(ominous music)

212
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,771
(screaming)

213
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,328
(foreboding music)

214
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,203
(laughing)

215
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,796
(knocking)

216
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,032
(coughing)

217
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,137
- Fuck.

218
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,872
(knocking)

219
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,441
- [Man] Professor Hanson?

220
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,876
- Be right there.

221
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,992
- Sorry I'm late, professor.

222
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,095
I was finishing that
 sketch last week.

223
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,834
I have some cool
 stuff to show you.

224
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,112
Check out this cool pen.

225
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,581
Doesn't it look very
 Marquis de Sade?

226
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,251
(ominous music)

227
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,220
This sketch.

228
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,096
(foreboding music)

229
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,036
Nathan said that he was
gonna come around six.

230
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:47,574
Something to do with his
 mom and pills or something.

231
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,077
Professor, what happened here?

232
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,481
What happened to your eye?

233
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,487
- Long night.

234
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,156
(ominous music)

235
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,009
(stepfather laughing)

236
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,344
- [Stepfather]
 Think I'm funny now?

237
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,745
I'm funny, right?

238
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,114
You gonna laugh?
 You think I'm funny?

239
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,416
(laughing)

240
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,352
(foreboding music)

241
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,689
- Professor?

242
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,929
(somber piano music)

243
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,566
(eerie music)

244
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,406
Professor, are you okay?

245
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,119
(ominous music)

246
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,044
Professor?

247
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,243
(eerie music)

248
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,913
(exciting video game music)

249
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,452
(knocking)

250
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,786
- Go away.

251
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,855
(knocking)

252
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,590
Not coming.

253
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,926
(knocking)

254
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,261
It's open! Fuck!

255
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,364
- All right, motherfucker.

256
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,365
Where is he?

257
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,535
- Good morning, Peyton.

258
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,969
- Morning?

259
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,405
It is five in the
afternoon, dick fingers.

260
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,640
(video game music)

261
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,442
Where is he?

262
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,743
- He, as in?

263
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,177
- My brother.

264
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,980
- Brad's gone. You know that.

265
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,851
Now, you don't have to make
 excuses to come see me.

266
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,519
He didn't get on the plane,

267
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,389
he never called and
 he's not at school.

268
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,391
So where the hell is he?

269
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,229
- Your guess is as good as mine.

270
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,165
- And your guess would be?

271
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,000
That's what I thought.

272
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,770
- You can't just.

273
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,739
- We have a problem.

274
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,381
- I guess so.

275
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,784
Hey, where you going?

276
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,252
- To Troy's.

277
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,588
If anybody knows where
 he is, that bastard will.

278
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,155
They were supposed
 to hang that night.

279
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,991
- I'm coming with you.

280
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,793
- Why?

281
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,828
- You know.

282
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,464
Protection.

283
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,299
- Please.

284
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,513
(ominous music)

285
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,065
(moaning)

286
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,312
(evil laughing)

287
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,415
(moaning)

288
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,628
(giggling)

289
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,403
(groaning)

290
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,248
(foreboding music)

291
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,585
(groaning)

292
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,836
(gasping)

293
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,806
- Why are you doing this to me?

294
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,742
Please stop hurting me.

295
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,946
What are you doing?

296
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,448
What are you doing?

297
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,184
- Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

298
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,252
(laughing)

299
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,755
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

300
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,831
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

301
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,969
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

302
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,474
(knocking)

303
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,809
- Help!

304
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,444
Help me, please!

305
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,645
Please help!

306
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,882
- Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

307
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,117
(groaning)

308
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,489
(gagging)

309
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,991
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo.

310
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,498
(knocking)

311
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,534
(gasping)

312
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,026
(reggae music)

313
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,572
- Knock, knock.

314
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:35,808
What are you doing?

315
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,843
- Get the fuck in here.

316
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,177
Close that door.

317
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,313
What the fuck you two
 think you're doing

318
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,282
busting into people's
 homes like that?

319
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,116
- The door was open.

320
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,118
- Where's my brother?

321
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,554
- Shit.

322
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:48,387
What makes you think?

323
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,389
- Cut the shit, Troy.

324
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,624
- What the fuck did
 you say to me, bitch?

325
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,326
- What the fuck is going on?

326
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,328
- You wanna see a bitch?

327
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,366
You were with him last
 night and yet here you are.

328
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,334
So where the fuck is he?

329
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,375
I'm not gonna ask again.

330
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,577
- Yeah?

331
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:11,744
Then what?

332
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,479
You gonna cut me?

333
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,313
Please.

334
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,448
You have no motherfucking clue

335
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,218
the shit I've seen little girl.

336
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,887
- Where is he, Troy?

337
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,726
- Tony's in there.

338
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,295
He was the last one to see him.

339
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,201
You with her again?

340
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,169
- Never kiss and tell, my man.

341
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,805
- Yeah.

342
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,340
(heavy metal music)

343
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,910
(Tony moaning)

344
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,312
- Come on, now.

345
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,581
(yelling)

346
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,249
Shit!

347
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,084
Jesus Christ, get out!

348
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,186
- Where's Brad?

349
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,789
- How the fuck should I know?

350
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:57,624
- Enough!

351
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,092
Show me.

352
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,896
- No, I'm ain't
 showing you shit.

353
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,603
Let me go get my pants.

354
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,641
- Professor.

355
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,476
(foreboding music)

356
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,310
Sam?

357
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,249
Come on, is this a joke?

358
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,717
Get up.

359
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,152
Sam, come on.

360
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,055
(foreboding music)

361
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,493
- This is a bad idea.

362
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,662
- Keep moving.

363
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,702
- Tell us again about
this killer clown, Tony.

364
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:43,903
- Shut up, Conner.

365
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:44,837
- Shut up!

366
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,673
- All of you, shut the fuck up.

367
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,340
When I find Brad, I
 am whooping his ass

368
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,609
and then I am
 whooping all of yours.

369
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,478
- Damn, girl.

370
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,612
Fucking sexy.

371
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,446
- Shut up.

372
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,885
- There.

373
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,187
- Okay.

374
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,389
And?

375
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,326
- That's where we last saw him.

376
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm out of here.

377
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,495
- Wait.

378
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,496
- What happened?

379
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,498
- Just tell her already.

380
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,102
- Well, we came here looking
 for my cousin's stash

381
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,571
and there was this guy,
this creepy motherfucker

382
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,408
and he attacked
 us and we ran off.

383
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,445
We left Brad behind.

384
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,214
When we turned around

385
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,350
he was gone.

386
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,421
(ominous music)

387
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,225
- Listen,

388
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,893
you gotta understand.

389
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,561
What we saw was...

390
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,395
Crazy.

391
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,432
We weren't thinking.

392
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:49,501
- Yeah, he changed
 right in front of us.

393
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,403
The way his hair, his eyes,

394
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,807
I will never forget
 the look in his eyes.

395
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:58,044
- Turned into a clown?

396
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,346
- Call it what you want, man.

397
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,380
- I'm calling it
 what you guys said.

398
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,314
You did say a clown, right?

399
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,716
- I never said a fucking clown.

400
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,384
- You chicken shits.

401
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,089
You ran and you left
 my brother to die

402
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,827
so that someone wouldn't
find your stash.

403
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:15,661
- No.

404
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,330
It wasn't like that. No.

405
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,466
- I will kill you.

406
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:24,536
If he is dead, you're
 next, motherfucker.

407
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,973
You're both fucking next!

408
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,141
(yelling)

409
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,279
- Shit.

410
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,783
There goes our ride.

411
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,504
(intense music)

412
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,201
- Shit.

413
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,285
(somber piano music)

414
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,056
- We're gonna find him.

415
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:50,890
I mean it.

416
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,126
- He's dead, Conner.

417
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,463
(crying)

418
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,630
- Come on.

419
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,866
Don't say that.

420
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,135
We can go to the cops.

421
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,306
They'll have every officer
 in the city looking for him.

422
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,577
- They know his history.

423
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,579
They know his rap sheet.

424
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,250
If he's dead, they're
 not gonna give two shits.

425
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,752
They'll throw a fucking party.

426
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,056
He was a bad kid.

427
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:24,891
A kid.

428
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,929
And this was finally it.

429
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,600
Was finally his chance
 to get out of here

430
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:39,038
and to make
 something of himself.

431
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,874
I knew it.

432
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,547
I knew I should've stopped
 him from going out.

433
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:54,153
He was so fucking close, Conner.

434
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,889
He was so fucking close.

435
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,991
(crying)

436
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,197
- It'll be okay.

437
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,698
I'll help you out.

438
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,571
- I have to go.

439
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,739
- I'll come with you.

440
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:14,974
- No.

441
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,875
I'm fine, really.

442
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
Tomorrow, okay?

443
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,312
- Yeah.

444
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,147
Sure.

445
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,183
- Thanks.

446
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,852
For everything.

447
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,329
(car engine starting)

448
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,478
Hey.

449
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,213
It's me.

450
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:58,084
I just need to freshen up.

451
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,219
Be half an hour, all right?

452
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,588
All right, I'll see you soon.

453
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,239
- God, I need this.

454
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,941
I really need this.

455
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,878
- What is it you need, baby?

456
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,914
- She's the only thing
 that calms me, mom.

457
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,349
I can't help it.

458
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,451
Whenever I'm with
 her, I feel so alive.

459
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,621
(stepfather laughing)

460
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,857
- I'm sorry.

461
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,526
I'm sorry,

462
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:44,830
but if this bitch is the
 only thing you need, buddy,

463
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,400
you're more fucked
 up than we thought.

464
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,568
- You shut up.

465
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:51,837
- Or what?

466
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,773
- Leave him alone, you monster.

467
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,042
- Monster, aye?

468
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,977
That's cute.

469
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,714
Your precious baby boy kills
 three people in cold blood

470
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,383
and I'm the monster.

471
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,219
- I didn't do that.

472
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,454
Did I?

473
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,289
- Oh, you bet you did.

474
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,492
Tickled them.

475
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,593
Weird, right?

476
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,630
Except for that first one.

477
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,933
You ripped his
 throat out real good.

478
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,504
Now that was a mad
kill, if I ever saw one.

479
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,039
- No, no, no.

480
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,607
- Baby, calm down.

481
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,676
Dale's just messing.

482
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,080
Dale, tell Larry
 you're just messing.

483
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,913
Dale.

484
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:35,814
Tell Larry.

485
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,417
Dale.

486
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,818
- This can't be happening.

487
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,187
Not again.

488
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:42,688
- Oh it is.

489
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,456
Over and over and over and over

490
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,957
and over and over.

491
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,928
- What the hell
 did you do to me?

492
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,762
Answer me!

493
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,833
(foreboding music)

494
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,941
- I believe thank
 you is in order.

495
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,978
- Stop it! Stop it!

496
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,147
Stop!

497
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,581
Please, stop it.

498
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,416
Stop it!

499
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:18,056
(somber music)

500
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,628
- Don't act like
 you can't remember.

501
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,763
You can fool her.

502
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,433
You can fool yourself.

503
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:30,001
But you can't fool me, boy.

504
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,238
(laughing)

505
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:37,643
- What am I?

506
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,011
- You're a killer.

507
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,118
(knocking)

508
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,469
- Hello, Cherry.

509
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,204
- Why the long face, baby?

510
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,606
Let's get this party started.

511
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,909
- I had this one
 student in art class.

512
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,145
One day she wanted to
 be like Salvador Dali

513
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,813
and the next day René Magritte

514
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,883
and the next day she thought
 she was like Van Gogh.

515
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,852
She didn't know what she wanted.

516
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,121
- So that's why
 you quit teaching.

517
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,293
- No, I quit teaching because
 she wouldn't drop my class.

518
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,697
- You do some really great work.

519
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,599
- Thanks.

520
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,134
- I think when I quit teaching

521
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,171
it really got my creative
 juices flowing again.

522
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,339
I still teach.

523
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,073
A few local kids
 from the neighborhood

524
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,577
come here for art classes
 a couple times a week.

525
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,845
Nothing that pays the bills,

526
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,249
but at least I get to
 interact with people.

527
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,721
- Not a lot of interaction
 in your life, Larry?

528
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,227
- Sadly, no.

529
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,531
Listen to me.

530
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,199
I'm rambling like a madman.

531
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,468
Tell me about you, Cherry.

532
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:12,103
- Nothing much to tell, really.

533
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,508
- Can I assume Cherry
 isn't your real name?

534
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,743
- Next subject.

535
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:19,478
- Sorry.

536
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,748
It's just that I
 really care about you.

537
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,982
You come here so often,

538
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,685
I feel like we're more than just

539
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,354
customer and client.

540
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,624
I almost feel like we're...

541
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:33,459
- Friends?

542
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,995
We're friends, Larry.

543
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,033
If you really wanna know.

544
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,803
I recently lost my brother.

545
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,473
The only family I had left.

546
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,807
- What happened?

547
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,444
- He was murdered.

548
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,246
- Oh my god.

549
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,915
- At least, that's the
story that I'm getting.

550
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,517
But the ones telling that story

551
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,919
are a couple of burnout losers

552
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,488
with a sketchy track record

553
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:06,558
and an even sketchier
 relationship with the truth.

554
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,194
- Did they tell
 you what happened?

555
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,129
- Not exactly.

556
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,566
Just that he was
attacked in the woods by

557
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,872
a guy possibly dressed
 like a clown or some shit.

558
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,209
It's all fucking
bullshit if you ask me.

559
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,278
- A clown?

560
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,614
- Yeah.

561
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,148
Like I said.

562
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:30,982
Bullshit.

563
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,753
They did something to him.

564
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,488
I know they did

565
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,590
and when I find out what,

566
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,460
let's just say...

567
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,030
Fuck it.

568
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,568
Got anymore?

569
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,605
- Actually, that
 was my last bottle.

570
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,975
Cherry, I hate to do this.

571
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,810
I've been fighting a cold

572
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,912
or allergies or something.

573
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,016
- I get it.

574
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,419
Let's do this another night.

575
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,420
- Really?

576
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,254
- Yeah.

577
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,255
- You sure?

578
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,724
- Yeah, no problem, really.

579
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,559
- Okay.

580
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:24,970
I apologize.

581
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,107
- For what it's worth,

582
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,009
I had a lovely evening.

583
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,547
It was a nice distraction.

584
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,549
Till the end, of course.

585
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:52,731
Thanks.

586
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,701
See you soon?

587
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,035
- I'll call you.

588
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,608
(somber music)

589
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,216
- I told you.

590
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,050
A killer.

591
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,228
- What do I do?

592
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,397
- Trust in me.
 (eerie music)

593
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,232
It's the only way out.

594
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,838
- What're you doing, Larry?

595
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,840
Give me the knife, baby.

596
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:54,225
(menacing music)

597
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,296
- Very nice.

598
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,168
(giggling)

599
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:14,480
- Diablo?

600
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:20,151
- My friends call me Diablo.

601
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,055
You haven't paid me

602
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,025
in two months.

603
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,196
Name's Mr. Sanchez to you.

604
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,000
- I'm on it.

605
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,035
I swear, I swear.

606
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,538
- You are a nice piece of ass.

607
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:45,076
Why do you mess around
 with that old fuck?

608
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,115
- Larry's a nice guy.

609
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,384
He doesn't need sex.

610
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,385
We both win.

611
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,658
- You're not here to win.

612
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,895
You're my whore.

613
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,397
Whores fuck.

614
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,835
Start fucking him

615
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:12,704
and stop fucking me.

616
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,910
I want my money.

617
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,915
You get it from him

618
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,119
or you get a bullet
 to the brain.

619
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,659
(foreboding music)

620
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,229
Tomorrow night.

621
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,843
(exciting video game music)

622
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,358
(knocking)

623
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,627
- Yeah, coming.

624
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,240
(somber music)

625
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,844
What're we doing?

626
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,513
- Don't make me beg.

627
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,682
After all the shit I've been,
 I need to feel loved again.

628
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:33,351
Just one night. Can you do that?

629
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,553
Good.

630
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,554
Now shut up.

631
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,630
(somber piano music)

632
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,338
- Good morning.

633
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,040
- Morning.

634
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,380
- Some night, huh?

635
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,484
- Yeah, I'd say so.

636
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,256
- I love you.

637
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,795
- Conner, this isn't.

638
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:31,229
We can't do this.

639
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:35,600
- This is what you wanted.

640
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,971
This is what you asked for.

641
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:40,806
I'm here.

642
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,775
I'm right here, Peyton.

643
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,044
- I wasn't thinking last night.

644
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:47,178
Shit just got out of hand

645
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:48,947
and I needed someone.

646
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,418
- And I was there.

647
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,252
- Exactly.

648
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,423
And I still need you, Conner.

649
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,193
I need you to help me find Brad.

650
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,564
- And then?

651
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,333
- Then, I don't know.

652
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,970
- That's not a no.

653
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:14,906
- It's not a no.

654
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,143
But...

655
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:22,313
- But?

656
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,652
- I am in big fucking
 trouble, Conner.

657
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,320
Big fucking trouble.

658
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,924
- Go on.

659
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:33,959
- No, fuck it.

660
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,160
I've got it, really.

661
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,994
- What?

662
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,070
- Hey!

663
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,237
- Who's Larry?

664
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:47,738
- Fuck you, Conner!

665
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,441
- It's Diablo, isn't it?

666
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:53,011
He's got you again, doesn't he?

667
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,118
(dramatic music)

668
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,500
Spend the day with me.

669
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,136
Tell me everything.

670
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:22,240
I'll just shut up and listen.

671
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,309
(crying)

672
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,446
It's gonna be okay, Pey.

673
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,252
But as punishment,

674
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,223
you're gonna be second player.

675
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,458
(laughing)

676
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,900
(reggae music)

677
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,153
- Hey.

678
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:09,820
Go get us some food.

679
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:12,557
Come on.

680
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,691
- Fuck you, pot boy.

681
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:16,294
You get us some food.

682
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,195
- Fuck you.

683
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,797
Go get food.

684
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:20,631
- Fuck.

685
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,601
- Make it snappy.

686
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,570
- "Make it snappy."

687
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,139
(reggae music)

688
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:41,953
- Ah!

689
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,438
(somber music)

690
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,452
(phone chiming)

691
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:30,168
- This is your big chance.

692
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:34,772
Take care of her, that's one
 less loose end to worry about.

693
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,641
- She's not a loose end.

694
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,876
- She starts playing Scooby-Doo,

695
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:41,179
the cops get involved.

696
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,880
The cops get involved,

697
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,948
we're fucked.

698
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,118
- I suppose you're right.

699
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,553
- Yeah.

700
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:49,987
I'm always right.

701
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,923
You know what to do.

702
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,325
- I know, I know.

703
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:00,231
- Just make sure you get rope.

704
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,066
Nylon.

705
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,804
Not that cheap kind that
sheds shit everywhere.

706
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:07,638
And tape.

707
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,775
Lots and lots of tape.

708
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:13,578
Duct, not masking.

709
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:17,282
- Why would I get masking tape?

710
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:19,350
I'm not a complete moron.

711
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,185
- Really?

712
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:25,723
Where'd you stash
 the bodies, Larry?

713
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,426
- That's a valid point.

714
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:31,429
- After we take care of
your little fuck ups,

715
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,763
we hit the road.

716
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,565
New town.

717
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,102
New identities.

718
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,104
New kills.

719
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,706
This time,

720
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,375
we'll be unstoppable.

721
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:00,325
(somber music)

722
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,591
- Shit!

723
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,525
Shit! Shit!

724
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:47,037
(engine puttering)

725
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:52,042
Fuck!

726
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:58,916
Yeah, motherfucker.

727
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,451
I know who you are.

728
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:09,427
No, you ain't getting in here.

729
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,795
Fuck!

730
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,798
(engine puttering)

731
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:14,632
Fuck.

732
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,309
(ominous music)

733
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,577
(coughing)

734
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,915
(foreboding music)

735
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:34,919
Fuck!

736
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,655
(eerie laughing)

737
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,499
(yelling)

738
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:53,003
(eerie laughing)

739
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,542
What the fuck?

740
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,314
- Coochie coochie.

741
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:04,215
Coochie.

742
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:05,049
Coochie

743
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,453
Coochie coochie, coo.

744
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,621
Coochie coochie, coo.

745
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:12,357
Coochie coochie, coo.

746
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,363
(laughing)

747
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,869
(foreboding music)

748
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,038
- Is that all you got, man?

749
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:32,510
Holy shit!

750
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,415
(laughing)

751
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,384
- Coochie coochie, coo.

752
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,252
Coochie coochie, coo.

753
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,521
(laughing)

754
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:52,297
(eerie music)

755
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,234
(gagging)

756
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:29,400
(somber music)

757
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:49,219
(Dale laughing)

758
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:02,199
- Get the address.

759
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,469
We need to check the place.

760
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,105
More loose ends, I'm sure.

761
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,315
(eerie music)

762
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,697
(foreboding music)

763
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,136
(screaming)

764
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:40,571
- Who are you?

765
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,772
What the fuck?

766
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,173
Let me out of here.

767
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,175
Fucking kill you.

768
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,577
Let me go.

769
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:49,079
Just stand there,
 you fucking freak.

770
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,916
(creepy laughing)

771
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,487
What the fuck are you doing?

772
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:57,922
What is that?

773
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:01,626
(creepy child-like laughing)

774
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:04,361
Shit, man.

775
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,034
- Coochie coochie, coo.

776
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,836
Coochie coochie, coo.

777
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,071
(laughing)

778
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,241
Coochie coochie, coo.

779
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,976
Coochie coochie, coo.

780
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,713
- Stop!

781
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,548
Please.

782
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,517
Stop, please.

783
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,218
Please.

784
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,856
Please, cut it out.

785
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:32,957
Please, stop.

786
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,560
Stop. Stop.

787
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,463
Stop, please.

788
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:41,832
(gasping)

789
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,002
- Coochie coochie, coo.

790
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,737
Coochie coochie, coo.

791
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,645
(intense music)

792
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,447
- What the fuck?

793
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:57,615
Stop.

794
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:58,749
Stop!

795
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,584
I swear.

796
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,021
Stop.

797
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,023
Let me go, you fucking freak.

798
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,759
(eerie laughing)

799
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,369
(intense music)

800
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,716
(gasping)

801
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:34,952
What the fuck?

802
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,655
I'm gonna kill you.

803
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:45,863
What the fuck?

804
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:47,097
Put that down.

805
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:47,932
No.

806
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,267
Oh, fuck. No.

807
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,402
Please, no! No!

808
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,273
Oh god.

809
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,746
(intense music)

810
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:05,950
Fuck.

811
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,695
(laughing)

812
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,129
Oh, Jesus Christ.

813
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:23,100
Oh my god.

814
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:25,870
Oh fuck.

815
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,038
(booming)

816
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,242
(ominous music)

817
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,290
- Now,

818
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,124
the girl

819
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,327
and we're home free.

820
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,563
(laughing)

821
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,708
(somber music)

822
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,651
(video game music)

823
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,126
- You're going down.

824
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:26,964
- I gotta go.

825
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,674
This isn't up for discussion.

826
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,208
I have to, Conner.

827
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,810
- Why?

828
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,545
Why can't you just stop?

829
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,013
- Because if I don't
 get him his money,

830
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:47,184
I will have bigger problems
 than Tony and Troy.

831
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,286
You know how serious he is.

832
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:50,655
- Let me take care of him.

833
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,189
- And do what?

834
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,023
Kill him?

835
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,526
His people will find you

836
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,764
and it won't end
 until we're all dead.

837
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:01,398
Or I can end it now.

838
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,633
I can get him his money

839
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,803
and I can get him
 out of my life.

840
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:07,638
- You think it'll be that easy?

841
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:10,641
- There are no other
 options for me.

842
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:13,610
- I love you.

843
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:17,247
I've always loved you.

844
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:20,484
But I can't let you
kill yourself for money.

845
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:21,652
- Bye, Conner.

846
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,359
(somber music)

847
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,139
- Wow.

848
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,307
You look terrific.

849
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,308
- Thank you.

850
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,315
- You know what to do.

851
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,153
The bitch dies.

852
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:29,987
- I know.

853
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,222
- I'm sorry?

854
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,624
- Nevermind.

855
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,993
I was just thinking
 of something.

856
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:36,827
Sit down.

857
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,900
Well, here we are.

858
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,402
- Here we are.

859
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:49,606
- Can I get you something?

860
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,842
- Just these clothes off me.

861
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:54,812
- I thought you'd never ask.

862
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,814
Let me get the room ready.

863
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,983
I have a surprise for you.

864
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,119
I want this to be special.

865
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:05,756
Make yourself at home.

866
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,940
(dramatic music)

867
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,310
- You really like the moon.

868
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,326
- You're wasting time.

869
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:49,066
(foreboding music)

870
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,468
(ominous music)

871
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:29,739
- Brad.

872
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,980
(gasping)

873
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:39,917
- Get her.

874
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,521
(yelling)

875
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,923
- No! No!

876
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:49,326
(intense music)

877
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,227
Get off me!

878
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,442
- You let her go,
 we're done for!

879
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,480
(screaming)

880
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:27,864
- Peyton!

881
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,200
- No! No! No!

882
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,769
Conner!

883
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,272
(booming)

884
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:36,106
- Shit.

885
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,480
(tire screeching)

886
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,550
Stop it, please!

887
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,384
- Shut up!

888
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,286
- Let me go! Let me go!

889
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:52,489
- Sit down.

890
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:54,291
- Diablo, wait.

891
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,260
- Hands behind your back.

892
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,396
- Let me go and I will
 get you your money.

893
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,764
Let me go, please.

894
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:03,433
- It's too late begging.

895
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:04,701
- Let me go!

896
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:05,535
Diablo!

897
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,704
Diablo, please.

898
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,074
I will get you your money.

899
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:11,942
I will get you your money.

900
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:14,144
- All right, bitch.

901
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:14,979
You die.

902
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,447
- Let me go.

903
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,749
I will get you your money.

904
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,251
- Too late, bitch.

905
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:26,256
Now you'll know
 the fires of hell.

906
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,558
- Diablo, listen to me.

907
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:29,759
Listen to me.

908
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,528
Just let me go

909
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,031
and I will get you your money.

910
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,766
Please.

911
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:40,170
Don't do this. Just let me go.

912
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,571
- Shut up, bitch.

913
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,173
- Just let me go!

914
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:44,274
You let me go!

915
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,109
Let me go!

916
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,078
- Burn in hell.

917
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,052
I'll roast marshmallows
on your tits.

918
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,496
- Look at me.

919
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,268
Don't do this and I
 will get the money.

920
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,303
I will get you more
 than your money.

921
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,072
I will get you so much money.

922
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:16,673
I will be your best girl.

923
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,208
- You die!

924
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,576
- No! No!

925
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:22,512
(screaming)

926
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:23,980
Stop!

927
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,449
Diablo!

928
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,017
- Burn, burn, burn!

929
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:30,487
I smelled a cunt.

930
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,890
Dirty whore.

931
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:37,294
No one messes around
 with Diablo Sanchez.

932
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:48,205
Shit!

933
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:49,706
Forgot my matches.

934
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,409
Sorry, I'll be back.

935
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:56,580
- Help!

936
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:00,617
Help!

937
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:05,322
Help!

938
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:07,524
- Hey! Hey!

939
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,426
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

940
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:11,095
- I'm moving. I'm moving.

941
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:13,930
(creepy laughing)

942
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:18,268
- Larry.

943
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,372
(eerie music)

944
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:26,843
- What the fuck?

945
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:32,816
- What're you doing?

946
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,554
- I love you.

947
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,123
- [Peyton] What?

948
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:41,791
(intense music)

949
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,946
(eerie music)

950
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:15,125
(intense music)

951
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,556
(creepy laughing)

952
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:28,498
(exciting music)

953
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:25,021
(intense music)

954
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,868
(yelling)

955
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,474
- What?

956
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:57,954
(carnival music)

957
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:21,411
(foreboding music)

958
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,013
- No!

959
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,452
(gasping)

960
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,487
(somber music)

961
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:29,579
What do you want from me?

962
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,016
You wanna kill me?

963
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:36,486
You wanna fuck me?

964
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:39,889
Do it, Larry.

965
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,725
I'm tied up.

966
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,960
I am a helpless little girl.

967
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,464
Yeah.

968
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:50,467
Oh yeah, that's
 what us whores like.

969
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:55,171
- What are you doing?

970
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:58,575
This is no time
 to fuck with her.

971
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:02,446
That guy's gonna come back
 in here again any minute.

972
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:04,748
Could be another loose end.

973
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:07,250
Do you want another loose end?

974
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:09,686
- Come on!

975
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,256
What are you waiting for?

976
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,495
I'm here for the taking, right?

977
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,866
(crying)

978
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:29,506
Abuse me.

979
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,109
The others did.

980
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,582
(laughing)

981
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,819
(dramatic music)

982
01:13:58,968 --> 01:13:59,903
I hate you.

983
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:12,616
(laughing)

984
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,599
(screaming)

985
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,768
(yelling)

986
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:41,511
(laughing)

987
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:44,247
(dramatic music)

988
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,492
(laughing)

989
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:07,737
(screaming)

990
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:18,414
("Lunatic Dreams" by
 The Dirty Blondes)

991
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:34,998
* I can't believe
 I'm here with you

992
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,770
* It's a fantasy come true

993
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:47,210
* I know just what I wanna do

994
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:53,983
* I hope you're
 feeling that way too

995
01:15:56,252 --> 01:16:00,389
* The pressing
 moon is on the rise

996
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:06,462
* I see it shining in your eyes

997
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:12,736
* And as the sun sinks into dusk

998
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:18,574
* My emotions turn to lust

999
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:22,145
* Lunatic dreams

1000
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:25,048
* Can come be true

1001
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,884
* Nightmarish screams

1002
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:30,720
* Fade in to blue

1003
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:36,726
* Maybe I'm seeing
 visions in my head

1004
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:43,132
* Lunatic dreams
 float above my bed

1005
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:50,907
* I'm your vision in the night

1006
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:57,380
* I just might give you a fright

1007
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:03,119
* Your my midnight rendezvous

1008
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,554
* Your my midnight rendezvous

1009
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:09,659
* I think I'm gonna come unglued

1010
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:12,796
* Lunatic dreams

1011
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:15,298
* Can be true

1012
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,702
* Nightmarish screams

1013
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:21,537
* Fade in to blue

1014
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:27,343
* Maybe I'm seeing
 visions in my head

1015
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,817
* Lunatic dreams
 float above my bed

1016
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:52,668
* Come to me, my little one

1017
01:17:54,938 --> 01:17:59,108
* I'll take you
 to my land of fun

1018
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:05,114
* Don't be scared

1019
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:08,684
* Don't be afraid

1020
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,856
* It's not just a masquerade
