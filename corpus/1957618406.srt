[youthful chattering]

6
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,660
Good morning class.

7
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,595
All:
Good morning doctor.

8
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,830
Doctor:
Okay, let's begin.

9
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,633
In any serious
study of fixation,

10
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:09,002
psychiatrists must find a way to
understand the puzzle of the
idiot savant.

11
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,473
Doctor Miller and I
theorize that the idiot savant

12
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,143
develops as a result of
fixation and regression.

13
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:18,312
In other words, as a patient
fixes on one interest

14
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,714
all other thoughts are shoved
out of the patient's mind.

15
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,917
Sort of like studying for finals

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,853
or thinking of sex.

17
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:29,157
[students laughing]

18
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,493
Many famous and infamous
men and women of history

19
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,729
showed these patterns
of fixation and regression.

20
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,601
In the asylum these patterns
indicate the idiot savant
syndrome.

21
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,870
But on the street, these people
are just plain weird.

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,439
[laughter]

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,675
In our case history for today

24
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,244
is a perfect example
of a fixation

25
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,213
that has not responded to drugs

26
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,415
or electroconvulsive therapy.

27
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,084
Doctor:
Jim is a 21 year old white male.

28
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:01,189
Jim murdered his younger sister
when he was 13.

29
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,924
At first they thought her
death was an accident...

30
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,929
but Jim's violent
outbursts continued

31
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,132
until he was finally
committed at the age of 14.

32
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,935
Jim quickly settled down...

33
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,805
and appeared to
become quite normal.

34
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,776
He started talking and became
Dr. Miller's most outstanding
success story.

35
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,913
There however was a problem.

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,782
Jim was like a chameleon.

37
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:33,521
He absorbed the calm patient
manner of Dr. Miller.

38
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,459
Fixated with psychiatry, he was
released at the age of 16.

39
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,961
They thought he was
a nice teenager.

40
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,233
He raped, murdered and
mutilated his mother.

41
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,870
He raped murdered mutilated
his first girlfriend.

42
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,173
With nothing more
than kitchen utensils

43
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,975
and his father's hand tools,

44
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:59,880
Jim performed three
perfect lobotomies.

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,982
Jim had observed
the operation once

46
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,518
in this very asylum.

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,122
Jim is still here and
he's still quite insane.

48
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,759
Although Jim is stark raving
mad, he's able to adjust

49
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,829
the electric shock machine
for his own treatment.

50
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,933
He has learned to control his
most violent of rages...

51
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,903
and he directs his violent
behavior toward toys.

52
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:27,341
Jim and Dr. Miller
have co-authored papers

53
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,677
for scientific journals
on the promise of

54
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,979
focused microwaves
and ultrasound

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,815
in the treatment of the
tragic horror

56
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,184
of the fixated behavior.

57
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,220
For Dr. Miller and
I both believe

58
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,691
that Freud's fixation and
regression cycle

59
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,295
is the primary cause
of most insanity.

60
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,962
Thank you very much class.

61
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,266
[applause]

62
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,703
Dr. Miller:
Thank you Jim. You can go now.

63
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,505
No!

64
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,106
I don't want to go!

65
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,774
You can't make me go!
No!

66
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,677
No! No! No!

67
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:09,683

Aaaaahhhh!

68

[exhales]

69
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,440
Take him to
the electric shock room.

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,308
I'll be there when he wakes up.

71

My dolly's broken.

75
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,348
I can fix it.

76
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,087
Orderly, something's burning.
Come with me.

Nurse Krieger! In here.

80
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,042
Sick motherfucker! What are you
doing? Taking her temperature?

81
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,053
Take these two to rehab!

[anguished screams]
My dolly! My dolly!

84
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,813
You can stay down there
until you calm down.

85
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,548
[laughing]
They sure got you that time.

86
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,984
Orderly:
Screw you.

My dolly.

88
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,455
This way my dolly.

89
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,824
--I won't let them hurt you.
--My dolly.

90
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,325
Doc Miller.

91
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,327
Boys, I need your help.

92
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,897
The words just come down
from the administration.

93
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,365
They're going to be closing
this place down.

94
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,334
We have to move
all the patients

95
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,937
to the new facilities in the
mountains. Come on.

96
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,445

*[Music]

98
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:42,182
Just like I said sir, an ideal
place to put your brigade.

99
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,417
Why you could put a battalion
in each one of these buildings.

100
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,353
And look at the
training area sir.

101
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,155
Not bad Major.

102
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,590
Its nice to see there are some
things you can't screw up.

103
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,425
What's the condition
of the buildings like?

104
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,327
Pretty good sir.
They were mothballed

105
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,096
when they turn the
nuts out onto the street.

106
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,532
- Major: Let's go inside.
- Yes sir. I only have the key
to this one building

107
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,336
but we can get all over the site
through the underground tunnels.

108
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,175
Gentlemen.

109
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,947
[hissing]
No sir, that's just steam
in the heating lines.

110
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,683
Take a right sir.

111
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,298
Well yes sir,
it is a handyman special

112
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,366
but I think we
can fix it up okay.

113
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,170
Boy this damn place
is built like a maze.

114
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,440
It was built that way so nuts
couldn't find their way out.

115
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:01,895
Are you hungry?

116
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,199
How can you tell a baby's crazy?

117
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,368
[voice recorder in bear]
How can you tell a baby's crazy?

118
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,771
Kill mommy! Kill mommy!

00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,307
[voice recorder in bear]
Kill mommy! Kill mommy!

[laughing]

121
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,347
Let's go.

122
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,882
Get outta here.

123
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,062
Look at this.

124
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,498
An inflatable party dinosaur.
This is really sick.

125
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,934
May the force be with you!

126
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,503
[laughing]

127
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,339
This is unreal.

128
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,122
I wonder why they
shut this place down.

129
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,225
Someone figured it was cheaper
having psychos sleeping outside

130
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,128
on city heating grates
then it was in nice warm 
asylums.

131
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,430
I think I read about
that somewhere.

132
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,101
Actually there was a federal
investigation on patient abuse
here.

133
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,904
No wonder this place
is so damn spooky.

134
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,872
Let's not talk about that shit.

135
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,941
We don't want to
freak out the troops.

136
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,144
I wonder who rented
this pad anyway.

137
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,980
Looks like Charlie Manson to me.

138
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,202
Hey, listen to this.

139
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,906
"I want a warm fuzzy
to have and hold

140
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,642
I want a warm fuzzy
to keep me warm

141
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,212
I want a warm fuzzy of my own."

142
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,049
Soldier:
A warm fuzzy?

143
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,917
This is some sick shit.

144
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,986
Check this one out.

145
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,588
Man this place gives
me the creeps.

146
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,163
The general wants to get
the Hell out of here.

147
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,697
On our way sir.

148
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,200
--Let's get out of here.
--Alright.

149
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,415
Major, how soon can we
have this site?

150
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,384
It's yours as soon as I get
the word sir.

151
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,991
Captain, how soon can
we occupy it?

152
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,226
I can have an advance detachment
here in the morning sir.

153
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,028
Let's do it.

154
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,232
"Let's do it."
Gary Gilmore's last words.

155
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,301
Was he that Calvary
guy they sing about?

156
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,336
No asshole,
that was Gary Owens.

157
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,341
Gary Gilmore said, "Let's do
it," before they fried him in
prison.

158
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,844
Let's go.

159
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,516
[marching cadence]

160
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:26,366
[call cadence]

161
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,552
Alright men. Take ten,
expect five. Get to.

162
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,355
Smoke'm if you got'em.
I'mma go get the L-T.

163
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,129
He's such a tight ass.

164
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,477
That's pretty good stuff man.

165
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,381
Real good real good.
Yeah, you got anymore?

166
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,352
No man that's it. Ain't gonna
find no more out in Timbuktu.

167
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,854
Look around though.
There's a lot of ground here.

168
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,990
There's gotta be somewhere
we can hide a few plants.

169
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,925
Man they'd put you in
Leavenworth for that.

170
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,328
Heh, or the asshole
of the Earth.

171
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,031
Take a look around my friend,
that's where we are.

172
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,932
Fort Asshole of the Earth.

173
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,901
Man this place is worse
than Jersey.

174
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,506
Hey, I wonder what they used to
use this place for anyway.

175
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,044
Used to be some kind of
fucking nuthouse or something.

176
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,246
Keep people like
Freddy and Jason.

177
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,781
I bet they pumped a lot of good
drugs into those crazy people.

178
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,417
I bet you're right.

179
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,918
I wonder where they kept'em.

180
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,255

00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,306
This place is spooky.

185

[retching]

202
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,596
Will you look at this shit?
It looks like some kind
of aborted fetus.

203
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,298
[gasping for air]

204
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,933
That ain't no abortion. That's
a fucking dead rat man.

205
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,570
Oh man it stinks in here.

206
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,605
We got drug bottles.

207
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,309
Shit, they're all empties man,
these are no good.

208
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,280
Ugh, I gotta get out of here
before I puke again.

209
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,048

Fresh air!

215

The door is open!

216
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,785
The door is open!
--My dolly!

217
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,189

[sniffing]

221
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,749
Soldiers:

223
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,632

224
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,567

232
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,189

She's 89 years old.

233
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,025
Yeah but you like older women.
That's OK.

234
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,662
Come on man don't fuck

235
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,264
Besides we're supposed to be on

236
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,701
Man there ain't nobody out here.
No OP-4 either.

237
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,570
Just hanging out...

238
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,506

Turkey diced with gravy.

246
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,189
Same shit, different juice.

247
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,359

248
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,261

It's a meal.
--Alright.

00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,713
That's not cool.

We're in a graveyard. Let's just

See, she likes me man.

264
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:17,504
You're gonna have to find
a whole lot more beer
for her to like you.

265
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,871
Bartender: I think these guys
are about to get a little too
rowdy for this place.

266
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,673
I want yous outta here.

One more six-pack and that's it.
You're outta here.

they got an insane asylum,
and they kick us out of a bar.

277
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:53,039
Sergeant Vespa, what an asshole.
"Take the night off."

278
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,475
What the Hell do you do in
a hick town like this anyway?

279
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,609
Alright man, what's on the

00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,347
Oh man. I don't wanna see
no stupid zombie movie.

282
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,617
If you don't want to watch some

283
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,487

Always prepared.

289
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,766
What are you? Some
kinda boy scout?

290
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,868
I was an Eagle Scout.

291
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,605
I was a Cub Scout until I got

What is this place?

308
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,687
I don't know. Looks like a place
they used to torture the
crazies.

309
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,389
You spics are so full of shit

310
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,892
They talked to the crazies here.

311

Hey man, where the fuck

312

No lobotomy.

324
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,210
Shock therapy.

325

[electrical hum]

334
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,266
Something's wrong.

Too much!

336
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,070

Screwed up Bill.

348

351
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,254
Not enough.

352
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,889
We need more.

353
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,494
Don't touch him!

354
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,965
[electric buzzing]

355
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,036
It's working.

356
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,905
[excitedly]
It's working.

357
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,378

You're mine!

359
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,985
He's alive.

360
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,586
It works.

361
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,121
Need help?

362
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,190

370
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,358
Does anyone know what

00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,193
No sir.

372
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,595
Does anyone care what

They're also in you
squad sarge.

376
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:13,139
Send somebody to find out
where they are before I mark

377
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:16,342
Platoon, attention!

378
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,744
Dismissed!

379
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,281
Would anyone like to
volunteer for this one?

380
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,451
Shit sarge, last time I
volunteered for something they
sent my ass to this hole.

381
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,653
You're a volunteer.

[door creaking loudly]
Woo, welcome to the

00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,481
Don't scare me like that dude.
--Ehh...

389
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,117

00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,891
Oh man its getting late.

399
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:33,552
Hey, they're just tryin'na leave

400
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:38,357
No man, check it out. They left
their keys, their clothes,

401
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:41,060
If you were gonna bug out

402
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,595
Yeah, I guess I would.
I don't know.

403
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,298

404
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:51,070

409
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,316

410
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,951

He needs them!

432
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,041
Enough! Enough!

433
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,178
He needs therapy.

434
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,080
He needs therapy.

435
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,268
[strained grunting]

436
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,318
This is the right plug!

437
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,375
The machine.

438
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,679

442
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,175
I have it marked.
The bigger the head...

443
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,645
the higher the voltage.

444
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,880
[electric buzzing]

445
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,851
Jump start!

446
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,620
A little more...

447
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,857
[intense breathing]

448
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,060

[electric buzzing]
[mechanical thumping]

450
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,871

Live!

454
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,644
He's alive!

455
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,413
The other patient.

456
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,715
The other patient.
I will reset.

457
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,388
Yes!

458
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,092
You want guts?

459
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,827
I want guts!

460
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,364
[retching]

461
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:21,099
Guts.

462
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,233
Grrr... rawrr.

463
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,670
Put'em in.

464
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,237
Where are the others?

465
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,939
They're getting more patients.

466
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,377
More patients.

467
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,216
Sir, I don't know
where they are.

468
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,652
When Smith and Quinn
didn't show up

469
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,855
Sergeant Sutton took the rest
of his squad looking for
them.

470
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,793
When they didn't come back,
Sergeant Vespa took second
squad looking for them.

471
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,362
Damnnit, I can't go to
the Captain with this.

472
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,032
Get another man from
platoon headquarters.

473
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,935
We'll start searching the next
empty building, from the top
and work our way down.

474
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,770
Sir, what do you suppose
happened to them?

475
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,939
Hell if I know.

476
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,007
Get my driver and tell him
to bring that sword of his.

477
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,510
Yes sir.

478
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,590

482
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:23,595

483
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,164

484
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,569
He lives!

485
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,539
[zombie growling]

486
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,873
More patients.

487
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,143
More patients!

488
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,210
JIM:
Help me.

489
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,947
Another patient.

490
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,653
Okay.

491
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,389
[growling]
Fall in.

492
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,429
Awaiting orders sir.

493
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,798
Bring me more patients.

494
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,100
I'll send these
two men with you.

495
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,702

509
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,973

00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,725
Hey guys?
--Sir?

517
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,392
I think we gotta--

518
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,861

519
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,664

Let's get the Hell outta

530
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,595
I talked to the Captain. He said
there's 20 men still missing!

531
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,930
Man those men are still here!

532
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,532
Somebody or something has
turned them into monsters!

533
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:41,667
Monsters?

534
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:45,571
What kinda monsters?
Zombies? Pfft.

535
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,172
Sir! Men in the hallway moving
in this direction.

536

[growling]

537
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,917
Let us out! Let us go!

538
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,485
We can still get outta here!
Open the door!

539
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,320
[roaring] [moaning]

540
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,322
Let us out! Sir!

541
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:07,158
[snarling]

542
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,526

547
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,695
These patients need therapy!

548
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,363
[growling in agreement]

549
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:50,135
Take them to the treatment room!

550
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,003
Look Carl I need solidiers.

551
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,272
Not your badass bimbos
or whatever you call them.

552
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:58,143
Lethal ladies captain.
It's an experiment.

553
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,279
You won't give them a chance
just because you've got a dick
and they don't.

554
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:04,850
Let me tell you captain, my
soldiers are every bit as good
as yours

555
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,419
and they can get a dick
any day of the week.

556
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,788
Now I'm sorry Coloniel but,
what makes you think your
soldiers are ready for action?

557
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,524
They were gonna drop us into
Panama to kick some ass.

558
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,027
Instead they assigned us to this
ammunition dump.

559
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,997
And you Lieutenant,
what's your problem?

560
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,833
Sir, my men sir.

561
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,968
Sir, there's intruders in the
compound. They killed Sergeant
Vespa and part of his platoon
sir.

562
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,603
Damnnit Lieutenant, pull
yourself together.

563
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,305
Sir, you have to believe me sir.

564
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:31,576
There's partly burned and
wounded soldiers in the
compound.

565
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:32,978
They're not human sir.

566
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,713
Alright lieutenant, how many
of your men are gone?

567
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,815
Including Sergeant Vespa sir,
18.

568
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,218
Jesus the other units have
already moved to the training
area.

569
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,287
They report 26 missing

570
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,889
and that's a total of 44.

571
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,992
Sir as God as my witness
I watched them rip apart
Sergeant Vespa.

572
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,228
Sir! They ate Worrington.

573
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,298
We're in some real bad shit. I
say we get the fuck outta here.

574
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,733
At ease goddamnnit.

575
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,002
Since the Lethal Ladies are
itching for action,

576
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,504
I'll have them move as the
point element in the tunnel.

577
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,506
Alert the other platoons

578
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:04,242
and have them search and
destroy each floor above.

579
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:07,245
We'll fan out through each
building and clear the site.

580
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,380
That's more like it.

581
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:12,150
I'll tell Major Wainwright you
got a problem here.

582
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,386
Red alert! This is not a drill.

583
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,556
Enemy within the compound.
Prepare for combat.

584
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,825

I hear footsteps.

603
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,811
No Heartbeat.
No breathing.

604
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,282
There's no heat source.

605
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,118
No aura.

618
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,138
You want to check this out.

619
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:44,990
Check this out, files.

620
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,562
Holy shit.

Here L-T, here's one with
your last name.

622
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,701
Funny funny.

623
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,538
I can't believe the shit
they got in here.

624
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,812
These are what kinda drugs
they gave'm.

625
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,671
Where you headed?

626
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,839
I'm stationed out at the old
asylum.

627
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,974
You one of the guys that works
out there, aye?

628
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,179
Yeah, we've only been there
for a couple of weeks

629
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,382
I was out on a pass to deal
with a Dear John letter.

630
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:45,716
Did you work it out?

631
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,520
Nah, she's in love with
some college boy.

632
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,190
That's okay, lots of girls like
soldier boys.

633
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,924
I haven't met any
around here that do.

634
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,593
You have now.

635
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:56,994
My name is Sheila

636
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,597
My name's Kevin.

637
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,899
I knew some spooky stories
about that place

638
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,534
make your skin crawl.

639
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,102
Try me.

640
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,805
They used to torture
the patients.

641
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:08,739
Nah.

642
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,210
They did. Killed an 11-year-old
boy.

643
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,114
Doctor gave him strychnine.

644
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,450
It took three days but,
it finally died.

645
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,619
That's rough, killing
a little kid.

646
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,788
Honest, that's what they did.

647
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,025
You ever been in the tunnels
under the asylum?

648
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,728
Naw they keep us pretty busy
out training in the woods.

649
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:32,463
I'll have to show you sometime.

650
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,566
Oh, now isn't it dark and
spooky down there?

651
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,204
Its okay, really. I've been
in there lots of times.

652
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,607
The power comes straight
from the nuke plant.

653
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,909
So most of the lights are on
all the time.

654
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:46,010
The lights are on?

655
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:47,878
All the time.

656
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,713
I'd love to see that.

657
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,416
I'd love to show you.

658
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,050
Well, uh, let's go.

I'm not sure what is happening
but we've already lost

No sir!

ass down here to see what is
happening.

What's this one say?

710
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:29,820
Mary.

711
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:34,525
Nymphomaniac. Man here's one
for you. You can read on her.

712
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,529
Listen, what the hell's that?

713
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,431
I don't know. Let me check.

714
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:44,835
Holy shit!

715
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,738
Quick! Get these back
to the general.

716
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:49,707
Rawr!

717
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,476
Aaaaahhhh!

718
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,116
Get you womaaan!

719
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,318
Arrrggg! Arrggg!

720
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,902
Gaaah! Aaahhh!

721
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:13,991
Look soldier boy.

722
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:16,961
Here's one of your buddies.

723
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,773
Looks like he's been wounded.

724
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:06,310
How do you know I wouldn't just
want to keep you here as my pet?

725
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,215
How do you know I wouldn't just
want to just stay here and
be your pet?

726
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,985
Well, I could be one of
the left over crazies

727
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,387
still hiding out here.

728
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,658
Crazy? Maybe.
But, ugh...

729
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,293
for leftovers, you look
good enoughto eat.

730
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,798
You're so nasty.

731
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,908
Look, here's another one.

732
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,944
Why look in here.
They left a bed.

733
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,816
Into the room and off
with your pants soldier boy.

734
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,561
We're in there! We're in there!

735
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,200
You men okay?

736
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,236
Those monsters, they killed
the rest of my platoon.

737
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,737
Same thing happened upstairs.

738
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,906
Where's Captain Murphy?

739
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,274
They got his ass. I saw what
was left of him.

740
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,110
Shit. Who's the ranking
N-C-O here?

741
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,177
You're the Sarge.

742
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,880
Alright. Lieutenant Kent
is dead.

743
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,016
We found these in a file drawer
marked missing when the
asylum closed.

744
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,217
We can't hold out here
much longer.

745
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,452
I just say we get the fuck
out of here man.

746
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:38,622
These two inmates disappeaed
just before they closed this
place down.

747
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:41,325
It says here this Jim guy used
to burn toy soldiers.

748
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:43,794
I don't know. Maybe this Jim guy
is still here and he's
brainwashing them,

749
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,062
or God knows what.

750
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,763
I think the girls helping him.

751
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,299
We have to find a way to destroy
these zombies.

752
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,535
I got away by throwing some
drain cleaner on one.

753
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:54,238
This is some bad shit.
I say we bug out of here.

754
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:57,174
No! This ends here.
This ends now.

755
01:02:57,174 --> 01:02:58,742
You can't kill something that's
already dead.

756
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,777
No shit. Do you have
any suggestions?

757
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,312
Sergeant, I say we burn the
place down.

758
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,647
Brilliant.

759
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:06,283
Not only will it not confirm
that we killed them

760
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,552
we're gonna destroy the only
evidence we have that'll save
our asses.

761
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,988
Besides, how are we gonna
control a fire with this?

762
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,190
What kind of drain cleaner did
you use sergeant?

763
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,259
I don't know. Something strong.
Probably acid.

764
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,662
That's it. We can melt them to
Hell with battery acid!

765
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:21,131
Montgomery. Tucker. Come with
me to the motor pool.

766
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,968
We're gonna fill this up with
battery acid and use a
compressor to pump them up.

767
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:25,903
Give us 15 minutes.
Any questions?

768
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:27,104
No sir.
--No sir.

769
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:27,938
Let's go.

770
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,376
Hey, where's your battery acid?

771
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,478
Just wait a minute. Can't you
see I'm the only one here today?

772
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,846
Battery acid! Now!

773
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:36,981
It's over by the shed.

774
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,516
But be careful, that stuff will
melt the meat off your bones.

775
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:40,584
That's exactly
what we want!

776
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,041
[moaning]
[bed squeaking]

777
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:36,766
Let these fuckers have it!

778
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,003
[zombies screaming]

779
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,735
Look! That bastard's still
moving! Fry'em!

780
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,397
It worked! It melted a shitload
of them on the way over here.

781
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,200
Drop your weapons, pods and
vests, and let's go get'em.

782
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,649
Come on out you sons of bitches!

783
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,653
Oh my God, it's Kim!

784
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:57,033
Nail her.

785
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:30,667
Move out.

786
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,011
Jesus.

787
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:03,467
Die you motherfuckers!
Get some!

788
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:44,093
Do you hear something
in the hall?

789
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,864
Oh God! Oh I hear bells!

790
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:54,037
No!

791
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,709
[rifle shots]

792
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:10,880
We got'em!

793
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,258
How do you know it was them?

794
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:24,193
Who the Hell else would be here?

795
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,334
It was them.

796
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,336
Let's get the Hell outta here.

797
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,280
[retching]

798
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:53,089
Sir, this shit makes the My Lai
Massacre look like a salad bar.

799
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:02,632
Sir, Bravo Company first
battalion 66 infantry
await your orders.

800
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:05,368
Stand at ease.

801
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:06,803
Smoke'em if you care to.

802
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,205
We have a choice to make.

803
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,240
Number one...

804
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,744
we can tell the truth about
what happened here...

805
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,881
and we'll end up being locked
up in a place like this...

806
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:19,515
or two...

807
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:22,118
we can bury this incident.

808
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,320
We can't resurrect the dead...

809
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,456
but we could pretend
that it never happened.

810
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:31,527
We can write those soldiers
off in a training accident.

811
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:36,633
As a result of this action all
of you could be transferred

812
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,768
to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.

813
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,370
There is a need

814
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:44,774
for lifeguards and
recreational instructors

815
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:47,611
for the Wakiki Army Recreation
Area.

816
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,213
What do you suggest we do?

817
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:52,081
Hawaii!

818
01:16:27,984 --> 01:16:29,886
Semper fi sir.
--Who-wah!

819
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:42,766
Well general, what do you think
of your new training area?

820
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,802
You know over that hill there's
a lake big enough to swim
your M tracks.

821
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,972
Well fine Major, we can put a
marine division in here but,

822
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:51,007
what kind of shape are
the buildings in?

823
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:53,877
Well not bad sir.

824
01:16:53,877 --> 01:16:56,279
This whole facility was
mothballed in the early 80s.

825
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,114
Tthe army took it over in '89.

826
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,448
They weren't here very long.

827
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:01,818
The whole unit was relocated
to Hawaii.

828
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:05,188
General Lewis wouldn't let
anyone near this place until he
died.

829
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,423
We got it from the Army
for a steal.
