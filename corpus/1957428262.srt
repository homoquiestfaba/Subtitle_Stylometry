Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker

4
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:04,156
were the most famous
televangelist couple in America,

5
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,242

00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,736
- Tam.
- Hmm?

874
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,863
You can't...
What are you doing?

875
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:54,239
TAMMY: I'm changing the baby, honey.

876
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,658
JIM: You can't talk
to him like that.

877
00:37:57,617 --> 00:38:00,787
That's the big boss man.
We need him to like us.

878
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:02,622
- Jim.
- No, Tammy.

879
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,709
Look, listen to me.
I'm trying to build something here.

880
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:07,377
I'm not messing around.

881
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:10,630
God told me He wants me
to have what Pat has.

882
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:14,009
But if you keep acting like that,
if you keep talking to Falwell that way,

883
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,343
I'm not gonna ever get there.

884
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:17,763
Well, God's been talking to me, too,
you know, Jim?

885
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,514
And He said that I gotta speak up.

886
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,267
So, here goes.

887
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,062
You can't leave me at home all alone,

888
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,731
feeling unloved, and useless.

889
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:32,778
And He said that I belong on TV
just as much as you do.

890
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,572
And that I should sing
and I should be funny.

891
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:38,408
And I should talk about real things
for grown-ups.

892
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:40,827
Just, you know, just the way you do.

893
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:43,872
And...

894
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:48,752
He says I'm not gonna tell people
who's going to Hell, Jim.

895
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:52,339
We're in the business of healing people.

896
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:56,384
Yes.

897
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:00,847
Jerry Falwell's a powerful man,
Tammy Faye.

898
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:05,060
Jim Bakker

899
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:09,356
is a powerful man.

900
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:11,691
- Jim Bakker.

Yes, he is, Tammy Faye Bakker.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

904
00:39:20,784 --> 00:39:24,412
I'm so, so sorry.
I forgot my own strength...

905
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:27,916
and my manly duties.

906
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,876
It's okay. (CHUCKLES)

907
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:33,004
You know, we built CBN in four years

908
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,423
and we could build our own in half that.

909
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,051
Yes, I think we can.

910
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,555
- Oh, yeah, we can.
- (LAUGHS)

911
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,183
- Yes.
- (CHUCKLING)

912
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:49,729
Jim Bakker is gonna
be a builder for Christ.

913
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:52,399
Oh, yes, he will.

914
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:55,485
- (CHUCKLING)
- And Tammy Faye Bakker

915
00:39:55,652 --> 00:40:00,282
is gonna sing her gospel
all around the world.

916
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,492
We are gonna spread His word.

917
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,035
Oh, my!

Nice to see you.
Hi! How are you?

Look at all of you! Wow!

My land!

938

What a beautiful audience!
Hi, how are you doing?

939
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:03,136
God has worked miracles!
I want miracles for all of us!

We've got a marvelous show for you today.
Little Richard is here!

941

(SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

947

PTL brings the word of God
and Jesus Christ

- to the whole world.
- That's it.

- God bless you, honey.
- It's a powerful thing!

950
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,753
REPORTER 2: Five years ago,
the PTL network

951
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:39,673
was little more than a prayer
and a dream.

952
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:42,217
Today, the nation's
fourth largest network.

953
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:47,138
We don't deserve it but yet we are blest

954
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:51,851
We don't deserve it but yet we are blest

955
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:54,271
Yes, people. We truly are blessed

956
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:56,439
because there is no condemnation for them

957
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:58,024
which are in Jesus Christ.

958
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:01,278
Therefore, if God is for us,
who could be against us?

959
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:03,738
Blessed are they that hunger
and thirst for His glory,

960
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,907
for they shall be filled.

961
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:08,952
Blessed are the pure of heart,
for they shall see God.

962
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,081
We have gathered us into His kingdom
and made us priests of God his Father.

963
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:17,752

He rules forever! Amen!

And it's the happiest time of the year,
it's Christmas!

970
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:40,650
And remember, never forget it.

971
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,321
You know what I'm gonna say.
God loves you.

972
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,448
He really, really, really does.

Jim and Tammy are gonna be
so happy to see you.

977
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:58,501
I can't believe you've never
made it down to the studios before.

978
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:01,379
Well, the Carolinas are a long way
from International Falls.

979
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:03,715
Have you always been involved
with the church, Mr. Fletcher?

980
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,425
I've done all sorts of things.

981
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:07,761
Once, I was even a party clown.

982
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,054
You don't believe me, but it's true.

983
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,930

We'll get you set up.

MAN: But the penile implant
of the inflatable type

987
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:17,437
is the one that we see here.

988
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:19,022
Mm-hmm.
And this is the newest one?

989
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:22,233
Well, it is. And when the man
wants to become erect,

990
00:43:23,026 --> 00:43:24,444
he simply reaches down

991
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:27,947
and he squeezes that several times

992
00:43:28,114 --> 00:43:29,407
and the man becomes firm.

993
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:31,534
(LAUGHS) I think that's fantastic.

994

Well, you know something else
that's fantastic?

997
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,252
I'm so excited I'm just beside myself.

998
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:43,671
I would like to introduce you

Come on. Stand up,

1003
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,641
that deserves a big ol' round of applause.

1004
00:43:56,976 --> 00:43:58,520
Stand up, Mom.

So, here's the house.

Isn't it beautiful?
I just think it's so neat.

Our ministry's building lots of houses
on the PTL property.

There's one with pregnant teens
and one for kids with needs.

to help people.

Yeah, I'm so glad you guys are here.

I'm just gonna bug you any time I want to.

Oh, yeah, I'm gonna wake you up
any hour of the night.

being bamboozled like that.

Oh, yeah, that's God's love.

1026

Every day, I have rapture.

RACHEL: Rapture?

1028
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:01,666
You just spent an hour talking
about pumping penises.

1030
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:05,378
Well, these things happen to people

1031
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:08,423
and I'm just being honest
about the way that life is.

1032

And I'm providing solutions

1033

- On the left.

1035

Okay.

Sit down, Mom.

1037
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,226
Who paid for this house, Tammy?

1038
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:21,936
Well, the ministry makes lots of houses.

1039
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:23,855
We've got one for unwed mothers.

1040

(GASPS) Wait till you see Kevin's House.

1041
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,859
Oh, yeah, that one's for kids
with special needs.

1042
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:30,778
And it's named after a sweet little boy
named Kevin.

1043

for a long time, Tammy.

1215
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,334
Oh, yeah, that's right, Jim.

1216
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,419
It's been going on a long time.

1217
00:53:26,295 --> 00:53:29,173
We are being persecuted
by the secular press

1218
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,803
who simply do not want you
to receive the word of God.

1219
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:36,180
JIM: It is a witch hunt.

1220
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:39,976
And on top of this,
we have numerous past due bills...

1221
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,394
that must be paid

1222
00:53:41,477 --> 00:53:43,896
if we want to save the entire network

1223
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:46,899
and stay on the air
delivering the word of God every day.

1224
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:50,111
So, now is the time
for our prayer warriors

1225
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:53,155
to rise up because we are in a war.

1226
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:58,244
You know, Tammy and I,
we just hate to do this,

1227
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,206
but if every person watching

1228
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:05,626
could double their pledge right now,

1229
00:54:06,502 --> 00:54:09,839
that way, we can save
the word of God.

1230

1232
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:20,266
So, together, if we agree together,

1233
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:23,227
let's give the devil a black eye.

01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:52,487
We should just stay out of it
and keep politics out of the church.

1726
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,738
Too much on the line.

1727
01:18:55,615 --> 01:19:00,786

our churches' tax exempt status.

it's just so nice
to have you here with us.

1733
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:17,220
We have an experience today
that really is touching to me.

1734
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:19,722
Right here on my right,
I have a young man named Steve Pieters,

1735
01:19:19,805 --> 01:19:21,849
and I'd like to introduce you to Steve.

1736
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:24,644

Steve is a patient of AIDS

1737
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:28,272
and he's so generously allowed us
to talk to him today.

1738
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:31,484
He is presently taking chemotherapy
and is unable to travel.

1739
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:35,530
So, we have a satellite hookup
live from LA.

- Hi, Tammy.

We're so glad to see you.

I'm so happy I could be here.

1743
01:19:42,954 --> 01:19:45,331
Okay, Steve.
At what time in your life

1744
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,917
did you feel like you were different?

1745
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,170
Did you feel like maybe you weren't
like some of the other guys?

1746
01:19:51,337 --> 01:19:54,799
I realized I was gay
when I was about 11 or 12.

1747
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:59,220
I talked with a pastor in the church
where I grew up

1748
01:19:59,303 --> 01:20:01,556
and, um, he was freaked out.

1749
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:02,682
Mm.

1750
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:06,435
He told me, "Don't tell anybody."

1751
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:10,022
Never tell anybody anything about it

1752
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:11,232
and it will go away,

1753
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:14,860
but it didn't go away.

1754
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:15,987
Okay, I have another question.

1756

That's how we're able to reach
so many folks just simultaneously.

1758
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,413
Let me ask you, Jerry,
what's your viewership

1759
01:20:25,496 --> 01:20:26,998
over at Liberty Broadcasting?

1760
01:20:27,164 --> 01:20:31,085
Oh, well, I'm proud to say
that we reach three million viewers a day.

1761
01:20:31,168 --> 01:20:35,381
My goodness. Praise God.
That's just wonderful.

1762
01:20:36,757 --> 01:20:38,050

we reach 20 million viewers a day

1764

Oh, let's see who Tammy's talking to.

1767
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:51,480
TAMMY: And, Steve,
because of this feeling,

1768
01:20:51,564 --> 01:20:52,690
did you try to make friends with girls?

1769
01:20:52,773 --> 01:20:55,359
And did you try to be
around girls and everything

1770
01:20:55,526 --> 01:20:56,694
so no one would think anything?

1771
01:20:56,861 --> 01:20:58,696
Oh, sure, I dated girls.

1772
01:20:58,863 --> 01:21:02,116
I tried to "program" myself to be straight

1773
01:21:02,742 --> 01:21:04,535
and it never worked.

1774
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:06,120
TAMMY: So, what made you feel...

1775
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:07,622
And what's this, Jim?

1776
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:09,206

no way for you to be straight?

- It was from meeting

other gay people who were happy
with the way they were

1780
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:19,759
that made me realize
I could be happy with the way I am.

1781

- Now, I find this problematic.

1784
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,476
Okay, Steve. What did you feel

1785
01:21:28,643 --> 01:21:32,355
when you first heard the word AIDS?

1786
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:34,231
Was it just a word to you, Steve?

1787
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,194
Well, yes. Why would it hurt me?
I was a good Christian pastor.

1788
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:40,196

last minute or...

1791
01:21:43,824 --> 01:21:44,909
You need to get her under control.

1792
01:21:44,992 --> 01:21:46,702
No, no. Let me help.

1793
01:21:47,578 --> 01:21:50,581
Believe you me,
I will be having words with her.

- Jim.

As Jesus says in Mark 5...

1799
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:02,385
Reach out.

1800
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:03,636
Yes.

1801

What happened
when you told your mom and dad

1802
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:07,973
that you were feeling this way?

1803
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,810
- Well, my mother cried.
- Uh-huh.

1804
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:13,562
And my father held my hand

1805
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:16,649
and told me that I was his son,
no matter what.

1806
01:22:17,024 --> 01:22:19,110
Ah, thank God.

1807

You know,
thank God for a mom and dad

1808

who will stand with a young person.

1809
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,409
I think that's so important

1810
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:29,412
because no matter what happens
to a young person in their lives,

1811

they're still your girl

no matter what happens in their life.

And I think it's very important

1814
01:22:35,292 --> 01:22:38,504
that we as mom and dads
love through anything.

1815
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:40,589
And that's the way with Jesus, you know?

1816
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:42,883
Jesus loves us through anything.

1817
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:45,010

that they say is,

to give them that chance

with them, and...

This morning when I was
in need of some comfort,

I turned to my favorite scripture,
