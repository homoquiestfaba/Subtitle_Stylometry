Tyler.

00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,100
Tyler.

3
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,300
Hey.

00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,600
Tyler! Tyler!

00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,467
Dude.

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,333
Rudy got food poisoning,
we got a spot,

7
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,733
We're playing in Band Slam.

8
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,033
What's going on?

9
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,100
Get her out of here.

10
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,767
Oh my God, dude,
I was so rad.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,500
I just camped out
on Ricky's doorstep

12
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,667
And I was... oh,
hey what's up?

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,800
- But look, we don't
have time for this...
- Tyler.

14
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,800
We need to get to sound check,
drop off all our stuff,

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,700
Everything has to
be perfect tonight.

16
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,933
- Daisy.
- What?

17
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,067
- Yeah, we're in the
middle of something.
- Do you mind?

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,533
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

19
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,800
But this is like
super important for us.

20
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,567
- Daisy get out.
- What?

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,233
Oh, my God!
Are you guys doing it?

22
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,300
Ew.

23
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,467
Tyler, I'm just curious.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,667
What happened to that chick
who slept here last night.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,700
* Finally

26
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:28,533
* We've got our shot

27
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,467
Screw you, Tyler.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,667
* And tonight
Why is she singing?

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,733
* Our dreams will come alive

30
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,167
Thank you, Daisy.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh my God, Tyler,
forget her.

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,633
* We're going to let shit
rip tonight

33
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,533
* And get some due
respect all right

34
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,400
* Finally stage and lights

35
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,200
* Professional and real to spite

36
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,800
* The road we've
travelled up to now

37
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,667
* Our chance to
finally take a bow

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,533
* To Band Slam

39
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:52,733
* To Band Slam

40
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,100
* Hey, Daisy, let's do this

41
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,767
Dude, call the band.

42
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:58,767
Check it out, old school.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,300
What's up!

44
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,533
Oh my God, stop that.
You sound like an idiot.

45
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:03,467
Listen to me.

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,800
You guys into playing
Band Slam tonight?

47
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,767
Seriously?

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,233
Yeah.

49
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,533
I mean, Rudy Might
got food poisoning,

50
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,567
The Flows are in rehab,

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,167
And like The Whores drummer

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,633
But dude, we're like, so in.

53

Sweet.

54
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,333
Oh, God.
Shit balls, it's my sister.

55
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,500
All right, listen.

56
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,033
It's five o'clock now, we
need to get there by 1 a.m.

57
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,633
We're on at 1 a.m.
so don't be late

58
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,100
- and I'll see you there.
- Alright.

59
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Hello.

60
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,033
Hey, I need you to take me
to Turks Up tonight.

61
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:26,767
Oh, yeah, no.

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,700
Why not?

63
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,567
- Well, because that's a gay bar.
- I know.

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,233
Oh my, Colby,
please don't be one of those

65
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,300
Experimenting posers, okay?

66
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,767
You're like in a sorority.
You braid your hair...

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,300
So, there's a girl
I have to talk to.

68
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,733
Yeah, I can't do
that because, uh,

69
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm playing Band Slam.

70
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,200
That's awesome.
What time do you go on?

71
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:41,367
- 1 a.m.
- Great.

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
So you got plenty of
time to take me out.

73
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,267
Oh, great,
I'm not taking you.

74
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,067
So, my little sister thinks
she's gay now, apparently.

75
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,133
Hmm.

76
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,600
She's cute.

77
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,433
I hope you're joking.
That's not funny.

78
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay, seriously, off limits.

79
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,400
Hey, party is this way.

80
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,167
- Can you believe we're
graduating tomorrow?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,067
There's just something
I got to do,

82
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,167
But I'll catch up
with you guys later.

83
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,200
* Four years of pretending

84
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:13,533
* Being someone I'm not

85
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:17,233
* Tonight those years are ending

86
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,200
* Tonight the dream

00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,467
* Some kids line up in
their funny square hats

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,267
* My graduation is
bigger than that

89
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:36,533
* Finally, I get to be me

90
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:43,567
* And tonight I'm
going for the girl

91
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,333
Jessica Post.

92
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,067
* A thousand pretty faces

93
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,467
* Their smiles as
real as their tits

94
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,800
* Today my agent wants me to be

95
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,333
* Slutty bimbo on the bus #6

96
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,067
Misty Monroe.

97
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,200
Um, we're just doing,
uh, page 15.

99
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,133
Okay.

100
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,700
- Is anyone sitting here?
- Thanks.

101
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,700
- That's it?
- Yeah.

102
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,400
* Why me

103
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,767
* This town is so lonely

104
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:45,033
* And no one can see me

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,433
* When will I finally

106
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,733
* Find someone who cares.

107
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, and then the other thing
is Zan is going to be there.

108
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,367
- Zan?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,433
Dude, Daisy what's all
this shit about Zan?

110
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:07,800
What?

111
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,300
Dude, you spent eight long
ass months in that girl.

112
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,733
Okay, first of all it was nine.

113
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:12,967
Whatever.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,133
You haven't been able to play
a show since she dumped you.

115
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:19,267
Uh, you know what Tyler,
I am so over her, okay?

116
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,733
I mean, God,
just take a look at me.

117
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,367
I got my mojo back.

118
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:31,467
* Finally, we got our shot

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,200
* We've got to grove back

120
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,167

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,333

will come alive

122
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,733

141
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,267
Welcome back.

142
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,767
Drive.

143
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm telling you the
radiator is toast.

144
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,400
Dammit.

145
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,267
I told you not to buy
this piece of shit van.

146
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,067
Dude, we've got to call
your fucking sister.

147
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,633
- No.
- Daisy.

148
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,267
Call her.

149
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,500
So, I hear you're gay now.

150
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,267
She's not gay.

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,767
Why can't I be gay?

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,467
Because I'm gay.
You're just copying me.

153
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,800
Well, you're so
full of yourself.

154
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,067
Oh my God, Colby,
you can't be gay.

155
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Mom will kill you
and then me.

156
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,100
It's one thing if I'm gay

157
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,700
Because I'm kind of
a whole bad seed.

158
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,733
She tried to write me off.

159
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,400
But you, oh my God,
you're like the good egg.

160
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,300
Well, being the
good egg is boring.

161
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,100
Well, I'm sorry,
that's who you are.

162
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, now I'm a
good gay egg, okay?

163
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,600
Yeah.
Come on.

164
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,500
Let her be a gay egg.

165
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,267
Thank you.

166
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,433
Colby, you've never even
touched your own vagina,

167
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,400
Let alone anyone else's.

168
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,733
**

169
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,633
I fuckin' hate this place.

170
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,400
This is ridiculous.

171
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,733
Hey, that's her.

172
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:20,633
Where?

173
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,400
In the green jacket.

174
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:23,600
Oh, she's hot.

175
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:24,533
I know.

176
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,433
- Yeah, she's out of your league.
- Shut up.

177
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm sorry Colby, she is.

178
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,067
I mean, look at her,
she's like the queen bee

179
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,367
Of her little band of
baby dikes.

180
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,067
- She's an actress.
- Yuck.

181
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,167
Of course she's an actress.

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,300
Oh, what's she been in?

183
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,100
Oh, I saw her in this
allergy medication commercial,

184
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,367
And then she did this
movie Satan's Bride

185
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,733
I rented it,
she was really good.

186
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,667
You rented it?

187
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,500
Colby. God, you're a
creeper, seriously.

188
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,533
I just hope she remembers me.

189
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,267
I bought her latte last week.

190
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,533
She lost her wallet. So...

191
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,500
Dude, Colb, all you have to do
is go up there and talk to her.

192
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,467
Well, she can't
just walk up and say,

193
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,167
"Hey do you remember
I bought you a latte."

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
Well, why not?

195
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,100
Okay, because that girl right
there think she's king shit

196
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,300
Of Fuck Mountain, all right?

197
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,600
You just go up to her,
I promise you,

198
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,033
She will eat you for lunch.

199
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,267
You need an angle.

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,233
An angle?

201
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,433
Yeah.
You need something;

202
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,100
You know a wedge
to get her interested.

203
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, isn't sex enough?

204
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,667
Colby's hot.

205
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
You think I'm hot?

206
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,467
Yeah.

207
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,433
- Ixnay on isteray.
- Okay.

208
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,533
I know pig Latin.

209
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,300
No, you don't know anything.
That's exactly my point.

210
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,167
You're not even gay.
What are we doing here?

211
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
- Oh, shut up.
- Whatever.

212
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,733
I'm just going to
go talk to her?

213
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,500
Wait. Wait. Wait.

214
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay. So what's your...
What's your angle?

215
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,533
I thought you were nice
when I bought you that latte,

216
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,633
You made me laugh.

217
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,500
I think you're sexy and
I've never done this before,

218
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,400
But I'd like to sleep with you.

219
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,067
That's your angle?

220
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,667
Yeah.

221
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh, she's dead.

222
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,533
Bye dead sister.

223
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,600
I loved you.

224
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,633
Oh stop.
I think she'll pull it off.

225
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,467
I mean, everyone
loves a bi-curious girl.

226
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,200
No, Tyler, let's just do.

227
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,800
She thought she had
a chance maybe...

228
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,667
Hey!

229
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,100
Hi.

230
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,167
I'm Colby.

231
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,300
I met you last week at
the Coffeewood on La Brea.

232
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,200
Okay.

233
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,667
- So...
- Yeah, you lost your wallet and,

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,300
Um, you were up at the barista,
but you didn't have any money

235
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,300
And I was behind you
in line and...

236
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,700
Right.
Yeah, yeah, hey.

237
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,433
Hey.

238
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,467
So, do you guys
come her a lot or...

239
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,633
Um, I guess.

240
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,333
Are you an actress because
I think I saw you in this movie

241
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,300
And it was really good.

242
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,367
Um, Satan's Bride.

243
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,767
- Hey, oh my God.
- How are you?

244
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
Wow, you cut your hair short.

245
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, yes, I chopped it off.
Do you like it?

246
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,533
Oh, my God, yes.
This is Shelby.

247
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,667
- Colby.
- Colby.

248
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,200
We met at the
Coffeewood on La Brea.

249
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:41,733
Hi.

250
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,033
Oh, shit. Sidney...

251
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,433
How are you?

252
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,700
- You look great.
- Oh, my God, no.

253
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,433
- How was it?
- Fucking great.

254
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,100
You guys are stupid.

255
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,100
I cannot begin to tell you.

256
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,267
I'll have to fill you guys in.

257
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,600
I mean,
do we have time to...

258
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,633
Yes, oh my God.

259
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,767
She wears her color well.

260
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,567
Okay, seriously,
this is painful.

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,233
- Can I please just go
over and stop her?
- Stop.

262
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,400
No, I'll tell her
she's got a phone call.

263
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:11,467
[CROSSTALK]

264
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,533
Well hey, I'm going to go,

265
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,767
But it was nice to
see you again.

266
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,433
Nice to see you too.

267
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,733
Who the fuck is that?

268
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,367
She's coming back.

269
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,367
I love this song...

270
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,233
Oh my God,
how did it go?

271
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,633
I'm going to die.

272
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,500
Happy? Asshole.

273
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,167
Tyler Murphy.

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah, that bitch
owe me money.

275
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,500
618 Coronado.
Yeah.

276
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,400
I am not your fuckin'
babysitter, all right?

277
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,167
You struck out, the
dream girl is not into you,

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,500
Time to call it a night,
I'm done.

279
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,033
Whatever, this is my car.

280
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,033
I have to do vocal
warm-ups, okay?

281
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:02,967
- I have to stretch.
- Oh, whatever.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,100
I've had no water tonight,
I have a show.

283
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,333
Okay, that's when she
signed with endeavor.

284
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,433
But she sucks.

285
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,433
I know,
trust me, I hate her.

286
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,267
Hey.

287
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,367
Hey.

288
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
You guys have a light?

289
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,067
She does.

290
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,633
So you guys like,
actors or actresses,

291
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,633
I don't know.

292
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,233
What do you guys like
to be called these days?

293
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,667
It doesn't matter,
we're not either.

294
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,667
Speak for yourself.

295
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,100
Actors.

296
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah, I'm just mentioning

297
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,033
Because we're going
to this party

298
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,400
With some big casting
guys will be there.

299
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, really, what's his name?

300
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,767
I don't know.
It's my friend, Colby's uncle.

301
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,167
Come on.
I don't care.

302
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,033
Whatever.

303
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,567
I guess he represents
Angelina Jolie.

304
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,267
Angelina Jolie?

305
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,400
Really?

306
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,333
You can come if you want.

307
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,067
- Oh, my God we're so going.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

308
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
- I can't even breathe right now.
- You've been obsessed with
her forever.

309
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,567
Okay, we're going,
come on.

310
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,033
- That was six years ago.
- Well, it was my favorite shirt.

311
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,367
- You gave it to me.
- Oh, like hell I did.

312
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,633
Sid and Misty are
coming at the party with us.

313
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,600
- Hey.
- Uh, what party?

314
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:19,367
You know, the party at
Colby's uncle's house.

315
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,300
My uncle?

316
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,633
Lets hit it.

317
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,567
Oh, my God.

318
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,733
- I swear to you, if you have
anything to do with this...
- No, no, no.

319
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,233
I will burn all of your CDs.

320
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,733
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Please, don't embarrass me.

321
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,133
Tyler, what are you doing?

322
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,367
I gave you an angle.

323
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,733
Okay. Well, she didn't
even have an uncle,

324
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:35,667
So sorry.

325
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,733
Well, then I guess
we'll have to find one.

326
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,800
Oh, Tyler, listen to me,
we don't have time for a,

327
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,567
Let's get Colby laid
mission tonight, okay.

328
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,333
We've got to get our
equipment at the Dark Light.

329
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,367
Where's your sense
of adventure?

330
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,133
I mean, this is your
sister's graduation night,

331
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,433
Let's give her a fuckin'
chance with this girl.

332
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,367
We have like, five hours
before we have to go on anyways.

333
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,167
Give me your keys.

334
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,100
Tyler, no... this
is all your fault.

335
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,667
What did I do?

336
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,233
Just play it cool.

337
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, great,
here comes nerd alert.

338
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,700
What?

339
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,067
Hey.

340
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,467
Hey.

341
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,600
So, uh, I hear you
guys are actors,

342
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:21,567
Is that right?

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,467
I mean, I've done some
modeling and acting,

344
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,667
And she's done acting.

345
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,267
So, do you like, mostly print
or like... what do you do?

346
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,767
You go to a lot of parties,
do you wear a lot of Ed Hardy,

347
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Like, what do you do?

348
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,800
No, we go to a lot of like,
Hollywood parties.

349
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,633
I mean, that's how you
get connected this town.

350
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,067
You know, you have
to socialize.

351
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,467
It's part of the job.

352
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,767
Hey, do you guys have like,
agents and stuff

353
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,633
Or how do you do?

354
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,367
Yeah, we do, yeah.

355
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,033
Yeah, who's your agent?

356
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,133
It's like a little
boutique agency,

357
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,467
But I think they're
really specialized on...

358
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,300
Boutique? Do they have like,
perfume and shit there

359
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,200
Like, I don't understand.

360
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,500
No, it means small.

361
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,667
What have you been in?

362
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,433
I was in a couple of films,

363
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:55,733
But you probably wouldn't
know about them?

364
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:56,833
Really?

365
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,467
They're not with known names,
you guys would know.

366
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,633
But one day you'll know them.

367
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,533
- Like, one day we'll...
- Totally...

368
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,667
Your band is really
good you guys...

369
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,333
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

370
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,667
You've seen us play?

371
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,533
Someone here
has seen you play.

372
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,600
Colby.

373
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,833
Colby is like, awesome.

374
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,600
You know, Colby you should take
them to come see us perform.

375
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,700
Hey, Tyler, do you
have a girlfriend?

376
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,400
Uh, do I know you?

377
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,700
Oh, I mean, I'm just wondering
if you have like, a type,

378
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,167
Like, maybe brunettes or...

379
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,700
- No, she doesn't...
- Do I have a type?

380
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,333
Oh a type, oh I'm sorry.

381
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,233
I don't even know how to
answer that question.

382
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,767
Why do you have like, many?

383
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,333
She's in a very open
relationship

384
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,267
With like, the population.

385
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,233
So she's not found
the right one yet, huh?

386
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,200
No, but she keeps trying.

387
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
* Raise your hand

388
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,267
* If you want to get laid tonight

389
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,533
* If you just want
to play tonight

390
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:57,367
* If you've just
turned gay tonight

391
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,300
* Play your cards right girls

392
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,300
* The plans might get pretty

393
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,333
* Or things could get shitty

394
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,233
* If we don't watch the time

395
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,100
* Our gay plans are different

396
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,500
* but strangely our
goals don't differ

397
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,233
* A night without drama

398
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,733
* A hot sweaty blur

399
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,700
* By 2 a.m.
I hope I'm naked with her

400
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh, seriously I'm not listening.

401
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,267
* Lalalalalala

402
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,433
* By 2 a.m.
I hope I'm naked with her

403
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,133
* Painted with her

404
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,567
* Sainted by her

405
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,667
* 2 a.m.
I'm reacquainted with her.

406
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
* Covered in grass stains

407
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,167
* Wrapped up in clover

408
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,533
* By 2 a.m.

409
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,200
* Not 1 a.m.

410
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,433
* Because I've got things to do

411
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:49,033
* By 2 a.m.
I hope I'm naked with her

412
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:56,533
* Drop your plans and
let's chase the glamour

413
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,633
* A night to get hammered

414
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,167
* And avoid slammer

415
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,533
* Unless that's your thing

416
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,733
* We shut off the phones
and shoot from the hip

417
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,500
* A dark sticky rock show

418
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,133
* A club off the strip

419
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,567
* This night's looking up

420
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,267
* Let's see where it goes

421
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,600

00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,067
* I hope I'm naked with her

423
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,567
* New born inspired

424
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
* Zero attire

425
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:26,300
* By 2 a.m. hot on a
wardrobe that's style

426
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,600
* Clothes just fall off

427
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,500
* Like more Morisa Tomei style

428
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,133
* By 2 a.m

429
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,667
* Not 1 a.m

430
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,767
* Because we've got
things to do

431
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,467
* By 2 a.m.
I hope I'm naked with her

432
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Hey.

433
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:42,700
Hey.

434
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,533
Hey.

435
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,267
Hey.

436
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,733
Hey.

437
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,533
Oh, my God.

438
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,433
* By 2 a.m.

439
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:09,667
* To get the mother-fucking
money up in my hands

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,600
* Because if they don't

00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,767
* They gonna have to
talk to my nine

442
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,467
* It's almost midnight, bitch

443
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,600
* I'm about to book a
fucking tee time

444
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:19,333
* Sick of messin' around

00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:22,533
* Trying to play a fuckin' bitch

446
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,267
* This ain't no joke, girl

447
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,600
* You'z about to get killed

448
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:29,167
* I'm about to go Tigers Woods
on your mother fucking grill

449
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,333
* By 2 a.m.

450
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:35,433
* Or I'm coming for you

451
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:38,533
* So all you got to do now
is just stick to your word

452
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:42,167
* You'll be six feet deep
laying dead in the dirt

453
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
* Make no mistake because
it mother-fucking shit hurts

454
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,300
* When Dr. Monique

455
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,500
* When the clock strikes twelve
you better fill my purse

456
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:55,667
* Or by 2 a.m. bitch you'll
be dead in the dirt

457
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,200
* Yeah, dead in the dirt, baby

458
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,767
So that was Colby's
Uncle Steve,

459
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,300
He wants us to meet him
at this club Coco Bongo

460
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,733
Which is downtown.

461
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,700
Oh, did you think, uh,
Angelina will be there?

462
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,367
Maybe.

463
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,167
My God.

464
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,300
Hey, Colby why don't you
tell Misty and Sid about

465
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,500
How Angelina hit on you
about one time.

466
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,567
What?

467
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,567
Yeah, remember
last summer, Colb?

468
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,767
So okay.

469
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,400
So Colby was on this yacht in
the Bahamas with her uncle

470
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,400
And Brad and Angelina.

471
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,400
And Maddox.

472
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,633
- Right. That's right.
- Yeah.

473
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,433
- Maddox.
- Yeah.

474
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,067
So everybody went
on the shore

475
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,367
Except for Colby
and Angelina.

476
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,667
- Really?
- No.

477
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,833
So when they were alone

478
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,133
Angelina asked Colby to put
suntan lotion on her back.

479
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,433
- No shit.
- Shut up.

480
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,267
And Colby whips out
the suntan lotion

481
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,333
And she starts rubbing it
all over Angelina.

482
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,467
What?

483
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,600
And then Angelina totally does
this reach around thing

484
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,733
And tries to get it on Colby.

485
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,100
- Shut up.
- No shit.

486
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,733
It's fine Colby, tell them.

487
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,233
Yes, Colby, what the fuck?

488
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,333
Yeah, tell them, Colby.
Come on.

489
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,200
Well.

490
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:16,300
Yeah. I mean,
it's just not big deal.

491
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,567
She's just being modest.

492
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh Colby,
don't be shy, honey.

493
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,467
No, it's just we have all night.

494
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Did that really happen?

495
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:24,800
Kind of.

496
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,167
Clarify "kind of?"

497
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,767
Did you guys hook up?

498
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,100
No, I mean... she's
married so...

499
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,333
Wait...

500
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,800
You didn't hook up with Angelina
Jolie because she's married?

501
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,300
Wait, well guys,
Brad came back.

502
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,633
Yeah, Brad came back so it
was kind of awkward and then...

503
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,033
Was he pissed?

504
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,333
No, no, no.
I mean, it was cool.

505
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,800
He was really nice.

506
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,700
Very nice, Brad Pitt.

507
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,400
- That is so cool.
- Wow.

508
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,667
Good guy.

509
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,500
If I almost fuck Angelina Jolie,
I would make a t-shirt that says

510
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,133
"I almost fucked
Angelina Jolie."

511
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,100
I mean,
are you kidding me?

512
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,033
You should totally do
that anyway because

513
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,033
Nobody would know the
difference, right?

514
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,367
I'm just watched G.I. too.

515
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,300
Why did you do that?

516
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:15,867
What?

517
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,033
Made up that stupid lie

518
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:21,133
About Angelina Jolie
making a pass on me.

519
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,800
Ah Colb,
here's a hot tip for you.

520
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,133
It's important to learn
how to lie to women.

521
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,400
Come on.

522
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:33,233
Seriously, you think
I'm joking, but I'm not.

523
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:37,667
You see, women want a fantasy;
they're all about the possible.

524
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,400
An angle will get you in the
door but a good set of lies,

525
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,467
That will close the deal.

526
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,367
That's terrible.

527
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,767
Look at her.

528
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,100
Do you want to be with her?

529
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,167
Yes.

530
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,100
Then tonight is your night.

531
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,700
Tonight is the only night.

532
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:02,767
There's no tomorrow,
there's just tonight.

533
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,767
So what are you going to do.

534
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,367
**

535
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,267
Listen to me, you have 45
minutes to make your move

536
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,333
Then we're out of here.

537
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,333
What the hell kind of move
am I suppose to make?

538
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,633
Well, if you're actually
gay you'd know.

539
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,467
Thanks.

540
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,167
Be strong.

541
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,067
Look how the hair
just hangs in her face.

542
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,633
Oh, my God, well
smile... go talk to her.

543
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,200
We were just in the
whole car with her.

544
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,100
- No. No. She has no...
- Hey.

545
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,100
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up with her?

546
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:39,833
Who?

547
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,533
Tyler.
Misty and her hot thing.

548
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,767
- What Tyler?
- No, no, no.

549
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,367
We didn't have a thing,
she doesn't remember me.

550
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,667
Okay,
they had an almost thing.

551
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Oh... my gosh, no, I used
to go to see her play

552
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,433
When she was in
her old band.

553
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,300
You mean, Jaded Lipstick?

554
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,533
Yes.

555
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,167
- My mother is a bitch.
- Bitch.

556
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,200
- My mother is a bitch.
- Bitch.

557
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,433
I'm going to cut her breast off.

558
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,233
I know that my
mother is a bitch.

559
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,400
And I finally talk to her and
I gave her my number

560
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,433
And then she didn't call.

561
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,200
I shouldn't have put
my number on her arm,

562
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:15,333
She could have washed it off
or wiped it off or something.

563
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:18,467
Misty has been obsessed
with her ever since.

564
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,133
She doesn't remember me.

565
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,100
Remember she came over here,
tried to talk to us

566
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,733
And then had zero recollection

567
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,800
That we used to go see her
band play all the time.

568
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,533
Oh, there's guys, I'm going
to have them buy us drinks.

569
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,633
Has it ever happened to you?

570
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,633
You get a huge crush on
someone who didn't even know.

571
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,567
Yeah.

572
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,367
* Even though I know it's
never going to happen

573
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,367
* Fooling myself brings
me so much satisfaction

574
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,233
* Don't say a word but
she's my fantasy crush

575
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:56,500
* Oh that's funny,
I didn't know you dig sluts

576
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:57,567
Oh.

577
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,333
* Don't shit on my dream
it's just my fantasy

578
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:05,400
* Of what could possibly be,
but it won't be

579
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:11,400
* And the saddest part is that
it doesn't matter anyway

580
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:15,133
* Do you know what
I'm saying

581
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,267
Yeah.
I think I might feel on that.

582
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,033
Hmm.

583
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,300
* And in the Saturday dream
she takes me to the beach

584
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,400
* Then after hot fuckin' sex
she says she'll never leave

585
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,333
* Oh that's so sweet

586
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,067
* But see there's only
one problem

587
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,500
* She's so dirty she may
be allergic to water

588
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,300
* Don't shit on my dream
it's just my fantasy

589
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:45,467
* How could possibly be,
but it won't be

590
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,467
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway

591
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,567
* Do you know what I'm saying

592
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,067
* Well, there's this girl
that I really like

593
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Well?

594
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:01,533
* Well, I don't know
her really, like

595
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,767
* And we get drawn
together one night

596
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,733
* A goose chase night

597
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,433
* This really super crazy night

598
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,767
* But she's got this
other chick that she likes

599
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,033
* Until she realizes that
the perfect girl

600
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,167
* Is sitting right here

601
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,667
* Don't shit on my dreams
it's just my fantasy

602
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,733
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be.

603
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:32,133
* And the saddest part is that
it doesn't matter anyway

604
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,067
* Do you know what I'm saying.

605
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
* But anyway we're at
this party and it's wild

606
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:42,100
* It's like fiction and I lose
my inhibition and I kiss her

607
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,233
* And one thing leads
right into the next

608
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:50,300
* We end up on a trampoline
and I have first time sex

609
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,300
* It's just my fantasy

610
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,167
Whoa, hold the phone,
you're a chick virgin?

611
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,367
No, I'm not.

612
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I mean I... did I say
that I was it was like, no.

613
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,500
Just... in my fantasy song,
you know it's my first time,

614
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:05,133
But she's... I've
done it like a million,

615
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,300
Trillion times.
I can't even count.

616
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,500
Right. Right.

617
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,067
Continue.

618
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,433
* So we're out this rock show
A really loud rock show

619
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:17,767
* She looks at me
it's like we both know

620
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,533
* That we need to seek
backstage

621
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,800
* And find a back room

622
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,700
* Back stage, sex rampage

623
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:29,633
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy

624
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,633
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be

625
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:38,100
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway

626
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:41,633
* On a beach, in a car
I fuckin' said you will never leave

627
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,500
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy

628
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:49,633
* Of what could possibly
be but it won't be

629
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:54,033
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway

630
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,633
* Backstage, at a show,
my first time sex, trampoline

631
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:01,467
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy

632
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,600
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be

633
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:11,367
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway

634
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,233
* I think you know
what I'm saying

635
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
You're such a romantic.

636
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:23,733
Too bad the shit
doesn't happen

637
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,200
In real life though, right?

638
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:27,800
Come on,
let's go find Sid.

639
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,433
Listen, I don't know why
you're bothering with Colby.

640
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,233
This whole thing is like
an exercise in futility.

641
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:40,233
Valentine, this guy,
he's a con artist.

642
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,533
Exactly.

643
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,467
I need you to do me a
favor for like, five minutes.

644
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,200
I don't know,
what's there for me?

645
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,533
Don't get any bright idea's,
hot shot.

646
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,733
You still owe us for
the fucking Lambert.

647
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,300
Is that Zan?

648
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,033
Yeah.
I'll be right back.

649
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,667
- Daisy, don't go.
- Be back.

650
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,433
Daisy.

651
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,400
Misty, I have to
tell you something.

652
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,433
Oh, guys,
they're so easy.

653
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,433
Where have you been?

654
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,400
I got us drinks.
Back off.

655
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:30,300
Hey, sweet cheeks.
How are you doing?

656
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,033
Sid, Misty, this is
Colby's uncle Steve.

657
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,133
It's a pleasure to meet you.

658
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:40,667
It's always nice to meet
Colby's attractive friends.

659
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,300
Hey, Colby, I haven't seen
you since Clooney's poker game.

660
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,233
What?

661
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,400
You played poker with Clooney?

662
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,500
Yeah.
He's an old friend.

663
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:49,733
So what do you
guys doing out here,

664
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,500
The party is on the dance floor.

665
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:52,767
Come on.

666
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,467
- Bono is stopping by later...
- Wait, Bono!

667
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,100
Yeah, Bono.

668
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,467
Who the hell is that perv?

669
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,600
Oh, it's a guy, I know.

670
00:28:57,633 --> 00:29:01,100
Hey, I need you
to do me a favor.

671
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,167
I need you to have
sex with me.

672
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,200
What?

673
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,800
If I want to get together Misty

674
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,800
I have to get together
with you first.

675
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't follow you.

676
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,600
Well, this was your whole
idea in the first place, Tyler.

677
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,767
I mean, I'm trying to like,
work a freakin' angle here.

678
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,700
So, I was thinking if I
hook up with you first,

679
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,600
Then Misty won't think that
I'm a square anymore

680
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:23,633
And she'll feel all like,
jilted and insecure

681
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,633
Because you didn't
hook up with her

682
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:29,200
And then you hook up
with me on the rebound.

683
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,767
It could work.

684
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,067
I'm telling you.

685
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,633
Colby,

686
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:40,433
As much as this
pains me to tell you,

687
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,733
I cannot have sex you.

688
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,333
You see, your
sister will kill me.

689
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,167
Oh, who cares about her?

690
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,067
I do.

691
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,033
Who cares?
Okay, tonight is the night.

692
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,167
You said so yourself.

693
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,700
What about fake sex?

694
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,600
How are we supposed
to have fake sex?

695
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,433
I don't know,
but I'll figure it out, okay.

696
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:21,433
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

697
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,700
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

698
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:42,200
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

699
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:49,333
Hey, Zan.

700
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,100

Listen Zan,
I gotta talk to you, so...

Daisy, now is not
really a good time.

Well, when?

708
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,733
I mean, when is a good time?

709
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,333
Because you didn't even have the
courtesy to break up with me.

710
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,733
I had to find out that you're
dating Skankoroma here

711
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:16,667
Through your fucking tweet.

712

What on earth do you
need to talk about?

713
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,100
I mean, how many times you have
to process this relationship.

714
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,633
She dumped you.
You're a loser.

She's not.
End of story.

I got her really good...

Oh, she backed up...

732
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,233
- She got on top of me.
- Totally.

733
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,767
She's on top of me.
And she's not light.

Let me tell you
that hurt a little bit.

735
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,500
But I think Zan, there's a
moment we connected eyes,

00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,800
She was like a little
impressed by my moves.

Okay.
This is why what?

876
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,300
Why I broke up with you.

877
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,133
Oh my God,
this is funny guys...

878
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,567
Dude, what did she say?

879
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,767
You know, she said, sorry,
it's wrong to leave you,

880
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,100
I love you.
I always will.

881
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,333
What did she really say?

882
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,500
Where the fuck are we going?

883
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:35,567
Well, we have to
unload these drugs;

884
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,133
We can get our $5000,

885
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,633
Pay Monique and then
get our shit back.

886
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,200
How are we going to unload

887
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,433
$5000 worth of drugs
in three hours?

888
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,300
We got to be on stage
at 1 a.m.

889
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,500
I don't know.

890
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,700
Hey, maybe Lana will
want to buy them.

891
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:51,100
Bitch, do you have
a death wish?

892
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,567
No, we have to
find some like rich,

893
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,633
Obnoxious, drunk kids who
are looking for a good time

894
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,300
And sell them the drugs.

895
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,233
Hey, my eyes are peeled.

896
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,267
No.

897
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,700
Oh yeah.

898
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:16,667
No.

899
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,667
- Yeah.
- No.

900
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,800
- Oh yes.
- Hell, no.

901
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,400
- No. No...
- Oh, fuck yeah.

902
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,433
It's happening Colby, done.

903
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,767
Done.
You can't do shit.

904
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,067
[CHANTING] Colby.

905
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Colby. Colby. Colby...

906
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,200
Yes, Colby.

907
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:47,467
It's your graduation night.

908
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,167
It's easy, We're going to send
your friends off with a bang.

909
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,067
Yeah and I have six demerits.

910
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,067
- I'm going to be like...
- You are such a...

911
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,733
My sister is such bad girl.

912
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,600
When did you get
so bad, Colby?

913
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,167
These girls are really...

914
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,233
And I haven't even
told them about...

915
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,100
Me...

916
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,767
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

917
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,300
Halloween is in October,
ladies.

918
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,033
Hi, Lauren.

919
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:27,033
Um, I just came
to grab my jacket.

920
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:29,567
Colby, we made a pact

921
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,133
To spend our last night
together as sorority sisters

922
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,700
Here in this house

923
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:39,200
Reflecting on four great
years here at LAU.

924
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:42,667
We could be out partying or
hanging with our boyfriends,

925
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,633
But instead we made a solemn
pledge to be here together.

926
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,800
Everybody here is here but you.

927
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,567
You for some reason

928
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,567
Seemed to think you have
something better to do

929
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,133
Than to participate in
the Sigma Omega Kappa

930
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,533
Farewell ceremony.

931
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:00,033
What could possibly be
more important

932
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,333
Than spending tonight with
your sigma sisters?

933
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,267
Sex with Misty.

934
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,167
Ow, my tit...

935
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,100
Lauren...

936
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,267
Was I finished talking?
I don't think so.

937
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,667
My followup question is this.

938
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,100
What do you think you can do
to make up for this selfish

939
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,500
And insulting behavior
on your part?

940
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,667
What are you bringing
to the table, Colby.

941
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,600
Uh, party favors.

942
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,233
**

943
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,433
Everyone makes fun of me
whenever I talk about it.

944
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:50,533
Did you have to wear like,
a uniform in space camp?

945
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,367
Yes.

946
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,467
- Do you still fit in it?
- I do.

947
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,800
Do you know who's
Story Musgrave was?

948
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,500
He's an astronaut.

949
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:02,600
I bought every button from
every launch he had ever done.

950
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:07,167
I used to dream of being
like, a counselor there.

951
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,400
That was my goal at 15.

952
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:11,067
- I didn't get that.
- Oh.

953
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,400
So I choose acting.

954
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,567
And here you are in LA?

955
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,667
Yes.

956
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,567
- I hate LA.
- Why?

957
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,433
It's not just what I expected.
Everybody is so fake.

958
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,200
I don't know.
I miss New York.

959
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:25,133
You should really give
LA a chance.

960
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,333
You see LA,
it's like a treasure chest,

961
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:30,333
There's all sorts of hidden gems
all over the place

962
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:32,533
You just have to know
how to look for them.

963
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,233
You see other cities
are really slutty,

964
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:36,267
They just have
everything out there to see.

965
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,733
There's no mystery.

966
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,400
But LA,
she makes it work.

967
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,300
I don't know.

968
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,600
No, listen.

969
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:43,733
If you drive downtown,

970
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:46,567
There's this crappy electronic
store in Sixth Street,

971
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,467
But if you go through the store
and then in the storeroom

972
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,533
With a flashlight,
you can look up in the rafters

973
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,600
And see the remnants of
the first vaudeville

974
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,633
Built in LA.

975
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,767
That's so cool.

976
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,500
Yeah.

977
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:02,467
And then if you drive in
the Santa Monica Mountains,

978
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,033
The second week of April,
there are acres and acres

979
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,400
Of blooming wild flowers
everywhere.

980
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:09,733
You guys don't have seasons.

981
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,133
That's not true.

982
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,600
Just not the ones
that you're used to.

983
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,333
But if you've lived
here long enough,

984
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:18,300
You can detect the subtle changes
and the quality of the light

985
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,100
And feel of the air.

986
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,567
I don't know you can't
just look at the surface.

987
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,467
You got to look beneath.

988
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,733
Well, maybe I had the wrong
person showing me around.

989
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:45,367
So, do we have a winner yet?

990
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,167
A winner of what?

991
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,233
Come on, who's going to
hook up with Tyler first?

992
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,367
Hey Colby,
Lauren needs you.

993
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:54,567
I'll be right back.

994
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,433
Ah-hmm.

995
00:43:58,767 --> 00:43:59,600
What?

996
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:01,333
What is up with you?

997
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:02,633
She's cute.

998
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:06,333
Oh, come on, Misty.

999
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:09,667
The hottest fucking girl
on the entire West Coast

1000
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,733
Is ready to your bed bitch.

1001
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,667
So get your fucking
head in the game.

1002
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,533
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1003
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's right, yeah.

1004
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:22,600
Thank you.

1005
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,433
Okay.

1006
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:34,300
So you wanted to talk,
let's talk.

1007
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,067
So, I saw Fat Sal
the other day.

1008
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,267
Yeah?

1009
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,567
Yeah.

1010
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,567
He was asking about you.

1011
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,333
Are you happy?

1012
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:55,333
Yeah.

1013
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,333
Does she make you laugh?

1014
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,300
Daisy, what do you want?

1015
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,100
I want you to be
honest with me.

1016
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,333
No, you don't.

1017
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:09,067
People say it all the time,
but nobody actually wants that.

1018
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,600
No, I do.

1019
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:13,167
Zan, I love you.

1020
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:17,500
I mean, do you feel
anything for me like at all

1021
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,667
Or the last nine months

1022
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,467
- just some weird
hallucination on my part?
- No.

1023
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,800
No, of course, I loved you.

1024
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,167
Of course.

1025
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,233
It's not just enough.

1026
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,433
How can that not be enough?

1027
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,767
It's not enough because I
can't spend the rest of my life

1028
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,267
Waiting for you and Tyler
to get your shit together.

1029
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,467
Oh, I don't know,
we're together.

1030
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,233
You know, we got like a
couple of irons in the fire;

1031
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,200
Things are... things are...

1032
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,367
Daisy, I have to go.

1033
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,300
Give me the keys.

1034
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,633
I wrote a song for you.

1035
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:56,133
Um, I don't want your song.

1036
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,600
What?

1037
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:00,333
I don't want your song, Daisy

1038
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:04,067
Because this is over
and I don't want you.

1039
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,300
I don't want your song.

1040
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,467
I really actually don't want
anything to do with your life.

1041
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,267
I just want Kelly's car back.

1042
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,367
What does she have
that I don't?

1043
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,467
- Daisy, you have to let me go.
- What does she have?

1044
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,600
She has talent.

1045
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:25,267
She has talent, I'm sorry.

1046
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,133
Give me the keys.

1047
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,767
Thank you.

1048
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:54,367
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

1049
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:04,467
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

1050
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,633
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

1051
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:30,367
* I find it hard to breath when,
you're standing on my neck

1052
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:39,267
* Put on an old song,
let's just sing along

1053
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,367
* Even just for a little while

1054
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,367
* Oh, tell me you need me,
cause I'm grieving

1055
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,767
* Love you so much
it makes me sick

1056
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,033
* One more hug

1057
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,500
* Then pull the plug

1058
00:47:57,533 --> 00:48:00,167
* You know,
I'd rather die right here

1059
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,300
* Than live one day without you

1060
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:09,500
* Tell me it's all right

1061
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:14,567
* It'll be okay

1062
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,033
* Look into my eyes,
tell me pretty lies

1063
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,433
* I don't care, just stay

1064
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,133
Oh, sorry Colb, it looks
like you are too late.

1065
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:54,333
The problem with you is
that you are just too sweet.

1066
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:59,633
Oh, but you do know where
nice girls end up right?

1067
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:05,100
In a pint of ice cream
and a vibrator.

1068
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,500
I'll see you out there.

1069
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,700
* This whole life
ain't worth living

1070
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:30,700
* When I'm giving every
little piece of my heart

1071
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:35,500
* is aching up and replacing

1072
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:41,433
* I thought I had something,
something to give

1073
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:46,167
* For so long seeing
my sights of you

1074
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,667
* Will I ever be right for you

1075
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,300
* Even though I stand rejected,
have been discarded

1076
00:49:56,333 --> 00:50:01,800
* Sickened and lost amongst
the broken hearted

1077
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:07,367
* She tells me it's all right

1078
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,333
* It'll be okay

1079
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:17,733
* Look into my eyes,
tell me pretty lies

1080
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:23,100
* I don't care, just stay

1081
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:28,300
* Don't ask me why

1082
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:33,267
* I just can't say

1083
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,500
* One day the little girl will
gonna show the world

1084
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:42,233
* Well gonna laugh one day

1085
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:52,633
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

1086
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:03,367
* All these feelings arise,
will we ever embrace

1087
00:51:07,533 --> 00:51:12,800
* Will you let me inside,
does your heart have a place

1088
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,167
* A place, a place

1089
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,100
* Ah, ah, ah

1090
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:23,800
* When you close your eyes,
do you still see my face

1091
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:31,033
* It's all right

1092
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:39,700
Hmm.

1093
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,033
Okay.

1094
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:45,233
I have something to tell you.

1095
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,367
I'm pretty sure that I'm gay.

1096
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,767
Duh.

1097
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,367
Duh?
Seriously?

1098
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,333
Intramural softball.

1099
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,033
Oh, my god.

1100
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,333
Do you know how
to have fake sex?

1101
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,367
Um,
I don't understand the question.

1102
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,500
Like, if I was to simulate sex
without actually having it,

1103
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:16,300
What would I do?

1104
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,300
Moan a lot and swear.

1105
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,733
Really?

1106
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,400
Huh.

1107
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:26,767
Ah. Ah. Ah.

1108
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,333
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1109
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:31,300
Hmm.

1110
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,767
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1111
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,700
Oh, fuck.
Oh, God.

1112
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:39,500
Fuck. Fuck. OK. OK.

1113
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:42,367
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1114
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,800
I could never say that.

1115
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:51,100
Oh, and if you bust this one
out it will drive them crazy.

1116
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:53,300
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.

1117
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,233
Oh, shit.

1118
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:58,700
Oh... you make me
so... you make me so wet...

1119
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:03,167
I know.

1120
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,167
Wow.

1121
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,700
Okay, look,
I need your help.

1122
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:09,300
You know, I actually remember
when I saw you guys first play.

1123
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,567
- No shit.
- Yeah.

1124
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,400
It was like last September.

1125
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:13,333
Where was it?

1126
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:16,500
Um, I don't know it
was like some dark,

1127
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:19,267
Burgundy room
with tall ceilings.

1128
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,733
- Oh, was it the dark room?
- Yes.

1129
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,167
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1130
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,367
That's a fuckin' awesome place.
I love it.

1131
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:28,567
Hey, can you, um...

1132
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,133
Can you tell he change
in the seasons in LA?

1133
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,200
What?

1134
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,200
I mean, like you've
lived here your whole life,

1135
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:38,800
Like, can you feel the change?

1136
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:41,567
There are no fuckin'
seasons in LA.

1137
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,633
It's just hot
and fuckin' hotter.

1138
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:46,500
Yeah, I know.

1139
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,567
Hi.

1140
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,700
Do you mind if we Misty
for a second?

1141
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:51,700
Why?

1142
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:53,133
You've been chosen.

1143
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,067
It's actually a great honor.

1144
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,467
Every year, one civilian is
chosen to participate

1145
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,733
In the annual crossing
over ceremony.

1146
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:03,400
I'm good.
Thank you though.

1147
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,467
It's not optional.

1148
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:11,433
Come on, show time.

1149
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,267
Take off your clothes
and get in the bed.

1150
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,233
To cherish these
friendships forever.

1151
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:25,133
[ALL] To cherish these
friendships forever.

1152
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:27,667
To be bonded in
everlasting sisterhood.

1153
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,267
[ALL] To be bonded in
everlasting sisterhood.

1154
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,300
I mean,
not like the lessy kind.

1155
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,433
[ALL] I mean,
not like the lessy kind.

1156
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:39,200
I mean, that's fine for Colby,
if that's where she's sent to,

1157
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:42,267
No judgments,
but most of us like dick.

1158
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,467
[ALL] I mean, that's fine for Colby,
if that's where she sent to,

1159
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,400
No judgments,
but most of us like dick.

1160
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,267
Okay, I'm sorry.

1161
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,767
Ah, you guys are
totally freaking me out.

1162
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,533
Congratulations, you are now
officially a civilian sister

1163
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:00,300
Of Sigma Omega Kappa.

1164
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,767
Thanks.

1165
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,633
Oh, um, do you know
where my friends went?

1166
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,800
- I think they went upstairs.
- Thanks.

1167
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,767
Incoming.

1168
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,600
Okay.
Let's do it.

1169
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,533
Hey, we're going to
be late for Monique.

1170
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:26,667
Do you understand
it's like Monique...

1171
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,500
No. Hey.
We're like five minutes away.

1172
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,200
It will be fine.

1173
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,667
I have to do this.

1174
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,667
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1175
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,333
Oh, yes.

1176
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:42,700
Oh, fuck, yes, Tyler.

1177
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,067
Whoa!

1178
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,467
Tyler, you are making
me so wet.

1179
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:09,467
Oh, my God.

1180
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,033
Oh, Tyler. Tyler.

1181
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:14,600
You fuck my sister.

1182
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:16,467
No. No. Daisy.

1183
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,100
Daisy this is not what
it looks like, I swear.

1184
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:20,067
Daisy.

1185
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,533
- You are fucking dead to me.
- No. Daisy.

1186
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,133
Daisy.

1187
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:26,567
Oh, man.

1188
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:32,167
Daisy. Stop it.
Nothing happened.

1189
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,233
Oh, nothing happened?

1190
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,367
I just saw you in bed
fucking my little sister.

1191
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,267
- No, we were faking it.
- Oh you were faking it?

1192
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,400
Colby had this
cockamamie plan

1193
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:41,633
If Misty walked in on us
and thought we're having sex,

1194
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,667
Then she would
think Colby was cool

1195
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,133
And then they would
go have sex.

1196
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,367
Okay.
So, I'm expected to believe

1197
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,033
My little sister asked you to
have some fake sex with her

1198
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,600
- in order to get some other girl.
- Yeah.

1199
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:54,167
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- I know. Daisy.

1200
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,733
She's just a kid.
She's Gail's age.

1201
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:58,267
She's not a kid anymore,
Daisy.

1202
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
What did you just say to me?

1203
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,333
I mean, she's graduating
from college tomorrow,

1204
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:04,667
She's not a kid anymore.

1205
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,233
I knew it.
Man, I fucking knew it.

1206
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:07,633
You've been crushing
on Colby for years.

1207
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,433
Just waiting to get your
whore little hands all over her.

1208
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,567
Well, let me tell
you something, Tyler,

1209
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,700
It's never going
to happen, okay,

1210
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,467
Colby is way too good for you.

1211
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,767
So you better forget you
knew either one of us.

1212
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,500
And you're out of
the fucking band!

1213
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,533
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy

1214
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:49,100
* Of what could possibly be
but it might be

1215
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:54,167
* And the greatest thing is
it's going to happen anyway

1216
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,767
* Do you know what
I'm saying

1217
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,333
Hey.

1218
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,233
Hey, Misty.

1219
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,533
Get off me.

1220
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:11,100
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

1221
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,133
It's not going to happen, okay.

1222
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,567
Okay.

1223
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,100
Misty, are you okay?

1224
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:43,233
What happened?

1225
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:47,567
Nothing. I just made a
huge fool out of myself.

1226
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,267
I know how you feel.

1227
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,633
I just thought we would
have had something.

1228
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm so stupid.

1229
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,533
I always do this
and I don't know why

1230
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,667
I just threw myself at Tyler.

1231
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,233
Then she acted like
I was a leper.

1232
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:06,067
Am I that disgusting?

1233
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,267
No.

1234
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,100
You're beautiful.

1235
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,700
- I can't stay.
- Misty.

1236
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:15,767
I have known Tyler
my entire life.

1237
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,733
She's like the best friend my
sister could ever have

1238
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:20,233
And she may be hot, but

1239
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,733
All Tyler cares about
is smoking pot

1240
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,500
And looking cool
playing her bass.

1241
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,400
I just feel like you've been
making up all this stuff

1242
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:31,100
About her,
but none of it is real.

1243
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,367
But I like my fantasies.

1244
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:41,367
With fantasies you don't
have with the real person

1245
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,567
And that's scarier.

1246
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,333
A lot scarier.

1247
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:47,200
It's like, you have a
connection with somebody

1248
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:49,433
Then you have to let them in.

1249
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:52,333
And what if they don't
like what they find?

1250
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,400
What if they do?

1251
00:59:58,433 --> 01:00:00,233
Stupid, fucking bitch,

1252
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,067
What the hell is she thinking.

1253
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,367
Ding-dong, bitch.

1254
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,067
Ah!

1255
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,233
- No. No. No.
- Where's Tyler?

1256
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:12,567
Where's Tyler?

1257
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,700
What's you running for?
What's you running for?

1258
01:00:14,733 --> 01:00:16,367
Ah!

1259
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,567
Get the fuck out of here.

1260
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,333
What is fucking
wrong with you all?

1261
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:29,567
Y'all going to fuck around
and make me break a sweat.

1262
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,800
Ray Charles could see
y'all mother-fuckers

1263
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:43,367
Hiding under the...

1264
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,200
Ah!

1265
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:50,533
What's wrong with y'all?

1266
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,667
Where is your
girlfriend at, blondie?

1267
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,233
Tell her I'm looking for her.

1268
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:55,433
Now that you're
fucking with me,

1269
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:58,633
I'm going to start taxing
everyone of this Sigma bitches.

1270
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,100
Ah!

1271
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:04,233
Where the fuck do you
think you're going, huh?

1272
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:06,400
Keep fucking with me...

1273
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,600
Ah!

1274
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,067
- Where the fuck do you...
- Freeze!

1275
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,767
Oh, please, toy cop.

1276
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,500
Officer Jackie.
Officer Margie.

1277
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,633
Campus police.

1278
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,067
Yeah, campus police.

1279
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:52,433
Kids today,
no respect for the law.

1280
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,467
No, ma'am.
No respect.

1281
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,667
Yeah.

1282
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,767
I've been after you little
sorority misses for a while now,

1283
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,400
Waiting for you to
slip up and pounce.

1284
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:10,767
It would appear that
Monique Shaniqua Jones

1285
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,533
Is in violation of the
terms of her parole.

1286
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,367
Proper authorities
have been notified.

1287
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,233
Fuck you, bitch.

1288
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:23,733
And as for you ladies,

1289
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:26,300
Your parents have
been contacted.

1290
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,733
You called my mom?

1291
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:29,767
Happy graduation, ladies.

1292
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:35,700
Great. Wow.

1293
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:38,167
This is just fucking great.

1294
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:39,633
Great.

1295
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:42,300
Well, this is fucking great.

1296
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,033
Yeah.

1297
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:45,333
- Daisy.
- Don't you talk to me.

1298
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:47,433
It was a mistake, okay.

1299
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:49,233
I can't deal with you
not talking to me.

1300
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,667
Oh, well maybe you should
have thought about that

1301
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,533
Before you screwed my
little sister, do you think.

1302
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:53,167
Hmm.

1303
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,100
Yeah, maybe perhaps, okay.

1304
01:02:56,133 --> 01:02:58,167
- You guys hooked up?
- No.

1305
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,500
That's an understatement.

1306
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:02,433
Oh, Tyler, Tyler.
Fuck me, Tyler.

1307
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:03,767
Dah.

1308
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,767
Why didn't you telling me?

1309
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,500
This whole ridiculous evening
has been one big fat lie.

1310
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:10,467
Yeah.

1311
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,233
That's been Colby's
strategy the whole time.

1312
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:15,667
For instance, our uncle,
not Angelina Jolie's agent.

1313
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,033
We don't even have an uncle.

1314
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:18,267
So who was that guy?

1315
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,500
His name is Valentine.
He's a con artist.

1316
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,667
Oh, man.

1317
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,667
You mean I hooked up
with him for nothing?

1318
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:30,733
What? He said he was going
to introduce me to Beyoncé.

1319
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:37,333
The craziest lie of all is
that Colby is not even gay.

1320
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:39,167
I don't know what kind of bullshit
pulls or game she's playing,

1321
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,700
But I'll tell you what,
it's getting real tired.

1322
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,733
You've been lying to
me this whole time.

1323
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,200
No, it wasn't like that.

1324
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:55,033
I mean, it was kind of like that,
but you wouldn't talk to me.

1325
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:58,133
Tyler said that I needed an
angle so I tried to fix things

1326
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,533
So that you would like me and...

1327
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:02,733
Oh, you guys were in
this the whole time.

1328
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:05,500
Misty, I'm really,
really truly sorry.

1329
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:09,333
Save it.
Forget it.

1330
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,333
Are you happy?

1331
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:18,333
- This night get any worse.
- Ladies, you have a visitor.

1332
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,133
Mom.

1333
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,167
You know what
you guys are,

1334
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,467
You're professionally ungrateful.

1335
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,367
And get me up in the
goddamn middle of the night.

1336
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,133
Maybe you could get a job and
be professionally delinquent.

1337
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,400
You guys are all worthless,
you know that...

1338
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,533
* Lately out here on my own

1339
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:50,800
* Surrounded by heartbeats
never felt more alone

1340
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,600
* What's happening

1341
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:57,533
* So why does everyone
look the other way

1342
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:02,367
* When I'm right here
and I want to say

1343
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,700
* Here I am, once again,
stuck in traffic

1344
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:11,667
* Count to 10,
trying not to panic

1345
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,533
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh

1346
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:19,433
* Broke the rules
down to the letter

1347
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:23,333
* Let me try it once again,
I can do it better

1348
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,600
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh

1349
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:34,800
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again

1350
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:37,033
* Here I am once again

1351
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:40,500
* People flying out their cars

1352
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:47,167
* Forgetting and regretting
can only get a girl so far

1353
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,533
* So where you going, going

1354
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:58,300
* Like little Boeings,
Boeings, yeah

1355
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,167
* Didn't ya see the red light

1356
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:06,100
* God knows how I hate
to say, I told you so

1357
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:09,767
* What ya lookin' at me for

1358
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,767
* I'm no help,
the future is a ghost

1359
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:19,467
* Here I am, once again,
stuck in traffic

1360
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,300
* Count to 10,
trying not to panic

1361
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,700
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh

1362
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,067
* Broke the rules
down to the letter

1363
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,733
* Let me try it once again,
I can do it better

1364
01:06:34,767 --> 01:06:39,267
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh(

1365
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:46,400
* God knows I hate to say

1366
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,367
* God knows I hate to say

1367
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,300
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again

1368
01:06:56,633 --> 01:07:00,600
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again

1369
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,567
* Here I am once again

1370
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:09,233
You're as delinquent
as your sister.

1371
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:10,600
What's the freakin'
holdup here?

1372
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:13,667
Mom, are you coming to my
graduation tomorrow night?

1373
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,567
I told you Colby,

1374
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,133
I'm going to San Diego
with Greg.

1375
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,167
Oh great, throw a tantrum.

1376
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,567
Do you want me to
treat you like an adult,

1377
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,467
Well you better
start acting like one.

1378
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,200
Fuck stake.

1379
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:29,333
Fuck.

1380
01:07:29,367 --> 01:07:31,033
Huh.

1381
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:32,733
Go on,
what are you waiting for?

1382
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:34,533
I don't even know you.

1383
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:38,167
Colby.

1384
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,033
Colby, would you hold up?

1385
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,500
I don't want to talk to you.

1386
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:42,467
Oh really?

1387
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,467
Well, I don't want to
talk to you either.

1388
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,800
That's why it's a good
thing we're sisters,

1389
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,667
We have to talk to
one another.

1390
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,400
Look I was a jerk, okay.

1391
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:54,100
I'm sorry that I'm having such
a hard time with this Colby.

1392
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:56,133
It's just that...

1393
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:58,633
You know, it's not like mom
was exactly around a lot.

1394
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,333
It's always been
just the two of us

1395
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:02,333
And I was the one,
you know,

1396
01:08:02,367 --> 01:08:03,500
Helping you with your
homework

1397
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:04,700
Or taking you to school

1398
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,433
Or picking up the pieces when
you broke up with that guy

1399
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:09,467
And then this guy and
now girls, good God.

1400
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,433
Colby, do you like girls?

1401
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,300
Girls are all fucking nightmare.

1402
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,500
But this night is
any indication.

1403
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,300
Look, I just don't want to
see you get heartbroken.

1404
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,233
It's my heart to break.

1405
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,067
It hurts me all the same.

1406
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:36,700
I'm not in the habit of
being honest with girls,

1407
01:08:36,733 --> 01:08:42,767
But if we had
hooked up tonight,

1408
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,500
We would have had
a good time,

1409
01:08:47,267 --> 01:08:50,133
But I wouldn't
have called you back.

1410
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,100
And then I just would have
moved on to somebody else.

1411
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,367
I'm the one that
put Colby up to

1412
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,233
This whole crazy night,
okay?

1413
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:05,233
She doesn't have a
lying bone in her body.

1414
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,333
So, um...

1415
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,267
Where are we headed?

1416
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
Dark Light.

1417
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,400
You're out already?

1418
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:29,300
You just went in an hour ago.

1419
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,200
Overcrowding.

1420
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:33,033
Drive.

1421
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,200
* You think it's you and her

1422
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:45,667
* Against the world now

1423
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,033
* Until you're bloody
on the floor

1424
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:53,133
* Saying I'm too bad yeah

1425
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:05,267
- Hey, you're going
to be amazing.
- Thanks, man.

1426
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,433
Uh, see you in a while,
wish me luck.

1427
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:10,167
- Oh, I got to go.
- Oh, see ya.

1428
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,567
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Rock it.

1429
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:21,633
* You're all hi

1430
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,400
* She's all hello

1431
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:26,033
Oh, hi Daisy,
what the hell?

1432
01:11:26,067 --> 01:11:28,067
- It's a long story.
- We're on in 10.

1433
01:11:29,767 --> 01:11:31,633
I can't believe you guys
actually showed.

1434
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:32,733
Huh.

1435
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:35,967
Hey, news flash,

1436
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,200
There's a real live
audience out there.

1437
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:39,633
I mean, this isn't like
performing at home

1438
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,333
In front of a mirror
with a hair brush.

1439
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:44,767
Do you guys really think
that you're ready for this

1440
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,133
Because I'm embarrassed
for you in advance.

1441
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:52,300
Next up.

1442
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:56,500
Let's give a warm Dark Light
welcome to the Dollyrots.

1443
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:05,733
Zan.

1444
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,767
I just think your music
isn't for everybody, sorry.

1445
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:15,067
Oh, yeah real nice, Zan,

1446
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,133
After she spent eight long
ass months with you.

1447
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,467
Nine.

1448
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,700
* Because I'm happy
so happy

1449
01:12:23,733 --> 01:12:28,367
* Joy oh joy

1450
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,300
We stink.

1451
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,500
No, we don't.

1452
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:44,633
Daisy, look she's just
trying to get you in your head.

1453
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,633
I'm going to make
a fool of myself.

1454
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:49,100
Tyler, we're going to
make fools of ourselves.

1455
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:51,333
Daisy!

1456
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:56,767
* And every time I kissed
your mouth so sweet

1457
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,167
* I still wonder how it's me

1458
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,500
* It makes me happy
so happy

1459
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:08,767
* Joy oh joy

1460
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,233
* It's for always

1461
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,300
You're my never
gonna happen crush.

1462
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,067
What?

1463
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,133
You're it.

1464
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:23,733
You're my fantasy girl.

1465
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,300
Drama.

1466
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,467
You know,
every day of my life

1467
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,700
I have to pretend to be
somebody I'm not.

1468
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:32,733
I have to be fake with
all this other fake people.

1469
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:35,800
But for some reason I
thought that you were for real.

1470
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:38,167
I thought that you were
the only real person

1471
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,400
I had ever met in LA.

1472
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,733
But you turned out to be
phony just like everybody else.

1473
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:45,133
Misty, I get you.

1474
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,700
Okay, I get your whole thing.

1475
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:48,633
I mean, I know in New York
you had a ton of friends

1476
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:51,133
And then you moved here
and in Hollywood,

1477
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:54,700
No one cares about who
you are or what you think.

1478
01:13:54,733 --> 01:13:57,100
But I do.

1479
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:00,467
And I think that
space camp is awesome.

1480
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,300
Look, I know what's it like to
pretend to be something

1481
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:05,367
That you're not and
I'm tired of doing that.

1482
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,733
I just want you to know that you
don't have to pretend with me

1483
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:13,200
Because I just liked you.

1484
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,467
I'm sorry that
I ruined your night.

1485
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,433
No, Colby, wait.

1486
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:31,200
What if we just
start from scratch?

1487
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:42,267
Hi.
I'm Colby.

1488
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,333
* Why don't we

1489
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:18,467
* Try to be

1490
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,133
* Honest even though
it's hard

1491
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,633
* Now is the time to start

1492
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,200
* Don't you see

1493
01:15:30,233 --> 01:15:32,633
* I happily

1494
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:36,433
* Accept you as you are

1495
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:44,500
* Now we got nothing to hide

1496
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:51,100
Come here, I want to
show you something.

1497
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:09,500
* You're high to me

1498
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:16,600
* Tell me it's not happening

1499
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,800
* Am I just the parody

1500
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,367
* With my best behind me

1501
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:57,533
I'm sorry, man.

1502
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,400
She's just a heat seeking
missle, you know.

1503
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:04,533
When you're up,
she's up,

1504
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:07,633
And you're down,
she's gone.

1505
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,600
I just thought she
believed in me, you know.

1506
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,667
I believe in you.

1507
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,100
Come on.

1508
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:21,800
You kind of have to
say that, you know.

1509
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,433
No, I don't.

1510
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:29,600
I know you and I've
seen you rock every day.

1511
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:31,167
And we can't shut you up.

1512
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,467
You love to rock.

1513
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,300
Whenever you ever give it a
shit what other people think?

1514
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:44,733
Fuck it, right?

1515
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:46,700
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

1516
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,800
Vote for us the Dollyrots.

1517
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,633
Whoa. All right.

1518
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:55,033
Next up,
we got Alotta Flame.

1519
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,633
Let's take it again, guys.

1520
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:40,400
* Listen up

1521
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:47,500
* Once upon a time
she was all strung up

1522
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:50,533
* And now she's
dancing in the road

1523
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:53,067
* Well, the story got wicked
and the song was the ticket

1524
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,667
* Fast forward to tonight

1525
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,633
* We've all grown
The past is left alone

1526
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,567
* When we look inside
and see what's true

1527
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,400
* My friends, myself,
the night of our life

1528
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:07,467
* I'm taking it back
like Goonies do

1529
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,633
* We only win when
we decide to

1530
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:18,500
* Now all my nights
will have an asterisk

1531
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:23,600
* Much happier without you

1532
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:26,400
* And as I walk out here,
here's an ass to kiss

1533
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,067
* My tomorrow is
all brand new

1534
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,733
* So now

1535
01:19:36,767 --> 01:19:39,067
* Sometimes my head
sounds like there's

1536
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,800
* Nothing lasts forever
but stories and stone

1537
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:50,567
* But we've got a tale
to tell you

1538
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,200
* And the stone and well
it should have been

1539
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:56,733
* It should have been left alone
It should have been left alone

1540
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,100
* It should have been left alone
It should have been left alone

1541
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:03,233
* Leave me alone

1542
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:05,267
* Give me five minutes alone

1543
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,367
* Leave me alone

1544
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,400
* My night will
have an asterisk

1545
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,433
* Much happier without you

1546
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:18,433
* As I walk out here,
here's an ass to kiss

1547
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,533
* Because missy
it's the end

1548
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:26,100
* My darling,
don't come calling

1549
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:29,333
* Just get lost
once and for all

1550
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:33,767
* Stay the fuck away

1551
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:38,233
* Now the gig is up

1552
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:40,267
* Time to give me back

1553
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:44,500
* Everything you ever took

1554
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:47,133
* Come on, come on

1555
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,467
* Now the gig is up

1556
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:55,233
* Time to give me back
everything you ever took

1557
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,633
Whoa, all right.

1558
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,200
What a show.

1559
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,800
Alotta Flame, people.

1560
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:01,267
And it looks like we
have ourselves a winner.

1561
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,667
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alotta Flame.

1562
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,300
Here's your prize $5000.

1563
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:07,500
Yes.

1564
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,667
Uh-hmm.

1565
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,633
- Hi, Monique.
- Hey.

1566
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,533
- No. Really.
- Yeah.

1567
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:23,433
Well, okay.

1568
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:29,533
This shit,
bet not bounce.

1569
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,267
* They try to hold us back
but we're just too much

1570
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,800
* You know they cannot hold
what they cannot touch

1571
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:57,633
* All the lights are green
on the avenue

1572
01:23:01,133 --> 01:23:03,167
Happy graduation.

1573
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,667
* And we can say goodbye
to the place we've been

1574
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,500
* All I need I found in you

1575
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:18,033
* We waited out whole lives

1576
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:20,767
* To finally make it here

1577
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,167
* Darling what's the catch

1578
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,367
* Is it too good to be real

1579
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,433
* Where would I be now

1580
01:23:30,467 --> 01:23:33,700
* If it weren't for you

1581
01:23:33,733 --> 01:23:38,700
* I hope this never ends
I hope this never ends

1582
01:23:38,733 --> 01:23:41,400
* You call my name
at the starting line

1583
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:45,033
* And I'm ready to go
with you by my side

1584
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:48,667
* There's no holding back
this time

1585
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:54,367
* It's all right
if I think too much

1586
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,733
* Because you know my cards
and you call my bluff

1587
01:23:57,767 --> 01:24:01,667
* But we don't need to
be like everyone

1588
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:15,467
* We waited our whole lives
to finally make it here

1589
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,500
* Darling what's the catch

1590
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:21,700
* Is it too good to be real

1591
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:28,267
* Where would I be now
if it weren't for you

1592
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:31,133
* I hope this never ends

1593
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:33,667
* Oh, I hope this never ends

1594
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:44,767
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment

1595
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:51,133
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment

1596
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,767
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment

1597
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,267
* Because we're coming home

1598
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,667
* We're coming home

1599
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:13,167
* We waited our whole lives
to finally make it here

1600
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,133
* Darling what's the catch

1601
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:19,267
* Is it too good to be real

1602
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:25,633
* Where would I be now
if it weren't for you

1603
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,700
* I hope this never ends

1604
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,067
* I hope this never ends

1605
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,767
* We waited out whole lives
to finally make it here
