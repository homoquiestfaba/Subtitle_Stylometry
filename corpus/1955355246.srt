1
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,605
It was the witching hour

2
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,274
when the bogey man comes out.

3
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,860
When people go missing.

4
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,600
Matron thinks the witching
hour arrives at midnight.

5
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,437
The girls say 1 or 2 o'clock
in the morning.

6
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,191
I think it comes at 3
in the morning,

7
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,027
when I'm the only one left awake

8
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,905
Like, always.

9
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:09,408
Like now.

10
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,070
Oy!

11
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,241
You're bladdered, the lot of you!

12
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:55,579
Would you clear off!
There are children trying to sleep.

13
00:04:56,621 --> 00:05:00,792
Hello little missy.
Don't little missy me!

14
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,712
I'll call the coppers,
I will do it.

15
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,683
Never get out of bed.

16
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,029
Never go to the window.

17
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,826
And never look behind...

18
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,787
the curtain.

19
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,423
Never get out of bed,
never go to the window

20
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,675
and never look behind the curtains!

21
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,586
There aint no place to go

22
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,172
unless you has wings

23
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:48,843
I's hungry.
It's time for eats.

24
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,153
Where am I?

25
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:08,904
Giant country.

26
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,307
No such place..

27
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,002
Wish I was a long, long way.

28
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,672
Yeah, it'd be a distance.

29
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,468
What's that? What's that?

30
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,856
Giants.

31
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,734
There are more of you?

32
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,443
Yeah, well..

33
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:51,030
Flesh Lump Eater, Bone Cruncher.

34
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:56,035
Man Hugger, Child Chewer, Meat Dripper,

35
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,704
Gizzard Gulper, Maid Masher

36
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,582
Blood Bottler.
Blood Bottler?

37
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,293
Yeah. And the Butcher Boy.

38
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,961
The Butcher Boy?

39
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,340
Please don't eat me.

40
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,512
Me?

41
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:19,600
You think because I'm a giant,
that I'm a man gobbling cannibal.

42
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,359
Me? Gobbling up human beings?
Do you mind!

43
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:29,735
This I never.

44
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:33,280
Then, who are you?
What kind of a monster are you?

45
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,949
You has me wrong.

46
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,951
You snatched me.

47
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,579
Yeah, well, there
you has me right..

48
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,044
Anyway, I didn't steal
you very much.

49
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,463
After all, you's only
a little thing.

50
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:55,344
I can't help thinking about your poor
mother and father, they must be...

51
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,805
I don't have a mother or father.

52
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,558
You don't?

53
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,603
They both died when
I was a baby.

54
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,981
So you is an orphan?

55
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,900
Yes. You took me from
an orphanage.

56
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,527
You didn't know?

57
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:14,280
I.. I didn't know that.

58
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,574
Were you happy there?

59
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,784
No. I hate it.

60
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,954
The matron who runs it
is incompetent and

61
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:25,708
she has crazy rules and
you get punished a lot.

62
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,168
How is you punished?

63
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:31,755
She locks you in a dark cellar.
There are rats down there.

64
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,758
The filthy old fizzwiggler.

65
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,390
The other giants..

66
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,642
Are they nice,
like you're nice?

67
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:47,396
No, I's sorry to say the boys
would eat you up in one dollop.

68
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,694
My 24 foot,
puddin nuts in giant country.

69
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,616
And that's where you is.
In giant country now.

70
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,576
But why did you bring me here?

71
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,453
Why did you take me?

72
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:04,997
I had to take you.

73
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:11,920
Because the first thing you'd be doing, you'd
be scuddling around, yodelling the news

74
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,548
you were actually seeing a giant.

75
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:19,094
And then there would be a great
rumple dumpus, wouldn't there.

76
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:23,390
And all the human beans would be rummaging
and wiffling for the giant what you saw

77
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,852
and getting wildly excited, and then
they'd be locking me up in a cage

78
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,105
to be looked at with all the squiggling

79
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:35,819
you know, hypo-dumplings and
croco-down-dillies and gigi-raffes.

80
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:41,492
And then there would be a giganteous
look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.

81
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,118
I won't tell.

82
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,082
No-one would listen to me anyway.
I'm an untrustworthy child.

83
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,334
Yes you would.

84
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,753
No I wouldn't.

85
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:55,631
Yes you would. No I wouldn't.

86
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,716
Yes you would. No I wouldn't!

87
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:03,847
You would be telling the whole wonky world
most likely on the tele-tele bunkum box

88
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,974
and the radio squeaker.

89
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,353
I won't tell. I wouldn't ever.

90
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:13,816
Please, take me home.
I'm scared, I want to go home.

91
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,283
No.

92
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,749
Gah. It's horrible.

93
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,005
You're just going to have to
be staying here with me.

94
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,633
For the rest of our lives.

95
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:41,718
You mean, of my life.

96
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,221
For the rest of my life.

97
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,480
Hey, is you not all fridgedy cold?

98
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,276
Heh. In your little nightie.

99
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,030
I WILL run away.

100
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,868
Listen. Listen, you.

101
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,745
I is warning you.

102
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:14,042
Not to ever go wifflin' out of
this cave without I is with you.

103
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,462
Or you is coming to an
ucky mucky end.

104
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:21,133
You can't stop me.
I've run away a 1000 times.

105
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,218
I have instincts.

106
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:27,097
Instincts. I always thought
human beans was full of brains,

107
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:30,102
but you is not very clever.

108
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,436
I can stop you.

109
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:40,277
Those giants, they'd swallow you
up like a piece of frumpkin fry.

110
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,572
It's pumpkin pie, not frumpkin fry.

111
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,410
And gigi-raffes are giraffes.
Crocodile-dillys are crocodiles

112
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:51,705
and hippo-dumplings are
hippopotamuses.

113
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:59,296
I cannot be helpin it if I sayin'
things a little squiggly.

114
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,262
I cannot be right all the time.

115
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:11,099
Quite often I's left,
instead of right.

116
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,686
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

117
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,193
Yeah. Well, what I says and what I means,

118
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,446
sometimes two different things.

119
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,787
Ey, what is you reading?

120
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,123
Nicholas Nickleby

121
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,667
What's in those jars?

122
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,963
Dreams.

123
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,674
Dreams aren't things.

124
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,552
I don't dream, actually. I've got insomnia.

125
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,600
Is that right?

126
00:19:56,686 --> 00:20:01,900
Dreams is actually very
mysterious things.

127
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:09,658
All the time they is searching
for sleeping.

128
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,479
People...

129
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,001
with throbbing veins and burning skin.

130
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,798
Eyes wild and heavy.
You can.. you can read!

131
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,558
Yeah!

132
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,387
Thoughts hurried 'n disordered.

133
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:37,435
He felt as though the light were
re proach, and shrunk

134
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:41,318
involuntarily from the day

135
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:50,182
As if you were some foul
and hideous thing...

136
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:06,126
Help me!

137
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,338
No, help!

138
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:12,549
Help me!

139
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,009
Help!

140
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,573
You did that!

141
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:38,867
There you has me right.

142
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,286
I told you. I didn't dream,

143
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:43,830
so it was much scarier
than it needed to be.

144
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,416
Needs must.

145
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:54,132
Titchy little snapper whippers like you should not
be higgling around with old sage and onions like me.

146
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,847
Giants is all murdererful
and cannibals.

147
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,393
They's swallowpin' up human
beans like they's sugar lumps.

148
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,729
Beings, not beans.

149
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:11,107
Well, they'd eat you either way.

150
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,158
What is that green fizz?

151
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:21,618
Frobscottel.

152
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:25,788
All giant's is drinking frobscottel.

153
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,170
It's fizzing the wrong way.

154
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,590
All bubbles go up.

155
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,968
Up? Up?

156
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:43,765
Upward going bubbles gives
a filths of belchy burp.

157
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,809
What's wrong with a
little burp now and then?

158
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,646
Ooh, is loathesome.

159
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:54,192
But if the bubbles in your
tummy go down and come out...

160
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:57,111
someplace else,

161
00:24:57,403 --> 00:24:59,656
that could have a far nastier result.

162
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,699
A whizzpopper.

163
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:04,494
A Whizzpopper?

164
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,123
Yeah, the sign of true happiness.

165
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,713
Oh no.

166
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,720
It's glummy!

167
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,520
Runt!

168
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:40,154
Is you at home, Runt?

169
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,490
No.

170
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:46,661
You.. is jabbling.

171
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:52,375
Who is you jabbling to, Runt?

172
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,129
Why is you such a chatbag
in the morning?

173
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:58,381
Why is you not sleeping today?

174
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:01,175
Because you keep me
awake with your jabbling.

175
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,763
I's have a booboo.

176
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:07,557
Possibly later.

177
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,767
Now, Runt!

178
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,277
Right. I'll just have to fetch some water

179
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:22,738
No, no, no.
No water.

180
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:25,825
No water.

181
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:27,425
Hide, hide behind there.

182
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:39,297
Gimmee it. Gimmee it. Give't here.

183
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,227
Does you have a new
little petty-poo.

184
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:54,427
No.

185
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,140
I smells bean, Runt.

186
00:26:57,274 --> 00:27:00,234
I finds him, I eats him up.

187
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:03,934
You is barking up the wrong dog,
There ain't no bean here.

188
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,365
I's hungry.

189
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:19,045
Why don't you have that snascomber?

190
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:23,090
That is a scrumptious snascomber.
It's fresh.

191
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,301
You live on some rotten garbage, Runt.

192
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:28,054
Don't be like that.
Have you never tried that for a stump eater.

193
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:29,347
No, never.

194
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:34,185
I tell you I was guzzling that
wonder veg gleefully night and day.

195
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:35,603
Well, that's what's wrong with you.

196
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,607
The outside is horrigust.

197
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:47,281
But, the inside is smelly something
sweetly familiar.

198
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:52,244
Yeah, go on. Go on boy. Get your
lips around that, that is lovely.

199
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:57,166
Wait! Wait!

200
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,045
You hates vegetables,
you eats only beans.

201
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:05,549
I hates vegeterribles.
I eats only beans.

202
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,801
Yeah. Yeah!

203
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,260
Yeah! Yeah!

204
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,470
Yeah!

205
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:10,846
Yeah!

206
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:11,389
Yeah!

207
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:12,682
That's what I said

208
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,935
That's what I said.
I said it

209
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:21,941
I hates fruits and vegeterribles.

210
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,567
And water.

211
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,113
And water.
And water

212
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,449
I'm taking this.

213
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:38,541
You. You is an insult to giant people.

214
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,741
Cheers.

215
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,940
Too hot! Too hot!
Too hot! Too hot!

216
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,786
And something to wear?

217
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:41,492
Where'd you get the jacket?

218
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:46,205
In your scraps. It's nice.

219
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,556
Is.. something the matter?

220
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,108
No, nevermind.

221
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:23,992
Where're you going?

222
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:27,788
To work.
What do you do for work?

223
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:33,418
Ah, now you is asking me to
tell you whuppsie big secrets.

224
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,921
I won't tell a soul. How could I, anyway?

225
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,340
I'm stuck here for the rest of my life.

226
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,139
I catch dreams.

227
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:48,475
I want to come.

228
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,275
Now.. you is stayin' here.

229
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:57,985
No, I'm not.

230
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:01,280
Yes you are. You is human
bean and human bean

231
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:05,492

to those giants out there

232
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:09,329
so you gonna stay in a nice
safe place right here.

233
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,791
Not possible.

234
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,795
I goes and catch dreams, same
as every day. I goes alone.

235
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,256
I's a feature of habit.

236
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:24,553
But you'll be leaving me here with them.
They WILL eat me.

237
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,722
They is soundin' asleep.

238
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:29,516
I is going dream catching.

239
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,601
I is going alone.

240
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,188
You be snug as a bug up there.

241
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:19,816
Oh my.

242
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,419
You can't have secrets from me.
It's too late for that.

243
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:23,797
You must take me.
No.

244
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,968
We can't have secrets. I'll tell you mine.

245
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,011
I sneak out at night too

246
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,222
and I steal sometimes, and I lie.

247
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:36,434
So I'm lonely most of the time.
I've never had a best friend,

248
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,270
Sounds like you are that.

249
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:42,732
We gets over it.
We gets on with it.

250
00:36:56,871 --> 00:37:01,960
Flesh Head, he'll come and eat me,
my blood will be on your hands.

251
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:08,842
Everything about you goes against
all my better judgementals, gal.

252
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:12,345
Well I'm right about this one.
I promise I am.

253
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:26,818
See, they snooze-lents, so hold your
breath, cross your fingers.

254
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,989
Here we go. We have to go right
past all those sleeping giants.

255
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:36,119
Climb all those steps, to get
all the ways up theres.

256
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:05,591
Runt!

257
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,503
Where's you gallopping off
to in the daytime, Runt?

258
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:28,880
You know I's going off to my work.

259
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,175
You can be seen by snoopers
and bring a giant's hunts.

260
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:35,970
We is not wanting a
giant's hunts, is we?

261
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:40,225
Now let me down Flesh. Let the
boys sleep in the day.

262
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,852
We's all awake now, we might as well...

263
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:46,397
Frolic.

264
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:48,441
Yeah, we might as well frolic.

265
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:51,903
What's frolic?

266
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,822
Frolic, you know..

267
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:56,366
Oh yeah. Sorry.

268
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:59,911
Don't just take it. Do something.

269
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:02,163
Gizzard Gulper, go long.

270
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:19,347
Why you not hunt with us, Runt?

271
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:59,697
Look at the puffers!
Rain be comin'.

272
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,703
Bean.

273
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,882
You shouldn't let them treat you like that.

274
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,261
Nobody should.

275
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,265
I lives with nine bean-eating giants.

276
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,810
They takes, so I gives back.

277
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,478
I blows my dreams about.

278
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:16,023
Well, it's as good as I can do.

279
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:21,571
I do something, eh?
I do something.

280
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,557
We's here at last.

281
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:55,730
You's in dream country now, missy.

282
00:42:57,398 --> 00:42:59,817
I shared you a secret.

283
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:03,571
Look at all the stars!

284
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:11,287
Often enough on a clear night

285
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:16,959
I's hearing far away music coming
from those stars in the sky.

286
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:20,546
You do? What else.

287
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:26,093
I's hearing the tiny little ants chittering to
each other as they skiddle about in the soil.

288
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:30,931
Cattlepiddlars though.
They is the worst chatbags.

289
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:36,729
All the time they is arguing about who
will be the most pretty buttery flies.

290
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,107
Go on. please.

291
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:46,364
I hear the footsteps of a ladybird
as she walks across a leaf.

292
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,867
But the funniest, the funniest
old stories I always..

293
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:52,036
I hear it from the plants and
the trees themselves.

294
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:56,665
Yeah, they is living and growing,
laughing and chittering

295
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:58,918
Just like you and me.

296
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,669
Come on, down you go.

297
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:10,971
I's hearing all the wondrous,
and all the terrible.

298
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:14,517
Terrible, terrible things.

299
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:19,063
All the secret whisperings of the world.

300
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:21,315
Really?

301
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,820
You think I's swiss-fingering you
don't you?

302
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:27,321
No.

303
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:31,784
It's just all rather hard to believe.

304
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,777
At one point someone..

305
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:12,700
someone called me
"the big, friendly giant."

306
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,585
What shall I call you, gal?

307
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:33,095
My name is Sophie.

308
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,724
Well, jump. Sophie.

309
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:07,588
This be where all my
dreams is beginning.

310
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,266
Oh my.

311
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:39,995
As a dream comes whiffling by,

312
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:42,456
is so silvery soft,

313
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:47,920
for is making a tiny little buzzing,
humming sound, like music

314
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:08,524
Boggswinkles!

315
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,069
It's a fizzwizard.

316
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:15,823
I don't be seein' many
of them anymore.

317
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:25,416
It's behind you on your elbow.

318
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,627
No! Not that elbow,
the other one!

319
00:47:30,796 --> 00:47:32,089
Now it's on your foot.

320
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:34,716
The other foot.

321
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:45,644
It's on your bottom!

322
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:13,130
I's got it.

323
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,342
It seems to know you, gal.

324
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:24,099
Look, it is a golden fizzwizard.

325
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:26,435
I wish I could hear it.

326
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:28,103
Here.

327
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:31,231
It is very soft.

328
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:44,912
Do you actually hear
what these dreams say?

329
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:46,872
Yeah, I do.

330
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:51,501
This one sounds like you.

331
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:01,053
Hello, beautiful dream.

332
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:28,705
Look!

333
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:31,833
Go on, make yourself useful,
little frogglefrump.

334
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:34,252
I couldn't.

335
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,798
Yeah, you could. Use your hands,
your tetchy little finglers.

336
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:54,332
I got one!

337
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:55,917
Let it go, Sophie.

338
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:57,836
Give it here, give it me,

339
00:50:58,211 --> 00:50:59,421
Give it me.

340
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:08,972
Mince my maggots!
I think this be a very, very bad dream.

341
00:51:09,848 --> 00:51:11,766
There bad dreams here too?

342
00:51:14,186 --> 00:51:16,146
It be a trogglehumper.

343
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:25,280
What're you going to do with it?

344
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,951
I locks them up, wicked beastie.

345
00:51:31,828 --> 00:51:33,622
What does the bad dream say?

346
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,209
It says...

347
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:40,962
Look at what you is done.

348
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,966
And there be no forgiveness.

349
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:54,351
Where are you?

350
00:51:57,187 --> 00:51:58,772
I can't see you!

351
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:04,069
Big Friendly Giant!

352
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:38,186
Big Friendly Giant.

353
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:42,732
I'm going to call you BFG.

354
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:46,027
You calls me what you likes.

355
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,321
Where are you going next?

356
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:50,865
Dream blowing.

357
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:54,035
It be as good as I can do.

358
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,325
Why here?

359
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:37,912
Because I hears his little heart.

360
00:53:40,957 --> 00:53:42,917
What be your pleasure, missy?

361
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:48,798
Make them all happy.

362
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:13,239
BFG, did your mother or father
teach you about dreams?

363
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:16,743
Giants don't have mothers or fathers.

364
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:19,078
Never?

365
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:20,955
How old are you?

366
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:27,587
Well, I's.. as old as the earth, I suppose.
I get a little bit crumply...

367
00:54:29,255 --> 00:54:36,221
Us giants is mostly just going on and on
and on. Like whiffsea time twiddlers.

368
00:54:37,597 --> 00:54:42,602
BFG, did you hear my heart
at the orphanage?

369
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:45,605
Yeah, I hears it right now.

370
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:31,401
What does the dream say?

371
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:38,074
Well, the boy, he's dreaming that the
telephone is ringing in his house.

372
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:40,702
His da he answers it and he says..

373
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,579
Yes, this is Mr. Goulash speaking.

374
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,458
And then he's gasping like he
has a lobster stuck in his throat.

375
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:51,462
And he's saying, 'Who? What?
Yes sir. I understand. Surely, sir. "

376
00:55:51,713 --> 00:55:54,841
It's me you wish to be speaking to,
not my little boy.

377
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:58,386
And then his face turns white
and his eyes pop out of his head.

378
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:01,264
And he says Yes sir. He is
here, sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.

379
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:03,224
And he hands the phone to the boy.

380
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:08,479
Is you knowing the President of
the United States, he asks.

381
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:13,401
No, says the boy, but I suspect
he's hearing about me.

382
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:19,198
And then he takes the phone,
the boy, and he, he's having

383
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:22,493
a long chittery-chat on the
phone with the President.

384
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:26,122
Well, let me take care of it,
Mr. President.

385
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:30,835
No, no, sir, you'll bungle it up
sir, if you do it all your way. "

386
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:34,589
And his da, his eyes is
googling out of his head.

387
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:37,008
And then his ma, she comes into the room

388
00:56:37,258 --> 00:56:42,513
and his da, he tells her, and then,
and so on and so on and so on.

389
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,062
Dreams are so quick.

390
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:55,943
On the outside, they's long on the inside.

391
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:13,336
What?

392
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:15,087
I hears a lament.

393
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:21,219
Somebody's selky's is
cryin' for their darlin'.

394
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:23,638
Look!

395
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:33,648
Monsters.

396
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:37,151
We have to stop them.

397
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:40,196
You can't keep living like this, BFG.

398
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:51,499
BFG, what did you do with my blanket?

399
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:56,254
I thought you had it there. Where is it?
In my other... In the cape?

400
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,341
I think I dropped it in giant country.

401
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:08,266
You dropped it in giant country.

402
00:58:14,105 --> 00:58:15,523
Giant country..

403
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:48,306
Did I fall asleep?

404
00:58:52,476 --> 00:58:54,687
Why are you giving me a dream?

405
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:58,149
Why are you giving me a dream?

406
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:04,238
Why are you giving me a.. dream?

407
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:07,074
You dropped your blanket.

408
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:15,082
So they must know you was there.

409
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:17,334
You's not safe with me, gal.

410
00:59:18,627 --> 00:59:21,922
So? You is not safe with me.

411
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:24,633
Never mind that now.

412
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:26,886
There was a boy.

413
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,808
He liked to read. He taught
me how to read.

414
00:59:33,642 --> 00:59:36,145
You's wearing his little red jacket.

415
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:41,400
I hears his lonely heart,
just as I hears yours

416
00:59:42,026 --> 00:59:47,239
Then, he seen me, like you did.

417
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:50,326
So I had to take him, ipswitch.

418
00:59:53,496 --> 00:59:55,456
I could've brought him back home..

419
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,502
but then it be too late.

420
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:03,422
It won't be like that.

421
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:08,469
We'll stop the giants.
We'll make them go away forever.

422
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:34,286
Was the boy scared?

423
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:39,625
Yeah. In the end.

424
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,128
I'm not.

425
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,841
Brave Sophie.

426
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,469
I'm not.

427
01:00:54,848 --> 01:00:58,435
I'm not! I'm not.

428
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:05,544
BFG, you say you can hear
ants talk and spiders spin.

429
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:08,130
And you can hear the stars.

430
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:10,883
Can you still hear me?

431
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:56,970
I feel you're here.
I know you're here.

432
01:03:14,113 --> 01:03:15,781
Jump, Sophie.

433
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:07,249
I need a plan.
I need a plan.

434
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:08,949
I need a plan.

435
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:12,254
Are you thinking of a plan?

436
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:18,552
I's not having the foggiest
idea in the wonky world.

437
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:20,846
Well, keep at it.

438
01:04:22,246 --> 01:04:23,246
Runt!

439
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:28,312
Sophie, hide.

440
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:38,989
Oh Runtie, is you at home.

441
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:23,408
I has a boo-boo.

442
01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:28,121
Well, you's a big boy. You take care
of your boo-boos yourself now.

443
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:32,209
I will.
Oh, he will.

444
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,503
You has a bean.

445
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:36,254
Right, out!

446
01:05:36,922 --> 01:05:38,866
Let's get on with it.
Let's get on with it.

447
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:40,966
Time to hunt.
Time to hunt!

448
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:53,230
Skitter scatter boys.
Find me the chiddler.

449
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:09,287
This be my work.

450
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:11,581
This be my work, boys!

451
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,503
Look at me!

452
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,340
Once, we giants, we be gentries.

453
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,759
Those days are over.

454
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:26,972
Where is the delicious little chat-bay?

455
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,764
Right, out, all of you!

456
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:08,365
He find the last one.

457
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,284
I finds this one.

458
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:16,826
This be my home.

459
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:24,959
You don't come in here any more!

460
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:29,297
Go on, get out!

461
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,259
Curse you, be Runt.

462
01:10:35,303 --> 01:10:38,139
Get out!
This be my home!

463
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:43,144
You. You is insult to giants.

464
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:10,815
Well, there be my dreams
disappeared into a thick ear.

465
01:12:11,482 --> 01:12:12,942
Into thin air.

466
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:15,987
Words.

467
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,323
There's so such a twitch-tickling
problem to me all my life.

468
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:21,576
I knows exactly what
words I want to say

469
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:25,455
but somehow they all come
out squish squiddled round.

470
01:12:25,705 --> 01:12:27,999
Don't worry. That happens to everyone.

471
01:12:28,332 --> 01:12:32,545
Not like it happens to me,
I speaking the most terrible wigglish.

472
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:36,299
Well, I think you speak beautifully.

473
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:41,179
You do? You really do?

474
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:42,397
Uh hum.

475
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:44,932
Simply beautifully.

476
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,401
That is the nicest present that anybody
has ever given me in my entire life.

477
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:56,601
BFG?

478
01:12:57,069 --> 01:12:58,863
Oh, woopsie splunkers!

479
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:00,063
BFG?

480
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:04,952
How absolutely - what's the word - squiffling.

481
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:07,747
BFG!
I's all of a stutter!

482
01:13:07,947 --> 01:13:08,947
BFG!

483
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:11,147
Yeah, yeah.

484
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:14,128
I have a plan.
A plan?

485
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:17,798
We are going to the Queen.
We really really need her help.

486
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,467
We can be there by dawn.

487
01:13:32,647 --> 01:13:35,316
Right, you be giving your queenie

488
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:39,737
a frightsome curd-bloodling
troggle-humper

489
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:43,908
Needs must.
Scary as you can make it.

490
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:02,051
The Queen will dream that giants, all
nine of them, are in England.

491
01:14:02,718 --> 01:14:06,889
And they are eating little children.

492
01:14:24,407 --> 01:14:27,034
Be sure to put some army in it.

493
01:14:50,182 --> 01:14:52,101
Be sure you have a little of me.

494
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:07,867
Did you add yourself?

495
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:46,947
The Queen will dream,
that a little girl

496
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:53,204
is sitting on her window sill.
Then, she wakes up, and I am there.

497
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:54,955
We are there.

498
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,791
And then what happens?

499
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:02,213
Well. Then a
Big Friendly Giant steps forward

500
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:04,506
and bows and says..

501
01:16:05,466 --> 01:16:08,636
Your Majesty.
I am your humble servant.

502
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,348
You mean she actually sees me?

503
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:19,563
No, not in a month of Mondays, gal.

504
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,198
BFG, stop.
You're going to knock me off.

505
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:15,327
I'm trying to listen to the different
breathing of manly bean and lady bean.

506
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
No. No no

507
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,304
No, horrible.

508
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:18,307
Make them stop.
Make them stop.

509
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:20,476
Giants. Giants!

510
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:24,855
Horrible. Man-eating giants!

511
01:18:25,314 --> 01:18:28,692
No, stop. No! No!
No no no.

512
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:32,905
Your Majesty?

513
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:36,575
What is it?

514
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:38,827
Mary.

515
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,663
I had the most horrible dream.

516
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,877
Well, only a dream, ma'am.

517
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:50,047
Let me get your tea.

518
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:06,438
I dreamed that girls and boys were snatched
out of their beds in boarding schools

519
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:11,151
and were being eaten by
the most ghastly giants.

520
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,780
There was so many of them.

521
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:17,324
There was the Flesh Lump Eater.

522
01:19:17,824 --> 01:19:19,826
and the Gizzard Gulper

523
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:22,913
and the Meat Dripper

524
01:19:24,456 --> 01:19:25,457
and the..

525
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:30,128
Butcher Boy.

526
01:19:31,088 --> 01:19:32,130
I'm sorry

527
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:35,092
The giants put their hands
in through the windows,

528
01:19:35,092 --> 01:19:37,302
and plucked the children
out with their fingers.

529
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:41,181
It was so bloody,
so vivid, so real.

530
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:43,517
So real, Mary.

531
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:46,436
The children just disappeared.

532
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,113
Oh my.

533
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:00,867
What the matter, dear?
You're white as a sheet.

534
01:20:03,495 --> 01:20:05,205
Well sit down. Mary, sit.

535
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:07,666
You're trembling.
What is it?

536
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:11,211
It's just..

537
01:20:11,962 --> 01:20:14,423
It's so odd, ma'am.
So very odd.

538
01:20:15,048 --> 01:20:17,592
You haven't seen the papers?
No, I haven't seen them yet.

539
01:20:18,802 --> 01:20:22,514
Here. Look.
It's the very dream you had.

540
01:20:23,473 --> 01:20:27,853
Children have disappeared in the
night. Gone. Taken.

541
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,231
But not by giants.

542
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,567
Well, no, it couldn't be,
could it ma'am.

543
01:20:45,704 --> 01:20:46,997
Draw the curtains.

544
01:20:48,373 --> 01:20:49,416
Yes, ma'am.

545
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:00,016
Oh!

546
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,686
I don't believe it.

547
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:14,483
There's a small girl standing
on the window sill.

548
01:21:16,234 --> 01:21:17,486
Is there not, Mr. Tibbs.

549
01:21:18,653 --> 01:21:20,155
There is indeed, ma'am.

550
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:23,074
She is standing right there, ma'am.

551
01:21:23,825 --> 01:21:25,160
You didn't dream it.

552
01:21:26,203 --> 01:21:27,412
But I did dream it.

553
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,251
How in the world did you get there?

554
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,213
Well...

555
01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:37,839
Let me handle this ma'am,
come down.

556
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:39,299
No, no, don't do that.

557
01:21:40,217 --> 01:21:42,719
A giant put you there.

558
01:21:44,387 --> 01:21:49,601
Yes, he did, ma'am.
He's waiting in the garden now.

559
01:21:50,227 --> 01:21:51,561
Is he?
Is he?

560
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:55,732
He's my best friend.

561
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:58,026
He made your dream.
Did he?

562
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,736
Did he?
Did he?

563
01:22:00,946 --> 01:22:02,864
Queen's garden.
Rear window, please.

564
01:22:02,948 --> 01:22:05,825
Why have you and your
giant come to see me?

565
01:22:08,078 --> 01:22:12,958
I think you would remember that,
Your Majesty, if the mixing went well.

566
01:22:14,084 --> 01:22:15,460
Yes. I remember.

567
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:21,174
You have a plan.
You need me.

568
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,011
Yes. We do.
Should we call for him now?

569
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:28,056
I suppose we should.

570
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:31,935
You promise you won't
hurt him, ma'am?

571
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:35,480
Rear garden, rear garden please.

572
01:22:39,317 --> 01:22:40,694
I'm ready.

573
01:22:44,094 --> 01:22:45,094
BFG.

574
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:57,252
BFG, the queen would
really like to meet you.

575
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,636
You won't put him in the bunkum house?

576
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,186
Come down from there, child.

577
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:21,901
Mary, take her downstairs and
get her some breakfast,

578
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:24,154
Mr. Tibbs, find out where she comes from.

579
01:23:24,571 --> 01:23:31,244
No no. He's just afraid. He's never done
anything like this in his whole life before.

580
01:23:32,829 --> 01:23:36,207
BFG.
Be brave.

581
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,278
You promised you wouldn't hurt him.

582
01:24:06,362 --> 01:24:09,949
Mr. Tibbs.
Tell the guards to stand down.

583
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:13,161
Mr. Tibbs.

584
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:21,294
Stand down, gentlemen, please.
Stand down.

585
01:25:06,297 --> 01:25:07,632
Dear. Come here.

586
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:23,982
Your Majesty, I am your humble servant.

587
01:25:26,985 --> 01:25:33,199
Youe Majester, I is your humbug servant.

588
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:41,749
I am so pleased to make
your acquaintance.

589
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:52,969
Oh Majester, oh monarcher, oh ruler..

590
01:25:55,471 --> 01:25:57,390
of straight lines.

591
01:25:59,976 --> 01:26:06,649
I's come with my little
friend Sophie to give you a...

592
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:13,156
To give me what?

593
01:26:15,575 --> 01:26:17,785
Assistance.

594
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:23,875
Thank you, I'm sure you have,
but not in my dressing gown.

595
01:26:29,047 --> 01:26:33,760
Giants, Boris. Man-eating giants.
Have people been disappearing?

596
01:26:35,636 --> 01:26:38,389
We have verifiable intelligence.

597
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:41,184
We might need air clearance.
I'll get back to you.

598
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:52,779
Nancy, is Ronnie there?

599
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:58,659
Well, wake him.

600
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:06,417
Her Majesty the Queen.

601
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:34,195
This way, sir.
Just follow me

602
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:38,533
Follow me.
That's it, sir.

603
01:27:39,408 --> 01:27:42,411
Slow ahead, careful.

604
01:27:43,496 --> 01:27:46,415
And full stop.
The port side sir.

605
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,709
Careful of the antiques, sir.

606
01:27:52,171 --> 01:27:53,464
And up. Up.
Careful, up, up.

607
01:27:54,173 --> 01:27:56,592
That's it.
Hard to port.

608
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,887
And slow.. ahead.

609
01:28:06,936 --> 01:28:10,690
Steady. Yes sir.

610
01:28:15,528 --> 01:28:17,738
Boggswinkles! What was that?

611
01:28:18,447 --> 01:28:20,032
That was Louis quatorze.

612
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:22,952
I'm so, so, so sorry, Your Majesty.

613
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,497
He's never really been
in a house before.

614
01:28:27,248 --> 01:28:28,916
Your cape, sir.

615
01:28:30,334 --> 01:28:34,547
What a whupsi spliffering room we is in.

616
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,640
Your valet, sir.

617
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,340
Your Majesty.

618
01:28:56,777 --> 01:29:00,656
This room is so gigantous I's needed
bi-circulars and telescopes

619
01:29:00,906 --> 01:29:02,408
to see what's going on at either end.

620
01:29:03,284 --> 01:29:04,702
Does he always talk like that?

621
01:29:05,578 --> 01:29:09,790
Yes, Your Majesty.
He's never had schooling.

622
01:29:34,231 --> 01:29:35,566
Sir.

623
01:30:44,635 --> 01:30:47,096
Please BFG, start.

624
01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:12,705
There is only one word
for that, Majester.

625
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:17,293
Scrum-diddly-umptious!

626
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:25,509
Oh. That is glummy.
Good bye snascomber!

627
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,428
What's snascomber?

628
01:31:28,095 --> 01:31:32,433
It's this horrible stinky vegetable and
I'm afraid it's all he has to eat.

629
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:34,977
Doesn't seem to have
stunted his growth at all.

630
01:31:44,153 --> 01:31:46,447
Poor BFG his coffee please.

631
01:31:51,911 --> 01:31:54,663
What's that?
What's that black stuff.

632
01:31:54,863 --> 01:31:59,263
What's that?
What's all that foam?

633
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:03,714
He's magnificent, your giant.

634
01:32:06,634 --> 01:32:08,427
Sophie, dear, do start.

635
01:32:09,386 --> 01:32:11,180
You must be famished.

636
01:32:27,321 --> 01:32:29,031
It's delumptious.

637
01:32:58,221 --> 01:32:59,221
Oggle-frunk.

638
01:33:08,821 --> 01:33:15,786
Please, Majester. What is this horrible
swig-pill I was drinking, Majester?

639
01:33:16,662 --> 01:33:17,955
Would he prefer tea?

640
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:20,541
Would prefer frobscuttel.

641
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,376
Frobscuttel?

642
01:33:23,752 --> 01:33:26,839
A little gift for Your Majester.

643
01:33:27,423 --> 01:33:29,591
Delumptious fizzy frobscuttel.

644
01:33:29,883 --> 01:33:31,593
It be a personable for rent.

645
01:33:32,219 --> 01:33:33,303
How kind.

646
01:33:33,762 --> 01:33:37,808
Would Your Majester be so kind
as to honor me with...

647
01:33:41,103 --> 01:33:42,855
a pour?

648
01:33:45,065 --> 01:33:48,694
It's fizzing the wrong way.
Our bubbles go up.

649
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:54,241
Yeah. We would have some
galumptious whizzpopping music.

650
01:33:54,783 --> 01:33:56,910
Does he like music?
We have bagpipes.

651
01:33:57,452 --> 01:33:59,121
The generals have been briefed, ma'am.

652
01:34:14,595 --> 01:34:17,639
This is a story that beggars belief,
but we don't have the time.

653
01:34:18,724 --> 01:34:21,226
We're on our way to giant country.

654
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,646
BFG will chart a course for you.

655
01:34:25,063 --> 01:34:27,191
Generals, BFG.

656
01:34:31,195 --> 01:34:35,449
In 10 hours, the giants will
once again be on the hunt

657
01:34:35,824 --> 01:34:38,035
and I intend to stop them.

658
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:43,123
And where exactly
is giant country, sir.

659
01:34:43,832 --> 01:34:45,626
Where is it?

660
01:34:58,513 --> 01:34:59,565
There.

661
01:34:59,765 --> 01:35:00,765
What?

662
01:35:00,849 --> 01:35:02,059
There.

663
01:35:02,309 --> 01:35:05,020
Gentlemen, your men
will follow the BFG.

664
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:08,857
I have promised him that you
will go only once to giant country.

665
01:35:09,066 --> 01:35:11,193
You'll not be finding
it a second time.

666
01:35:24,164 --> 01:35:26,333
Just look at those bubbles.

667
01:35:39,137 --> 01:35:42,432
I believe in the BFG.

668
01:35:43,132 --> 01:35:44,132
The BFG.

669
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:46,132
To the BFG

670
01:35:57,656 --> 01:35:59,116
Marvellous bubbles.

671
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:49,541
To giant country.

672
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:42,093
We will hold here.

673
01:37:43,887 --> 01:37:47,390
BFG. I'm asking if you have a plan.

674
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:51,019
BFG? Do you have a plan?

675
01:37:53,063 --> 01:37:54,814
BFG. Do you have a plan?

676
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:02,155
The troggle-humper I caught.
You're giving it to the giants?

677
01:38:02,781 --> 01:38:07,118
Yes, I's giving the boys the
most horridest dream of despair.

678
01:38:07,452 --> 01:38:12,248
If the dream does its job, they wakes
trapped in flush-bunkun remorse.

679
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:15,335
And if those whuppsie belly poppers
out there does their job,

680
01:38:15,627 --> 01:38:17,754
then I think we stands a chance.

681
01:38:18,838 --> 01:38:23,677
Look at what you has done,
and there be no forgiveness.

682
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,931
Needs must.
Now, stand back, gal.

683
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:04,884
We has brought the hunt
to giant country.

684
01:39:08,138 --> 01:39:10,390
What is Sophie's dream?

685
01:39:11,599 --> 01:39:17,021
A golden fizzwizard.
I don't see much of them any more.

686
01:39:19,149 --> 01:39:21,317
But what does it say?

687
01:39:29,576 --> 01:39:31,828
It tells the story of a little girl.

688
01:39:32,537 --> 01:39:35,915
A little chiddler, with her
whole life ahead of her.

689
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,377
With a family of her own.

690
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:44,632
Little chiddlers of her own, too, someday.

691
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:48,052
There'll be great successfuls

692
01:39:48,636 --> 01:39:51,181
and funnies ahead for her.

693
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:56,895
Truth to tell, just a dribble of despair.

694
01:39:58,313 --> 01:40:02,150
Times'd be hard, times'd be soft.

695
01:40:03,234 --> 01:40:05,445
Adventures'd come and go.

696
01:40:07,405 --> 01:40:12,994
But in the end,
she remembers the good deeds.

697
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:19,375
Now, Sophie, I know

698
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,838
that story be your hearts desire.

699
01:40:25,507 --> 01:40:26,883
I knows it.

700
01:40:27,842 --> 01:40:32,597
The dream, it came to you, didn't it?
It be Sophie's dream.

701
01:40:36,392 --> 01:40:38,978
But then I wake up.

702
01:40:40,104 --> 01:40:41,522
And you wakes up.

703
01:40:43,775 --> 01:40:45,443
But not here.

704
01:40:46,402 --> 01:40:50,698
No, you has more dreams to catch,

705
01:40:52,033 --> 01:40:53,660
my little froggle-frump.

706
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:59,249
But not in giant country.

707
01:41:07,006 --> 01:41:11,719
But will I still have you?
Will you still hear me when I call for you?

708
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:16,933
Are you forgetting something?
Are you forgetting these?

709
01:41:30,571 --> 01:41:32,532
It be time, BFG.

710
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:44,329
Now, where did I put the...

711
01:41:46,129 --> 01:41:48,840
I left me trumpet at Her Majesters.

712
01:41:51,634 --> 01:41:54,512
I'm such a mixed up

713
01:41:55,346 --> 01:41:59,142
boggled up giant sometimes.
Deliver us from weasels.

714
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:03,939
Sophie.

715
01:42:04,339 --> 01:42:05,639
Oh no.

716
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:06,839
Oh no, Sophie.

717
01:42:32,508 --> 01:42:35,386
And what does we have here?

718
01:43:02,205 --> 01:43:03,998
You is a cannibal!

719
01:43:04,898 --> 01:43:06,398
I is bad!

720
01:43:09,378 --> 01:43:12,590
Have pity on a poor little giant!

721
01:43:13,925 --> 01:43:16,469
You are a very bad giant.

722
01:43:17,553 --> 01:43:19,472
I has no regrets.

723
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:24,227
Runt.
Run Sophie, run.

724
01:43:27,647 --> 01:43:31,692
It's over, Flesh Lump Eater.
It's over, boy.

725
01:43:32,985 --> 01:43:34,904
It's time to stop now.

726
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:39,116
I's always hungry.

727
01:44:00,716 --> 01:44:02,216
Come on lads!

728
01:44:09,516 --> 01:44:10,516
Take him away!

729
01:45:09,665 --> 01:45:11,834
The giants were taken far, far away

730
01:45:12,334 --> 01:45:14,211
to a place you've never heard of

731
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,505
and a place you'll never go.

732
01:46:07,056 --> 01:46:12,394
The Queen sent them off with snascomber
seeds. It was all they would have to eat

733
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:20,152
and they were just going
to have to get used to it.

734
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:53,394
It's time to wake up, darling.

735
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:08,742
Morning, Sophie.

736
01:47:19,878 --> 01:47:21,797
I had a dream last night.

737
01:47:23,382 --> 01:47:28,304
In the dream I was awakened by a beautiful
buzzing humming noise floating above my bed.

738
01:47:34,393 --> 01:47:37,271
I walk to the window and
against the horizon

739
01:47:37,521 --> 01:47:42,693
I saw his long legs leaping,
suitcase and trumpet in hand.

740
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:47,740
I could see all the way
to giant country,

741
01:47:48,324 --> 01:47:50,909
I could see the garden
BFG was growing.

742
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:54,913
He had fruits and berries,
cauliflower and tomatoes

743
01:47:55,372 --> 01:47:58,167
He refused to have Brussels sprouts,
though,

744
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:01,670
but snascombers were still
growing beside his cottage

745
01:48:02,254 --> 01:48:04,506
How else would he make frobscuttel?

746
01:48:06,467 --> 01:48:09,636
I saw the stone door and
the crooked windows.

747
01:48:11,055 --> 01:48:13,015
His cape was hanging by the door.

748
01:48:14,391 --> 01:48:17,686
I saw the crow's nest,
and his sailor boat bed.

749
01:48:19,897 --> 01:48:23,650
I saw his rocking chair and the
fire burning in the fireplace.

750
01:48:23,984 --> 01:48:26,320
With a much nicer stew cooking.

751
01:48:30,449 --> 01:48:33,285
I could see the scattered pages
of the book he was writing.

752
01:48:37,498 --> 01:48:38,999
He was happy

753
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,460
and I was happy.

754
01:48:42,669 --> 01:48:46,215
When I'm lonely, which is
not nearly as often as before

755
01:48:46,715 --> 01:48:50,177
I talk to him and he actually hears me,

756
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:57,768
because BFG hears all the secret
whispering of the world.

757
01:48:59,269 --> 01:49:00,979
Good morning, BFG.

757
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:50,979
