1
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,355
- What the hell's that all about?
- Nothing.

2
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,638
Hey, Mike, you in a hurry?

3
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,956
What's with them?

4
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,590
Maybe they're just tired.

5
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,434
Sorry, boys, the kitchen's closed.

6
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,236
We're sticking to the story.

7
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,433
No matter how rough it gets,
understand?

8
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,270
Whatever.

9
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,716
Greg?

10
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,599
Go ahead, Mike, make that phone call.
We're all with you. Go on.

11
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,236
That's right, man.

12
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,113
That's right, go.

13
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,674
Working your boys kind of late tonight,
were you, Mike?

14
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,108
<i>This is Sergeant Reynolds</i>
<i>from Criminal Investigations</i>

15
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,313
<i>calling Lieutenant Frank Watters. </i>
<i>Are you there, Lieutenant? Over. </i>

16
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,754
- <i>Lieutenant, do you read me? Over. </i>
- I'm here, Sergeant.

17
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,918
<i>I've checked with Sheriff Davis. </i>
<i>He says he'll give you all the details</i>

18
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,714
<i>when you get to Snowflake. Over. </i>

19
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,275
What's his problem?

20
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,268
<i>Frank, it sounds like he's</i>
<i>in over his head on this one. Over. </i>

21
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,436
I hear you.

22
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,473
Police investigation. There's nothing
for you to see or to hear, so just...

23
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,672
Everybody just go on home, now.
There's nothing to see.

24
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,509
Get in your cars, take your kids,
take your families, go on home.

25
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,235
Lieutenant Watters?

26
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,670
- I'm Frank Watters.
- Sheriff Blake Davis.

27
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,758
I know a lot about you, yes, sir,
from the papers.

28
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,748
Sure do. About you not having any
unsolved cases here or in Montana.

29
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,633
Nothing but a myth.
But a damn fine one.

30
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,559
Now, why the radio silence
on bringing me here, Sheriff?

31
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,116
Well, we got a special kind
of situation here, Frank.

32
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,073
A missing boy on our hands.
Travis Walton.

33
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,590
About an hour ago, a deputy of mine
took a missing-persons report

34
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,951
from a fella by the name of Rogers.
Mike Rogers.

35
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,958
I've known him a long time.
He's a good guy, straight guy.

36
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,116
He's been running a crew
up the Mogollon Rim

37
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,276
near Turkey Spring
for about a month.

38
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,313
Yep, they had a government contract
to clear out the brush.

39
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,476
Dennis!

40
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,318
I want you to meet my deputy.

41
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,398
Dennis, shake hands
with Lieutenant Watters. Deputy Clay.

42
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,352
- Hi, Dennis.
- It's an honor, Lieutenant.

43
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,835
I read about that wetback murder
you handled down Nogales way.

44
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,319
Dennis, can you tell us who else
is in that gang besides Mike Rogers?

45
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,149
Yeah. We got David Whitlock, 26.
Local boy, active in the church.

46
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,193
Greg Hayes, 17.
High school kid from Winslow.

47
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,154
This one's pretty shook up.
Robert Cogdill, 20, from Durango.

48
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,511
Joined the crew just a week ago.
Allan Dallis, 25.

49
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,756
A drifter,
on the crew just over two weeks.

50
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,396
- Bad apple, if you ask me.
- Yeah. He's got hell in his eye.

51
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,591
Sure does.

52
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,758
Frank, I think that...

53
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,712
I think that maybe...

54
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,071
Maybe you better hear this
from the horse's mouth.

55
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,838
Lead me to the horse.

56
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,474
- Dennis, get these folks out of here.
- Come on, folks.

57
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,069
Give them some room.

58
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,714
Restaurant's closed for the night.

59
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,430
- Now, what in the hell is that thing for?
- It bother you?

60
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,269
- Yeah, it bothers me.
- I don't want any misinterpretations.

61
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,596
This way there's a clear record
of everything you tell us.

62
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,873
Well, we already told that Barney Fife
of a deputy everything we know.

63
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,638
I'll tell you, Frank,

64
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,114
Clay wrote down everything.

65
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,675
We'll use the recorder.

66
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,711
A man with nothing to hide
is a man with nothing to worry about.

67
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,272
- You're the leader, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,436
Yeah, he's our fearless leader.

69
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,393
Maybe I should be
talking to you instead.

70
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,152
Oh, no. No, sir. He's the boss.
There's no doubt about that.

71
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,835
Tell me about Travis Walton.

72
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,110
- About what happened?
- About Travis.

73
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,276
Start by telling me who he is.

74
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,556
He's...

75
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,676
He was my best friend.

76
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,470
Wake up, Dad, wake up.
Wake up, Dad.

77
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,036
It's the tickle monster!
It's the tickle monster.

78
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,754
Ow, what are you doing?
Daddy just cracked his elbow.

79
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,190
How are you? Good morning.

80
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,868
- Good morning. What are you doing?
- Breakfast is ready!

81
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,150
- Waking you up.
- Who told you to wake me up?

82
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,634
- Mommy did!
- Mommy did!

83
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,114
Why did she tell you to wake me up?

84
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,470
Because she wants me
to tickle you again?

85
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,319
Travis, you son of a bitch,
get off that bike!

86
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,676
Cathy, what are you doing?

87
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,552
Nothing, Mom.

88
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,115
Hey, get that thing
off the sidewalk, Travis!

89
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,272
Here you go. Coming in. There you go.
You want butter on that?

90
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,155
- Can I have some French toast?
- Sure.

91
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,476
I can have some?

92
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,750
I got some for you right here.

93
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,110
No, I gotta go.
I gotta get the truck running.

94
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,915
Wait a sec. Let me talk to you
for a second, please.

95
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,679
What...? The bank's gonna
call again today.

96
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
- So?
- So, what should I tell them?

97
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,832
Do we have to talk about that
right now?

98
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,510
No, you know what? We can wait
till they throw us out of our house.

99
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,155
Hey, Mike!

100
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,356
Morning.

101
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,196
What's the matter?

102
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,990
You and Katie again?

103
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,190
Hey, Mike, want a doughnut?

104
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,916
Make you feel better.

105
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,469
About time we got yours
back on the road, don't you think?

106
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,116
Unless you got some secret plan
to let it rust and sell it for scrap.

107
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,788
We'll start tonight.
What do you think?

108
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,434
I gotta show you something.

109
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,394
- What's this?
- This is our future.

110
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,999
MT Motors.

111
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,236
Serving all of Navajo County.

112
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,829
Harleys, Nortons, Yamahas,
you name it.

113
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,235
We'll do commercials like the guys
in Phoenix.

114
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,352
"MT Motors. Our prices are so great,
our showroom

115
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,120
is almost always empty. "

116
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,632
Get it? Empty. M-T... Motors.

117
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,798
Empty. What do you think?

118
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,829
I think we better just concentrate
on finishing the contract.

119
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,429
The Forest Service
won't extend the deadline.

120
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,108
Mike, don't worry. This is the deal.

121
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,674
Look, Travis, my mortgage
is on the line.

122
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,996
I gotta worry. I got no choice, man.

123
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,551
We'll get it done or we won't.

124
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,476
Hey, where you going?

125
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,836
Love awaits me.

126
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,435
Look, it's Uncle Travis.

127
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,598
- Hi, Uncle Travis.
- God. Travis, can't you use the door?

128
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,313
- No.
- Go...

129
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,679
- Morning.
- Good morning.

130
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,190
Breakfast in bed.

131
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,472
Thank you.

132
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,388
Dana, let's get married.
I can't wait any more.

133
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,673
- Travis.
- Don't answer. Don't answer. Just...

134
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,836
Just think about it.

135
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,876
OK.

136
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,908
Can we get going, please?
Before I get seriously sick.

137
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,599
- See you later.
- OK.

138
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,476
How you doing, fellas?

139
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,552
- Good morning.
- Hi, guys.

140
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,712
Bobby, every day I tell you
turn it down or turn it off.

141
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,194
I'm not gonna tell you again.

142
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,316
You need to listen
to some blues, man.

143
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,192
You guys got any doughnuts
up there?

144
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,356
Well, we did, Dallis, but we ate them all.

145
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,879
Hey, listen to this, man:

146
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,038
"Lady in Borneo gives birth
to a litter of 13."

147
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,037
- Litter?
- Yeah.

148
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,593
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean, man?

149
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,109
It's right here. Read it.

150
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,719
Get out of my way.

151
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,277
- Hey, leave him alone.
- Shut up, mind your own business.

152
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,389
What if I make it my business?

153
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,716
Is that what you want, dude?
You wanna make it your business?

154
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,151
- Can you girls stop fighting?
- Why don't you shut up, David?

155
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,918
- Hey! Knock it off, man.
- You knock it off.

156
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,112
- No, you knock it off, Dallis, now.
- No, you knock it off.

157
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,595
Come on, man. This is a good song.

158
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,074
Turn it down, Bobby. I mean it.

159
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,155
All right, boys. Let's get moving.

160
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,949
All right, listen up.
It's gonna be a long day.

161
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,152
David and Dallis, you guys alternate
on the big saw to buck the windfall.

162
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,793
- Bobby and Greg are on clean-up.
- Right.

163
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,833
Let's try to get the east side
of Pine Mountain before sundown.

164
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,998
All right? Get the water. Let's go.

165
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,229
Another day, another dollar.

166
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,196
Down the hill!

167
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,996
Wide load now.

168
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,430
Timber.

169
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,952
All right, lunch!

170
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,836
Not too bright!

171
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,196
Can't hear you.

172
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,152
Hey, knock it off, Dallis!
I said lunch!

173
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,958
Dallis!

174
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,436
- Hey.
- Hey, bud.

175
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,871
What do you say we do a little fishing
when the contract's over?

176
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,513
When this contract's over, huh?

177
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,029
Come on, it's what we need.
One of our camping trips.

178
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,312
Some hunting, some fishing,
chasing bears.

179
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,318
Oh, yeah, I remember.
You ran that bear up that tree.

180
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,590
I was just trying to make friends.

181
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,595
So how come you can't
make friends with Dallis?

182
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,995
He's just jealous
I can do something he can't.

183
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,158
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Read and write.

184
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,915
So, what do you say, man?
A little R and R, and then MT Motors.

185
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,749
You think I'm gonna let
a flake like you marry my little sister?

186
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,394
A flake from Snowflake. How poetic.
I like that.

187
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,556
Yeah, that's just my point.

188
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,239
What's your point?

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,955
You're a dreamer.
And you're not ready for marriage.

190
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,636
Not if I gotta turn into you...

191
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,398
...Mike.

192
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,750
We went back to work,

193
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,269
and we finished up along about dusk.

194
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,678
The day's work was done
and the five of you left the work site.

195
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,155
Six. There was six of us.

196
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,034
- Travis Walton left with you?
- Of course.

197
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,196
The rest of you boys
go along with that?

198
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,356
Yes.

199
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,069
How about you, Mr. Dallis?

200
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,509
You go along with that?

201
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,029
Oh, yeah, I go along with that.

202
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,196
You don't sound too sure.

203
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,356
Well, I'm sure.

204
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,396
- What's it to you?
- Oh, it just seems like that you had

205
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,716
the biggest axe to grind with Travis.

206
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,992
What was that whole thing
with that chainsaw?

207
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,668
I was just having some fun.

208
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,479
That's all.

209
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,240
You gonna arrest me for that?

210
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,634
What happened to your hand?

211
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,319
- I did it to myself earlier today.
- Just having a little fun?

212
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,875
Yeah, that's right,
I was just having a little fun.

213
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,550
You ought to be more careful, son.

214
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,675
Yeah, well, I'll do my best, Daddy.

215
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,952
I'll bet you will.

216
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,278
Why don't you fellas
tell Lieutenant Watters what you saw?

217
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,869
Or what you think you saw.

218
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,718
It was Dallis that saw it first.

219
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,592
What about it?

220
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,395
Tell us about it. What did you see?

221
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,556
What did it look like?

222
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,796
It looked like...

223
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,914
Like a fire.

224
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,070
- You awake?
- I'm awake.

225
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,874
What in the hell is that?

226
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,558
That is strange.

227
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,150
What is?
What are you guys looking at?

228
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,599
Looks like the sunset to me.

229
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,156
No, Greg, that's east. The sun set
behind us 20 minutes ago.

230
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,669
Well, what do you think it is, then?

231
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,316
Maybe a fire or maybe
a plane crash in the woods.

232
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,035
Yeah. Yeah, a plane crash. It could be.

233
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,158
Christ, man.

234
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,839
Hey, what the hell is that?

235
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,031
Maybe we should just
turn back, huh?

236
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,152
That's gotta be a fire.

237
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,232
Look, it's moving.

238
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,351
I saw it.

239
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,994
- It isn't moving, Bobby. It isn't...
- Look, man.

240
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,519
Is it?

241
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,676
That's one monster forest fire there.

242
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,359
Fire, my ass.

243
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,432
That ain't no fire, man.

244
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,234
What else could it be?

245
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,309
What the heck is going on here, Mike?

246
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,794
- You screwing around?
- No.

247
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,236
Mike, maybe we ought to do
like Greg says

248
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,714
and just pull over for a minute.

249
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,797
No, Mike. I wanna see what it is.

250
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,238
There's only one road out of here
and we're on it.

251
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,793
If that's a fire
and we can't get around it,

252
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,718
we're gonna be
spending the night out here.

253
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,430
Mike?

254
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,439
Stop, Mike! Stop the truck!

255
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,236
- That's wild.
- Holy Christ.

256
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,789
- Travis!
- Travis!

257
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,592
- You son of a bitch!
- The hell you doing?

258
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,995
Get back in the truck, asshole!

259
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,758
What is that?

260
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,679
- What is that thing?
- Oh, my God!

261
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,036
Travis!

262
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,111
The hell's he doing out there?

263
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,073
- Get back to the truck!
- The hell is that?

264
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,554
- Travis!
- Get back in the truck!

265
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,673
- Get out of there.
- What is that?

266
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,393
I don't know what that is.

267
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,792
Hey, Mike!

268
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,353
Travis, get out of there!

269
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,028
Leave the son of a bitch here
if he's gonna be an asshole!

270
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,831
Travis, get back here! Travis!

271
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,190
Run, Travis, run!

272
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,676
- What the hell is that?
- Do you feel that?

273
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,235
- Crazy...
- Travis!

274
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,198
- Travis!
- Get the hell out of here!

275
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,868
- Get back in here! Travis!
- What the hell is that?

276
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,316
Travis!

277
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,719
He's...

278
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,990
- He's...
- Go! Go!

279
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,156
Go! Go!

280
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,759
Mike, he's dead! He's dead!

281
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,356
- Oh, Mike, he's gone!
- Go!

282
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,913
- I'm not leaving him.
- He's dead!

283
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,394
I'm not leaving him here!

284
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,750
- Go! Get out of here! Go!
- Get the hell out of here, Mike!

285
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,234
He's dead.

286
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,714
What the hell you doing?
He's dead!

287
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,195
- He's dead. He's dead.
- Come on!

288
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,916
- Get the hell out of here!
- Let's go!

289
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,350
Go! Go!

290
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,838
- He's dead!
- Oh, my God!

291
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,315
It's moving! It's coming after us, man!
It's gonna kill us.

292
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,318
Stay down! Stay down!
Everybody stay down!

293
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,151
Slow down, Mike!

294
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,791
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

295
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,592
- What the heck was that thing?!
- I don't know!

296
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,836
I don't know, Mike!
I don't know what it is.

297
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,235
- What was it?
- Oh, my God!

298
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,396
What was that?

299
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,477
Slow down, Mike!

300
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,912
Shit!

301
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,959
Come on, man, you're gonna kill us.

302
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,037
- Is it following us?
- I don't know.

303
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,356
I can't see it. Is it following us?

304
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,630
- I don't know!
- Shut up!

305
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,389
- Come on!
- Look out!

306
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,831
- Come on, man!
- Get off of me!

307
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,638
What in the hell you stopping for?

308
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,195
We left him there.

309
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,039
- He's dead, jackass!
- We gotta go back.

310
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,390
- No!
- No way. What are you talking about?

311
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,956
No, maybe we do gotta go back.
Maybe we gotta go back!

312
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,513
- No way! No!
- No way, man! No!

313
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,392
We don't know that he's dead yet.

314
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,398
- Get out of here! Let's get...
- What are you talking about?

315
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,670
I'm going back! I'm going back!

316
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,030
If you don't wanna go,
get out of the car now.

317
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,595
I'll come pick you up later.

318
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,952
- You can't do this to us, man.
- What if you don't come back, Mike?

319
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,836
Get out.

320
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,628
Go, man. You gotta go. Get out.

321
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,115
It'll be all right. You stay by the road.

322
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,396
Son of a bitch.

323
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,076
I...

324
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,840
I searched the woods and...

325
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,996
But he wasn't...

326
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,476
There was nothing...

327
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,916
They took him.

328
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,160
You expect me to believe

329
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,115
that a flying saucer came down
and took your friend away

330
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,276
to outer space?

331
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,040
That's the truth, mister.
That's exactly what happened.

332
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,832
Is it?

333
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,110
Is it? According to your story,
you never even went back

334
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,073
to the clearing,
so you don't know, do you?

335
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,554
I didn't have to go back.

336
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,231
Mike Rogers says he wasn't there,
you can take it to the bank.

337
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,919
And you know that, Blake.

338
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,712
Why the heck aren't you
speaking up for us?

339
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,672
Why you letting this man
talk to us like this?

340
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,711
- David, I...
- It seems like you're not even trying

341
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,592
to believe us.

342
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,756
We all saw the thing.

343
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,518
We all saw the guy get zapped.

344
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,676
You saw something.

345
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,796
At least, you thought you did.

346
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,992
- And what about you, son?
- Me?

347
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,156
Yeah. What did you see?

348
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,155
I saw the same...

349
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,031
Same as they saw.

350
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,475
Well, that's quite a story.

351
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,671
Yeah, well,

352
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,475
I think it's about time to get out of here.
What do you boys think?

353
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,877
You're real broken up about
your missing buddy, aren't you?

354
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,036
Oh, that's very perceptive.

355
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,913
- That's because he's not my friend.
- I got that.

356
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,509
- Clearly.
- Did you?

357
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,314
Good. Now, are you done?

358
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,909
We'll tell you when.

359
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,872
I don't want anybody to leave till I get

360
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,275
everybody's phone number
and address.

361
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,152
- Shouldn't we try to find him?
- This is a...

362
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,033
He's not on the mountain, remember?

363
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,595
They took him.

364
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,998
Well, what do you think?
Think we ought to head up there?

365
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,909
Too late. Not enough men.
We'll head out in the morning.

366
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,556
Well, Dallis, you sure can talk.

367
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,433
See, I told you he wasn't
gonna believe your damn story.

368
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,676
Not a goddamn word of it.

369
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,358
Looks like they were
working on it there.

370
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,473
Boy, that truck looks like
it's been to hell and back.

371
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,989
Well, the sun comes up
at six in the morning.

372
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,589
We got 50 men, jeeps, horses, dogs.

373
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,877
I wanna call Flagstaff
and get two helicopters.

374
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,389
- That be enough?
- That's plenty.

375
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,512
My hunch is, tomorrow
we'll find Travis Walton.

376
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,678
Of course, I'd be surprised
if we found him in one piece.

377
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,757
Yeah.

378
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,190
You recommend a good motel, Sheriff?

379
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,913
Yeah. Chapparal.

380
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,554
Just after you get inside to Snowflake,

381
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,751
right there by the water tower.

382
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,951
Still, you have to wonder
how those boys

383
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,878
came up with such a crazy story.

384
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,196
Yeah.

385
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,960
Back on earth,
we're dealing with a murder.

386
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,116
Plain and simple.

387
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,958
Goodnight, Sheriff.

388
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,276
Goodnight, Frank.

389
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,470
<i>An Agriculture Department</i>
<i>spokesman acknowledged that... </i>

390
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,798
It's all over the radio. They're making
it out to be a big joke or something.

391
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,956
It's no joke.

392
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,878
You left him there?

393
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,355
I don't know where he is, Dana.

394
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,356
What do you mean,
you don't know where he is?

395
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,516
Just what I said.

396
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,713
Well, how could you just
leave him out there?

397
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,912
The radio was saying something
about outer space.

398
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,872
I didn't just leave him.

399
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,117
And, yeah, there was
something out there, Kate. I...

400
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,754
I... I don't understand. "Out there"?

401
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,349
Is Travis gone?

402
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,796
They're gonna send out
a search party for him tomorrow.

403
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,753
Where is he, Mike?

404
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,429
Where is he, Mike?
Where is he, Mike? Mike...

405
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,311
It's OK. He's gonna be OK.

406
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,036
It'll be all right.

407
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,314
My Father in heaven,
I humbly bow before You.

408
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,000
I ask for Your spirit to be with me.

409
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,836
Forgive us, Father,
for what we've done.

410
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,389
I want two-man teams on that ridge.

411
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,319
If that boy's out here, I wanna find him.

412
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,634
- You got it?
- I got it.

413
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,559
Let's get going, boys.
And God bless you.

414
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,989
You're certain? This is the spot?

415
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,839
I mean, it was night, but... but, yeah.

416
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,996
Here. It was right here.
This is exactly where he fell.

417
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,872
You said there was
an obvious depression.

418
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,354
That we could see it clearly.

419
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,596
This is it, right here.

420
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,349
Now, where the hell was it?
Was it over there, was it over here?

421
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,869
What are we doing, playing games?

422
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,876
I'm not sure.

423
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,956
I see.

424
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,755
He doesn't believe us.

425
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,473
Where's my brother, Mike?

426
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,148
- What'd you guys do with him?
- Look, Dan, take it easy.

427
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,557
- Back off, Whitlock.
- Hey, we're gonna find him, Dan.

428
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,030
Which one of you is Allan Dallis?

429
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,992
He's not here.

430
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,919
- What about him?
- I did some checking.

431
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,918
Your hired hand's got himself
a nice little criminal record.

432
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,395
Assault with a deadly weapon.

433
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,876
Listen, Mike, if anything
happened to my baby bro...

434
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,117
...I'm holding you personally
responsible. You got that?

435
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,556
Yeah.

436
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,269
Give me a break. I came up here
to earn some money, man.

437
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,710
Now I might go to prison.

438
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,229
Well, maybe it's God's way
of punishing us, Bobby.

439
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,112
Spare me the God talk, OK, David?

440
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,594
Hey, even if you don't believe in Him,

441
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,074
you know the difference
between right and wrong.

442
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,033
We all do. We got no excuses.

443
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,316
What?

444
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,236
What is that?

445
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,599
Apache reservation starts
right up there. Right there.

446
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,075
<i>Hey, we got something over here!</i>

447
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,512
- Find anything yet?
- I don't know.

448
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
Wonder what they'll find in there.

449
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,714
You got any ideas, Mike?

450
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,115
There's something here, Sheriff.

451
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,390
- Is it Walton?
- It's him.

452
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,239
- I knew it.
- They killed him.

453
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,198
What is it?

454
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,674
Quit digging.

455
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,836
It ain't human, Frank.

456
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,038
Some hunter buried his dog.

457
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,196
I thought that was him.

458
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,713
Dana's staying over
at the Waltons' house.

459
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,509
Some guy from the ALI.
Called today.

460
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,554
They've taken you off the contract
and hired a whole new crew.

461
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,276
You don't seem too surprised.

462
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,999
I'm not.

463
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,474
Well, why aren't you?

464
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,069
What are we gonna do
for a pay cheque next week?

465
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,714
Look, I'll figure it out, all right?

466
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,832
You know, I don't get this.
My best friend has disappeared.

467
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,998
God knows where he is,
and all you can think about is money.

468
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,719
I'll tell you something else.

469
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,559
People in this town are saying
terrible things about you.

470
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,115
- Well, I don't care what they think.
- Well, I do.

471
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,598
We live here, our kids live here.
Of course I care, and so should you.

472
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,268
- Mommy.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

473
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,835
You know what? Listen,
why don't you go back to bed,

474
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,678
and I promise you
I'll read you that story.

475
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,633
I promise, OK? OK.

476
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,796
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

477
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,518
What's she gonna say, huh?

478
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,518
When everybody says
her father's a liar or...

479
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,714
Go on, say it.

480
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,992
A liar or a murderer.

481
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,190
Including you?
Are you saying that, Kate?

482
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,435
No.

483
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,631
No. Of course not.

484
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,996
I just... Michael, I just want you
to tell me

485
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,509
what really happened up there.

486
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,513
I told you what happened.

487
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,836
I told you all I know.

488
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,511
You believe me, don't you, Kate?

489
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,956
You do believe me?

490
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,159
<i>Hello? Yes, this is 51098,</i>
<i>what is it?</i>

491
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,750
<i>This is Western Union... </i>

492
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,474
You know, Mike, the word's out.

493
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,476
Well, what word
would that be, Tom?

494
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,272
Oh, I don't know, it's just that

495
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,233
I been getting calls all day
from here to Timbuktu.

496
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,476
As of tomorrow, I'm all booked up.

497
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,831
- Well, who's calling?
- Reporters, sightseers,

498
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,110
UFO buffs and the like.

499
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,153
Hey, Mike,
what's really going on here?

500
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,878
- Can you keep a secret, Tom?
- You bet.

501
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,116
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

502
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,349
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers.

503
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,792
You know, I feel like asking you

504
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,355
if it's a beautiful day
in your neighborhood.

505
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,077
Ray Melendez,
Action News, Phoenix.

506
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,236
- Look, I just woke up.
- Oh, that's no problem.

507
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,670
I just need to ask you a few questions.
What do you say, huh?

508
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,359
I've got nothing to say.

509
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,472
Well, see, I figured that you'd wanna,
like, you know,

510
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,318
set the record straight.

511
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,873
What with everything that's being said

512
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,593
about you and all, you know...

513
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,199
Well, you figured wrong.

514
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,470
It's for your own...
It's for your own good, you know.

515
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,910
Just talk to the people.
Let them know what really happened.

516
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,076
What do you say? Come on.

517
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,639
- Hey, you guys, I think it's him.
- Is that him?

518
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,114
I think so.

519
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,754
Mike Rogers. Excuse me.
Mr. Rogers.

520
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,758
Mr. Whitlock. I'm Jarvis Powell,
from AFAR.

521
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,155
We have had a lot of experience
in these matters,

522
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,352
and I think we might be able
to help each other out.

523
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,035
Well, we just wanted
to let you know that

524
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,630
there are those of us out there
who know the truth.

525
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,195
Now he's talking to this other guy.

526
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,673
Go on.

527
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,548
Please, give us a call
if we can be of service.

528
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,716
Let's go.

529
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,238
Any time.

530
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,318
- How much do I owe you, Earl?
- Two dollars.

531
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,914
<i>Seventy-one, sixty-five... </i>

532
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,313
Betty.

533
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,557
Yeah, I know. These boys know more
than they're telling.

534
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,509
What the heck's that lowlife
Buck Morton staring at?

535
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,597
He keeps looking over here.

536
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,189
Mike, this town's gone nuts.
Everything's crazy.

537
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,311
Yeah, I can see that,
now that we're TV news.

538
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,750
They're going up
to look for Travis again.

539
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,234
They won't find anything.

540
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,513
Watters come by at six in the morning,
he starts asking us all these questions.

541
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,073
He's all over us, man.

542
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,113
- Yeah, he said if we cooperated...
- Come on.

543
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,912
- If we confess.
- Confess?

544
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,271
Yeah. Yeah, if we confess,
he's gonna try to help us out.

545
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,277
Help us.

546
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,277
What the hell's going on
around here?

547
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,675
You got something
you wanna say to me?

548
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,559
- Go sit down, Buck.
- Hot food, coming through.

549
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,548
You boys wanna remedy this,
we can step outside right now.

550
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,070
You gotta be kidding me,
you fat piece of shit.

551
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,669
- You little son of a bitch.
- Get off of me! Get off!

552
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,154
- Come on.
- Calm down!

553
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,237
Come on, calm down.

554
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,873
Come on.

555
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,470
Back away there and let Miss Ida
through with that food, will you?

556
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,193
God almighty.

557
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,994
Get over there and drink that coffee
before it gets cold, boy.

558
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,838
How you boys running today?

559
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,793
- Anything, Mike?
- How's my boy?

560
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,274
No. Thanks, Ida.

561
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,879
Sit down, David, sit down.

562
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,036
Cool down, fellas.

563
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,275
Listen, fellas, I want you all to know

564
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,358
that there's not a damn thing
personal in this.

565
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,915
Now, where's your friend?

566
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,111
- Which one?
- Come on, Mike.

567
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,039
The one with the attitude.

568
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,549
Well, if you mean Dallis,
I don't know.

569
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,835
We got a proposition for y'all.

570
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,191
I want you to take
a lie-detector test.

571
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,109
If you're telling the truth,
it'll sure strengthen your cause.

572
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,554
We'll think about it.

573
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,398
I got a good man
right here in the state.

574
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,717
I mean, you could take it today,
tomorrow, any time that y'all feel...

575
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,593
I said we'll think about it.

576
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,192
Why don't we have a little talk,
Mike, huh?

577
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,356
Outside.

578
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,234
Young Greg told us the truth
about the cut on Dallis's hand.

579
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,840
It wasn't a paper cut, was it?

580
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,873
He had an altercation with Travis
on the day of the disappearance.

581
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,196
Isn't that true?

582
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,988
I guess.

583
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,668
I think you're starting to get
a pretty good feel

584
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,269
for who I am, Rogers.

585
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,836
I've been at this line of work
for a long time.

586
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,759
You know what's starting to bug me?

587
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,157
I think maybe
you didn't kill your friend.

588
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,953
But for the life of me,

589
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,038
I can't figure why you're covering up.

590
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,110
- What the heck's he want?
- I don't know. Let's go.

591
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,437
- Where we going?
- To find Dallis.

592
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,676
Dallis? I thought you don't know
where he is.

593
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,313
I lied.

594
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,760
All right, I'm gonna raise you
ten on this. I'm gonna raise you...

595
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,270
Guys, just speak American, please.

596
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,236
Well, fellas.

597
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,516
Well?

598
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,470
I heard what's been happening in
that stupid little Mormon town of yours.

599
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,073
Told you that story wouldn't work.

600
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,236
Yeah, well, you know they took away
our logging contract, Dallis?

601
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,998
Do you know that, huh?

602
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,839
Well, that figures. They're a bunch
of chickenshit assholes.

603
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,156
Yeah, well, speaking of chickenshit,

604
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,396
where you been?

605
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,636
I been around.

606
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,432
You knew where to find me,
didn't you, Mike?

607
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,154
Davis and Watters
are looking for you, Dallis.

608
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,032
They know about
your criminal record.

609
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,798
They know you lied
about how you hurt your hand.

610
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,230
- They know you're full of it...
- You're full of information today,

611
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,193
- aren't you, choirboy?
- Well, it don't make us look good

612
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,551
- when you don't show up. No, it don't!
- Well, that's too goddamn bad!

613
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,400
They want us to take
a lie-detector test.

614
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,750
I wanna know
what you think about it.

615
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,553
You wanna know
what I think about it?

616
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,432
That's right.

617
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,596
I'll tell you what I think.

618
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,838
I think those devices
are very dangerous, man.

619
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,473
That machine says you lied.

620
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,399
It don't matter
if you told the truth, you lied.

621
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,670
It might clear us, though.

622
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,874
Oh, it might clear you.

623
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,032
You know,

624
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,390
they don't need a body
to press murder charges,

625
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,434
did you know that?
Did you know that, huh?

626
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,791
And they ain't never gonna find Travis.
You know that and I know it, right?

627
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,151
So then the pressure's gonna be on
Davis and Watters to solve the case.

628
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,237
And who do you think
they're gonna zero in on, huh?

629
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,590
What, you, choirboy?

630
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,360
And God'll send
a swarm of locusts down on them.

631
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,198
And you, Mr. Pillar-of-the-Community?

632
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,550
No, I don't think so.

633
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,751
No, the question is,

634
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,758
how long before you boys decide
to save your lily-white asses

635
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,313
and point the finger at me?

636
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,112
- That's a load of crud...
- No, that's exactly

637
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,153
- the way it's gonna be!
- That's a load!

638
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,195
If we decide to take
this lie-detector test,

639
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,992
we all take it.

640
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,838
Don't you point your finger at me.

641
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,758
All right, Mike. Come on!

642
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,916
All right! All right!

643
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,150
All right. Go.

644
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,910
- Get away from me.
- All right, Dallis, you just be there.

645
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,794
That was nice, that felt good.

646
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,836
Just be there.

647
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,716
