Wow. My favorite villain

00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,128
This could be
a great opportunity

728
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,193
if you don't kill me.

Don't actually do that, though.

Somebody bring me a phone.

It's ransom time.

749
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:56,650

I can't have you lose an arm,

1255
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:05,581
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

1256
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:08,814
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

1257
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,547
Betsy, knock it off.

1258
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:14,913
(grunts) Hey!

1259
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:16,746
Whoa! Oh, no. (grunts)

1260
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:21,845
(grunts)
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

1261
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,445
(Wild Knuckles yelling)

1262
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:25,378
Whoa. Help! Oh, no.

1263
00:56:25,411 --> 00:56:27,610
- The net!
- (groans)

1264
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:30,610
I got you! I got you!

1265
00:56:30,644 --> 00:56:33,544
- (grunts, screams)
- I don't got you.

1266
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,976
(grunts)

1267
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,241
Take my hand.

1268
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:40,842
- Whoa. Whoa.
- (straining)

1269
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,742
- I got you!
- (yells)

1270
00:56:45,274 --> 00:56:47,474
(low growling)

1271
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:50,674
(both sigh in relief)

1272
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,273
(both panting)

1273
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,873
You could've run,
but you... but you didn't.

1274
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:59,238
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

1275
00:56:59,272 --> 00:57:02,706
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

1276
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:05,538
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

1277
00:57:05,571 --> 00:57:09,705
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

1278
00:57:09,738 --> 00:57:12,837
(gasps)
That's all I ever wanted.

1279
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,570
You want, uh...
I don't know, you want me...

1280
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:18,303
you want me to teach you
a thing or two?

1281
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:20,636
Mm-hmm-hmm!

1282
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:24,269
MASTER CHOW (echoing):
Many fighters have asked me,

1283
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:27,735
how did I become a great master?

1284
00:57:27,768 --> 00:57:29,435
(gasps) Hey, look-a!

1285
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,232
(grunting)

1286
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:43,699
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

1287
00:57:43,732 --> 00:57:45,964
You just dig down deep,

1288
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:48,964
find your inner beast, and...

1289
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,230
(roars)

1290
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:56,563
Uh... gesundheit?

1291
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:58,596
Now you try.

1292
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,896
Uh...

1293
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:01,962
(yells)

1294
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:03,829
(coughs)

1295
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:05,662
(blows raspberry)

1296
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:08,561
(snarling playfully)

1297
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,361
(sighs)

1298
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:16,593
Find your inner beast!

1299
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:18,693
(speaking Minionese
frantically, whimpering)

1300
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:19,959
Stop this kick.

1301
00:58:19,993 --> 00:58:22,259
(distorted grunt)

1302
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,992
(screams)

1303
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,559
(groans weakly)

1304
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:29,324
We have a lot more work to do.

1305
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:30,658
(Bob chuckles)

1306
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:32,957
(grunting fiercely)

1307
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:34,357
(Stuart groans)

1308
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,857
(whoops fiercely)

1309
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,623
(Minions grunting)

1310
00:58:38,656 --> 00:58:41,222
("Born to Be Alive"
by Jackson Wang playing)

1311
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,690
(Bob yells excitedly)

1312
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:44,555
(speaks Minionese)

1313
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:46,522
(grunting)

1314
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:48,789
(grunting, speaking Minionese)

1315
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:51,355
(speaking frantically
in Minionese)

1316
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,688
(frightened whimpering)

1317
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:55,820
(grunts)

1318
00:58:55,853 --> 00:58:57,220
(vocalizes)

1319
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:58,853
(seal barks)

1320
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:00,853
(speaking Minionese)

1321
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,486
- (laughing)
- (seal grunts)

1322
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,786
- (screams)

1323

(speaks Minionese)

1324
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:09,518
(sneezes)

1325
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,384
(speaks Minionese,
chuckles nervously)

1326
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:15,184
(hollow thumping)

1327
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:23,816
(speaking Minionese)

1328
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:26,416
(chuckling)

1329
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:28,315
(shouts in Minionese)

1330
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:29,948
(yelling playfully)

1331
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:32,248
Eh? Eh? (speaks Minionese)

1332
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:34,514
(grunts fiercely)

1333
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:36,814
- (Minions grunting weakly)
- (Stuart passes gas)

1334
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:38,647
(Minions screaming)

1335
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:42,680
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

1336
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,979
(gasping, cheering)

1337
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:46,446
(speaking Minionese)

1338
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:47,945
No, no, no, no, no!

1339
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:51,712
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

1340
00:59:51,744 --> 00:59:54,411
(sighs) They're dead.

1341
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,643
First rule of heists:
always stay in character.

1342
01:00:02,677 --> 01:00:04,543
Got it, Grandpa.

1343
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:09,542
Say, do you mind
if we use the john?

1344
01:00:09,575 --> 01:00:12,808
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

1345
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,508
Uh-huh.

1346
01:00:19,974 --> 01:00:22,340
(device whirs, beeps)

1347
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:29,938
(gasps)
The Bank of Evil.

1348
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:32,338
(quiet chatter)

1349
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,337
It's showtime, kid.

1350
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:45,369
Follow my lead,
and don't forget your cue.

1351
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,403
Hello. I, uh...
I just need to cash this.

1352
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:52,335
Oh, wowie zowie!
What a big bank.

1353
01:00:52,368 --> 01:00:55,235
How many security guards
are in here?

1354
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:56,567
Who's this little guy?

1355
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:59,401
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

1356
01:00:59,434 --> 01:01:02,600
that children should be seen
and not heard.

1357
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:04,333
(chuckles) Kids.

1358
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:06,400
I actually have a son of my own.

1359
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,632
(groans) He looks weird.

1360
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,766
(chuckling):
Oh, don't listen to him.

1361
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,265
Your son is very, uh, cute.

1362
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,831
MR. PERKINS:
Hmm.

1363
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:18,297
(yells) Oh, no!

1364
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:19,830
- (groaning)
- MR. PERKINS: Oh.

1365
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:22,296
Oh, help!
I'm seeing a white light.

1366
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:26,230
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

1367
01:01:28,295 --> 01:01:31,229
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

1368
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:32,462
Oh. Help!

1369
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,395
- (groaning)
- Help my-my pop-pop!

1370
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:37,927
Somebody help him!

1371
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:39,261
Huh?

1372
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:40,494
My grandpa!

1373
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:41,837
- GUARD: We need a doctor!
- (chuckles)

1374
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:43,893
This is the big one.

1375
01:01:43,926 --> 01:01:46,459
- Whoa! (yells)
- GUARD: Oh.

1376
01:01:47,426 --> 01:01:49,359
WILD KNUCKLES:
You hear that?

1377
01:01:49,393 --> 01:01:51,692
It's the sweet sound of angels.

1378
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:54,825
- Help!
- (grunts)

1379
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,258
Do something!

1380
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:58,658
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

1381
01:01:58,691 --> 01:02:00,624
(grunts)

1382
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,256
(beeps)

1383
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:10,789
(grunting)

1384
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:13,389
WILD KNUCKLES:
No, no, no. The other way.

1385
01:02:13,422 --> 01:02:15,188
The other way. (groans)

1386
01:02:15,222 --> 01:02:17,354
(strained grunting)

1387
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:18,821
(whimpers, screams)

1388
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:20,521
All right, everyone stand back.

1389
01:02:20,554 --> 01:02:22,488
- (whirring)
- Uh-oh.

1390
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,663
- Clear!
- No, wait a minute. Wait.

1391
01:02:23,687 --> 01:02:25,620
(grunts rapidly, groans)

1392
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:27,220
(people gasping)

1393
01:02:27,253 --> 01:02:29,253
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

1394
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:30,886
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

1395
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,619
- Clear!
- (rapid grunting)

1396
01:02:33,653 --> 01:02:35,518
Maximum charge.

1397
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,251
- Clear!
- Thank you.

1398
01:02:37,284 --> 01:02:39,485
You saved my grandpa.

1399
01:02:39,518 --> 01:02:42,251
Uh, did we...
did we do the heist?

1400
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:43,651
(Gru chuckles nervously)

1401
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:46,783
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

1402
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:48,783
- You dropped these.
- Um...

1403
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:51,750
(Wild Knuckles groaning)

1404
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:54,316
Look what I got!

1405
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:56,181
Hey. Not bad.

1406
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:57,649
Not bad at all.

1407
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:59,215
We make a good team.

1408
01:02:59,248 --> 01:03:00,514
We do?

1409
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:02,648
Oh, yeah.
Hey, we got to keep at it.

1410
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:04,914
Wait till you see what
I'm gonna teach you next.

1411
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,280
I cannot wait.

1412
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:10,146

Okay, Stuart...

We can find a better name later,

1479
