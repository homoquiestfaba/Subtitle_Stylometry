1
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,373
You okay, baby?

2
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,821
Yeah.

3
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:23,550
Same one?

4
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,097
Yeah.

5
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,271
Come back to bed.

6
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,435
Sorry.

7
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,584
I hate what this has done to you.

8
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,660
Yeah, I'm okay.

9
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,038
I'm okay.

10
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,851
Were you just gonna leave
without telling me?

11
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,878
No.

12
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,225
How many times do we have to do this?

13
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,272
I know.

14
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,808
I gotta make it right, baby.

15
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,542
Always so serious.

16
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,774
We're gonna be a family...
it's different.

17
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,673
Yeah.

18
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,102
Apache will help us.

19
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,556
It's hard leaving you this time.

20
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,827
Hey...

21
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:10,932
you're a soldier.

22
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,232
Yeah.

23
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,578
Good morning.

24
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,347
Detective Dan Adams,

25
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,158
LAPD.

26
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:28,041
Cushko, Russian
Special Intelligence Agency.

27
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,060
So what we got going on here today?

28
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,214
Well, you play the local,

29
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,777
our department should be able
to handle the rest.

30
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:40,512
You want cigarette?

31
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:44,871
- No, trying to quit.
- Yes, me, too.

32
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,130
All right, let's see what this girl
got for us.

33
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,392
Hey, it's me.

34
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,065
I got the rendezvous point.

35
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:09,625
Reyes Creek. Yeah, it'll be good
to see you, too, brother.

36
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,279
Yeah, well, old times die hard, right?

37
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,873
Man, those days are long gone.

38
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,078
Yeah, yeah, we can talk about it.

39
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:23,226
All right, later.

40
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,547
- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me. Everything okay?

41
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,707
Well, I miss you already.

42
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,189
- Miss Laura Wiley?
- Yes.

43
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,740
Detective Adams,
this is Special Agent Cushko.

44
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,293
You mind if we come in
and ask you a few questions?

45
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,363
Please, come on in.

46
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:06,281
Thank you.

47
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:12,042
- Somebody's holding?
- Oh, no, not any more.

48
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,910
Oh, my God, last night. Hey, girl!

49
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,481
Good morning, ladies.
We'll be just a few minutes.

50
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,950
My bad.

51
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,118
Please, have a seat.

52
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:29,865
- Nice place you got here.
- Thank you.

53
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:32,974
So, what's all this about?

54
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,161
Well, we believe that you
have been dating an officer

55
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,180
who's gone AWOL for some time.

56
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,494
A Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Miller?

57
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,372
You happen to know where he is?

58
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:48,290
- AWOL?
- Absent without leave.

59
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,745
I know what it means, but Conrad, AWOL?
He's Mr. Military Guy.

60
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:57,222
- Is he in trouble?
- When's the last time you saw him?

61
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,860
We had drinks a few weeks back.

62
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,986
Now, Miss Wiley,

63
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,587
neighbours said they saw him
leave this morning.

64
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:11,554
He still has keys.
If he came in and didn't say anything,

65
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,508
well, you see the boxes.
I'm trying to move on.

66
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:18,154
- You guys broke up?
- Yeah, it's... it's complicated.

67
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:21,232
On and off again. Try dating a soldier.

68
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:24,292
You didn't perhaps overhear
anything that might...

69
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,520
well, give you an idea of where he is?

70
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,739
Something military related,

71
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,976
or perhaps just something
out of the ordinary?

72
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:35,073
No, he kept to himself, you know,
a really quiet guy.

73
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:39,429
Look, I know this can be very frustrating,
but this is just procedure.

74
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,204
We really need to know where he is.

75
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,671
No, I understand,

76
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,427
but I'm not really interested in knowing
where he is, you know what I mean?

77
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,968
Are you sure about that?

78
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:55,573
Dating Conrad is not the easiest thing
in the world.

79
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:59,277
In fact, I can think
of a thousand things that are easier.

80
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:02,372
This on-again, off-again situation,

81
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,158
waiting by the phone until he calls.

82
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,345
Some girls can handle it,
some girls can't.

83
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:10,311
Yeah, I get it.

84
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,064
Well, look,

85
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,259
- we'll let you get back to your Saturday.
- Thank you.

86
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:19,111
Remember that he is in a very,
very serious situation.

87
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,242
- Do the right thing.
- Of course.

88
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,545
- Miss Wilder, are you here all the time?
- Yes.

89
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,583
Okay, just take my card and...

90
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:31,443
if you do hear from Mr. Miller,
don't hesitate to call us.

91
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,371
I won't.

92
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,222
Shit.

93
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,774
One last thing...

94
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:46,291
aiding and abetting a criminal
is a serious offense.

95
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,186
- No joke.
- I understand.

96
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,699
Have a good day.

97
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:58,112
She's definitely covering for him.

98
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,955
We call that a Lah-dee-dah chick
in my neighbourhood.

99
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,643
Then we'll just have to put
a little more pressure on her?

100
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,620
Copy that.

101
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,115
You know you have
your traffic duty cops?

102
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:14,360
You have them do
a little further research on her.

103
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,107
Well, I could... run the plates,
do a background check?

104
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,360
- Cigarette?
- No, I told you I'm trying to quit.

105
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,664
Keep this for later?

106
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,734
Hello, sir.

107
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,940
- $29.10?
- Okay. How are you today?

108
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,845
How's it look like I'm doing?

109
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,950
Hey! You can't do that!

110
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,762
Hurry up!

111
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,046
Hey.

112
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,022
Hello. Are you okay?

113
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,482
You want me to call somebody?

114
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,231
Give me a tall one.

115
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,658
Give me a fucking beer, you bitch!

116
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,361
Come on! What the fuck?

117
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,856
You're gonna clean this fucking shit
with your hands now, you got it?

118
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,616
- What's going on with you?
- Clean it up!

119
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,661
- What are you doing? Clean this shit up!
- Stop!

120
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,645
Get in the fucking car right now!
Not on the Bird!

121
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,979
- Clean this shit up!
- Stop!

122
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,001
- I'm not gonna fucking stop!
- Hey...

123
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,879
- What? What do you want?
- I'm okay, it's not bad.

124
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,624
Hey, that's enough.

125
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:09,434
What, are you stupid?
You know who the fuck I am?

126
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,429
No, I don't know who you are.

127
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,605
Fucking asshole.

128
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,367
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

129
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,680
- What's your name?
- Q.

130
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:25,208
Are you crazy? This guy's gonna hurt you.
Just get out of here.

131
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,732
Motherfu...

132
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,206
Really? Prick.

133
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,328
It's Q, right? Get out of here.

134
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:40,387
- What are you still doing here, go! Come on.
- Okay. Alright.

135
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,761
- You got a license?
- Yeah.

136
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,704
You didn't see anything, right?

137
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,008
- Nothing, I saw nothing.
- Good. That's what I thought.

138
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,904
Here, key to the truck.

139
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,557
Title and registration are
in the glove box. Be kind to her.

140
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,239
Yes!

141
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:44,733
- Is this what you were looking for?
- Yeah, thank you.

142
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:50,843
- Hey. You busy? You have a second?
- Always.

143
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,338
Here's the paper you requested...

144
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,715
nothing too special.

145
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,666
But I did notice one thing
when running the info you gave me.

146
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:03,390
The owner of the house was willed
to a Laura Wilder. And you said Wiley.

147
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,418
- She said her name was Laura Wiley.
- Maybe she meant Wilder?

148
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:10,605
- It's possible.
- Anyway, the plates on the car are clean.

149
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,781
We're still waiting
for more results from the lab.

150
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,298
This is what we found on him so far.

151
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,846
And this officer is AWOL 72.

152
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:25,795
Shit, it'd be better for everybody
if it was 72 hours instead of 24.

153
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:28,622
Yeah, the longer we wait,
the longer it takes.

154
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:31,612
Something with this picture
don't sit right with me, though.

155
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,676
Anything wrong, Detective?

156
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,133
What do you see?

157
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,812
Have Jones run prints from this.
I need it back in two hours.

158
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,220
Okay... sir.

159
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,645
I'm on it.

160
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:50,945
- Rose?
- Yeah.

161
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:54,767
- I didn't forget about dinner.
- You better not.

162
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:22,746
- Hello.
- Mr. Miller, I have him for you now.

163
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,116
- I trust this line is secure?
- It is.

164
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:31,269
I wanted to let you know personally
your wire came in.

165
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,706
When shall we expect you
to retrieve funds?

166
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,576
In about two days.

167
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:40,394
You know I can't keep this here
for more than 48 hours?

168
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:45,107
Even in my country, Interpol doesn't
like us doing business with Eastern Europe.

169
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,670
That's probably why you guys charge
40% more than any other bank, right?

170
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,389
We'll be there in two days.
Make sure you get it ready.

171
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,586
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, good.

172
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,484
- Just pretty quiet.
- Just relaxing.

173
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,804
- Conrad's fine, you know. He'll be back.
- I know.

174
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:26,757
I don't like it, because when the police
come knocking at your door,

175
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:28,758
it's usually never a one-time thing.

176
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,362
Rebecca, you've been watching
way too much TV.

177
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,382
Hey, you saw the guys.
Laura knows what she's doing.

178
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:37,084
- It'll get figured out.
- It's just weird, that's all I'm saying.

179
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,170
Let me guess,
somebody's spying on us right now?

180
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,605
- Maybe.
- Okay, you guys watch too much CSI Miami.

181
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:46,127
Okay, hello, those TV shows have
consultants, so it's completely legit.

182
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,706
- Yeah, it's totally legit.
- Totally legit.

183
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:50,734
Totally.

184
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,553
- Hello?
- Hey, baby, it's me.

185
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,256
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. You okay?

186
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:01,233
Sorry I hung up on you.
I had company today.

187
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,695
- Who?
- Two men, LAPD and Russian.

188
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,239
- What do you want me to do?
- Start getting everything ready.

189
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,791
I'll be back to pick you up tomorrow.

190
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,511
It's now or never, baby.

191
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,404
- Laura?
- Yes.

192
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,050
Keep your friends away from the house,
okay? For their own good.

193
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,240
Okay.

194
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:23,541
- Be safe. I love you.
- Yeah, me, too, baby.

195
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:36,861
You are so co-dependant, you know?
There's like classes for that.

196
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:40,998
He leaves, he comes back, he leaves.
I don't know why you put up with it.

197
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:44,233
- You deserve better, you are hot shit.
- I'm pregnant, that's what I am.

198
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:49,398
- Shut up!
- No way! Oh, my God!

199
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,270
Wait, does that mean
I get to be the godmother?

200
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,157
Oh, look, he's back.

201
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,176
Good afternoon, ladies.

202
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,005
Jesus, you don't have anything
better to do on a weekend?

203
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,606
What's better than hanging out
on the beach, getting some sunlight,

204
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:10,369
- looking at pretty girls?
- Jesus.

205
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,987
- Am I under investigation, Detective?
- No, not yet, but...

206
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,665
I have a few questions I want to ask
Conrad Miller. Since he's not available,

207
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,503
I figured I'd just ask you.

208
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,729
All right.

209
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,798
Now look, Miss Wilder,

210
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,551
just a little more information
and I'll be on my way.

211
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:34,669
What would you like to know?

212
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,435
Well, I see that you have
your house up for sale,

213
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:42,118
and also a boat down at the marina
you're trying to sell.

214
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,811
So you figured that out in three hours.

215
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:48,603
Yes, my parents left everything to me,
including the boat.

216
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:51,116
Just figured I could use the money.

217
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,255
If my cop instincts serve me right,

218
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,084
I say that your boyfriend put you up
to sell everything.

219
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:09,195
- So you and him could run together.
- Seriously?

220
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,298
He's not my boyfriend,
and I'm not running anywhere.

221
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,945
He is your friend, right?
And he is a boy?

222
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,571
Well, actually,
I'm in the market for buying a boat.

223
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,950
Maybe I could come down to the marina
and take a look at yours?

224
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,226
I'm showing a potential buyer at 08:00.

225
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:27,855
There won't be any stowaway Marines
on there, now will there?

226
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:31,775
Look, Detective, Laura's my best friend,

227
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,811
and a seriously honest person.

228
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,431
If she was hiding something,
I would know about it,

229
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:37,783
and she's not, okay?

230
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:41,011
We're just trying to enjoy ourselves,
catch some rays.

231
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,562
Paint our toenails... girl stuff.

232
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,766
And you're just kind of keeping us
from doing that.

233
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,845
Your toenails do look nice,
if I can say so myself.

234
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:53,464
I'll see you at 8 o'clock
in the morning, Miss Wilder.

235
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:54,983
All right.

236
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,646
What an asshole!

237
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,107
- All right, guys, you gotta go.
- What?

238
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:07,394
I'm sorry, I just...
you know, I have a headache.

239
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,784
- It's just too much for one day.
- You sure?

240
00:23:09,884 --> 00:23:11,516
- Yeah.
- Feel better.

241
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:53,354
She's running.

242
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,432
Did you take out the trash?

243
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:13,128
We so shouldn't let it go that...

244
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:16,004
I just finished the dishes, so...

245
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:18,150
Oh, awesome. Sweet.

246
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,407
Yeah, anyways, I'm pretty worried
about Laura, aren't you?

247
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:24,931
Yeah, I am, too.
What do you think is gonna happen?

248
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:27,926
I don't know. I'm just worried
for her safety, you know?

249
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,096
Yeah, me, too, he better come back.

250
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,941
I mean, you think
he's gonna come back, right?

251
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:37,262
I'm not sure. He better.

252
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:42,834
Becca?

253
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,904
Becca?

254
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,613
Whatever.

255
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,702
God, I'm gonna text her
and see if she's all right.

256
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,161
What do you want?

257
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:09,463
Tell me everything you know
about Conrad Miller right now.

258
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:50,333
Jesus... the fuck?

259
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,129
I didn't even think that worked.

260
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,587
We're full, cowboy.

261
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,076
I'm the only car out there.

262
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,843
I know, but...

263
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,460
For real, we ain't open for business.

264
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:21,198
But the light's on, you're here, I'm here,
that's gotta mean you're open.

265
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,594
Shit, I forgot to turn
the no vacancy light on.

266
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,123
Look, I just need a bed to chill,
I'll be out by sunrise.

267
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,151
Wrong motel. We're closed.

268
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:36,906
Well, I feel like it's my lucky day,
there's a vacancy sign right there.

269
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:41,360
Well, Mr. Lucky, it ain't your day.
Please, come on.

270
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,209
Okay.

271
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:45,998
Hey...

272
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,468
there's a little town ten miles up,
you should try there.

273
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,653
Wish I could help you.

274
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,659
Sorry. I... I don't make the rules,
I just follow them.

275
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,311
So you say a place up the road
ten miles, right? What's the name?

276
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:08,000
Look, we don't get much drifters
around here. They know better. Go.

277
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:12,233
Okay. Have a nice night.

278
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,776
What the fuck?

279
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:55,456
Hey, act cool.

280
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:02,692
Hale, is that you?
Turn off the fucking light.

281
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:07,029
Hey, man, thought that was you. New car?

282
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,090
Yeah, no, it's one of Amanda's friends.

283
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,490
You know, we're borrowing it
for a couple days.

284
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,678
This thing's a fucking mess, though,
we're just cleaning it out, you know?

285
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:17,624
It's nice.

286
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,234
So, how you been?

287
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:21,968
- I've been good.
- Yeah?

288
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:24,213
Time off, new baby and all.

289
00:29:24,313 --> 00:29:26,190
Yeah, that's right,
Ray said you had a kid.

290
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,226
What are you gonna do?
Back to the grind, right?

291
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:29,652
Yup.

292
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:33,314
- Business good?
- No, business is shitty.

293
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,267
You know, it's not exactly
a tourist destination.

294
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:39,537
You know, for most people,
it's kind of last resort.

295
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:43,434
It'll pick up, keep your head up.

296
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,410
Hey, Mandy. You okay?

297
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,906
Hey, don't fucking look at me, man.

298
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:54,592
You know, bitches get in fights
just like the rest of us.

299
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,872
Okay, you two behave.

300
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:02,398
- I'll see you later, Tony.
- Yeah, see you later.

301
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:11,943
Why don't you put on
some fucking make-up, okay?

302
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,338
You think I like looking
at that fucking shit?

303
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,352
I'm sorry.

304
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,304
Tell Ray to get down here, all right?

305
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:24,287
Shit's about to get messy.

306
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,088
Love birds.

307
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,808
- Adams.
- Detective, good morning. Where are you?

308
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:03,731
Down at the marina,
checking out some beachfront property.

309
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,442
- No action?
- No, not yet. Look...

310
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,203
What exactly am I looking for here?
I mean, gimme something.

311
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:14,532
Colonel Miller, a U.S. officer
stationed in my country...

312
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:20,912
we came to believe he came back here
with an asset very crucial to our security.

313
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:23,819
We need to speak
to him about this asset.

314
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,530
- And the girl?
- Collateral.

315
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,024
I don't get it. Why isn't the U.S.
government on top of this thing?

316
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,710
Oh, that is classified.

317
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,654
Classified... well,
can you declassify it for me?

318
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:39,633
That is way above
your pay grade, Detective.

319
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:42,539
They don't pay me enough
for anything around here.

320
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,696
How will I know
when we're getting close?

321
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,485
When the shit hits the fan.

322
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:54,258
People don't believe shit stink
until they step in it.

323
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,069
- This better be good, Mandy.
- Come see for yourself.

324
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,001
What the fuck?

325
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,865
What's his story?

326
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:41,720
Drifter Marine,
we doped him up real good.

327
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,380
Anybody see him?

328
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,426
- No, but Officer Hale came...
- What are you doin'? Move!

329
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,673
- Come on, come on. Outside.
- Jesus, Ray!

330
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,502
Okay, what? Talk to me.

331
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:02,207
Officer Hale came by,
better go in, saw that guy's car.

332
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,473
Officer Hale is a fucking Boy Scout.

333
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:07,353
Let's just hope to hell he hasn't run
those plates yet, because if he did,

334
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:11,598
we're gonna have a lot more shit to worry
about than those chinks and some dope.

335
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:15,840
- When's the pick-up?
- Tony says two days.

336
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,176
That means we gotta get him
out of here before, right?

337
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,407
You put me in quite
a predicament here, Tony.

338
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:30,469
- Yeah, what the fuck can you do?
- Maybe be a little more careful?

339
00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:32,467
Give me a smoke.

340
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,721
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

341
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,718
- Look...
- Lighter.

342
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:41,263
I guess shit happens.

343
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,851
So, tell me,

344
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:47,136
when are we gonna get the money for the guns
and do this whole Asian exchange.

345
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:49,424
Tuesday at the latest.

346
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:52,874
I tell you, them nips are gonna
bring a pretty good price.

347
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:55,510
- You want to try one of them out?
- No, I'm good, Tony.

348
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,505
Roll all in the hay as soon as I get done
taking care of this fucking thing.

349
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:01,541
Hey! Why don't you go
find something the fuck to do!

350
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,436
Come on, Tony, take it easy,
will you? Come on.

351
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,492
- She's sensitive like her mom, okay?
- Her mom was a fucking whore.

352
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:11,927
This is true. I never really did like
that fucker anyways.

353
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,401
Fuck her, though.

354
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:17,348
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

355
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,295
Family first, right?

356
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:25,849
And don't you forget it, okay?
Come here.

357
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,466
Do me a favour.

358
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,757
Get rid of this guy.
Let me know when you do it,

359
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,664
and I'll make sure everything's clear
on my end, okay?

360
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:36,160
Fuckin' A, I'll take care of it
before lunch.

361
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,863
Okay.

362
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:43,610
I'm gonna enjoy it, too.

363
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:56,010
Wake up, cowboy!

364
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,300
Hey.

365
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,195
GI Joe's up!

366
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:11,782
Devil's work is never done.

367
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,500
I went through your shit last night.

368
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,487
You have a lot of military
shit up in here.

369
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,540
What, are you like an MP or something?

370
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,160
A real bad ass?

371
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,747
I don't give two shits
who the fuck you are,

372
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,735
'cause I'm still gonna chop you up

373
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:44,361
and feed you to the animals
in the back woods.

374
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,518
You know what really gets me?
Really fucking gets me... is...

375
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,021
in all that shit...

376
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,346
there was this.

377
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,342
A lipstick canister, and I'm like,
why would he have a lipstick canister?

378
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:02,245
Oh, maybe he's a homo.

379
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:07,217
You know what? I'm gonna paint your lips,
because you're a fucking homo.

380
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:12,748
Except it ain't fucking lipstick,
it's this. What the fuck is this?

381
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,938
God, jeez...

382
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,268
Oh, no, try the knots, man.
Yeah, I'm an excellent knots tier.

383
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,062
I was a Boy Scout.

384
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:31,014
In fact, I got my knot-tying
badge right here.

385
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,085
Oh, you a tough motherfucker, ain't you?

386
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,911
Wrong time, wrong place.

387
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:49,284
Ain't your lucky day, shit happens!

388
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:53,918
I mean, what... so you got $300,

389
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,692
no phone, no ID,

390
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:00,470
and in your trunk, no suitcase,
just a bunch of clothes.

391
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,398
And you still haven't fucking told me
how you got Junior's car!

392
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,925
Goddamn it!

393
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,733
Answer him!

394
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:20,498
Look, it ain't hard to tell
that you're a fucking Marine, okay?

395
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,853
But what gets me fucking rock hard,
is this right here.

396
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:29,366
Why the fuck do you have
a Banco de "Mal-dives" card?

397
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:33,390
- "Maldeeves".
- What the fuck is a Maldives?

398
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,431
You know what?

399
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:41,145
Fuck you, whoever the fuck you are,
you are fucking dead!

400
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:45,031
- You got the wrong guy.
- Yeah.

401
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,634
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck this is.

402
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:51,765
You fuck with that, you inbred
piece of shit, they'll fucking find you.

403
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:06,088
Go and fucking get Junior,
and tell him we found his car.

404
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:09,485
And tell him to bring his fucking chainsaw,
because as much as I love torturing a fool,

405
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:11,032
I got too much shit to do.

406
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:14,269
And put up the fucking
no vacancy sign, okay? Go!

407
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:16,129
Okay.

408
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:20,265
And cover up that fucking eye!
I fucking told you that already!

409
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:23,702
Stupid fucking bitch.

410
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:35,990
Hey, Cap.

411
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,171
Look at you. You look good, honey.

412
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,622
- Thank you.
- Really, really well.

413
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:44,547
Thank you.

414
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:46,337
Is it the hair?

415
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:48,654
Maybe the lifestyle suits you better.

416
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,279
I like to think so.

417
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:55,768
- I thought you quit.
- Well, I did... for a day.

418
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:58,423
Conrad?

419
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,290
Soon.

420
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,776
- What do you need done?
- An exit.

421
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,228
- You got it.
- Here he is.

422
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:07,347
Good morning, sorry I'm late.

423
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,549
Thought you'd be earlier.

424
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:12,584
- Who is this?
- Detective Adams, LAPD.

425
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:15,489
He seems to think I'm hiding
an ex-boyfriend or something on the boat.

426
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:18,800
- Just doing my job.
- You have a warrant, Detective?

427
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,280
No, I don't, but it's like that vampire
rule, if you invite me on, it's legal.

428
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,432
It's up to you, Cap.

429
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,886
Well, make it quick. Me and this
little lady have some catching up to do.

430
00:40:29,986 --> 00:40:32,874
- I'll be just a minute.
- Help yourself.

431
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,826
- You okay?
- I'll be better in 24 hours.

432
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:03,570
Hans!

433
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,760
Hans!

434
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,064
Hi, sorry to bother you, folks.

435
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:13,373
Has either of you seen
a little Rottweiler,

436
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,910
- black fur, ugly little shit.
- Sorry, no.

437
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,046
- Yeah, Adams.
- Hey, I got the results back.

438
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,660
There were no fingerprints
on that picture you gave me.

439
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,455
And there's video showing Conrad
using force on a man at a gas station.

440
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:32,448
- Then he stole the man's car.
- You gotta be kidding me.

441
00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:36,269
It's an '86 White Trans Am,
I'll send you the plates.

442
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,354
It's not adding up.

443
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,604
I've been trying to figure
this one out, too.

444
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,095
You get a location?

445
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:44,160
Yeah, I'll text you what I have.
Be careful.

446
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,229
It's my girlfriend's dog.

447
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,524
Every day, it's the same shit. I put the dog
on the leash, the dog gets off the leash.

448
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:52,704
I have to find the dog, put the dog
back on the leash. I'm sick of this shit.

449
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,480
But the things you do for love, right?

450
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,833
And that ass.

451
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,976
Not the dog's ass, my girlfriend's ass.

452
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:03,471
I'll walk a dog for that ass.

453
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,152
Well, anyway, thanks... thanks a lot.

454
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,095
You said Reyes Creek?

455
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,087
- Thanks.
- What's happening?

456
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:14,365
It seems like your boyfriend
went on a war path,

457
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,234
stole a car,
beat the shit out of some guy.

458
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,063
They ran the plates,
30 miles outside of Reyes Creek.

459
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,881
I'm coming with you.

460
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,831
Maybe you can be a voice of reason.

461
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:28,801
Hope you know what you're doing, kid.

462
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:38,824
Shit.

463
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,811
- This is Laura, leave a message.
- Shit.

464
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:54,113
Turn your phone on, L.

465
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:58,009
Cleaner on your six.
The guy looking for his fucking dog.

466
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,530
There's no turning back now.
Nowhere is safe.

467
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,275
- There he is, there he is.
- Fellas, not now.

468
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,454
Give me the keys, motherfucker!

469
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,473
I told you, not now.

470
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,360
There's no turning back now,
nowhere is safe.

471
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,935
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

472
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,130
Hey, I think Conrad
will be happy to see you.

473
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,231
Who was that on the phone?

474
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,954
Sam, she wanted to have drinks tonight.

475
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:53,674
- You young girls love to party.
- Yeah.

476
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,592
I don't fucking believe this.

477
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,731
Because you're a dumb fuck, that's why.

478
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,011
Oh, I'm gonna love
slicing this bitch up.

479
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:32,091
Karma sucks!

480
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:36,100
My bitches do not leave me.

481
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,886
- That right?
- They're fucking mine!

482
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,698
You don't have to be
a part of this, Amanda.

483
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:46,592
Sorry. Junior, you heard
what Tony said, right?

484
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:49,971
- You don't have to do what Tony says, okay?
- Amanda does what she's told!

485
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:52,299
Go, get the fuck out of here now!

486
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,668
Bad idea, man.

487
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:47,764
Motherfucker!

488
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,745
Where are you going?

489
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:17,673
You just killed my crew.
Put the bag down.

490
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,283
I should have done this
the moment I laid eyes on you.

491
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,768
Yeah, you should have.

492
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,755
Where the fuck is the bank card?

493
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:41,425
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

494
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,013
Last fucking chance.

495
00:46:49,113 --> 00:46:51,906
It's in the office!
It's in the fucking office!

496
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:54,469
Now that wasn't so fucking hard, was it?
Now come on, let's go!

497
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:56,302
Move!

498
00:46:56,998 --> 00:46:59,425
- Oh, God!
- Hey, hey, how's this feel?

499
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,811
No, no! Fucking shoot me!

500
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:04,797
Get the fuck up! Get up! Get up!

501
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:07,648
- Goddamn it!
- Move! Move!

502
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:13,666
Where is it?

503
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,267
- Goddamn it! Fuck!
- Where is it?

504
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:35,178
Thank you.

505
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:37,306
On your knees.

506
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,264
On your fucking knees. Now!

507
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,273
Let him go!

508
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:47,607
Now!

509
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:51,554
- Don't do this for him.
- I'll fucking do it.

510
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:54,703
He fucking beat you.

511
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,042
He hurt you, just leave.

512
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,966
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

513
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,761
It's over, you don't have
to be afraid anymore.

514
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:08,428
What are you waiting for?
Shoot this piece of shit!

515
00:48:08,728 --> 00:48:10,670
You're worth more than this.

516
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,085
What are you talking about?
I give you everything!

517
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:21,015
No... no, no, you don't.

518
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:25,081
You treat me like shit.

519
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:30,353
Goddamn it. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby, okay? But I love you!

520
00:48:34,728 --> 00:48:38,319
I can't... I can't do this
anymore, I can't.

521
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:41,178
- I can't!
- You stupid, fucking cunt!

522
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:43,746
No!

523
00:48:57,326 --> 00:48:59,713
You fucking piece of shit.

524
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,196
Hey, hey, come on, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

525
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,868
- Don't hurt me, please.
- I'm not here to hurt you. Turn around.

526
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,008
Right here, this way.

527
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,694
It's okay.

528
00:49:58,804 --> 00:50:01,399
- Here.
- What for?

529
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,627
For you... take it.

530
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:07,856
It's okay, just get 'em out of here.
Come on.

531
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:11,397
It's okay, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna
hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you.

532
00:50:12,985 --> 00:50:15,130
Come on, turn around.

533
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:19,451
Take it, share it.

534
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:23,713
Thank you. Thank you.

535
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,862
Get out of here.

536
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,089
Fuck.

537
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,804
Drop that fucking knife... now!

538
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:43,325
Put your hands on your head
and drop to your knees.

539
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,218
- Drop to your knees.
- You're making a mistake, Officer.

540
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,923
- Shut your mouth! Hands behind your back.
- You got the wrong man.

541
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:51,858
I said, shut your mouth!

542
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,270
Drop that fucking weapon!
And you let Officer Hale go now!

543
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:00,710
Do not fucking move. I've had a long
fucking day. I do not want to hurt you.

544
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,411
Deputy Chief over here
is a part of all of this.

545
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:07,362
- Shoot him!
- Shut up and listen.

546
00:51:08,324 --> 00:51:11,412
Ray and Tony been selling drugs, guns

547
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:14,266
and these poor girls over here.
Look at them. Look at 'em!

548
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:18,229
See how afraid they are of him?

549
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,175
He's an officer of the law,
now do the fucking math.

550
00:51:22,438 --> 00:51:25,284
It's over, Ray. This place is done.

551
00:51:25,384 --> 00:51:28,861
They're dead. Every one of them,
do you understand me?

552
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:32,140
Now drop your fucking weapon
and let me leave.

553
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,626
- That's never gonna happen.
- I'm leaving now, Ray.

554
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:38,257
So remember why you became
a fucking cop.

555
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,359
These girls are scared and afraid,
they need your fucking help,

556
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:42,568
so pretend like you fucking care!

557
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:47,592
All eyes are on you, Ray.

558
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,426
Lose the radio.

559
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,117
Left hands, both of you, cuff 'em.

560
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,954
You, too, Ray.

561
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:16,239
Over here.

562
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,347
Stay there, Ray.

563
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,615
Take hold of the car right now.

564
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:29,603
Both hands. On the floor.

565
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,141
Over here.

566
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:36,446
Over here!

567
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:39,700
- Okay?
- Do it.

568
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,137
Oh, we're gonna get you, boy.

569
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,307
No, you won't.

570
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:57,164
I hope you're a good cop,
because he's a fucking disgrace.

571
00:52:57,442 --> 00:52:59,373
Make him pay.

572
00:53:01,354 --> 00:53:06,034
It's not like that.
Listen to me, it's not like that.

573
00:53:26,895 --> 00:53:31,216
It's crazy how you get 20 miles outside
of LA and this whole town is like a desert.

574
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:37,273
- Oh, nice car.
- That's him.

575
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:40,454
- What you talking about?
- Step on the fucking gas!

576
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,708
- Now.
- Calm down, I'm doing 90.

577
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:47,083
What the fuck is wrong with you, woman?

578
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,688
Chase the fucking Audi now.

579
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,746
- Are you out your fucking mind?
- Do it, or I'll put a bullet in you.

580
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,114
You're looking at ten years,
pointing a gun at a cop, girl.

581
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:05,610
- Detective Adams, move.
- You know how to use that thing?

582
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,477
Want to test me?

583
00:54:08,577 --> 00:54:11,200
You got a lot of explaining to do there.

584
00:54:23,444 --> 00:54:26,842
Reyes Creek, ten minutes.

585
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,847
Copy that.

586
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:37,377
You're on his tail now.
There, you happy?

587
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,633
I don't have time for this shit.

588
00:54:57,645 --> 00:54:59,690
What's he doing?

589
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:13,679
- Tell me what the fuck is going on!
- Move.

590
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:16,355
Move!

591
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:18,265
Put it in fucking drive!

592
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:23,020
- Shit!
- He got a gun!

593
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,715
Shit!

594
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,444
Get him! Come on!

595
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:34,907
Call for back-up. Go!

596
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:36,810
Never mind.

597
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,666
Detective Adams, I need back-up.

598
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:43,590
- Sorry, I need your car.
- You can have the car.

599
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,701
- Let's go. Move it!
- Please don't hurt me.

600
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,786
Shots fired!

601
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:49,823
Wiley!

602
00:55:50,135 --> 00:55:51,892
Fuck!

603
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:08,199
Pick-up order ready, hot plate.

604
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,862
Take a seat,
I'll be right with you, hon.

605
00:56:20,494 --> 00:56:22,412
Hey, brother.

606
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:26,392
- You look like shit, Miller.
- Thanks, man, I feel like it, too.

607
00:56:26,892 --> 00:56:29,259
I was about to leave, you know?

608
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,090
I'm glad you didn't.

609
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,235
- What the fuck happened?
- You would not fucking believe it.

610
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:40,916
You look like this,
trying to keep a low profile?

611
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:44,657
Something like that, man.

612
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:48,764
I heard you got the heat on your six.

613
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:51,516
- Them reds don't play nice.
- Where did you hear?

614
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,053
Last night, you don't have
a whole lot of time.

615
00:56:54,753 --> 00:56:57,848
- Yeah, I know.
- You're a crazy motherfucker, aren't you?

616
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:03,413
You would fucking know. Smoke?

617
00:57:11,879 --> 00:57:16,006
Only chance I'm gonna have to get
out of this thing. Start new, you know?

618
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:22,931
- I gotta look after my family.
- Family? You're kidding me, right?

619
00:57:23,031 --> 00:57:24,792
She's having a baby, my friend.

620
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:27,914
Then we have to have a shot,
for old time's sake.

621
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,908
Sounds like a good idea.

622
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:33,312
Babe.

623
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:37,263
But just one, you bastard. I know you.
I gotta be on a plane by sunset, okay?

624
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:39,398
All right, copy that.

625
00:57:39,898 --> 00:57:41,417
Here we go.

626
00:57:41,517 --> 00:57:44,102
You okay? You look like
you've had a rough day.

627
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:46,196
- Just a little.
- Can I get you anything?

628
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,049
Do you have anything stronger
than milkshake in the back?

629
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:50,576
My friend over here needs a drink.

630
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:53,954
Yeah, sure. I got a bottle
of tequila in the back room.

631
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,340
- I won't tell, if you don't.
- Not a peep from me.

632
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,685
- Are you new here?
- Yeah, I just started a few days back.

633
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,196
And I thought I knew
all the hot asses around here.

634
00:58:02,296 --> 00:58:05,705
- Me, too.
- I'll be right back.

635
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,515
You never fucking change, do you?
It'll kill you one day.

636
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,684
What don't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

637
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,329
- That's what I heard.
- You called my boy?

638
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,114
Yeah.

639
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:24,784
- He's holding the wire for me.
- He'll do you right. No worries.

640
00:58:24,884 --> 00:58:26,851
You okay?

641
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,223
Yeah.

642
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,953
Hey, guess to us,

643
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:38,290
no matter how far we run, we can never
get away from what we've done.

644
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,439
I know what I've done.

645
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:45,731
I just want a piece of normal, you know?

646
00:58:45,831 --> 00:58:48,258
There is no normal for us.

647
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,477
Well, we're gonna give it a shot.

648
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,556
You're here, you're in one piece,
you lucky son of a bitch.

649
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:57,820
They don't know about her, do they?

650
00:59:00,112 --> 00:59:01,380
No.

651
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,488
Here we are, fellas.

652
00:59:05,143 --> 00:59:07,703
- Oh, damn it, I'm sorry!
- It's okay. It's okay. I got it.

653
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:09,840
- I'll get you another shot.
- Great, thanks.

654
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:14,944
She's new?

655
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,293
- Here's to new beginnings.
- Let's hope so.

656
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:33,637
- Fuck.
- You are pretty banged up, aren't you?

657
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,386
Yeah.

658
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:39,122
- You should see the other guys.
- I bet.

659
00:59:41,586 --> 00:59:43,644
You got the bank card?

660
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:46,192
Right here.

661
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:01,358
- Thanks, man, I just...
- No, don't even say it.

662
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:04,911
But what you did for us back then,

663
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:10,305
not even in two fucking lifetimes
can we even repay you.

664
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,156
Now... get going and take care
of your old lady.

665
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:21,682
That's what it's all about, right?

666
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:24,315
Yeah, it is.

667
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,834
Take care, man.

668
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,604
Later.

669
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:34,039
What the fuck? Hey, I need some help!

670
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:37,731
Turn around! Slowly.

671
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:44,758
Target acquired. Drop the weapon.

672
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:47,954
Set it on the table... now.

673
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,807
The drink...

674
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,693
You're good. Didn't see you coming.

675
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,020
Most men don't.

676
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,402
- How'd you find me?
- Where's the asset?

677
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:10,116
Not here.

678
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:13,353
I saw him give you the envelope.
Hand it over now.

679
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,557
- There's no intel. You're gonna get hurt.
- Doubt it.

680
01:01:16,957 --> 01:01:19,868
Do you even know why you're here?
Why you're tracking me?

681
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:23,446
Not my job to know, Mr. Miller.
My job is this...

682
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,818
Hold and detain.
Don't even think about it.

683
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:31,088
One more move, and I will put one
in your leg and let you bleed out.

684
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:34,275
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

685
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,397
See, I'm guessing you're here, Myron.

686
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,652
Long time.

687
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:50,741
Yeah.

688
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,774
You're a hard man to follow.

689
01:01:54,074 --> 01:01:56,855
You left quite a mess
at that hotel, didn't you?

690
01:01:56,955 --> 01:01:59,149
Yeah. He had it coming.

691
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,028
I ran into your lovely lady on the way
up here. She was with a detective.

692
01:02:03,128 --> 01:02:06,657
- You tell me you didn't fucking hurt her.
- Of course not.

693
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,555
She is having a little
car trouble, though.

694
01:02:10,903 --> 01:02:13,144
I'm not a monster...

695
01:02:14,156 --> 01:02:15,365
I'm a soldier.

696
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,761
You used to be one, until you went AWOL.

697
01:02:20,061 --> 01:02:23,473
- If that's what you want to call it.
- That's what it is.

698
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:25,434
Why?

699
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,563
Because the government
tells you so? Is that it?

700
01:02:29,863 --> 01:02:32,057
Because they always tell you
the fucking truth?

701
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:36,779
America, baby. After that Snowden shit,
they're not fucking around.

702
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:41,709
- You sure it's just the U.S. on this one?
- Yeah, the Commies sold you out, too.

703
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:47,348
- Asset?
- He says he doesn't have it.

704
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,890
Let's do this the easy way, yeah?

705
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,684
We're both men of action.

706
01:02:59,627 --> 01:03:01,504
Lies do not become us, Conrad.

707
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,126
Come on, man, you believe that?

708
01:03:07,926 --> 01:03:10,474
Lies are what we are, Myron.

709
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:19,947
You're selling classified information
to the Russians.

710
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,692
Come on.

711
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:25,772
I'm sure it pays well,
but it's not exactly NATO friendly.

712
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:29,322
Where the fuck did you think
you were gonna go?

713
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:32,827
Last time I checked we weren't
in the business of friendly.

714
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:35,822
You gave me nothing to work with.

715
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,485
Myron...

716
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:40,611
I just want out, man.

717
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,572
That's it.

718
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:49,325
You might want out one day.

719
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:54,659
Myron, asset recovery,
Conrad Miller is detained.

720
01:03:56,975 --> 01:03:58,811
Copy that. It's a kill order.

721
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,429
Move!

722
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:28,699
It's already over, Conrad.

723
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:31,202
There's nowhere to go.

724
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,145
Hold this position.

725
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:53,742
I know you're out here, Conrad.
Can we please get this over with?

726
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,570
This hiding shit is beneath you.

727
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:57,072
You're hit.

728
01:06:57,172 --> 01:06:59,324
I know you're hit.

729
01:06:59,424 --> 01:07:00,989
You're gonna bleed out.

730
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,616
Conrad, come out!

731
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,265
- I lost him. Anything there?
- Nothing back here.

732
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:43,930
He'll probably circle back there.
He has no other place to go.

733
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,949
If you do engage, put him down!

734
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:50,238
- Stay sharp, I'm on my way.
- Copy that.

735
01:07:53,362 --> 01:07:55,031
Shit!

736
01:08:02,137 --> 01:08:04,967
It's over. Let it go.

737
01:08:05,574 --> 01:08:07,698
Walk away.

738
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:51,253
Jesus.

739
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:03,691
I'm out.

740
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,688
Me, too.

741
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,437
Like that?

742
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:21,273
So it would appear.

743
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:06,711
You gave me nothing to work with.

744
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:15,692
You okay?

745
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,029
Bitch, I let you live.

746
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:23,307
Now you're on the list.

747
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:28,399
You never make it personal, you hear me?

748
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:31,271
You like this?
Give me your fucking hand.

749
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,009
Now, listen to me.

750
01:10:38,509 --> 01:10:41,281
I see you or anyone...

751
01:10:41,381 --> 01:10:43,802
from the agency within
100 fucking miles of my family,

752
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:46,267
I will find every one
of you and kill you.

753
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,437
You understand me?

754
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,457
You got that?

755
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:02,075
Motherfucker, that's my gun hand.

756
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,464
Good to see you, baby.

757
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,612
Yeah. Let's go.

758
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:23,422
- You got the door, baby?
- I got it, babe.

759
01:11:52,984 --> 01:11:55,053
Why didn't you kill him?

760
01:11:55,453 --> 01:11:57,505
It's different now.

761
01:11:58,405 --> 01:12:00,727
Inactive doesn't mean
I lost my touch, baby.

762
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,043
Copy that.

763
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:17,454
The customer said he saw Conrad sitting
in a corner booth with some Arab guy,

764
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:20,678
but he passed out, no sign of 'em now.

765
01:12:20,778 --> 01:12:25,525
- One man, one man caused all this.
- Let's try one man and one woman.

766
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:28,626
Guess we had it wrong all along.

767
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,597
It was always both of them.

768
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:06,684
No loose ends.

769
01:13:17,135 --> 01:13:19,113
I'm sorry.

770
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,846
We work for the same people.

771
01:13:38,522 --> 01:13:42,493
- It's above your position, Detective.
- Excuse me?

772
01:13:42,593 --> 01:13:45,263
You should never have been
put into this position.

773
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:48,124
Had I known, I would never have
allowed them to do this to you.

774
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:52,443
Had you known what? All hell would break
loose and dead bodies here over AWOL Marine?

775
01:13:53,771 --> 01:13:55,623
Look, as you should know by now,

776
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:59,276
Conrad Miller is a double agent.

777
01:13:59,376 --> 01:14:04,900
Getting secrets and selling them
to the old Cold War buyers.

778
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:10,814
And the woman, Laura, what's her story?

779
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:14,525
The real Laura Wilder died 15 years ago.

780
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:18,162
KGB agent Yulovsky
took over her identity.

781
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:22,567
She is the asset that Conrad took from
my country that we've been looking for.

782
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:26,904
And I am bringing her back with me
when I go back home.

783
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:31,159
So this is some real KGB shit?
Spy versus spy?

784
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:33,643
You American people feel...

785
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:36,127
better and more comfortable
so that you can sleep,

786
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:39,924
if you think this only happens
in the movies.

787
01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:45,476
- So what's the end game here, Cushko?
- End game?

788
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:47,850
That's classified.

789
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,763
Go home, take a hot shower,
go to bed, go to sleep.

790
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:55,742
- Tomorrow is another day.
- Is that how you Russian boys do it?

791
01:14:55,842 --> 01:14:58,870
Say tomorrow will be a better day
and drink your vodka?

792
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,891
Lots and lots of vodka.

793
01:15:03,782 --> 01:15:07,546
- I can't say it's been a pleasure, man.
- No shit.

794
01:15:10,223 --> 01:15:14,046
- You take care of yourself, Adams.
- You do the same.

795
01:15:18,339 --> 01:15:20,141
Hey, Cushko...

796
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:23,522
Laura... did you know she was pregnant?

797
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:27,687
Let me ask you something,
if it was your family,

798
01:15:27,787 --> 01:15:32,290
and their lives were being threatened,
wouldn't you have done the same thing?

799
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:44,131
How is your neck?

800
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:47,310
- It's a little achy, but...
- Achy? Well...

801
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,206
Copy that.

802
01:15:51,406 --> 01:15:53,516
Hey, you okay?

803
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:55,218
Yeah, I'm good.

804
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:57,474
You need anything?

805
01:16:02,783 --> 01:16:04,977
Let's grab that dinner.

806
01:16:50,247 --> 01:16:52,717
- Mr. Miller.
- Vladimir.

807
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,827
- Good to see you.
- Always.

808
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:59,992
And you must be the lovely Mrs. Miller,
nice to meet you. This is Natasha.

809
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:05,175
- Should we get on with this?
- Yes, you will see all is in order.

810
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:07,234
Hey, baby.

811
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,586
- Business is good?
- Always. You?

812
01:17:11,686 --> 01:17:14,462
- Yeah, ups and downs.
- So I see.

813
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,567
- Baby?
- We're good.

814
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:29,364
Funny, for something so small,
to cause so much trouble?

815
01:17:29,464 --> 01:17:31,392
It's always the way?

816
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:33,791
We'll let you get back to your moment.

817
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:36,546
- Be good.
- Yeah, stay out of trouble.

818
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,437
- We did it.
- We did it.

819
01:18:02,069 --> 01:18:06,042
- New beginnings.
- New beginnings.

820
01:18:12,763 --> 01:18:14,711
It's Myron, asset recovery.

821
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,526
Target acquired.
