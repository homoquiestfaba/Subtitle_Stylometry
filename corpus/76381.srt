U.S. Government
Accelerator Project, Texas"

3
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:59,197
Sorry, pal.

4
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:08,699
The exact time is 16:44...

5
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,800
and as you can plainly see...

6
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:15,246
the subject of retroactive experiment
number 12 is plainly deceased.

7
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:20,514
Since my first 11 attempts at
this experiment proved unsuccessful...

8
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,987
this will be
my last opportunity...

9
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,718
being as the idiots
at the Pentagon...

10
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,124
will be shutting this place down
completely come Monday morning.

11
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:31,425
This tape will provide proof
that I have been able...

12
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,728
to briefly
reverse the flow of time.

13
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,530
Whatever subject
passes through this machine...

14
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:38,901
will have total recollection
of all that has happened.

15
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:41,941
I, however, will have no memory
of these events.

16
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,537
The exact time is 16:44...

17
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,638
and as you can plainly see...

18
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:33,084
the subject of retroactive experiment
number 12 is plainly deceased.

19
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:38,352
Since my first 11 attempts at
this experiment proved unsuccessful...

20
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,892
this will be
my last opportunity...

21
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,690
being as the idiots
at the Pentagon...

22
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:48,598
will be shutting this place down
completely come Monday morning.

23
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,707
Now, this tape
will provide proof...

24
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:01,008
not only to my detractors
but also to myself.

25
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,412
- I did it.
- Because if I am right...

26
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,611
and I can briefly
reverse the flow of time...

27
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:11,323
I will have no memory
of these events.

28
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,325
I did it.

29
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,999
I did it!

30
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:25,971
Oh, my God.

31
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,682
Hey, man!
How're you doing, brother?

32
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:02,465
Look at them, man.
They like to pay for these, don't they?

33
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:05,863
- Nobody followed you here?
- I'll be back.

34
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,533
Whoa. My money, Frank.
Where's my money?

35
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:13,944
How the hell am I supposed to give you
money when I gotta go get it?

36
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,914
I've got no money on me.
That's why we're in this business.

37
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:20,146
- Have I ever screwed you over?
- Yeah, you have.

38
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,280
That was high school.
I was drunk. Leave me alone.

39
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:26,552
I need my money.

40
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:31,029
I'm gonna make you as rich as shit
four foot up a bull's ass.

41
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,497
Come on, man!
What are you doing to me?

42
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:35,500
Put the goddamn gun away.

43
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,399
- I need my money.
- I know!

44
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,995
- Thirty minutes.
- Thirty minutes and I'll be right back.

45
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:43,338
Take that thing away from me.
You're gonna hurt somebody with that.

46
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:46,576
Thirty minutes!

47
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,274
You have yourself
a little cup of coffee.

48
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:53,513
By the time you're done with it,
I'll be back with the cash.

49
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,548
The city of Chicago today
is in mourning...

50
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,321
in the wake of this weekend's
tragic hostage situation...

51
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:03,885
at the Federal Building.

52
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,692
Lead negotiator Karen Warren...

53
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,098
has officially resigned from her
position with the police department.

54
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:55,006
Stop! Hey!

55
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,603
Thanks a bunch, pal!

56
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,477
Not good.

57
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:15,350
What was that, honey?

58
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,622
My car. Looks like
I may need a little help.

59
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,803
What the hell
happened to that sign?

60
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,778
That's Rayanne. Don't mind her.
She's just shy.

61
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:39,945
Yeah. Looks like
you got a problem...

62
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,647
in this general area
right here.

63
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:45,657
Any particular type of problem,
you think?

64
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,817
I don't know.

65
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,089
I can take you up the road
a click to a buddy of mine.

66
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,097
He's got a tow truck
all his own.

67
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,866
Hell, come on.

68
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,167
Frank's the name.
Throw yourself in the rear.

69
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,671
I'll fix ya up.

70
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,403
- Isn't that right, Rayanne?
- Whatever you want.

71
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:08,004
Hi, I'm Karen. How far
do you suppose it is?

72
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,811
Oh, I don't know.
Let me think now.

73
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,250
I'd say five, ten miles.

74
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,380
Hell, who knows?
This is Texas, right?

75
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,726
- You from around these parts?
- Yeah, I used to be.

76
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:33,761
- Down by Galveston way.
- Is that right?

77
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,899
You sure do talk
like a city girl.

78
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:40,378
Polish these for me.

79
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,609
The funniest thing
happened to me today.

80
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:47,710
I was in the break room
getting a cup of coffee...

81
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,914
and there was this woman...
Kim.

82
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,321
She's some kind of secretary
or something.

83
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,655
And she says...
She goes like this.

84
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:58,925
She says, "Frank,
that's a good-looking belt buckle."

85
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:02,263
And I don't know.
This just popped into my head.

86
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,269
Don't ask me how.

87
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:07,101
I just said to her...
Guess what I said.

88
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,175
Guess what I say to her.

89
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,673
Somebody please just
guess what I said.

90
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,475
I don't know.
What'd you say?

91
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:20,645
I say, "lt'll look a lot
better pressed against your forehead."

92
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,649
That just popped into my head!

93
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:39,335
What's wrong? You don't wanna experience
my razor-sharp wit back there?

94
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:43,273
I guess I've just been away too long.
Missed that old Texas humor.

95
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:46,641
I know what'll cheer you up.
You like country music?

96
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,408
- No, not really.
- What?

97
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:52,280
I suppose it's one of the reasons
I left Texas in the first place.

98
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:55,684
It's made in America for Americans.
You're not un-American, are ya?

99
00:13:55,755 --> 00:14:00,419
No, you might say dealing with
Americans is what I'm trained to do.

100
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,485
Don't tell me you're a cop.
Don't tell me that.

101
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,792
Close. Psychologist.

102
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:09,926
Shrink, huh? All right.

103
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:12,732
I got an assignment for you.

104
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,170
What's the name
of that book of yours?

105
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,074
If you really want
to know it...

106
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:25,049
It provides a framework
to work out...

107
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:27,813
what you might do if you
could go back and change your life.

108
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:33,023
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit
to me, if you don't mind me saying.

109
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:35,026
It's just
therapeutic role-playing.

110
00:14:35,094 --> 00:14:37,619
Like me play Tarzan,
you Jane?

111
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:43,025
Shit! Where the hell
you suppose he popped up from?

112
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:44,592
Goddamn it!

113
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:53,745
Bullshit!

114
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,415
I already got three goddamn tickets.
My insurance is gonna go sky-high.

115
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:09,457
Whoa! Stay right where you are.

116
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:11,587
I didn't ask you
to get out of the car.

117
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:14,428
Officer,
just stretching my legs.

118
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,967
No crime in that.

119
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,629
I wanna see your license
and registration.

120
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:23,402
Yes, sir, but you gotta tell me
one thing first.

121
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:26,404
What in the hell
did I do wrong?

122
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,380
You were doing 78 miles an hour
in a 55-mile zone...

123
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,746
is what the hell
you were doing wrong.

124
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:34,752
Come on. Really?

125
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,414
I can assure you, Officer...

126
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:41,051
that that would be
highly unusual for me.

127
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,061
Because I am like this
with the law.

128
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,791
Just give me your license
and registration.

129
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:47,799
Yes, sir.

130
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:51,468
Goddamn bitch
shrank my jeans.

131
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:55,006
Here you go, sir.

132
00:15:56,475 --> 00:16:01,003
You wanna tell me who you got
travelling with you, Mr. Lloyd?

133
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,139
Them?

134
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,183
Them two's my women.

135
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,116
Bigamy is against the law.

136
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:09,313
Well...

137
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:11,583
that's why I ain't married.

138
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,124
Keeping it legal.

139
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:16,458
Why don't you
get back in your car?

140
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,193
Yes, sir.

141
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,201
Not a problem there. I'll just
sit there behind the wheel.

142
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,240
It looks like there's gonna be
a slight delay...

143
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,076
while the good officer
clears matters up.

144
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:00,699
Maybe I should ask
for a ride from the trooper.

145
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,173
- Get outta your hair.
- No, I wouldn't hear of it.

146
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:07,372
You just hold on.
Hell.

147
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,846
We only got
about a mile to go.

148
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:23,427
Well, except for six
previous speeding violations...

149
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:26,465
seems you are
a law-abiding citizen.

150
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,727
I told ya.

151
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,668
I'm just gonna
write you up for 70.

152
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,671
Sign by that "X."

153
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:44,773
Try and slow down.

154
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:49,577
'Cause I'll be watching you.

155
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,524
Thank you very much, sir.

156
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,730
Asshole!

157
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,059
- Honey...
- Shut up!

158
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,092
Goddamned bullshit!

159
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:13,368
You just keep your eyes
on this, asshole.

160
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,827
Look out!

161
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:44,273
Christ, I could've knocked that
son of a bitch back to Chihuahua.

162
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,309
So, baby...

163
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,814
What the hell are you
so tense about?

164
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,908
Come on. Lighten up.

165
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,252
Say something.

166
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:59,655
Our guest is gonna think you're
a damn mute if you don't say something.

167
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:03,855
Go on.

168
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:09,324
I just wish that you would
control your temper is all.

169
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:12,632
- That's bullshit!
- You wanted me to say something.

170
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:15,037
And the first thing that comes
out of your mouth...

171
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:18,406
is some kind of criticism of me,
is that it?

172
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:21,412
- No...
- Shut up, woman.

173
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,414
Goddamn women.

174
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,378
Can't live with 'em,
can't blow their heads off. Shit.

175
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,087
Well, this must be it.

176
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,324
Nope, not yet. I'm just stopping here
for a well-deserved beverage.

177
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:56,045
Damn! I'm as thirsty
as a chipmunk hung out to dry.

178
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:01,313
Hey. You girls wanna dabble
in a little beverage?

179
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,014
Not for me.

180
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,215
Can't say I didn't try.

181
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,393
Don't want you yapping
behind my back now.

182
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,593
Damn, it's good
to be in America!

183
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:19,771
Wake up, Sam.
The man is here.

184
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:23,206
- How'd it go?
- Goddamn went great.

185
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,446
He's always gotta come here
and get his beer.

186
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:31,506
You like that Australian beer?
He's always gotta get that.

187
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,517
Says it reminds him of his dad.

188
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:37,646
He took off for Australia
and left him when he was ten.

189
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:40,021
You know you don't
have to stay with him.

190
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:43,721
Sometimes I just wanna take a knife
and cut out his heart.

191
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:47,061
Honey, you don't wanna
do something like that.

192
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:49,430
I'm gonna give you the number
of a woman's shelter.

193
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,868
Call 'em any time.
They can help.

194
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:56,039
Yep.

195
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,907
Look what I got here.
This is the mother lode.

196
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,907
- What the hell...
- I don't know what these do...

197
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,449
but they sure pay for them.

198
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:08,315
I can't program my VCR.

199
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,480
You may wanna use
that phone over there.

200
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:16,624
Here.

201
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,629
Take care of yourself.

202
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,997
Don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine.

203
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,138
- There you go.
- Gimme that!

204
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:29,640
That's more cash
than I've ever seen.

205
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:32,075
Thanks for the ride.

206
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:38,979
Freeze!

207
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:45,512
Do either of you know where we could
find a place to camp around here?

208
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:49,357
- I'm sorry. I'm not from around here.
- Down the road about ten miles.

209
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,794
Ten miles? Great.
Thanks a lot.

210
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,668
I'm going to Mexico
with my Rayanne.

211
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,603
I hope it works out.
You watch the water down there.

212
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:02,697
I know that water's
supposed to be rough.

213
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,302
- Hey, Frank.
- Give you the shits, they say.

214
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:09,347
Frank, come here. Remember that guy
I told ya about?

215
00:22:09,414 --> 00:22:11,348
He gave me these.

216
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,853
Bullshit.

217
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:52,681
It's bullshit, Sam.

218
00:22:52,758 --> 00:22:57,559
- You show these to anybody else?
- No, Frank. That's your girl.

219
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:59,597
Bullshit!
You show these to somebody else?

220
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:01,599
- No, I didn't!
- That's bullshit!

221
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:07,338
Think I must've
dropped my wallet.

222
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,931
- Fuck you.
- You show anyone else those pictures?

223
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,339
Goddamn it!

224
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:18,940
Don't worry about it, asshole!

225
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:30,792
What the hell...

226
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:34,498
What are you doing?

227
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:37,763
Rayanne, pour me a beer
would you?

228
00:23:37,836 --> 00:23:40,361
Would you stop, please?
I was getting out there.

229
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:47,403
There's a tow truck back there.
Maybe you didn't realize...

230
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:54,042
Will somebody please tell me
why is it...

231
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,579
that women can change their minds
whenever the mood strikes them?

232
00:23:58,657 --> 00:24:01,683
We all have moments
where we rethink choices.

233
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,786
- It's natural.
- Natural.

234
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:06,797
Natural pain in the ass.

235
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:12,236
You want a beer?

236
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,801
- You sure you don't want a beer?
- Yes.

237
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:22,278
- You do want a beer.
- No.

238
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:24,144
That's what I mean!

239
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:27,617
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

240
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:31,144
Do you or do you not
want a goddamned beer?

241
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:34,351
No, I don't want
one of your goddamned beers!

242
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,860
Why don't you shut the hell up
and leave me alone?

243
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,696
Drink it.

244
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:54,703
I'll leave you alone.

245
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:01,812
Where are we going?

246
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:07,155
You see, Karen, my wife Rayanne here,
she seems to think...

247
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:11,321
that I'm one of those bad to the bone,
unrepentant assholes.

248
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,956
I think she brings it out in me.
What do you think?

249
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:16,660
It seems to me that you two
can work it out.

250
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:20,034
Is that what you think?
I think it's a little too late for that.

251
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:24,474
It's way too late.

252
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:30,012
I know now that
it'll never work out.

253
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,388
'Cause, you see...

254
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:40,357
I've had a sudden,
unforeseen realization...

255
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:43,690
that has left me saddened...

256
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:46,026
and terribly hurt.

257
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:48,362
What are you talking about?

258
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:52,836
It occurred to me back there that
I had seen that pickup truck before.

259
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,777
Maybe, Rayanne...

260
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:03,337
you might have
an understanding going on.

261
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,852
Come on!

262
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,853
This is Frank.

263
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:11,855
You can tell me the truth.

264
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:14,357
Tell me.

265
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:19,388
Lie! You're always
lying to me!

266
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,589
Sam...

267
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:26,296
was thoughtful enough to show me
some photographs of you.

268
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:31,035
I was shocked. I've never
seen you like that before.

269
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:33,270
I don't know what you mean.

270
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:36,803
Talking about the fucking beaner
you've been fucking!

271
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:39,951
That's what I'm talking about!

272
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:43,243
- He's gonna kill me!
- Look at me.

273
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,720
She's right.

274
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,816
I am gonna kill her.
Shit's what it is.

275
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,259
Talk to me.

276
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:52,819
Turn around
and talk about this.

277
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,164
We can work this out.
Come on.

278
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:00,329
You're a big guy.
You don't need a gun.

279
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,832
Put the gun down.

280
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,184
Open the door! Shit.

281
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,394
Here we go.

282
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:24,381
Shit!

283
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:37,361
Oh, my God!
Thank God!

284
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:43,667
- The door. Is it locked?
- It locks automatically.

285
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:46,898
You sure?
Is it bulletproof?

286
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:51,474
- I suppose so.
- We have to call the police.

287
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,909
This man, he just
shot his wife.

288
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,913
Relax. Nobody can
get through that door.

289
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:59,781
You don't understand.
The man is a killer and he's after me.

290
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:02,581
Relax. You're hurt. Let me
get something to clean that cut.

291
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:05,555
No, listen to me.
What is your name?

292
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:06,784
Brian.

293
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,917
Okay, Brian,
do you understand me?

294
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:11,827
You have to call the police now,
you got me?

295
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,783
I have a woman here
who's apparently been injured.

296
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,852
Hold on. Shit!

297
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:51,902
Undo.

298
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:03,307
Damn!

299
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,420
Oh, my God.

300
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,730
And there was this woman.

301
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,702
She's some kind of secretary
or something.

302
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,170
She sees my belt buckle,
and she says...

303
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:31,538
She goes like this.
She says, "Frank...

304
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,169
That's a good-looking belt buckle."

305
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:37,510
And I don't know.
This just popped into my head.

306
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,846
Don't ask me how.
I just said to her.

307
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,447
Guess what I say.

308
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,886
Somebody guess
what I said to her.

309
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:47,117
I don't know.
What'd you say?

310
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:53,028
I said, "lt'd look even better with
your forehead pressed against it."

311
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,893
That just popped into my head!

312
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:03,639
What's wrong? You don't wanna experience
my razor-sharp wit back there?

313
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:08,910
I'll just listen to some music.

314
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:12,140
- You like...
- I hate country music.

315
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:15,086
How can you hate country music?

316
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:17,087
I just do.

317
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,888
What's the name of that book?

318
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:30,968
- Psychotherapy.
- Is that right?

319
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:33,503
It provides a framework to work out
what you might do...

320
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,505
if you could go back
and change your life.

321
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:38,133
- Well...
- I know it sounds like bullshit to you.

322
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:41,042
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

323
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:44,206
It's not.
It's therapeutic role-playing.

324
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:46,307
You like that role-playing thing,
do ya?

325
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,318
Just like Tarzan and Jane.
Right, Frank?

326
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:54,081
You and I are connected.
You are reading my mind.

327
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,323
If you don't mind me saying, you're
driving too fast for your own good.

328
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:00,489
I bet it feels like 55.

329
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:02,123
Feels like it.

330
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,134
But it won't seem like it
to that cop back there.

331
00:33:04,202 --> 00:33:05,863
What cop?

332
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:09,839
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
Goddamn son of a bitch!

333
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:25,521
I already got three goddamn tickets.
My insurance is gonna go sky-high.

334
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:32,522
Whoa! Stay right there, mister.

335
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,724
I did not ask you
to exit your vehicle.

336
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,461
Officer,
just stretching my legs.

337
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:39,799
I wanna see your license
and registration.

338
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:44,868
Yes, sir, but you gotta tell me
one thing first.

339
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:47,138
What in the hell
did I do wrong?

340
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:50,406
Doing 78 miles an hour
in a 55-mile zone...

341
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:53,417
- What are you doing?
- The gun. Where is it?

342
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:56,579
- What are you talking about?
- Frank's gun. Where is it?

343
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:01,124
He never goes anywhere
without that gun.

344
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:06,729
Shit.

345
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:08,732
Them two's my women.

346
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,734
Bigamy is against the law.

347
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:18,606
Officer, could you tell me
where the nearest gas station is?

348
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:21,668
Ma'am, would you please
return to your vehicle?

349
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:22,940
Get in the car.

350
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:25,983
- Ma'am.
- Listen to that officer...

351
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,984
and go back into that car.

352
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:30,680
You see, I had a problem
with my car...

353
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:33,281
He's got a gun, Officer!

354
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,394
Freeze!

355
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:42,490
Officer, I'm with the Chicago Police
Department. This is a wanted man.

356
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:46,970
That's bullshit!
I got a license to carry that gun.

357
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,468
Freeze!

358
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:16,199
Get off me, bitch!
Rayanne, stop!

359
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,717
My baby!

360
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:00,706
God!

361
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:05,441
Shit! You bitch!

362
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:10,945
What the hell you doing here?

363
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:14,856
Who the hell are you?
Look what you did to my wife!

364
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:16,018
Shit!

365
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,592
What the hell you want?

366
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,393
Don't move!

367
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,957
Bastard!

368
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:30,072
- What the hell...
- Drive on. Get the police.

369
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:34,942
Don't! She's a psycho killer!
She'll kill us all!

370
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:36,605
- Bullshit!
- She's crazy!

371
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:40,117
She just killed my wife.
She killed the trooper.

372
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:41,708
- Wife?
- He killed her.

373
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:45,688
She killed my wife! She kicked me!
She's trying to kill me!

374
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:47,987
She's a psycho hitchhiker!

375
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:50,220
- Shut up!
- She's a liar!

376
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:52,353
I need your help.
Get the police.

377
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,490
Help me!
She's a psycho bitch!

378
00:36:56,501 --> 00:37:01,063
Freeze! Or I will shoot you,
I swear to God. Shit!

379
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:06,343
You ever use
one of those guns before?

380
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:08,811
Just give me a reason.

381
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:12,114
It could be outta ammo.

382
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:15,175
That's very funny, but you're
not dealing with Rayanne.

383
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:17,414
Put your hands
behind your head.

384
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,983
It's a lot of responsibility,
pulling that trigger.

385
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,324
That'll change your life forever.

386
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:28,297
Maybe I've been
looking for a change.

387
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:35,271
Shit!

388
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,365
Goddamn it! You bitch!

389
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:41,645
Hold it!

390
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,612
Mister, you got it wrong.

391
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:47,446
Help me! She shot me, goddamn it!
She's a killer!

392
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:51,010
Go call the police.
I'll watch him.

393
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:53,717
What are you talking about?
She's a murderer!

394
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,283
- Just go! I can handle this.
- Are you crazy too?

395
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:01,727
- She's trying to kill me!
- Go. Shut up!

396
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:05,835
- Murdering bastard.
- I didn't kill nobody. She shot me.

397
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:08,633
- Give 'em to me.
- What are you talking about?

398
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,697
You know what,
you stinking bastard.

399
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:13,835
The computer chips.
Give 'em to me.

400
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:16,880
Shit. Why didn't you just ask?

401
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:19,382
The copper took 'em from me.

402
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,214
He must've known I had 'em.
He's got 'em.

403
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:32,725
Stupid fucker.

404
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:03,187
Goddamn you!

405
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,090
Shit!

406
00:39:48,306 --> 00:39:50,001
Have a little car trouble, honey?

407
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:13,363
- Call 911.
- 911 what?

408
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:15,365
The police! Shit!

409
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:18,532
Phone don't work.

410
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,652
Up!

411
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:45,953
You and I need to have
a little conversation.

412
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,796
- You put that gun down right now.
- Okay, Frank.

413
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,528
Put it down!

414
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:17,887
Come on.

415
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:19,896
Come on, baby.

416
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,667
I kinda like you.

417
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,038
Where are you?

418
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,812
Feisty.

419
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,041
Spicy.

420
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,110
A girl like you,
I'd take out to dinner.

421
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:50,460
Where the hell are you?

422
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:55,058
What're you coming into my life for?

423
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:57,757
What the hell you want?

424
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:03,704
Shit, I'm so sorry
I gotta kill you.

425
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:06,767
I'd like to take you home
to my papa.

426
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:10,714
He'd like to meet you.

427
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,052
Bitch, where are you?

428
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,721
I tell you what, girl.

429
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:27,662
I'll be nice to you
if you're nice to me.

430
00:42:27,732 --> 00:42:29,427
How's that?

431
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,731
Call me crazy, but somehow
I don't quite believe you.

432
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,328
Get down!

433
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:41,238
What are you gonna do, baby?
Shoot me again?

434
00:42:41,312 --> 00:42:44,008
- Don't tempt me.
- I know.

435
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:48,415
This is about you taking hold
of your life, codependent no more.

436
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:51,819
- I'm from Venus, you're from Mars.
- Shut up!

437
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:53,083
Move!

438
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,988
You surprise me, ma'am.

439
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,429
I got a few tricks
up my sleeve too.

440
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:04,764
What the hell's going on?
Who is she?

441
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,235
I don't know.

442
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:10,330
Who the hell are you?

443
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:13,309
Just another Texas girl.

444
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:17,837
Bullshit! You've been
sticking your nose in my business!

445
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:19,940
Nobody knows my business.

446
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:23,646
Not even Rayanne, who is dead now,
thank you very much.

447
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:26,451
How the hell am I
supposed to live without her?

448
00:43:26,524 --> 00:43:28,924
You're pathetic!

449
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:31,860
Anyway, you knew
she was cheating on you.

450
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:36,798
How the hell you know that?

451
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,801
She tell you that?

452
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,575
Who was she doing?
Jesse? Who is it?

453
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:51,911
Cut it out.
Take it somewhere else.

454
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:55,645
Tell me!
I wanna know right now!

455
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,586
Cut it out!
Take it somewhere else!

456
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,724
Take her out in the desert!

457
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:07,353
I'll take it out in the desert,
all right.

458
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:08,898
Make sure nobody finds her.

459
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,698
Get up.

460
00:44:16,307 --> 00:44:18,241
I'll talk to you later.

461
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,439
Nobody's gonna find you
'cept the coyotes.

462
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:29,282
Better make it quick 'cause somebody's
bound to come looking for that trooper.

463
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,753
What's the trooper gonna say?

464
00:44:31,822 --> 00:44:34,052
Just gonna have to shut you up.

465
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,595
You listen to me.
You say anything...

466
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:42,063
and I'll kill them all, I swear.

467
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,600
Hi. Can I help you?

468
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:53,541
We wondered if you might know if there's
a campground located around here.

469
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:55,238
Freeze!

470
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:03,780
Lock the doors!

471
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:15,958
Get outta here!

472
00:46:09,386 --> 00:46:13,186
Let me in!
Brian, you son of a bitch!

473
00:46:16,427 --> 00:46:18,827
You're in there!
Shit!

474
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,638
Brian, you son of a bitch!

475
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:39,380
- Who are you?
- I'm the one you sent back.

476
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,680
- Remember?
- What?

477
00:46:41,752 --> 00:46:43,310
Your name's Brian.

478
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:47,551
There's something in here that sends
people back in time. Me, for example.

479
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:50,684
- I don't know you.
- I was here before.

480
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:53,594
You sent me back, and
I've just relived a nightmare.

481
00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:56,360
I have never seen you before
in my life.

482
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,025
Yes, you have!

483
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:14,414
If what you're saying
is true...

484
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:18,080
I wouldn't remember it
because it wouldn't have happened yet.

485
00:47:21,992 --> 00:47:24,187
This is incredible.
I must've documented this.

486
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,422
No, you listen to me.

487
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:30,399
A lot of people were just killed, and
the killer is outside. He's after me.

488
00:47:31,535 --> 00:47:34,527
- We'll call the police.
- That is not gonna work.

489
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:37,039
I want you to send me back.

490
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:39,541
I'll change what happened.

491
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,807
- I can go back, and I can fix it.
- Are you insane?

492
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,246
I have no idea what
the residual effects might be.

493
00:47:45,316 --> 00:47:48,717
I'll tell you what they are:
people die.

494
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:52,119
- Going back might make it worse.
- I've already made it worse.

495
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:57,352
This time, I'm gonna need
more time. At least an hour.

496
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:59,225
I've only designed it
for 20 minutes.

497
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:02,156
That's gonna put me
right back where I was.

498
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:06,793
You're coming with me.

499
00:48:09,173 --> 00:48:12,404
You want proof that your machine
works, you come with me.

500
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:22,919
They won't know that we know.
This'll give us an advantage.

501
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,920
As soon as you get back here,
call the police.

502
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,821
Tell them there's a crazy man
with a gun shooting people.

503
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:30,018
Get them to the gas station
down the road.

504
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:34,797
As soon as you've made the call,
meet me there.

505
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:40,701
You're that woman from Chicago
with the hostages.

506
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:44,673
Yeah. It's a pity this thing
can't go back three days. Get on.

507
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,206
- You first.
- Don't trust me?

508
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:54,045
Something like that.
Come on. Together.

509
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:22,904
"That is one
good-looking belt buckle."

510
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,438
And, I don't know, it just popped
into my head. Don't ask me how.

511
00:49:26,517 --> 00:49:29,008
I've heard it before.
It's a really stupid joke.

512
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:34,653
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

513
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:38,320
"lt'd look even better
with your forehead pressed against it"?

514
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:41,455
And you thought that was original?

515
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:45,358
Don't take it personal.
After all the stress...

516
00:49:45,436 --> 00:49:48,428
what with my car breaking down
and all...

517
00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:53,602
I am ready to relax,
cut loose.

518
00:49:53,677 --> 00:49:55,235
Know what I mean?

519
00:49:56,613 --> 00:49:58,672
Yeah. Hell,
it's Thursday, right?

520
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,775
Goddamn it. It's only
a day away from the weekend.

521
00:50:01,852 --> 00:50:03,513
That's right.

522
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,817
- What'll you do about your car?
- Hell with it.

523
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:09,416
I like yours better anyway.

524
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:11,586
I just love a big, old Cadillac.

525
00:50:11,662 --> 00:50:15,792
- It's so powerful.
- It is, isn't it?

526
00:50:15,866 --> 00:50:17,800
Let me tell you something.

527
00:50:17,868 --> 00:50:20,701
There's more under me
than just a Cadillac engine.

528
00:50:21,472 --> 00:50:23,599
Why don't we go somewhere
and you show me?

529
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:29,475
Sounds like fun, don't it?

530
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:31,844
You stop it.
This isn't funny.

531
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:34,406
Come on. You know
how much I love this.

532
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:40,823
There're a motel
'bout five miles up. We'll go there.

533
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:43,359
- I love motels.
- You do?

534
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:46,588
- Do whatever you want in 'em.
- Yeah.

535
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,858
Might even give 'em
your real name.

536
00:50:50,434 --> 00:50:52,493
Trash the shit outta the room,
then just leave.

537
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,560
Yeah, I like that!

538
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:58,802
I'm just gonna stop at the station
for a minute, then we'll go.

539
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:02,039
- I'll take a tequila and lime, please.
- Tequila and lime!

540
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:04,876
This day has been hell.

541
00:51:04,948 --> 00:51:08,475
- I'm so glad your car broke...
- Keep driving.

542
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:13,315
Take your hands off the wheel and I'll
blow our brains clear to the border.

543
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,551
What the hell you want, woman?

544
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:17,992
- Slow down.
- Shit.

545
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:20,586
If that's all you wanted,
why didn't you just ask?

546
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:25,459
Does this mean you changed
your mind about the motel?

547
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:29,267
Now you'll let this car pass us.

548
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:33,371
Rayanne, and I thought
you were moody.

549
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:35,377
You ain't seen nothing yet.

550
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,743
Don't get any ideas.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

551
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:49,290
You are of a different ilk
altogether.

552
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:53,562
Afternoon, Officer.

553
00:51:57,901 --> 00:51:59,266
Don't test me!

554
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:03,138
As soon as you get a chance, get as far
away from this asshole as you can.

555
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:04,605
You got it?

556
00:52:04,675 --> 00:52:08,076
Then again, I may just kill him
for you. Solve both our problems.

557
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:10,636
You bitch!
I try to help you...

558
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,739
and this is the gratitude I get?

559
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:14,943
Goddamn it, you better
learn some manners.

560
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:18,215
- This shit don't fly in Texas.
- Maybe that's why I left.

561
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:23,384
Let it go on by.
As difficult as it is...

562
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,928
try and act
like a normal human being.

563
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:45,938
Well, goddamn.

564
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,830
What the hell is happening?
Goddamn it, Rayanne!

565
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:10,668
I don't know who
your lady friend here is...

566
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,003
My lady?

567
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:15,374
but I know what you're doing,
and there is no way...

568
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:18,471
that I'm gonna let you or anybody else
take away what's rightfully mine!

569
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:20,015
What the hell you talking about?

570
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,381
Listen to me.
He's gonna kill you.

571
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:25,353
- Goddamn right!
- I will kill you.

572
00:53:25,422 --> 00:53:27,549
You won't kill me.

573
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:30,184
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

574
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:37,659
Go ahead and shoot me, you stupid bitch!
If you're gonna shoot, shoot!

575
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:43,533
I'm truly amazed.

576
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,237
Well, I'll be damned.

577
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,076
That's the first time you ever listened
to me. Look what you did to my vehicle!

578
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:22,340
What the hell...

579
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,226
Gimme that!

580
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:42,089
Help!

581
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:44,190
Help me!

582
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,396
Oh, shit!

583
00:54:47,137 --> 00:54:49,765
She's got a gun!
She's gonna kill me!

584
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:55,544
- She's a crazy psycho bitch!
- What's going on?

585
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:58,945
She's got a gun!
She killed my wife!

586
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,311
I'll take care of you later,
taco head.

587
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:25,273
Lady, I didn't do nothing!
I swear, lady! Please!

588
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:27,676
Wait!

589
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,308
- We've gotta get that piece of shit.
- Get in!

590
00:55:42,492 --> 00:55:44,858
We're not gonna catch him.
He's too far ahead of us.

591
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:47,260
Not for long. Your pickup's gonna be
giving him a little trouble.

592
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:51,357
- No way. I just had it serviced.
- Check the tires lately?

593
00:55:54,337 --> 00:55:57,932
- Shit. How did you know?
- Woman's intuition.

594
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:04,236
See if you can find
some more ammo for this thing.

595
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,891
Shit.

596
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:36,077
Where the hell are the police?
Brian, you bastard.

597
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:38,671
- Who's Brian?
- Never mind.

598
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:41,046
Frank's in that building somewhere,
and he's got the gun from your truck.

599
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:43,711
- You can count on it.
- How did you know I had a gun?

600
00:56:43,787 --> 00:56:45,482
This is Texas, isn't it?

601
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:47,321
Yeah.

602
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:49,524
Be careful.

603
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:12,505
- Don't you move!
- Hey, lady. Whatever you want, take it.

604
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:15,574
You got that right.
I'm looking for your buddy, Frank.

605
00:57:15,652 --> 00:57:19,486
- Who?
- Frank! I got something for him.

606
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:22,857
I'm right here, sweetheart.

607
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:25,451
- Come and get me.
- Come on out, Frank.

608
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:27,689
It's over!

609
00:57:27,764 --> 00:57:32,861
It's not over till that big,
ugly fat woman sings that little song.

610
00:57:35,505 --> 00:57:38,440
Sam, I think I found
your missing daughter here.

611
00:57:38,508 --> 00:57:41,102
Shit.

612
00:57:41,177 --> 00:57:43,372
Suppose these are real...

613
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:44,743
I can explain.

614
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:49,145
- Shit.
- I got it covered, Officer!

615
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,244
All right. Everybody, drop your guns.

616
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:07,995
Both of you! Put the guns down now.

617
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:11,768
I can't do that, Officer.
That man is trying to kill me.

618
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,138
This is his accomplice.

619
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:16,201
- Sam?
- I don't know what she's talking about.

620
00:58:16,279 --> 00:58:18,008
He's gonna kill you.
Don't trust him.

621
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,380
This is bullshit, Officer.
I picked up this woman hitchhiking.

622
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:24,750
She killed my wife Rayanne.
She's gonna kill Sam and me. Arrest her.

623
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:26,618
He's a thief and a killer!

624
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,625
He's carrying contraband.
Make him open his shirt.

625
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:31,923
- Check him.
- Okay.

626
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:36,455
First, just everybody put your guns
down. We can work this out.

627
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:39,661
Come on, now.

628
00:58:39,736 --> 00:58:43,797
We can work this out, but I am not
putting this down before you disarm him.

629
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:49,974
You hear, sir? She'll lower her weapon
if you'll lower yours.

630
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:52,139
Who the hell are you?

631
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:01,017
Okay, that's fair enough.

632
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:04,492
Hell, you're a professional
law enforcement officer.

633
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:09,089
If I can't trust you,
I can't trust nobody, can I?

634
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:11,099
It's a shame, Officer.

635
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:13,328
Real sad to see a woman
just snap like that.

636
00:59:15,672 --> 00:59:17,162
Especially such a pretty one, huh?

637
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,902
Sir, I've got her covered.

638
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:22,570
Now if you'd just lower your gun
and open up your shirt.

639
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,169
What?

640
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:26,977
You heard me. Put the gun down
and open up your shirt.

641
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,109
Keep an eye on him, Officer.

642
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,785
All right.

643
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:36,257
Okay, easy, easy. All right.
There ain't nothing here.

644
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:42,457
Hell, all I got down here
is a big old beer belly...

645
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:44,659
and a couple of bullets for you!

646
00:59:55,678 --> 00:59:57,839
She was right,
and you were wrong!

647
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,228
You bastard.
You killed her.

648
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:18,259
Yeah, well, Rayanne always did
like it south of the border.

649
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:19,858
Shit.

650
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:23,904
Go ahead.

651
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:31,003
I said go ahead.
Get it.

652
01:01:01,744 --> 01:01:02,676
Oh, God.

653
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:12,619
Found a peanut

654
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:15,055
Found a peanut just now

655
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,623
- What do we do now?
- Hell, you take her on foot.

656
01:01:20,697 --> 01:01:23,359
- I'll mow her down with that.
- Sounds reasonable.

657
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,367
But what do we do
with all those bodies?

658
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:29,098
Hell. We'll say a prayer, take their
watches and wallets, and burn them!

659
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:31,106
That's gonna stink.

660
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,538
Just now I cracked

661
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:40,378
- Stop!
- This doesn't look good.

662
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,941
- Stop!
- Don't stop.

663
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:44,281
I don't want to hit her.

664
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,523
Let me in, please.

665
01:01:48,591 --> 01:01:49,785
- Drive.
- Where to?

666
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:52,453
Just go. Go away from here.
Come on.

667
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:57,857
Shit!

668
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:02,561
- Turn it around!
- That's a police car.

669
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,869
You don't understand.
The officer's been shot.

670
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:06,806
This guy is trying to kill me.

671
01:02:06,876 --> 01:02:08,867
There's not time to turn around.

672
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,554
You are breaking the law!
You are on the wrong side of the road!

673
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,482
Bumper car!

674
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:32,928
Shit. Goddamn.

675
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,938
Yeah, whoo!

676
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,539
Go!

677
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:51,646
I'm going as fast as I can.

678
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:54,989
Get your heads down!

679
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:58,186
I love a good Chevrolet!

680
01:03:08,304 --> 01:03:09,396
Damn!

681
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:14,071
He's on this side.

682
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:26,687
Look out!

683
01:03:35,064 --> 01:03:36,759
Hang on!

684
01:04:15,371 --> 01:04:17,601
Oh, God!

685
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:19,938
- Mom, Dad!
- No!

686
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:14,494
Stay in here, kiddo.
I'll be right back.

687
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:02,573
Gotcha, baby!

688
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:05,614
Where do you think
you're running off to, girl?

689
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:09,981
I thought I'd get myself a beer
right about now, Frank. Want one?

690
01:06:11,988 --> 01:06:13,478
Well, baby...

691
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,325
where's that kid?

692
01:06:17,393 --> 01:06:18,758
What kid?

693
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,419
Goddamn it!

694
01:06:21,497 --> 01:06:24,864
Don't be difficult
at this particular junction, honey.

695
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:27,164
He's hiding, sweetheart.

696
01:06:27,236 --> 01:06:30,171
Wouldn't you be if there was
a damn maniac on the loose?

697
01:06:35,178 --> 01:06:36,805
Hold it.

698
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:39,347
Brian, don't you think
you're a little late?

699
01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:41,542
- You know him?
- Frank.

700
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:47,179
Well, it's an itsy-bitsy world
after all.

701
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:51,191
The two of you
in on this together?

702
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,228
I've never seen her before
in my life.

703
01:06:55,698 --> 01:06:58,166
All right, then.
We're going to Juarez...

704
01:06:58,234 --> 01:07:00,031
in that mother right there,
and you get moving.

705
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:02,036
- I'm going to Mexico.
- Wait.

706
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:07,701
Listen. If you did all this,
you'll never make it to the border.

707
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:10,143
- They'll send you right back.
- Why?

708
01:07:10,213 --> 01:07:12,408
They're tight with us now.
The Mexicans.

709
01:07:12,482 --> 01:07:14,109
- Why?
- Well...

710
01:07:14,183 --> 01:07:17,414
- Free trade.
- Free trade, my ass!

711
01:07:17,487 --> 01:07:20,456
- Just have to kill you both right now.
- Wait. Hold on.

712
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:24,382
There's another way.

713
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,893
Is that right?

714
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:27,862
- Yes.
- Yeah?

715
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,955
Tell me.

716
01:07:30,032 --> 01:07:32,933
Remember that little experiment
that I was working on?

717
01:07:33,002 --> 01:07:34,993
What, that sci-fi bullshit?

718
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:37,164
I got it to work.

719
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,903
Yeah? Well, is it gonna get me
to Mexico any quicker?

720
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:44,435
No. But you can go back
and change all this.

721
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:46,243
You can get away clean.

722
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:48,681
Is that right? Bullshit!

723
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,187
I did it once already,
with her.

724
01:07:56,058 --> 01:07:57,491
You bastard.

725
01:07:59,462 --> 01:08:01,293
Is that right?

726
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:06,159
Yes, it's true, Frank.
That's how I know all about you.

727
01:08:06,235 --> 01:08:08,169
You know all about me, do you?

728
01:08:08,237 --> 01:08:11,866
- Yeah.
- Well, what's my favorite color, then?

729
01:08:14,176 --> 01:08:16,576
What's my middle name?

730
01:08:16,646 --> 01:08:20,377
What did I have for breakfast
this morning? Huh?

731
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:25,011
What universities did I attend?
This is a bunch of bullshit.

732
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:29,080
You don't know anything about me.
Just get in the goddamn car now.

733
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:31,558
You always stop here, Frank...

734
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:34,619
meet with Sam, get a package of money
and some sort of beer.

735
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:38,155
It's always some foreign beer,
because it reminds you of your dad...

736
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:41,135
who took off to Australia
when you were ten.

737
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,967
And I can't imagine
that you got past fourth grade.

738
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,100
Not even Rayanne
knew about the money.

739
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,142
Hell.

740
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:51,679
That's how come you knew
the end of my joke.

741
01:08:53,115 --> 01:08:54,582
Damn.

742
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:57,483
Hell, Brian.

743
01:08:57,553 --> 01:08:59,384
Beam me on up.

744
01:08:59,455 --> 01:09:02,686
Let's check this little experiment
of yours out.

745
01:09:02,758 --> 01:09:04,191
But first...

746
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,564
Get up! Come on.

747
01:09:18,474 --> 01:09:21,068
This is quite a little family
we got here.

748
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:25,045
Four little peas in a pod
in the tunnel of love.

749
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:27,708
- So why didn't you call the cops, huh?
- I did call them.

750
01:09:27,783 --> 01:09:30,217
They thought I was crazy.
They kept laughing at me and hanging up.

751
01:09:30,286 --> 01:09:33,551
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Conversational.
Knock it off.

752
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,918
Try anything funny, I'll blow
the little bastard's brains out.

753
01:09:40,663 --> 01:09:42,096
Now!

754
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,490
Run!

755
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:49,697
- Come on!
- Get off him!

756
01:09:49,772 --> 01:09:51,296
Come here, you little brat!

757
01:09:51,374 --> 01:09:52,898
Get your mitts off!

758
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:56,141
Damn!

759
01:09:56,212 --> 01:09:57,645
Come on.

760
01:09:58,681 --> 01:10:00,410
Oh, God.

761
01:10:03,419 --> 01:10:05,387
Open sesame!

762
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:08,786
Get up, boy!

763
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:20,128
How the hell do you know Frank?

764
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:24,639
He had some very difficult-to-procure
computer microchips.

765
01:10:24,707 --> 01:10:27,870
I didn't know that he was
a gun-toting psychopath.

766
01:10:27,943 --> 01:10:30,844
Yes, he was loud and obnoxious...

767
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:34,076
and he smelled bad, but I had no idea
that he was insane.

768
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:36,675
All of this is
over some stinking computer chips?

769
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:39,687
Not just computer chips.
These are very difficult-to-obtain...

770
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:41,848
government-developed microchips.

771
01:10:43,025 --> 01:10:45,391
We're gonna have to
go back again, Brian.

772
01:10:54,303 --> 01:10:56,828
I've never pushed the system this far.
It's very risky.

773
01:10:56,906 --> 01:10:58,601
If we don't go to the beginning,
it'll never end.

774
01:11:02,578 --> 01:11:05,547
What? What's happening?

775
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,584
Damn it!

776
01:11:11,687 --> 01:11:13,211
Ten minutes?

777
01:11:14,356 --> 01:11:15,983
That's not enough time.
Undo it.

778
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:19,653
I got news for you. "Undo" never
got programmed into the system.

779
01:11:19,729 --> 01:11:22,163
What do you mean undo
never got programmed in?

780
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:24,222
I was using it on dead mice.
It didn't matter.

781
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:28,060
- Reboot it or something.
- You don't get it.

782
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:32,039
It's plugged into the entire complex,
and it's set to go.

783
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:34,338
From now on, anything that
comes in contact with that disk...

784
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,810
will trigger the effect.

785
01:11:36,879 --> 01:11:38,972
Oh, God.
He's gonna go back...

786
01:11:39,048 --> 01:11:40,606
and kill everybody.

787
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:42,241
We'll be there to stop him.

788
01:11:42,318 --> 01:11:44,013
But we won't know that he knows.

789
01:11:44,086 --> 01:11:47,578
But we know now.

790
01:11:47,656 --> 01:11:50,386
But it won't be us now.
It'll be us then, right?

791
01:11:55,931 --> 01:11:57,364
Wait!

792
01:12:02,338 --> 01:12:04,465
Where are you?

793
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,405
Where the hell are you?

794
01:12:08,844 --> 01:12:09,776
Stop!

795
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:15,810
Well, hell, there you are.

796
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:37,305
Whoa.

797
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:42,943
Stop!

798
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:47,375
Stop. That woman needs help.

799
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:50,646
- I don't know. It doesn't look good.
- No, stop!

800
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,381
- Don't stop.
- I don't want to hit her.

801
01:12:53,455 --> 01:12:57,721
Get in. He's coming in the trooper's
car. Turn around, Dad.

802
01:12:57,793 --> 01:13:00,284
- There's somebody coming.
- How'd you know?

803
01:13:00,362 --> 01:13:01,886
I just went through
the machine too.

804
01:13:01,964 --> 01:13:03,625
Oh, my God.

805
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:10,061
- That's a police car.
- I know. The cop's dead. He shot him.

806
01:13:10,139 --> 01:13:11,902
He's right.
The driver is a killer.

807
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:15,568
- Bob, let's go.
- Not in reverse!

808
01:13:23,986 --> 01:13:25,419
Oh, God.

809
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,364
Hang on!

810
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,163
Move!

811
01:13:40,236 --> 01:13:41,863
Go faster! Come on!

812
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:44,204
Get down!

813
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:12,627
Look out!

814
01:14:20,976 --> 01:14:22,705
Hang on!

815
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:56,166
Aah! You bitch.

816
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:43,989
What happened?

817
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:46,994
You sent this kid back
through your machine, Brian.

818
01:15:48,497 --> 01:15:50,055
Yes.

819
01:15:50,132 --> 01:15:51,793
He told me
he's gone through it.

820
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:56,031
That machine has got
to be destroyed.

821
01:15:59,508 --> 01:16:01,135
We go back one more time.

822
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:06,079
Back to the beginning, so that none
of this could happen again. You got it?

823
01:16:26,468 --> 01:16:27,935
Sixty minutes.

824
01:16:28,003 --> 01:16:30,028
A tremendous strain on the system.

825
01:16:31,774 --> 01:16:33,867
This whole place is gonna blow.

826
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,773
That'll be after we're long gone.

827
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:37,277
Come on.

828
01:16:50,726 --> 01:16:53,058
I thought you two
would show up pretty soon.

829
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:54,527
How'd you get in?

830
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:57,255
Hell, you showed me.

831
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:59,562
Don't you remember?

832
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:03,328
You don't, do you?

833
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:10,843
The only one that would
is that little kid, I guess.

834
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:13,809
He's out of the picture
entirely now.

835
01:17:13,882 --> 01:17:15,782
What do you want now, Frank?

836
01:17:15,851 --> 01:17:18,581
Well, I'll tell you.

837
01:17:18,654 --> 01:17:23,489
Brian, that is a damn amazing machine
you got there...

838
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:26,551
and I've been thinking
about all the fun I can have with it.

839
01:17:26,628 --> 01:17:29,825
You know what I could do?
I could kill the both of you...

840
01:17:29,898 --> 01:17:33,629
zap myself back ten minutes
and kill you again...

841
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:37,798
and again and again and again!

842
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:41,172
Not a very noble ambition.
You should aim higher, you bastard.

843
01:17:41,243 --> 01:17:42,175
Hell.

844
01:17:42,244 --> 01:17:45,611
Rayanne's gone, and I just want
to have a little fun.

845
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,239
But you know what?

846
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:52,117
I'm not familiar with that procedure.
You're gonna have to explain it to me.

847
01:17:54,156 --> 01:17:55,316
I won't.

848
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:58,459
Well, I'm sorry to say, sir...

849
01:18:00,028 --> 01:18:01,518
you don't have a choice.

850
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:04,522
It's all up to you, Brian.

851
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,897
How much time do you want?

852
01:18:10,873 --> 01:18:12,670
Oh, a couple hours.

853
01:18:12,741 --> 01:18:15,301
I mean, it's not my nature
to be greedy, Brian.

854
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:18,504
- Time's a-wasting!
- Brian, don't.

855
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,740
Sit down!

856
01:18:21,717 --> 01:18:23,412
Son of a bitch!

857
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,881
Now, Brian...

858
01:18:26,955 --> 01:18:28,820
don't be no stupid fool now...

859
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:30,722
try to be a hero.

860
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,851
- Okay.
- Come on.

861
01:18:32,928 --> 01:18:35,453
Don't worry about the bitch.
Give me the goddamn thing.

862
01:18:35,531 --> 01:18:37,465
Come on.

863
01:18:41,637 --> 01:18:43,468
Punch in the time
and hit enter.

864
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:45,837
You're a bright guy.
Figure it out.

865
01:18:48,977 --> 01:18:52,811
What do I do? I press two hours
and enter at the same time?

866
01:19:47,269 --> 01:19:48,793
You'd look damn good...

867
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,462
strapped to the hood of my car.

868
01:21:43,085 --> 01:21:44,245
Howdy.

869
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:46,753
Got a little car trouble there,
huh, honey?

870
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:50,657
Nope.

871
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:54,492
No?
Sure looks like it.

872
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:58,331
Sure you don't need anything?

873
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,061
I sure don't.

874
01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:02,899
All right.

875
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:05,030
Can't say I didn't try.

876
01:22:10,879 --> 01:22:12,403
Do I know you from somewhere?

877
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:15,582
Uh-uh.

878
01:22:16,985 --> 01:22:18,782
Now you take care of yourself, lady.

879
01:22:21,556 --> 01:22:23,490
What the hell's that about?

880
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:49,942
What seems to be
the problem, ma'am?

881
01:22:50,018 --> 01:22:54,455
Hi. My name's Karen Warren. I work
with the Chicago Police Department.

882
01:23:24,186 --> 01:23:25,380
Need a lift?

883
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:43,368
I don't care what you did,
and I don't care who you made love to.

884
01:23:43,438 --> 01:23:48,205
It's just you and me now.
This money's for you and me, baby!

885
01:23:48,276 --> 01:23:51,143
Come on now, honey.

886
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:54,614
Come on.
Put that gun away.

887
01:23:57,018 --> 01:24:00,545
Now, you ain't gonna shoot me, Rayanne.
I know that.

888
01:24:06,862 --> 01:24:08,295
'Cause you love me.

889
01:24:45,967 --> 01:24:48,959
Drop the gun, ma'am.
Drop it.

890
01:24:58,246 --> 01:25:01,773
- This doesn't look good.
- No, I think you're right.

891
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:04,341
- Let's go.
- Let's go on down.

892
01:25:04,419 --> 01:25:07,047
All right, ma'am,
put your hands over your head.

893
01:26:01,076 --> 01:26:03,601
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to step away.

894
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:07,011
Ain't nothing you can do here.
It's all over.
