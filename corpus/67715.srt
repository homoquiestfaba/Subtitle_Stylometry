00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,904
That's what got magnet sent here
in the first place.

[Laughter]

707
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,143
Man, it's criminal the way they
keep them locked up in cages.

708
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,414
No, jose.
What you did was criminal.

709
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:44,579
No, no. Tell 'em, magnet.

710
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,385
They wanted 1,000 bucks
for just one puppy.

711
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,891
- What?
- Yeah.

712
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,088
I would've made it out if my
pocket didn't start barking.

713

[Laughter]

714
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,502
You boys get one life,
and so far,

715
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,198
you've done a pretty good job
of screwing it up.

716
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,506
So, you're caveman now...
big shot.

717
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,943
Got a nickname.

718
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,846
Well, let me tell you
something, caveman,

719
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,477
you are here on account
of one person.

720
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,384
You know who that person is?

721
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,444
Yeah.

722
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,725
My no-good, dirty-rotten,

723
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,623

great-great-grandfather.

724
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,956
That's who it is.

[Laughter]

726
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,390
No.

727
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,696
You screwed your life up,
stanley yelnats,

728
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,599
and it's up to you to fix it.

729
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,103
It's not gonna be easy,

730
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:36,935
but you'd be surprised
what you can accomplish

731
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,374
once you set your mind to it.

732
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,344
Even zero here
isn't completely worthless.

733
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,109
What about you, zero?

734
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:47,116
What do you like to do?

735
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,920
You just won't talk with me,
will you?

736
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,082
Man, he only talks
to caveman, yo.

737
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,059
You think you're better
than all this?

738
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:06,897
I like diggin' holes.

739
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,305

for it, buddy boy.

What are you laughing at?

756
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,616

in front of the sun.

But it was only half-full
when i got it.

And, uh, there's a lot
in my hole.

Nothing.

1253
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,864
What'd she do to you?

1254

Nothing.

1255
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,605
Pbbtt. Nothing?

Hey, zero.

1267

Why'd you dig my hole, man?

1268
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:10,101
You didn't steal
the sunflower seeds.
