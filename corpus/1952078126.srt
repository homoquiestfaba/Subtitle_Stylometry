1
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,033
No, not again!

2
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:48,033
You're on the wrong
side of the tracks, Neil!

3
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,533
Run, Neil, Run!

4
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,600
Why can't you sleep
like a normal person?

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,100
Do you have nightmares
every freakin' night, or what?

6
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,600
It... it all seemed so real.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,100
Well listen Neil, you gotta
stop wakin' me up like this.

8
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
I need my beauty sleep!

9
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,133
I'm about ready to kick
you out of my apartment.

10
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:19,133
I'm sorry,
its just your apartment?

11
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:24,133
I'm the one who's been paying
rent since you lost your job.

12
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:28,133
Hey, hey-- don't turn this
around on me, man--

13
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,633
you're the one who has
the problem, not me...

14
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,133
- I don't have the problem.
- Okay, cut the bullshi--

15
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,133
You gonna get that?

16
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,633
Hello?

17
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:49,667
Oh, hey, Neil.
I didn't wake you, did I?

18
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,167
No, another damn
nightmare woke me up.

19
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,667
Again? Are you okay?

20
00:02:55,667 --> 00:03:00,167
Yeah, I guess. It was so real,

21
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,667
I could have sworn it
was really happening,

22
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,167
I felt like this guy was
really going to kill me.

23
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,667
You've just gotta relax.

24
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,167
Bad dreams are just a
result of too much stress.

25
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,667
You've just got to figure out
what in your life is bothering you.

26
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:19,667
Why are you eating my cereal?
I bought this! For me!

27
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,200
- Relax.
- And you're eating out of a cup!

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Well, all the dishes are dirty.

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Maybe you could lift a
finger and actually wash--

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,200
No, I was talking to Chuck...
no, he hasn't found a job yet!

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,700
Anyway, I've gotta get going,

32
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,200
Eddie's train gets in later today,
and I've gotta go pick him up.

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,200
Ed Spengler? From high school?

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I haven't seen him in five years!

35
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,733
- What has he been up to?
- He's been working

36
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:59,733
for his uncle in New York,
doing some scientific stuff.

37
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,233
I guess he's gonna
be conducting

38
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,233
some kind of experiments
in the area.

39
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:11,233
- What kind of experiments?
- Oh, you know Eddie,

40
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,733
wherever he goes,
weird things follow.

41
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:21,233
That's funny, I've always thought
the same thing about you.

42
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:26,233
Yeah, I suppose.
Anyway, here's Chuck--

43
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,267
I've got to get going.

44
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,767
Oh, hey babe-- what's up?

45
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,767
Why do you always talk
to Neil for so long?

46
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,267
Ye gods! My uncle was right!

47
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,767
Denver is crawling with
paranormal activity!

48
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,767
I don't understand why
I had to come all the way

49
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,767
here with you, just to look
at blips on a scanner.

50
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,767
This isn't a scanne--
it's a digital PKE meter,

51
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,267
and these aren't just
any old blips! They're--

52
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,767
I know, I know, they're
electro-phantasmal shadows

53
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:58,767
that indicate the presence
of ghosts. I get it.

54
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,267
I can't believe
your uncle talked me

55
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,267
into dropping my psych
major and chasing spooks.

56
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,267
Eugene, you're my best friend.

57
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:05,767
We've been through
a lot together.

58
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,267
Come on, we're in this
together, we're a team.

59
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,267
Team? Sometimes I feel
like I'm just your bitch!

60
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,267
Assistant, Eugene,
you're my assistant,

61
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,267
- and we're here to get a job done!
- But you treat me like I'm your bitch!

62
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:19,267
Fine, if you want to consider
yourself my bitch, then do so.

63
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,767
I wish Neil would get here
so we could get started.

64
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,267
My uncle showed us what
to do and how to do it,

65
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:26,267
and if we need to do it in
every building in Denver,

66
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,767
we'll do it in every
building in Denver.

67
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,767
Queers.

68
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,300
Hey back off man.
He's a scientist!

69
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
What? Oh, there's
a misunderstanding,

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
we're not like that, you see

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
we're here in search
of ectoplasmic energy

72
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
ghosts in hopes
that we can prevent

73
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
any paranormal outbreak
of malevolent inhuman spirits.

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
We're affiliated
with the Ghostbusters,

75
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,800
out of New York,
ever heard of us?

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Neil Anderson!
Long time no see.

77
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,333
If you happen to see
anything, well, um... spooky--

78
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,333
Let's go, Ed!

79
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,833
We're wasting
valuable drinking time!

80
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,333
...give us a call!

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,833
Queers.

82
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,867
So, Neil...
tell me about these dreams...

83
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:46,367
I'd rather not talk about it.

84
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,367
I get crap from Chuck
about it all the time.

85
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,867
Chuck?
Is he still dating Nancy?

86
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,867
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nancy Ashton?

87
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:59,367
Isn't that the girl you had
a crush on? She's hot.

88
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,867
- Why is she dating your roommate?
- I don't know.

89
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:05,367
It doesn't make any sense,

90
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:09,867
he's a complete slob...
he doesn't have a job--

91
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:12,867
I'm sure she'll realize her
mistake soon enough.

92
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,400
Yeah, I guess.

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
What kind of experiments
are you here for anyway?

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
"Paranormal investigations"

95
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,900
he thinks he's Fox Mulder
or something.

96
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh, for God's sake, Ed!
You're not following in

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,900
the footsteps of
your crazy uncle

98
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
with all that ghost
busting crap are you?

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
- Maybe I am.
- Well, I know one thing...

100
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,400
those proton packs
are cool as hell!

101
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:52,933
So tell me about
your nightmares, Neil.

102
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,933
Y'know, I read that bad
dreams are caused by stress.

103
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,433
Yeah, I've heard. I really jus--

104
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,433
What's going on?

105
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:06,933
Some kind of poltergeist...

106
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,433
been scarin' away my customers.

107
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,933
Really?

108
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:18,933
- You can't be serious.
- I'm always serious.

109
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,467
This is heavy, doc!

110
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,467
- Why do I get the messed up uniform?
- They're hand me downs.

111
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,967
So why do I get
the hand me down

112
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,967
that looks like a ghost
whipped his ass with it?

113
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,967
It's ectoplasm. Slime...

114
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,000
and probably a bit of marshmallow
now that you mention it.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Marshmallow?

116
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,033
Maybe it's gone.

117
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,033
I don't think so.

118
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,033
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just--

119
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,033
- Neil, throw the trap down!
- What?

120
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:11,533
The trap! You'll have to
throw it! It's on my belt!

121
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,033
On 3, take your foot
off the pedal!

122
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:26,533
Everyone remember to
look away from the trap!

123
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,533
One... two... three! Now!

124
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:43,567
Wow, I guess you were right, Ed!

125
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,567
Oh my god that was... awesome!

126
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,067
You boys just saved my
business! What do I owe you?

127
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,067
- Uh...
- Two grand!

128
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Good morning, I'm Ed Rooney.

129
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
This morning the
Mile High city is alive

130
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
with talk of
supernatural activity,

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,100
ghosts and hauntings pouring
in from all over the front range.

132
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:43,233
Hey babe, why don't
you come over here

133
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:47,233
- I just got a dimer from--
- That's all you do with your life!

134
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:50,733
- Yeah...
- I don't know how Neil puts up with it!

135
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,233
Neil? Yeah, he's a winner.

136
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,767
He's been staying with
his Ghostbuster friends

137
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,767
at their little
headquarters downtown

138
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:57,767
hasn't been home in a week.

139
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,767
Well, he's been a
busy man these days...

140
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,767
what with a job and all.

141
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,767
Oh geez, who cares what
that guy does, anyway?

142
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,267
- Maybe I do.
- What's that supposed to mean?

143
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,267
Nothing, look, I've got to go...

144
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,267
maybe I'll talk to you tomorrow.

145
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,267
You know what? Whatever!

146
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Man, I'm dead. What a week.

147
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm not chasing one
more ghost until

148
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,300
I get at least 8 hours
of uninterrupted sleep.

149
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Speaking of which,
you don't seem

150
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,800
to be suffering from
any bad dreams lately.

151
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
Nope...

152
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,800
ever since I stopped
sleeping at my apartment.

153
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
That's unusual.

154
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,800
Yeah, I think it was that
crappy mattress I bought...

155
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Mattress?

156
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Did you start having bad
dreams as soon as you got it?

157
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,833
Pew!

158
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,833
It is entirely possible you have

159
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:48,333
a poltergeist in
the mattress itself.

160
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,833
Why not... he's not using it.

161
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,867
Whoa, a haunted bed?

162
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:19,367
Why not? What happens
in these dreams, Neil?

163
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,367
It's really bizarre.

164
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,367
In the dream,
I'm always in this... place.

165
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,367
I'm all alone, but suddenly
in the distance,

166
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,867
there's this guy...
his face is horribly burned,

167
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:38,867
and he's got these...
knives on his fingers...

168
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:43,900
like claws...
he calls himself Freddy...

169
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Freddy Krueger.

170
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
You're all alone, now Neil!

171
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Neil? What? No, I'm Chuck.

172
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
How Sweet! Fresh Meat!

173
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Dude, are you gay?

174
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,900
Hey Chuck, let's toke up!

175
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,433
Hey man, you're all right!

176
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:51,467
- Hello?
- I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy!

177
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:56,467
- I'm sorry, who is this?
- Oh... uh... is Nancy there?

178
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,967
Nancy, it's for you!

179
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:20,467
Hmm... a dream demon.
It's not unheard of.

180
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah, so how do we stop
him if he's not a ghost?

181
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
I think we should check out
that mattress as soon as possible.

182
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,000
Right... like in the morning.

183
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,000
Actually, I was thinking right now.

184
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Well, have fun.
I'm gonna get some rest.

185
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
I have a feeling
that Freddy could be

186
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
the entire reason
the PKE levels in

187
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
- Denver have surged recently.
- No way...

188
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
there have been so
many other ghosts in...

189
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, all my recent data
points to something else.

190
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
I think Freddy may
have somehow opened

191
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
a rift to another dimension.
I wouldn't rule out

192
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Freddy actually controlling
the ghosts himself.

193
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,533
- I have to see that mattress.
- Okay...

194
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,533
as long as we're not
there all damn night.

195
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,033
I just need to get some readings.

196
00:19:56,067 --> 00:20:00,067
Neil, you better come here.

197
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,567
Look at those claw marks!
Just like my dream!

198
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,067
Its almost as if by
sleeping in your bed,

199
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,567
Chuck encountered
your dream demon!

200
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:17,567
- Freddy.
- A man is dead in your bed!

201
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,067
What should we do?

202
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,567
I have an idea.

203
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,567
Strange, I halfway expected

204
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,567
Freddy to emerge
from the mattress.

205
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,067
Hey, if we killed him
just by burning

206
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,600
his haunted mattress,
I'm fine with that.

207
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
I just didn't think it
would be that easy.

208
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
That's the third
teenager murdered

209
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,100
in their sleep in
the last week.

210
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
I think we both know
what this points to.

211
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
Agreed. I was going
over the possibilities

212
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
of how this may have happened.

213
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,133
We probably set Freddy free
when we burned the mattress.

214
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,633
Likely... but it also
may have occurred

215
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:13,133
when he made his
first kill in a new city.

216
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,133
That's why he didn't
emerge from the mattress.

217
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,133
Ghostbusters.

218
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,133
What do you mean
Nancy won't wake up -

219
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,633
is she having a nightmare?

220
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,133
Okay, we're on the way!

221
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,133
Surprise, it's the Ghostbusters!

222
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,667
Go, get them!

223
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,167
Ghostbusters!

224
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,167
Hello?

225
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,667
We found her like this.

226
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,167
She appears to be
trapped in a dream state.

227
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,167
Well, at least she's not dead!

228
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,667
It's Freddy... he's got her...

229
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,700
The readings I'm getting on
this are off the charts!

230
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,200
If the neural psycho
kinetic energy is constant,

231
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
this demon of yours
may be invincible!

232
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,200
No, there has to be
a way to stop him.

233
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,700
Maybe we could just
shoot him in the face?

234
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
- Well, that would kill me!
- Hey, what would Jared do?

235
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,700
Yeah, what would Jared do?

236
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,200
I would go into the
dream-dimension

237
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,733
where Freddy lives
and pull him into reality.

238
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,733
Once he is real,
you should be able to

239
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,733
contain him with your equipment.

240
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,733
Then I'd go to Subway
for a Roasted Chicken

241
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:58,233
sandwich on parmesan
oregano bread.

242
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:02,233
Of course, it's so simple!
Thanks, Jared!

243
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,733
Look, if there aren't any
more of these damn questions

244
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:08,233
for a while,
I'm gonna have a nap!

245
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:19,233
- No, please!
- It's okay.

246
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,767
I had Subway for lunch!

247
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,767
This is all makeshift, but
theoretically, it should work.

248
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,267
Once you two have
a hold on Freddy,

249
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:38,267
I'll pull you from the dream
and we can trap him, got it?

250
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:43,267
- Let's do this like Falco!
- Like Falco?

251
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,767
Rock me Amadeus!

252
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,800
- Where are we?
- Oh man,

253
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,300
this is it, this is my dream.

254
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,300
Right.

255
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Let's find Freddy.

256
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,800
Who ya gonna kill?
Ghostbusters!

257
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,833
Haaahahahaha!

258
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,833
Alright, let's bag this
sucker and go home.

259
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:37,333
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

260
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,333
My name... is Neil!

261
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,333
They don't hurt him at all!

262
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,333
- Run?
- Yes.

263
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,833
What are they doing?!

264
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,833
All you have to do
is grab a hold of him!

265
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,833
Nancy!

266
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,833
Neil! I knew you'd come!

267
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,333
Wake up, Nancy!

268
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,333
What happened?

269
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:29,833
Got him! Now Ed, now!

270
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:42,867
I had him!

271
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:46,367
No, he's definitely here...
somewhere.

272
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,400
He just disappeared!

273
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,400
I thought he could be
harmed in the real world!

274
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,400
Theoretically, he can...
but he seems to

275
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,400
have maintained some of
his dreamworld powers.

276
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,400
- I'll swallow your soul!
- Oh crap, guys!

277
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Get me out of here! Now!

278
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,433
This equipment to bring
Neil back is fried.

279
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,933
There's only one
way to get him out.

280
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:51,933
- What about Freddy?
- Eugene, keep me covered.

281
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:11,433
What are we gonna do?

282
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:37,467
I've got a plan.
We'll cross the streams.

283
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,967
Wait, wait...
that just sounds like a bad idea.

284
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:42,967
I mean I'm no scientist,

285
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,967
but I swear crossing
streams sounds.

286
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,467
It may just create
enough energy

287
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,500
to knock us back
into the waking world!

288
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Three... four...
better lock your door!

289
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But what if crossing the
streams doesn't work,

290
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
and we end up blowing
up the universe?!

291
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, we could either try it,
or stay here

292
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
while these phantoms
feast upon our souls!

293
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Five... six...

294
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,533
It's time to kick ass
and chew bubble gum

295
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,033
and I'm all outta gum!

296
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:45,033
You're not gonna cram
me into that toaster!

297
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:51,533
Thisssssssssssssssucks!!

298
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:11,067
- Wow, it worked!
- Of course it worked,

299
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,067
that's because
I know what I'm doing!

300
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,567
We better get this thing
to the containment unit.

301
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:24,567
- Who are you guys?
- We're the Ghostbusters.

302
