1
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,755
Yes!

2
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,408
<i>Winner!</i>

3
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,335
<i>You own this table!</i>

4
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,941
Where's Bernie? They're killing us.
We need him here right away.

5
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,486
Yeah!

6
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,724
<i>Come on, baby.
Come on, come on!</i>

7
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,522
Come on!

8
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,462
<i>Seven out.</i>

9
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,364
<i>Oh, man!</i>

10
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,632
Come to Papa-
Hey, what the hell?!

11
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,139
God damn it, that's supposed
to be an $800 jackpot.

12
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,033
Afternoon, Doris.
- Hey.

13
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,349
- Got any cream?
- Sure.

14
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,517
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.</i>

15
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,832
Dewar's and-

16
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,066
Fuck!
Dewar's and water, please.

17
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,572
Hi, Natalie.

18
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,010
- Hey...
- Bernie.

19
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,345
Shit, motherfucker!
Yeah, Bernie.

20
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,908
Yo, Doris, have you seen
Shelly around?

21
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,147
<i>He promised to position me
at the tables tonight.</i>

22
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,553
<i>I've been on skid row all week.</i>

23
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,581
You didn't settle up
with me last night.

24
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:57,119
No? You sure?
Fuck, I was way under.

25
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,529
It's been like an AA convention
around here.

26
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,466
<i>I'll make it up to you tonight,
I promise.</i>

27
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,266
Where have I
heard that before?

28
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,172
- If I see Shelly, I'll tell him...
- Thanks.

29
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,234
...that you're looking for him.

30
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,336
<i>Conway, party of 11.</i>

31
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,539
<i>Please check your reservation
in the Paradise Lounge.</i>

32
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,174
Hey, Bernie,
Shelly needs you on 11.

33
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,277
All right.
Let's do the Chivas Regal.

34
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,654
And have that-
have Natalie bring it over,

35
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,784
the one working the nickel slots
by the Paradise.

36
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,590
I spoke to Shelly earlier.
He wants her out on the tables.

37
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,097
All right.
I'll take care of it.

38
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,828
Great shot.
How about that?

39
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,705
<i>Hi. It's you, right?</i>

40
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,370
Yeah, over here.

41
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,108
Joe said
I should stick around.

42
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,173
You say something
to Shelly?

43
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,708
Um-hmm.

44
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,244
Wow, that was fast.
Thanks.

45
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,281
Don't mention it.
It's over here.

46
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,061
I'll win you a fortune
on five and nine.

47
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,625
Did you order
the Chivas Regal?

48
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,931
Hey, back off, will you, pal?
Can't you see I got a roll here?

49
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,338
<i>54, 54.</i>

50
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,707
- Seven out, line away.
- That motherfucker.

51
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,907
<i>Thanks for the bet, folks.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.</i>

52
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,625
Oh! Shoot!

53
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,675
Better luck next time.

54
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,799
<i>Ah-hh.</i>

55
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,767
- Shelly, they're here.
- Relax, shorty.

56
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,107
Hey. Nicky, you didn't tell me
you were coming.

57
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,338
I'm having a manicure here.

58
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,711
You think I don't wash up
after going to the john, huh?

59
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,114
Forget about it. You look like
a million bucks. How are you?

60
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,175
You should have called ahead.
I would have sent the car.

61
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,279
- No, we figured we'd surprise you.
- Anytime, Nicky, anytime.

62
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,313
I know that, partner.

63
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,985
Shelly, let me introduce you to our
brightest VP here.

64
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,723
This is Larry Sokolov.
His numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

65
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,324
- How do you do, Shelly?
- Can I get you something to drink?

66
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,834
I'd love a vodka tonic,
thanks.

67
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,870
...comes out of the confessional and she
says, "Move over, I have to gargle."

68
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,348
So Nicky,
what brings you to town?

69
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,647
Shelly, I've got
a smart kid here.

70
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,712
He's got some good ideas
about how to revitalize the Shangri-La.

71
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,054
Revitalize? What are you talking about?
We did $35 million last year.

72
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,083
Why don't you
just hear the kid out, huh?

73
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,995
Shelly, I want you to know that I have
nothing but the utmost respect for you.

74
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,592
You've done a tremendous job with
the Shangri-La over the last 16 years.

75
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,399
I don't think anybody
can dispute that.

76
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,305
<i>Yeah, nobody doubts that, Shell.</i>

77
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,434
But the business has changed.

78
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,070
Just take a look at the Strip,
you'll see what I'm talking about.

79
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,103
What?

80
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:40,312
You mean that Disneyland
mookfest out there? Huh?

81
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,753
Come on, you know
what that is?

82
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,349
Huh? That's a fucking violation
is what that is.

83
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,656
<i>It's something that used
to be beautiful.</i>

84
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,527
It used to have class,

85
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,590
like a gorgeous high-priced hooker
with an exclusive clientele.

86
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,034
Then along comes
that Steve Wynn cocksucker

87
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,368
and knocks her up and puts her
in a fucking family way.

88
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,102
Now, she's nothing
but a cheap fat whore

89
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,908
hiding behind too much make-up.
I look at her and see her stretch marks.

90
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,847
It makes me want to cry, because
I remember the way she used to be.

91
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,873
Am I right?

92
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,150
There's no arguing the bottom line.
Those places are raking it in...

93
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,816
and the Shangri-La as she is now
can't compete with that.

94
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,622
You think I'm trying
to compete with that?

95
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,596
You think that's what we're about,
trying to bring in the stroller crowd,

96
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,724
fresh off some "E-ticket" ride, trying
to break the house on red and black?

97
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,758
Fremont has never been
about that bullshit.

98
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,568
This is where old time
and real money come to play.

99
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,871
The numbers don't back you up
on that, Shelly. Don't get me wrong.

100
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,969
Nostalgia is great
and we love nostalgia...

101
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,241
<i>...but nostalgia
belongs in a museum.</i>

102
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,650
<i>I think it comes a time to decide
whether you're running a museum...</i>

103
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,781
or you're running a casino.

104
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,153
Bernie.

105
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,462
"Mr. Cool."
You got a minute?

106
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,366
- I was just heading over to 14.
- It can wait.

107
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,927
How's the knee?

108
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,668
I met this orthopedic surgeon

109
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,232
at Vegas Memorial.
He tells me...

110
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,677
they can rebuild a man's
entire kneecap out of titanium.

111
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,147
Oh, of course it costs
a shitload of money,

112
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,844
but seeing as this gentleman is into us
for 500 large, I thought maybe-

113
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,650
I told you, I'm not gonna be here
after Sunday.

114
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,325
Where are you gonna go,
Bernie?

115
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,092
Where the fuck are you gonna go
that's better than here?

116
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,326
I've got you covered in this town.

117
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,302
People know you work for me.
That's currency in your pocket.

118
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,600
That's fucking respect,
when you walk the floor.

119
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,334
Where are you gonna get that,
anyplace else?

120
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,138
Seven days, Shelly...
I'm out from under.

121
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,776
Excuse me, sweetheart.
What's your name, darling? Never mind.

122
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,843
This is who I am.

123
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,755
Yeah, that's right. I like to know who's
shopping it around in my neighborhood,

124
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,316
<i>so what you do is be in my office
first thing tomorrow morning,</i>

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,692
<i>if you want to continue
to work here at the Shangri-La</i>

126
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,492
<i>and you and I will go over
the rules together.</i>

127
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,227
I also want you to bring me a clean
bill of health. All right, my dear?

128
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,861
- Okay.
- All right, thank you.

129
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,976
How'd you like
to "birdie" that hole, huh?

130
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,639
Say the word and she's yours anytime.
I'll keep a running tab for you.

131
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,841
Nah.

132
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,181
What? What? She's not your type?
Are you kidding me?

133
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,482
I've got to go.

134
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,647
Things are heating up on 14.

135
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,174
Let's do it in the room.

136
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,240
Kim, I think we got our laundry
mixed up. I- I'll talk to you later.

137
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,651
Come on, let's go back
to the room.

138
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,521
$50 bucks only gets you 20 minutes, man.
You're wasting your time.

139
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:24,704
<i>Your soul is crippled.
I'm gonna change that.</i>

140
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,612
<i>Pray with me now.
Out, demon!</i>

141
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,081
<i>Let the crutches go!</i>

142
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,950
Let the spirit into you!

143
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,045
<i>Run with me!</i>

144
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,750
<i>Fuck me harder!
Harder! Oh!</i>

145
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,488
<i>Oh, yeah, baby.
I like that. Come on.</i>

146
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,689
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

147
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,756
<i>You're so big!</i>

148
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,873
<i>You do? Hallelujah!</i>

149
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:01,209
<i>The Lord has shown
his face once again.</i>

150
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,910
<i>You gonna come all over me?
Oh, yeah, come all over me.</i>

151
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,153
Let's do this, man.

152
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,750
Eight, the hard way.

153
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,526
- $900 for Mr. Pinkerton.
- Seven and Seven.

154
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,261
- Thanks, dollface.
- Jesus Christ!

155
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,601
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

156
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,402
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a fucking klutz.

157
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,704
- No, this stuff happens.
- Oh, my God.

158
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:35,112
I'm sorry. This guy-
fucking hands all over my ass.

159
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,048
You might want to stick around.

160
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,210
<i>I came to play.</i>

161
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,284
<i>Come again, sister,
in the name of Pinkie.</i>

162
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,259
Take this.
Hard eight, huh?

163
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,353
How you like that?
Suck on that.

164
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,695
That's right. Give me them dice.
Damn right.

165
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,962
One dollar,
hard eight.

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,492
All right, everybody,
get in. Here we go.

167
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,630
We'll bet $10.

168
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,370
Out! Seven out.
- Shit! God!

169
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,469
<i>What the fuck are you
smiling at, bitch?</i>

170
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,571
Whoa, whoa... easy.
Fellas?

171
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,514
- You think it's fucking funny?
- Take it easy, man.

172
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,041
Think it's funny this place is stealing
my- fucking numb-nuts, let go of me.

173
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,419
<i>I'll have you fired, you piece-of-shit
bitch! Piece of fucking garbage!</i>

174
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,155
" But now I couldn't do
without my supply "

175
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,224
" I need you for my own "

176
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,897
" Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day "

177
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,637
" As regularly as coffee
or tea "

178
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,510
" You got me in your clutches
and I can't break free "

179
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,574
<i>" You're getting to be
a habit with me... "</i>

180
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,712
Oh, Shelly.
I love you, Shelly.

181
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,222
He's the man,
he's the best man. Salut.

182
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,784
- No, no, no.
- He hates that shit. He really does.

183
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,927
" I used to think your love... "

184
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,301
" Was something that I... "

185
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,704
<i>" Could take... "</i>

186
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,471
" Or leave alone "

187
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:19,312
<i>" But now I couldn't do
without my supply... "</i>

188
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,085
<i>- There he is.
- Hey.</i>

189
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,718
Shelly, I was a fucking embarrassment
out there, do you understand that?

190
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,194
You should never have
talked me into going out there, Shelly.

191
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,697
I should have never let you.
Frank is rolling over in his grave.

192
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,892
I've got strep, man.
You understand that? I've got strep.

193
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,426
Listen to me, Pops, you were
pure velvet out there. It was just silk.

194
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,463
And also, looky-looky what was hanging
on the doorknob. Huh?

195
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,237
Forget about your tonsils.

196
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,905
When the muff confetti stops coming,
that's when you know you got trouble.

197
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,211
Did you get a receipt?

198
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,707
- Excuse me?
- They're on sale in the lobby.

199
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,654
Charlayne's. This is "Victoria's Secret
Valentine Collection."

200
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,851
What about that broad
you got coming here later?

201
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,452
How much did she set you back? Nothing
but the best for old Buddy, right?

202
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,988
Are you fucking kidding me?
Gimme, you don't deserve this.

203
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,058
You got all those ladies going home
with a nice breeze between their legs,

204
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,592
'cause you do it
the way they like it

205
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,572
and you're saying I'm some
Buddy Stafford ego pimp, huh?

206
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,905
Hey, fuck you
and- fuck you.

207
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,844
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me, man. Come on, come on!

208
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,746
Come on, don't be a prick.
Come on, man.

209
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,616
<i>Come on, give it to me!
Come on, man.</i>

210
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,184
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

211
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,169
Do you ever watch
any of those nature shows?

212
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,762
What?

213
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,366
You know, those nature shows.
You watch them?

214
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,810
Yeah, I've seen
a few nature shows.

215
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,839
Yeah? Well, this one I've seen
about a dozen times.

216
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:02,320
It's about... lions.
It's about...

217
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,154
the cycle of life of the lions...
and the leader of the pack.

218
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,422
<i>- Pride. With lions it's a pride.
- Yeah.</i>

219
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,056
This old king lion, right?
He's getting on in years

220
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,658
and then sooner or later
some young male comes along.

221
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,570
He challenges him... and he beats
the fuck out of this old lion, right?

222
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,871
He just kicks the shit out of him.

223
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,538
<i>And then... then they push him
out of the pride...</i>

224
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,242
and he has to go in the jungle
and scavenge and he dies alone.

225
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,478
The nature's got
some sense of humor, huh?

226
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,248
<i>No shit.</i>

227
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,154
See, but Shelly,
it's tragic because...

228
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,559
he's past it,
this old fucked lion...

229
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,792
and he doesn't know it
and it would be so much easier for him,

230
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,360
if he could just...
walk away.

231
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:58,104
And... he could avoid all the pain
and the humiliation.

232
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,678
Hey...

233
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,376
that would be like accepting
that you were dead already, right?

234
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,443
I think I like it better
nature's way, don't you?

235
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,888
Yeah, maybe you're right.

236
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,088
Yeah, that's it.

237
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,452
Buy you a drink?

238
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,653
Yeah.

239
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,729
<i>Shelly, you got a minute?</i>

240
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,432
Shelly, this is Johnny Cappella.

241
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,700
- How you doing, Shelly?
- I know you from some place, right?

242
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,708
Johnny's been opening
for Danny Ganz at the Mirage.

243
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,609
Now Sony is talking about signing him
to a three-album deal.

244
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,113
They're going to position him
as the new Harry Connick.

245
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,015
And I should be
interested in this... why?

246
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,985
Johnny's looking to headline.
I thought we might be interested.

247
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,352
- We?
- Did I come at a bad time?

248
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,448
Even if I was interested,

249
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,823
I got fresh ink with Buddy
for the next five years.

250
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,124
I just renegotiated his contract.

251
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,563
Listen, you two need to be
on the same page.

252
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,362
Larry, listen, if I don't
hear from you by Thursday,

253
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,926
I'm taking the Stardust.
All right? I'm going there.

254
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,097
- I understand.
- Johnny Cappella, gone.

255
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,768
<i>- We'll definitely be in touch, Johnny.
Assholes.</i>

256
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,275
Your progressed
Venus is in Gemini...

257
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,756
12.5 degrees...

258
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,022
and it's in direct motion,
which means...

259
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,329
...you're a slow starter
when it comes to romance.

260
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,363
Sorry. You know what?
This is real unprofessional of me.

261
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,899
I shouldn't discuss your chart
with you until I'm all done.

262
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,510
I can tell by the look on your face
you think this is all a lot of B.S.

263
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,710
No, I just... I know what
the outcome's gonna be.

264
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,483
There's not like one
particular outcome.

265
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,287
A lot of things come
into the picture, like...

266
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,124
- the planets, the moon phases-
- The outcome won't change with me.

267
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,859
- It'll be all bad.
- Oh, my God.

268
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,858
I have never met anyone
who was so down on themselves.

269
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,201
Do you know
what I do at the Shangri-La?

270
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,639
I asked around.
You're a cooler.

271
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,943
- You turn winners into losers.
- Do you know how I do that?

272
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,213
Listen, I know there's a lot of stuff
that happens in casinos all the time.

273
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,618
I do it by being myself.

274
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,987
People get next to me, their luck turns.
It's always been that way.

275
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,985
Well, that sounds
like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.

276
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,361
There's a whole chapter
of that in my book...

277
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,730
I only got six more days.

278
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,793
Well... really almost five.

279
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,101
I'm leaving town.

280
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,344
Only five more days?

281
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,112
Then we shouldn't waste
any more time.

282
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,713
You want to go back
to your place?

283
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,923
If this is-

284
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,864
I'm not sure...

285
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,231
I'm not sure I can afford...

286
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,669
- I can't afford to-
- Christ.

287
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,402
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Wait, I didn't mean it.

288
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,706
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I've gone and cooled the damn table.

289
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,741
Shut up, Bernie,
shut up.

290
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,483
You haven't gone
and cooled anything.

291
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,287
Not by a long shot.

292
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,831
Oh, God.

293
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,667
You know...

294
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,229
once they're dead,
they don't really grow back...

295
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,375
in case that's
what you were waiting for.

296
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,405
Oh, my God, you got a cat?

297
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,752
So... you got any music?

298
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,507
<i>Hey...</i>

299
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,917
come here.

300
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,288
Sit.

301
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:21,262
Relax, Bernie, relax.

302
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,304
I assure you...

303
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,401
at least one of us
has done this before.

304
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,571
This is not the first time
I've ever-

305
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,610
Surprise me.

306
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>I like this.</i>

307
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,763
<i>" Luck, be a lady tonight "</i>

308
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,503
<i>" Luck, be a lady tonight "</i>

309
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,209
<i>" Luck, if you've ever been a lady
to begin with "</i>

310
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,584
<i>" Luck, be a lady tonight "</i>

311
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:26,255
<i>" Luck, let a gentleman see "</i>

312
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:32,029
<i>" How nice a girl you can be "</i>

313
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,500
<i>" I know the way you've treated
other guys you've been with... "</i>

314
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,913
- They're snaps.
I think I can get it.

315
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,146
Ow! Wait. Pull down some.

316
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,550
- Okay.
- Ouch!

317
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,523
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

318
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,550
<i>" It isn't fair... "</i>

319
00:24:55,594 --> 00:25:00,122
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit.

320
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:05,432
<i>" A lady doesn't wander
all over the room "</i>

321
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,237
<i>" And blow
on some other guy's dice "</i>

322
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,703
<i>" So let's keep
this party polite "</i>

323
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:22,045
<i>" Never get out of my sight "</i>

324
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:29,454
<i>" Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with "</i>

325
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,554
<i>" Luck, be a lady tonight... "</i>

326
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,749
Sorry.

327
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,520
<i>" Luck, let a gentleman see... "</i>

328
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,961
It's okay, Bernie.

329
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,964
I've had worse.

330
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,801
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

331
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,043
I know I'm gonna pay for this,
I just-

332
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,514
I don't know who you are
or what- I don't...

333
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,575
<i>This was good and I'm glad.
I don't care.</i>

334
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,519
You've got a great cock.

335
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,193
You've-

336
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,395
Thank you.

337
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,862
So...

338
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,033
want to go get some breakfast?

339
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,777
They've got these rules
about casinos hiring felons,

340
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,218
so he got me a gig
in telemarketing.

341
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,815
We were scamming pensioners
out of their retirement money.

342
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,383
I lasted two weeks.

343
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,691
<i>Here you go.
By that time...</i>

344
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,754
<i>I was really getting in deep.</i>

345
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,857
<i>I owed one of the casinos
over a hundred grand.</i>

346
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,799
I put Shelly
in a really awkward position.

347
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,067
I don't blame him
for what he did.

348
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,472
What?

349
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,568
Your leg?

350
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,045
He did that to you?

351
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,208
- He shot you?
- No. Baseball bat.

352
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,912
- I got off easy.
- What do you mean you "got off easy"?

353
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,911
<i>- I was out of control.
- He maimed you, for fuck's sake!</i>

354
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,221
Listen to me.
I'm grateful for what he did.

355
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,854
I am absolutely serious.

356
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,364
Anytime I get an urge
to play off the clock

357
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,457
or so much as drop
a quarter in a slot,

358
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,060
I just reach down and feel
what's left of my cartilage.

359
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:30,166
- It's an excellent reminder.
- Jesus Christ.

360
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,733
I thought shit like that
only happened in the movies.

361
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,946
Anyway, Shelly and I worked out
a repayment plan.

362
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,950
<i>Six years off the books
at the Shangri-La cooling tables</i>

363
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,179
<i>- and in five days...
- Three.</i>

364
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,211
Oh! Oh, shit.

365
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,552
<i>Oh, my God! Now?
Are you sure?</i>

366
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,855
I'm going into labor.
Yeah, I'm going into labor.

367
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
Ow-ww!

368
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,258
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Stay very calm.

369
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,028
Okay, everybody, we're having
a baby, we're having a baby.

370
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,469
You fucking cocksucker!

371
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,871
Who puts their bag
in the middle of the fucking thing

372
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,205
so a pregnant woman
can trip over it?

373
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,811
- Mikey?
- Bernie.

374
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,408
I guess you're gonna be
a grandfather, Bernie.

375
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,078
Huh. Is this you?

376
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,213
Hey, what the fuck,
it runs.

377
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,221
Here, sit down.

378
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,954
- You all right?
- Yeah.

379
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,724
- Anyway, we've got to get out of here.
- Hey, Mikey.

380
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,755
How's your mom doing?

381
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,926
I'm gonna pretend
like you give a shit

382
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,370
and tell you she's getting by
as long as she's high.

383
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,641
Her name is Charlene,
in case you were wondering.

384
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,978
Hey, when's the last time
you saw a doctor?

385
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,747
About six months ago,
back in Jersey.

386
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,620
I wasn't about to go back there
after they treated me like cattle.

387
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,989
Just 'cause I had
no insurance, you know?

388
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,426
All those places are crawling
with TB from them spics.

389
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,124
Listen, Mikey,
if you want to...

390
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,261
why don't you drop by
the Bettor Life Motel,

391
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,397
give us a chance to...
to catch up?

392
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,203
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
maybe we'll do that.

393
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,211
Play catch up,
for the kid's sake.

394
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,789
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

395
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,629
<i>$100 minimum table, sir.</i>

396
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,127
No offense, pal,
but there's 20 other tables here.

397
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,299
What do you want to come
sit on my head for?

398
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,071
I'm just gonna play one hand.
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

399
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,476
I've got this voice in my head
that says, "This is the table."

400
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,949
- Insurance?
- No.

401
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,995
Oh, yes! Yes, yes!

402
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,562
Busto! Mel,
what's happening to you?

403
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,583
<i>Oh, yeah, welcome
to Mel's house.</i>

404
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,326
<i>Hey, where are you going?
Stick around, pal.</i>

405
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,429
<i>You and me, we make
a great team. Hey!</i>

406
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,802
What was that?

407
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,005
I mean, what the fuck gives?
Is it McGann?

408
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,209
The guy's been with me 12 years.
He's as stand-up as my fucking dick.

409
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,479
Maybe he's having money problems.
I'm gonna pull him.

410
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,543
- No, no, no.
- Was he counting them?

411
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,021
- The mook with the streak?
- Is there a problem?

412
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,581
No, there's no problem.
Fella's on a streak, is all.

413
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,594
Let me guess,
this is one of your "coolers"?

414
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,690
Why don't you announce it to the whole
fucking joint while you're at it?

415
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,190
They told me that you were a sticker
for the old ways, but coolers?

416
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,104
What is this guy, really?
A car mechanic? Some kind of shill?

417
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,404
'Cause he doesn't look
too effective to me.

418
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,770
- He's the best. Take it from me.
- All right. Sure. Whatever.

419
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,909
There are ways-
subtle ways-

420
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,250
<i>that we can keep the odds
in our favor.</i>

421
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,314
I'm talking about more
forward-thinking methods.

422
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,826
I'm sure you've got a whole prospectus
on the subject, right?

423
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,227
Well, as a matter of fact,
yeah, I do.

424
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,357
For instance,
I can tell you right off the bat

425
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,835
the wallpaper's not gonna cut it.
It's too uplifting.

426
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,497
I would suggest going
with some more muted tones.

427
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,632
- Wallpaper?
- Yeah. And personally,

428
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,007
I think the cocktail waitresses
could pop another button or two.

429
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,241
Myself, I wouldn't hire
anything less than a "C" cup.

430
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,415
<i>- You know what that is?
- No.</i>

431
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,113
<i>It's music to be sure.
It's pleasant, not intrusive,</i>

432
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,782
but recorded
at a subsonic level is a mantra.

433
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,284
"Lose... lose... lose."

434
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,796
We're just skimming
the surface, Shelly.

435
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,028
We really need to talk.

436
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,362
Shelly?

437
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,499
You better come guick.

438
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,668
Contact his daughter
and assist with the arrangements.

439
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,400
The Shangri-La
will cover all expenses.

440
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,841
<i>- What about the Paradise?
- She's going dark tonight.</i>

441
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,176
Er, that won't be necessary.

442
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,914
" Can I steal a little love? "

443
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,453
" Can I steal a little love? "

444
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,729
" Cool me honey,
I'm on fire "

445
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,200
" To steal your love
is my desire "

446
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,761
" Hug me, sgueeze me,
till I'm red "

447
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,465
" Till my eyes
bug out my head "

448
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,536
" Coo me, woo me,
turtledove "

449
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,074
" Can I steal a little love? "

450
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:51,214
" Please tell me,
why are you driving me crazy? "

451
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,792
<i>" Why do I dig you like I do? "</i>

452
00:34:55,827 --> 00:35:00,093
<i>" If I should steal a little kiss,
and you can prove that it was wrong "</i>

453
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,861
<i>" Then I'll give it back to you "</i>

454
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,368
<i>" Honey, baby with a smile "</i>

455
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,971
<i>" I can walk you
down the aisle "</i>

456
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,377
<i>" I won't even need
a shove "</i>

457
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,405
<i>" Can I steal a little love? "</i>

458
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,816
Young lady, over here.
You want to give it a shot?

459
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,291
- Yeah. Come here.
- Five for $1.

460
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,393
- Thanks, Bernie.
- Good luck.

461
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,657
Are you ready?

462
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,291
Shit.

463
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,167
All right, double fisted.

464
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,336
- Damn!
- Too bad. Better luck next time.

465
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,467
- You want to try again?
- Yes.

466
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,968
- No, no, no. Thank you.
- Thanks.

467
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,472
- What?
- Nothing.

468
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,714
- What?
- You're an easy mark, is all.

469
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,779
- I'm an easy mark?
- You know where that comes from?

470
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,950
No.

471
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,291
Years ago, Shelly and me were working
Coney Island for the summer

472
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,697
and when I'd see a guy who had a full
wallet and was willing to open it up,

473
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,792
I'd mark him with chalk.

474
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,065
I'd put it on my hand
and go something like,

475
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,971
"Hey, man, good work."
"Hey, buddy, how you doing?"

476
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,168
What the guy didn't realize

477
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,268
was that when he walked
down the way...

478
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,145
<i>Shelly could spot him a mile off.
An easy mark.</i>

479
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,817
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

480
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,150
I've got to sit.

481
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,063
Hi.

482
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,482
- You okay?
- Yeah.

483
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,215
Did you notice, last night,
that tattoo on my butt?

484
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,491
- Little Joe?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,693
Yeah, two 2's.
"Little Joe."

486
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,440
I had a son.

487
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,204
His name was Joe.

488
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,041
I was his mother for one year.

489
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,879
- You don't have to tell me this.
- No, I want to, Bernie.

490
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,514
I gave my son up for adoption.

491
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,263
I just wanted my life back.

492
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,465
I was 17 going on 18

493
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,869
and I was so fucking selfish.

494
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,039
My family didn't want nothing
to do with me after that,

495
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,773
so I hitched a ride out here

496
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,441
and thought
I'd make it as a showgirl.

497
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,248
10 years later...

498
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,657
I'd like to think that if it happened
when I was older,

499
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,092
with a guy that I cared about,

500
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,863
that it would have
been different, you know?

501
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,067
I think about my little Joe sometimes
and I do know I did the right thing.

502
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,074
I'm convinced of that.

503
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,114
Natalie...

504
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,230
I think...

505
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,063
I think I could kick your ass
at the dime toss.

506
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:52,519
<i>" You may not be
an angel "</i>

507
00:39:55,292 --> 00:40:00,161
<i>" 'Cause angels
are so few "</i>

508
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:08,662
<i>" But until the day
that one comes along... "</i>

509
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:13,473
<i>- Would you do something for me?
- " I'll string along with you... "</i>

510
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,103
<i>Yeah!</i>

511
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,637
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

512
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,376
<i>Bernie!
- Yes!</i>

513
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,811
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

514
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,913
Ow! Ow! Jesus, ow.

515
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,356
Oh, yeah!

516
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,656
- Bernie, let's do it up the ass.
- Okay.

517
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,889
- Please, please?
- Okay, okay.

518
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,057
<i>- No, my ass!
- Oh!</i>

519
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,590
<i>" And until the day
that one comes along... "</i>

520
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,763
Yes!

521
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,874
<i>Shut the fuck up in there!</i>

522
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,575
Did we wake you?

523
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,278
<i>" For every little fault
that you have "</i>

524
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:03,323

00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,162
<i>" The human little faults
you do have "</i>

526
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:20,933
<i>" Just make me

527
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,962
I have to pee.
I'm always peeing.

528
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,566
Hey.

529
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,305
How did you get in here?

530
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,043
I told the desk clerk
Bernie was my old man.

531
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:02,143
He let us wait inside.
Is that cool with you?

532
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,178
Bernie is out
looking for a parking space.

533
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,747
I must have taken the last one.

534
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,492
- I didn't get your name.
- Natalie, Mikey.

535
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,629
Tell me something, Natalie,
is he paying you?

536
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,870
Excuse me?

537
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,003
My old man,
is he renting your ass?

538
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,536
Because, otherwise,
I just don't get it.

539
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,606
I mean,
a loser like my pops

540
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,414
in the company
of some primo tits and ass?

541
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,485
It don't compute.

542
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,828
Is this enough
to get me a little taste?

543
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,032
Family discount?

544
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,798
- Are you kidding me?
- No, baby.

545
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,969
- Mikey!
- Hey, Bernie.

546
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,071
I told you we was
gonna stop by.

547
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,140
I thought you'd call ahead first.
We were at breakfast.

548
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,379
Hey. Hey.

549
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,884
You missed some.

550
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,950
Hey, that's nice.

551
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,757
- Hi.
- Hi.

552
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,136
You see, Bernie, the thing is...

553
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,135
we're kind of strapped.

554
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:36,476
I mean, Charly here
is expecting like yesterday.

555
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,916
And we don't have the dough to make with
the right nutrition for her and all.

556
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,785
So I was wondering
if you would like to invest a little...

557
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,724
maybe in your grandchild's future,
his well-being.

558
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,304
It's almost three grand.
That's all I got.

559
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,715
That's- that's
very generous.

560
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,846
Bless you, Bernie.
You want to feel it?

561
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,186
You know, I really-
I don't think...

562
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:25,150
Oh- I just felt a kick.
Come on, Bernie, give me your hand.

563
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,361
- You feel that?
- I don't know. I think so.

564
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,562
- Hey, we'll catch you later, Bernie.
- Okay.

565
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,969
Thanks.

566
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,765
Take care, Dad.

567
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,142
New Shangri-La Hotel and Casino.
We break ground on her in six months.

568
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,775
She's perfect.
Three floors of gaming,

569
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,877
<i>Imax theater,
entertainment center,</i>

570
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,186
boutigues, restaurants, roller coaster.
You name it, we've got it.

571
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,057
She pays for herself in three years.
After that, it's easy money.

572
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,688
Isn't she great, Shell?

573
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,101
<i>In "Lost Horizon," these people,
their plane crashes in the Himalayas</i>

574
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,299
and they get rescued,

575
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,470
Taken to this utopia
in the mountains, Shangri-La.

576
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,673
It's beautiful.

577
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,879
<i>Totally isolated,
untouched by the outside world.</i>

578
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:26,117
No war, no greed,
no bullshit.

579
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,716
Time has slowed down.

580
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:33,662
You never age.
It's paradise.

581
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,829
You see, that's what Shangri-La is.
It's paradise.

582
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,360
Yeah, we've seen the movie, Shelly.
What's your point?

583
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,873
My point is,
you don't fuck with paradise.

584
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,900
Come on. Jesus, Shelly.
Hey, we're not trying to fuck with it.

585
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,106
- We're trying to make it better.
- How?

586
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,548
How you gonna make it better?
It's perfect just the way it is.

587
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,950
It's the last of its kind.
It's pure.

588
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,614
This- this is a fucking mockery.

589
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,648
How is it a mockery, Shelly?
It's right out of the movie.

590
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,718
Who's talking about a movie?

591
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,492
This is not a movie.
This is my fucking life.

592
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,097
Let me ask you one guestion,
where are you gonna be

593
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,069
<i>when they decide
to change it back?</i>

594
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,096
When people want the real Vegas again,
before all this "Epcot Center" bullshit?

595
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,939
Who's gonna give it to them?
You? I don't think so.

596
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:25,074
You know who? The same fucks
who started this in the first place.

597
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,913
You know what's gonna happen?
It's gonna come around full circle

598
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,784
and bite you on the fucking ass,
take my words for it.

599
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,154
Shelly, you make
some good points, huh?

600
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,627
Maybe we'll swing back the other way
someday. Who the hell knows?

601
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,688
But for now, this moment,
I suggest we shoot the dice.

602
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,100
My friend, I think
you should take some time

603
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,331
just to think things through.

604
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,866
I know this is a lot to digest,
I know that.

605
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:06,880
Wait up a second.
What do you say?

606
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,518
I thought we were gonna go eat.

607
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,620
Why don't you try this table over here?
It's a little less crowded.

608
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,964
<i>No, let's play here.
It's my lucky table. I always play here.</i>

609
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,401
<i>Come on,
it's more private over here.</i>

610
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,632
Shelly, I'm a big guy. I know
how to take care of myself.

611
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,234
Go ahead. I know how to find you.
Go ahead. Go eat.

612
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,470
Here we go.
Come on.

613
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,976
<i>Out! Seven, line away.</i>

614
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,384
- What the fuck?
- Come on, "Pops." What the hell?

615
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,685
I could have paid my mortgage
with the money I just lost.

616
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:42,214
File a grievance, all right?
Shithead.

617
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,489
Come on,
give me two hot ones.

618
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,497
<i>Come on, new shooter.</i>

619
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,761
Give me 100 on right, 100 big yellow...

620
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,200
<i>All right, shooter. Come on.</i>

621
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:57,396
<i>Hey, hurry up, Gramps! Come on,
your soup's getting cold, huh?</i>

622
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,144
<i>Four, hard four.
- Give me $25 yellow.</i>

623
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,974
Hey, "Uncle Palsy"...

624
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,919
come on, throw them before you
fucking keel over and die, old man.

625
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,653
<i>Be there!</i>

626
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,219
<i>Seven, out. Line away.
Thanks for the bets, folks.</i>

627
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,027
Don't take it so hard, Pops.
Everybody craps out.

628
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,868
<i>Now go fucking change
your Depends.</i>

629
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,105
<i>That's good.</i>

630
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,052
Who's laughing now?
Crack wise now,

631
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,115
you fucking "Ken doll,"

632
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,096
no-dick, suburbanite,
fucking scum.

633
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,827
<i>Huh? Now how's that
for a game?</i>

634
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,301
- Nicky, Nicky. Hey, it's all right.
- Get the fuck out of here!

635
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:02,066
Disrespectful cocksucker!

636
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,970
<i>How do you like the game so far?</i>

637
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,510
Nicky, Nicky, take it easy.

638
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:15,109
<i>Come on. Come on, come on!
That ain't right!</i>

639
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,746
The guy fucked up my whole game.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

640
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,052
You're right. Forget about him,
he's just a piece of shit.

641
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,490
- Let me see your hand.
- My hand is all right.

642
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,257
I got news for you. I thought this joint
had more fucking class, okay?

643
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:30,824
It used to be we didn't let a bum
like that in this fucking place.

644
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,030
Come on.

645
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,314
This town...

646
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,321
this town, you know,

647
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:55,519
all- all I want to do...

648
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,754
is go some place
where I can tell night from day,

649
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:02,026
where they've got clocks on the walls.
I can't breathe here anymore.

650
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,667
Four days and I'm gone. I don't even
know if I can hold out that long.

651
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,866
So where does that
leave us, Bernie?

652
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,736
A week ago,

653
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:18,373
I couldn't even remember what it was
like to have a woman's hands on me.

654
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,810
I still pinch myself.
I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up-

655
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,752
Come with me.
Natalie, I want you to come with me.

656
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,918
- God, Bernie.
- I'm sorry.

657
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,951
I didn't mean to spring it on you.

658
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,431
I- I've been working on this
compatibility chart, okay?

659
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,093
And it looks good,
really it does.

660
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:42,799
- So, what's the problem?
- The problem is it's only good here.

661
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,568
But that's just for now,
for the immediate future.

662
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,875
You know, when the planets realign...
maybe next year...

663
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,279
A year!? Natalie,
I can't wait another year.

664
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,442
I can't-

665
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,126
I can't go, Bernie.

666
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,210
- Hi, Doris.
- Hey.

667
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,791
Oh, shit.
Just a second.

668
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,731
<i>Chang, party of 15, your table is ready.</i>

669
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,825
<i>Chang, party of 15.</i>

670
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,100
<i>All right.
Come on, papa-to-be!</i>

671
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,669
Come on, y'all.
I want to send my baby to college.

672
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,943
Six and a three,
five and a four. Let's go.

673
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:05,247
This is for our baby's future.
Don't "blow" it.

674
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,348
This is for you.

675
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,258
This one's on the line
for the guys with bowties,

676
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,127
- with shoes.
Oh, yeah.

677
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:18,191
Dealer's got shoes.
The point's nine.

678
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,499
Let's get that.
A six and a three, a five and a four,

679
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,165
Let's do it. Can we get it?
Can we get it? Come on.

680
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,674
We got a shooter.

681
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,038
Hi, Bernie.

682
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,570
<i>Fucking rock star!</i>

683
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,845
<i>Give me them dice back.</i>

684
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,944
Okay, pay me, moron,
pay me. Come on!

685
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,820
<i>$9,000, $9,000.
- Give him $9,000.</i>

686
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,154
<i>We're on a streak here.
Move it, move it, move it.</i>

687
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,682
God bless you all.

688
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,753
Point is nine. Point is nine.

689
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:50,789
Let me get all the hard ways
for "Team Moron" here, okay? All right.

690
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:55,168
This is great!
For you guys, all right?

691
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,070
- Here we go.
Come on.

692
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,507
- Six and three. Five and four.
This is for the baby.

693
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,034
Come on.

694
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,816
<i>Oh, oh, careful!</i>

695
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,379
Come on, guys, with the cigarettes.
We've got a pregnant woman here.

696
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,415
Put them out. I'm winning
you guys money. Come on!

697
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,053
<i>Come on.
All right.</i>

698
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,620
What gives?

699
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:25,965
He's up 18,000
since I stepped up to the table.

700
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,334
Sorry, Shelly. I'm kind of
hit-or-miss these days.

701
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,568
- $9,000, $9,000. Oh, baby.
- Oh, my God.

702
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,406
<i>Oh, my God.
I can feel a kick.</i>

703
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,512
<i>Fucking amateurs.</i>

704
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,278
Let's get it. Let's get it!

705
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:44,651
<i>Nope. That's it. Line away.</i>

706
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,491
Guys, I thank you.
My pregnant wife thanks you.

707
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,963
My unborn child
thanks you very much, okay?

708
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,192
<i>Color me up, will you?</i>

709
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,394
And keep one of these
little blue ones for yourself.

710
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,562
Thank you very much.

711
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,709
That's guite a run
you had there, champ.

712
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,878
Oh, yeah, lucky!

713
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,787
- Lucky night, I guess, huh?
- It's so exciting to watch, too.

714
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,417
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle this in my office.

715
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,586
I don't like to lay out
that kind of cash on the floor.

716
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,292
We'll go up there, relax a bit,
have a drink, name your poison,

717
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,596
a little apple juice
for the mother-to-be here.

718
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,433
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

719
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,242
- Should I take this stuff with me?
- No.

720
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,553
Yeah...

721
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:02,230
Okay, that is not
how I propose we handle this.

722
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,859
We turn this matter
over to the authorities.

723
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,926
They'll be blacklisted,
their credit ruined-

724
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,438
Then, I suppose I should stick
a fucking lollipop in their mouths

725
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,531
for the ride home, huh?

726
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,270
Let me tell you something, "Harvard,"
come upstairs with me in my office,

727
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,714
watch and learn how to protect
your investments the old-school way.

728
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,788
Fuck.

729
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,195
Ow, ow, ow... ow!

730
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,397
<i>All right. Here we go
everybody. Let's go.</i>

731
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:46,899
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, wait a second.

732
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,138
<i>Get off me! No!</i>

733
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,842
Shelly, wait. Wait!
Don't, don't. Don't do this.

734
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,941
<i>Stay out of this, Bernie.
It's got nothing to do with you.</i>

735
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,145
It's got everything to do with me.
He's my son.

736
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,485
Him? This little prick
is your son?

737
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,252
- Pop, you've got to help me out here.
- Shut up!

738
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,955
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait. Are you in on this?

739
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,326
<i>- Huh?
- What!?</i>

740
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,832
I asked you a fucking guestion.
You come clean with me now.

741
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,266
No! For God's sake,
what's the matter with you?

742
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,328
I didn't know nothing
about this!

743
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,068
Shithead here is your son?

744
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,909
Let me ask you a guestion.

745
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,078
How much you think
their two lives are worth?

746
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,715
Myself, I don't think they're
worth piss, but hey, he ain't my kid.

747
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,726
This shithead was up
150 G's down there.

748
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,923
That's 150 grand that somebody's
got to account for.

749
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,490
What do you say you cover
them both, 75 apiece, huh?

750
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,229
Come on, Shelly.
They didn't get away with the money.

751
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,737
- You haven't lost nothing.
- Go to work.

752
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,741
<i>Pop! Pop!
- No, wait! Come on!</i>

753
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,868
- Jesus!
- Wait.

754
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,140
All right, all right.
God damn it. All right.

755
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,207
All right, all right.
I'm good for it. $150 G's.

756
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,550
<i>I'm good for it.</i>

757
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,953
<i>It's all right, honey.
- Oh, my God, the contractions.</i>

758
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,322
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Come on, Shelly.

759
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,760
Oh, for God's sake, Shelly.
Will you help her out?

760
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,629
<i>That's my grandkid.</i>

761
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,065
Oh, my God, that's right.
That's Bernie's grandchild in there.

762
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,365
You all right, sweetheart?
You need to go to the hospital, huh?

763
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,598
- Uh-huh.
- I'll bet you do.

764
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,742
- Jesus!
- Charlene!

765
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,739
Hey, everybody look,
It's a boy!

766
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:37,481
Oh, can you believe this?
Bernie, you have a grandson!

767
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,393
Bernie's got
a little grandson!

768
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,124
Isn't he cute? Isn't he cute?
I think he looks like you, Bernie.

769
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:51,622
<i>What do you think?</i>

770
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,379
A nice healthy grandson.
Want to hold your grandson, Bernie? Huh?

771
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,476
Break out the champagne, everybody.
Bernie's a grandfather.

772
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,817
You still want
to make good on this?

773
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,851
If you want to change your mind,
I don't blame you.

774
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,696
I'll make it up to you, Pop.
I swear.

775
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,137
I'm good for it.

776
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,578
<i>- All right, up on the table, right now!
Whoa, whoa whoa-</i>

777
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,382
Wait a second.
Shelly, we had a deal!

778
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,888
$150 G's buys their lives.

779
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,414
This is a little slap on the wrist
to remember me by.

780
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,927
<i>Wait, wait.
No, no!</i>

781
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,522
Jesus, Shelly, no!

782
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,726
Come on.

783
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,941
Fuck!
I brought this on myself.

784
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,747
I planted the seeds.

785
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,419
When Angela had run off
with Mikey, I didn't-

786
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,484
I never made-

787
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:29,020
I never made an effort
to get back in his life.

788
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,966
I figured...

789
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,198
the kid don't need
a fucking loser for a father.

790
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,230
And now it's come full circle.

791
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,868
I give him the money,
I open the door to all this.

792
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,347
This- I got this coming to me.
This is- this is payback.

793
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,295
Are you done
beating yourself up, Bernie?

794
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:08,236
<i>" My funny Valentine "</i>

795
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:15,343
<i>" Sweet comic Valentine "</i>

796
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,972
<i>" You... "</i>

797
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:25,383
<i>" Make me smile
with my heart "</i>

798
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:36,827
<i>" Your looks are laughable "</i>

799
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:44,229
<i>" Unphotographable "</i>

800
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,639
<i>" Yet... "</i>

801
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:51,079
<i>" You're my favorite
work of art... "</i>

802
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,208
Bernie...
are you awake?

803
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,818
I think that...

804
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,830
I love you.

805
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,027
No.

806
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:16,103
I don't think.

807
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,597
I'm pretty sure of it.

808
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,777
You blindsided me,
Bernie Lootz.

809
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,213
I never saw it coming.

810
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,518
You shouldn't do that to a girl.

811
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,894
There's so many things
you don't know,

812
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,761
that you should know.

813
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,201
Oh, fuck,
I don't want to ruin this.

814
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,407
It- it don't matter.

815
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,104
It don't matter
what you come clean about,

816
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:58,238
it's not gonna change
the way I feel about you.

817
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,216
It's not.

818
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,445
Natalie, I...

819
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,852
- I'd say it, but...
- Say it, just say it.

820
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,883
No, with my rotten luck-

821
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:17,389
Don't- fuck rotten luck, Bernie.
That's over.

822
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,100
I love you, Natalie.

823
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:31,806
I really, really love you.

824
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,063
Trixie?

825
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,474
You came back?

826
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,945
<i>" What a day this has been "</i>

827
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,278
<i>" What a rare mood I'm in "</i>

828
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,877
<i>" Why, it's almost like
being in love "</i>

829
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,422
<i>" There's a smile on my face "</i>

830
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:53,019
<i>" For the whole human race "</i>

831
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:58,090
<i>" I would swear
I am falling in love... "</i>

832
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,036
Tell Bernie to go to table six.

833
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,505
<i>" All the music of life
seems to be "</i>

834
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:10,274
<i>" Like a bell
that is ringing for me "</i>

835
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:14,044
<i>" And from the way
that I feel "</i>

836
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,280
<i>" When the bells
start to peal "</i>

837
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,312
<i>" I would swear
I am falling "</i>

838
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,348
<i>" I can swear
that I'm falling "</i>

839
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:29,695
<i>" Well, it's almost like
being in love... "</i>

840
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:41,205
<i>Lovett, party of six,
your table is ready.</i>

841
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,542
Duty calls.

842
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,015
Bye.

843
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,682
Yes!

844
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:11,363
<i>" All the music
of life seems to be "</i>

845
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:18,612
<i>" Like a bell
that is ringing for me "</i>

846
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:22,106
<i>" And from the way
that I feel "</i>

847
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,052
<i>" When the bells
start to peal "</i>

848
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,079
<i>" I would swear
I am falling "</i>

849
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,957
<i>" I can swear
that I'm falling "</i>

850
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:34,895
" Well, it's almost
like being... "

851
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:43,638
<i>" Well, it's almost like
being in love. "</i>

852
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,609
Hey, Shelly, check it out.
The new "Mega Million."

853
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,910
I call her "Marnie."

854
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,974
You know,
'cause she's one frigid broad.

855
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,846
You want to tell me
what's going on out there?

856
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,322
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

857
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:05,088
We're down almost a mil out there.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

858
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,062
I guess I'm having an off day.

859
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,691
No, no, no.
You don't have off days, Lootz.

860
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,361
You're shitty luck incarnate.
What's wrong?

861
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,700
You coming down with something?
You have this look about you.

862
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:19,333
No, no, I'm fine. As a matter of fact,
I've never been better.

863
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,674
- Give it a shot.
- What's that supposed to mean?

864
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:26,341
She loves me, Shelly.
She told me last night. Natalie.

865
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,842
Should I get her flowers
or candy?

866
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,855
What is happening
to you?

867
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,084
I think flowers.

868
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,958
Sweet Jesus!
You popped her cherries!

869
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,519
Shut the fuck up!

870
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:42,326
<i>I'll stay.
Scotch on the rocks.</i>

871
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,890
- Here you go, babe.
- Thanks.

872
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,300
Hi, Tone.

873
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,736
Hi, Shell.

874
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,545
Do you believe
those fucking kids yesterday?

875
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:04,246
Don't worry about them, because
you and I have other problems now.

876
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,653
<i>You have really fucked things up
big time, let me tell you.</i>

877
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,524
I hired you to be
his "cooze" companion,

878
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,393
not the true love
of his fucking life.

879
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,523
But no,

880
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,329
you have to go and get all profound
on the poor schmuck.

881
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,495
"I love you, Bernie."

882
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,997
What the hell were you thinking?
Those four words of endearment

883
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,705
have cost this casino
one million and counting today.

884
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:34,076
I don't understand
what that means.

885
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,015
Lady Luck.

886
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,851
You've heard of "Lady Luck,"
haven't you?

887
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,557
<i>- Yeah.
- That's what's going on out there.</i>

888
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,425
<i>Lootz is Kryptonite
on a stick.</i>

889
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,487
He should have them
throwing ice cubes right now,

890
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,432
but instead I've got
a meltdown on my hands.

891
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:55,733
<i>you are out
of his life, before he even gets home.</i>

892
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,296
Don't even tell him to his face.
Leave him a note.

893
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,537
<i>I'm gonna make some calls and you're
gonna be situated at another joint.</i>

894
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,147
I don't think
I can do that, Shell.

895
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,125
Excuse me?

896
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,252
I said...

897
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,456
I don't think I can do that, Shell.

898
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,432
It wasn't an act.

899
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,594
I meant it.

900
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,331
- You love him?
- Yeah.

901
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,465
I love the schmuck.

902
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,966
What the fuck is there to love?

903
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:39,242
He's a loser.
Always has been, always will be.

904
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,240
I thought you were a smart cookie
when I picked you out.

905
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,281
You do not want
to fuck with me.

906
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,054
Because if you do,
your next john

907
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:54,529
is going to be a fucking rattlesnake
in the fucking desert.

908
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,622
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

909
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,633
Get out of here.

910
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,778
Hey, Natalie.

911
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:02,227
It doesn't matter.

912
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:26,113
<i>Look.
A six-card 21?</i>

913
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,556
<i>Please!</i>

914
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:53,144
<i>" Can I steal a little love? "</i>

915
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:58,620
" Yeah, let me raid
a little love. "

916
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,288
Thank you, thank you.
You guys are too kind.

917
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,559
This next song I'd like to do for you
is dedicated to a friend over there.

918
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,088
Brianna, this one's for you.

919
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,339
I want you to tell me
the truth, Shelly.

920
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,706
Did you say something to Natalie?
Did you muscle her?

921
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,304
Jesus, Bernie. Is that what you think?
That I would fuck with your happiness?

922
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,678
That hurts me.

923
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,017
I don't know.

924
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:38,087
This guy is all flash.
No soul.

925
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,824
I miss Buddy.
It's just not the same around here.

926
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,389
Buddy was tired.

927
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,630
I gave him the easy way out.
Things could have been so much worse.

928
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,106
"Gave him the easy way out"?
What are you talking about? He-

929
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,539
Buddy never would
have taken the buyout.

930
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,605
He would have stuck to his guns
right to the end.

931
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,209
They would have ended up hurting him.
I could not allow that to happen.

932
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,516
Jesus. You-

933
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:09,217
you sit here and you justify it
like you're Dr. Kevorkian or something?

934
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,317
Hey, listen to me.

935
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,351
I loved that son of a bitch,
but his time was up.

936
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,660
What was I supposed to do, leave him
to those corporate fucking scumbags?

937
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:20,135
What I did was a humanitarian thing,
that I have no doubt about.

938
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:25,740
And afterwards I held him in my arms
and I cried like a fucking baby.

939
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,639
What?

940
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:35,082
What is this fucking look
you're giving me now? What is that, huh?

941
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,216
<i>There are the sins of the flesh.</i>

942
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,660
<i>There are the sins
of the gambling halls...</i>

943
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,291
<i>be it dice or in some cases,</i>

944
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,029
<i>"the devil's thumbpapers."</i>

945
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,625
Let's take off tonight.

946
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,999
I can't do that.
I have an obligation to Shelly. He-

947
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,602
Fuck Shelly.

948
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,876
He doesn't give a shit
about you, Bernie.

949
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,353
Let's just climb in your car

950
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,620
and drive
the hell out of here tonight.

951
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,124
I can't do that, Natalie.

952
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,759
He'd come after me,

953
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,269
because you're with me.

954
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,568
I can't have that on me.

955
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,751
Okay.

956
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,096
Winner!

957
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,982
Shelly! Shelly!

958
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,315
You have no fucking right!

959
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:28,813
<i>Shelly, you got
no fucking right!</i>

960
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:33,225
Shelly, I tried.
I couldn't do it.

961
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,992
Shelly- Shelly-

962
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,556
I can't leave, Shell.

963
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,660
Shell, I love him.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

964
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,035
<i>You heartless fuck.</i>

965
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,105
I thought-

966
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,650
Bastard!
I thought he was your friend.

967
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:01,789
Who do you think you are?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

968
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,189
You're nobody!

969
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,194
<i>I could make you
disappear like that</i>

970
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,389
and not one fucking person
would miss you.

971
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,127
- Not one fucking person!
- Bernie would!

972
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,433
He loves me.

973
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,166
He loves me...

974
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:22,438
and that kills you,
doesn't it, Shell?

975
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:26,174
That kills you!
That kills you, doesn't it?

976
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,375
He was your only friend

977
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,908
and you crippled him.

978
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:33,114
You crippled him

979
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:36,454
and he still stood by you,
but no more, Shell.

980
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,450
The only friends you've got now
are the fucking guys on your payroll.

981
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:45,296
You don't own me anymore, Shelly,
and you don't own Bernie.

982
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:49,361
We're leaving here tonight.
I am taking him

983
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,135
and there is not a fucking thing
that you can do about it!

984
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:56,633
- And you will be all alone!
- Is that right?

985
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,924
I love him.

986
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,630
Natalie?

987
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,841
Don't turn the light on.
I got a headache.

988
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,177
Did you take something?
I've got aspirin, I've got-

989
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:42,877
Yeah, I already
took something.

990
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,943
What-?

991
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,354
Oh, shit.

992
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,019
Natalie, what-
what happened to the mirror?

993
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,631
Natalie?

994
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:04,366
No, Bernie, don't.
Oh, shit- Bernie!

995
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,636
Jesus Christ.

996
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,109
Natalie, who did this to you?
We've got to call the police.

997
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:13,513
- I thought, "Easy money."
- What are you talking about?

998
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:15,846
Shelly.

999
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,648
He paid me to get close to you,

1000
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,058
to keep you around.

1001
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,164
Shelly...?

1002
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:43,974
Yeah. Shelly.

1003
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:49,280
You were right that first night.

1004
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,878
I was for sale.

1005
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:58,056
Bought and paid for.

1006
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,755
You were the "easy mark,"
Bernie.

1007
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,897
At first I thought
that you were

1008
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:12,270
just another way to make
a guick buck, you know?

1009
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,645
And then I started
to take a closer look.

1010
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:23,408
And for the first time,

1011
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,887
you were somebody
who wasn't trying to hustle me,

1012
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:31,250
somebody who wasn't trying to pretend
he was someone he wasn't.

1013
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:36,128
Just a decent guy,
trying to get back on track.

1014
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:41,759
And it didn't hurt any
that you put me up on a pedestal.

1015
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:45,705
<i>It sure puts the gutter
in perspective.</i>

1016
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,110
Shelly paid you?

1017
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,409
Shelly wants me gone.

1018
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:02,189
<i>He says I bring you luck.</i>

1019
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,557
<i>"Lady Luck."</i>

1020
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:11,496
I stayed to tell you to your face...

1021
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:15,697
and I knew you wouldn't
want me no more and I could just go.

1022
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,939
We've got to get you to the hospital.
We'll talk about this later.

1023
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:32,003
Tell me again, Bernie.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

1024
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,845
Everything's gonna be fine.

1025
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:38,580
<i>This is our time. This is you and me
and we're going for it.</i>

1026
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,020
Oh, my God.

1027
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:45,759
Hey.

1028
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,491
You look in the mirror, you don't like
what you see, don't believe it.

1029
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,556
Look in my eyes.

1030
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,261
I am the only mirror
you're ever gonna need.

1031
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,066
You look into my eyes,
Natalie.

1032
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,951
Bernie, Bernie, wait, wait.

1033
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,010
Your chart that first night-

1034
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:15,887
I wasn't being straight with you.
It is the worst chart I've ever seen.

1035
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,188
There's nothing in the cards
for you, I'm telling you.

1036
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,195
No, don't you see?
That was before.

1037
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,663
That was before you opened up
your heart to me.

1038
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:27,896
Everything's different now.
I got Lady Luck on my side.

1039
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:30,427
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

1040
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:32,599
Wait.

1041
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,609
Here. Look,
I got $3,000 he paid me.

1042
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:38,077
Maybe Shelly
will take it as a down payment,

1043
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,411
and we can pay in installments,
when we get settled, okay?

1044
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:43,940
- I don't think $3,000-
- Come on, take it, Bernie!

1045
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,393
<i>...street vendors in your face. I walk
up there, I'd want to shoot myself.</i>

1046
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,029
<i>I suppose you'd like
that freak show, huh, Harvard?</i>

1047
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,232
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

1048
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,333
<i>It brings people downtown into
the casino. That is good for business.</i>

1049
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,183
- Oof!
- Hey!

1050
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,880
You lay another finger on her,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

1051
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:23,254
Are you listening to me?
I will fucking kill you.

1052
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,434
Why, Shelly?

1053
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,803
How could you do that
to her?

1054
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,639
Because I never let go
of a good thing, Bernie,

1055
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:45,544
<i>and you are a very, very
good thing.</i>

1056
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,242
The best cooler there ever was
and I need him back.

1057
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,217
He ain't never coming back.

1058
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,709
<i>That is a dead man talking.</i>

1059
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:59,385
Shelly...

1060
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,095
I'm done with this joint,
Natalie and me.

1061
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:07,329
We are out of here.
I'll get a job out in the world.

1062
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:09,563
I'll send you half
my paycheck every month.

1063
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,038
- I'll make good on my commitment.
- Bernie, if you bail on me,

1064
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:14,473
they're gonna throw your fucking ass
off the roof of this building

1065
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:18,172
snatch the broad, and throw her
right the fuck on top of you.

1066
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,815
I don't think so,
'cause if you whack me,

1067
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:27,083
then Bernie Lootz ain't the biggest
loser in the world no more.

1068
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,523
That honor is gonna rest
upon you, Shelly.

1069
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,026
<i>- And maybe you had it all along.
- I'm the loser?</i>

1070
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,529
What do you got,
other than this joint?

1071
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,793
- What more do I need?
- You got nothing.

1072
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:41,563
<i>This place- your legacy,
it's a mirage.</i>

1073
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,730
You turn your back,
it don't even exist.

1074
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:45,898
There's no night,
there's no day,

1075
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,603
it's just one big fucking blur
and it don't count for nothing.

1076
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,737
<i>You believe this fucking guy?</i>

1077
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,906
I feel sorry for you,
Shelly.

1078
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,939
You're the worst kind
of gambler there is,

1079
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,145
too scared to throw
his chips on the table.

1080
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,984
Too scared to extend
any real kind of friendship.

1081
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,718
Always scared he's gonna
end up out in the desert.

1082
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:09,421
Well, sweet fucking dreams, pal.
I'm out.

1083
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,625
If that's where it ends,

1084
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,226
that's where it ends.

1085
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,296
Jesus Christ, that's such a fucking
touching speech, Bernie.

1086
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,330
<i>All that Jimmy Stewart bullshit,</i>

1087
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,276
I got such a lump in my throat,
I can't tell you.

1088
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,474
But it doesn't change a thing.

1089
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:31,577
If you don't make good on my 150 G's,
I'm gonna close the books on you.

1090
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,679
<i>You and the broad.</i>

1091
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,986
<i>You leave me no choice.</i>

1092
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,612
Change only.

1093
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,892
Change.

1094
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,532
$3,000.

1095
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:39,486
Yo, 11, pay the line.

1096
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,791
Winner, seven.

1097
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,338
Six easy. Easy way six.

1098
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,380
<i>Winner. Front line.</i>

1099
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,295
Hey, Shelly,
take a look at number four.

1100
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,275
Winner.

1101
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,776
<i>Okay, folks, we're coming out now.</i>

1102
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,618
<i>Hold bets, curb checks,
C&E is 11.</i>

1103
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,498
<i>Come on, man,
make me some money.</i>

1104
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,565
Winner, seven.

1105
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,036
What the fuck is going on here?
Where have you been?

1106
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,973
- Not now.
- Bullshit. Shut him down right now.

1107
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,374
- Shut him down or I will.
- Not here.

1108
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,674
Come take a walk with me.

1109
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,083
What is your interest in this, Shelly?
Because you know what I see?

1110
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,851
I see your guy taking us to the fucking
cleaners, and I'll tell you one thing.

1111
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,324
He's not leaving here
with a fucking dime.

1112
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:36,169
Now listen to me,
you little Harvard turd.

1113
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,933
Lootz is all right,

1114
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,372
so he's walking out of here
with everything he's got coming to him.

1115
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:44,242
If you so much as touch
one fucking hair on his fucking head,

1116
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:47,577
I'm gonna fucking wallpaper this fucking
bathroom with your fucking ass,

1117
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,743
do you understand me?
Muted tones, isn't that what you said?

1118
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,549
<i>Huh? I can't hear you.</i>

1119
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,783
Wait, wait a minute.
There it is.

1120
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:59,190
Blended in, at a subsonic level,

1121
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,354
like some kind of mantra,

1122
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:04,661
"Pain, pain, pain."

1123
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,533
Please...

1124
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,579
Come on, come on.

1125
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:23,209
Big roll. Big roll, buddy.

1126
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:27,450
<i>Here we go, here we go.</i>

1127
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:36,087
<i>He must be up over 100 grand!</i>

1128
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:43,497
Gray craps, line away.

1129
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,983
<i>Here we go.</i>

1130
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,467
<i>Okay.</i>

1131
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:16,095
<i>Hit it again. Come on.</i>

1132
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,699
<i>Come on now. Come on.</i>

1133
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:26,870
<i>12 craps. Line away. 12 craps.</i>

1134
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:47,734
<i>What the fuck? Not all of it!</i>

1135
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:50,168
$80,000.

1136
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,399
On the field?
Is he fucking crazy?

1137
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,466
Don't do it.

1138
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:27,570
Thank you, God. Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.

1139
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,838
It's all right, right?

1140
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:34,075
You guys worked it out
and he took the money? It's okay, right?

1141
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,939
You want me to get that, Shelly?

1142
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:45,448
Bernie?
Can you tell me what happened?

1143
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:50,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1144
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:01,365
Why- why are we stopping,
Bernie?

1145
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:05,702
I think- I think-
Oh, God damn.

1146
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,433
What the fuck happened
in there?

1147
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:43,639
What? What?

1148
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,942
- What!
- Look. Look.

1149
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:48,380
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1150
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,748
- Natalie, I won. I won.
- Oh, my God!

1151
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,015
- How much!? How much!?
- A lot.

1152
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,420
Bahamas, here we come.

1153
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,153
Step out of the car, please.

1154
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:09,100
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Step out of the car, both of you.

1155
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:23,442
Officer, my driving, it-

1156
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:26,942
I'm sorry if we were driving
a little fast, we're a bit excited.

1157
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:30,423
We won a shitload of money
at the Shangri-La.

1158
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:33,552
You didn't win nothing.

1159
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:41,129
Now both of you, turn around.
Get down on your knees.

1160
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,568
Now.

1161
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:49,042
Jesus Christ, Bern,
Jesus Christ.

1162
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:56,112
The kid just wants
you should know, Shelly,

1163
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:58,618
he's just protecting
our investment...

1164
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,916
<i>...the old-school way.</i>

1165
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:03,253
I'll see you around,
my friend.

1166
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:10,329
I knew it was too good
to be true.

1167
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:14,926
Who were we kidding?

1168
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,581
It's a drunk driver.

1169
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:09,715
This is just-
this is just freaky luck.

1170
01:37:09,757 --> 01:37:11,952
It was freaky accident.

1171
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:35,341
<i>Gentlemen, I want to thank you
for your vote of confidence.</i>

1172
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:37,976
As the new director
of casino operations,

1173
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:41,681
I want to make a personal guarantee
to each and every one of you

1174
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:45,556
that your investment in the Golden
Shangri-La will be well looked after.

1175
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,960
The future looks very bright,
gentlemen.

1176
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:52,727
Very, very bright.
