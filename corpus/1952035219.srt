183
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,827
lt's the first time
l've done something like that.

184
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,398
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.

185
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,353
- l don't usually--
- Neither do l.

186
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:46,052
Well, we should probably--

187
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,185
Yeah?

188
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,133
Order.

189
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,716
Right. Right.

190
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:54,684
lt's a restaurant,
we order,

191
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:55,817
they bring us food.

192
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:56,828
[laughs]

193
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:59,099
Good evening.
Welcome to Myth.

194
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,977
Thanks.

195
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,021
Hey, l always
heard about this place,

196
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,686
but l never knew
it actually existed.

197
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,565
[laughs]

198
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,581
How very clever.

199
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,451
Shall l tell you
our specials?

200
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,156
Uh...

201
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:16,940
l think we'll be fine
without your specials.

202
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:26,383
Great. Now, uh...

203
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,892
he'll spit in our food
and forget our dessert.

204
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,491
[laughs]

205
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,066
Wouldn't be any different
from the last time l ate here.

206
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,411
[laughs]

207
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:43,745
So, tell me...

208
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,698
why did you place
a personal ad?

209
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,941
[chuckles]
The big question.

210
00:13:50,014 --> 00:13:53,792
Well, you just don't seem
like you would need it.

211
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:56,340
[laughs]

212
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,575
Thanks.

213
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,148
There's not really
a big story behind it.

214
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,170
l've only been out here
from Atlanta for four months,

215
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:08,953
and l work long hours
sometimes, which is difficult.

216
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,058
And it's so hard to meet
someone in this town

217
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,581
who's sane, employed,
and geographically desirable.

218
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,176
Tell me about it.

219
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,291
lf l meet one more wanna-be actor
from the Valley, l swear--

220
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,067
[laughs]

221
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,241
Anyway, this woman
l work with

222
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,983
pushed me into
placing the ad.

223
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,556
Kind of a dare, so--

224
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:30,876
She's trying desperately
to become my personal fag hag.

225
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,116
Well, you have to have
one of those in this town,

226
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,933
along with a head shot,
some repressed childhood memories...

227
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,603
[laughs]

228
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,226
So where do you live?

229
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,029
Uh, not too far from here.

230
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:47,640
l'm renting a house
on Ogden, near Melrose.

231
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:50,627
l'm on Sierra Bonita,
near Beverly.

232
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:53,502
That's...what?
Five blocks apart?

233
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,104
l know.

234
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,427
lt must be fate.

235
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,399
Must be.

236
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,463
[Adam]
So...here we are.

237
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,562
The end-of-date
awkward stage.

238
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,704
Yeah, that we all
know so well.

239
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:21,311
[laughs]

240
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,498
How about we skip it?

241
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:25,902
Okay.

242
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:29,317
And move on to, say, this.

243
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,655
Ooh.

244
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,673
Good plan.

245
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,084
When can l see you again?

246
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,757
Busy tomorrow?

247
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,638
l am now.

248
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:03,083
Favorite book?

249
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,151
That's a gimme.

250
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,295
Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy.

251
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:07,605
Favorite movie?

252
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,549
Star Wars,
of course.

253
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,851
Favorite
vacation spot?

254
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:13,835
Hawaii, Maui
to be precise.

255
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,273
Favorite sport?

256
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,278
Tennis.

257
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,013
Federer or Nadal?

258
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:20,620
Nadal. Have you seen
those arms?

259
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:21,690
[laughs]

260
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,224
Favorite way to spend
a Sunday morning?

261
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,592
Sleeping late,

262
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,163
then having brunch
with someone special?

263
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:33,181
Ah. Good answer.

264
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,189
Now l just gotta find
someone special.

265
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:36,628
You got any friends
you can fix me up with?

266
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,001
Ha! Asshole.

267
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:41,606
You don't know me well enough
to call me an asshole.

268
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,320
Well, let me know
when l get there.

269
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,040
By the way,
my dad says hello.

270
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:51,146
Your dad?

271
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:53,495
Yeah, l talked to him
this morning.

272
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:54,558
He's pretty much
my best friend,

273
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:56,303
so l had to call him
first thing

274
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,781
and tell him
all about our date.

275
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,258
Oh.

276
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:03,093
You always
tell him everything?

277
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,643
[chuckles]

278
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,047
Everything.

279
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,858
l'll keep that in mind.

280
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:11,668
So how long have you
been into fundraising?

281
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,302
Six years.

282
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,376
l'm with the Gay
and Lesbian Center now,

283
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:18,399
but l've worked mostly with
Democratic candidates.

284
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:22,775
So...

285
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,792
what are you doing
this afternoon?

286
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:32,752
[cell phone rings]

287
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:33,817
Hello?

288
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:37,366
l'm in his house.

289
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,351
They ad guy's?

290
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,764
Yes, the ad guy. Adam.

291
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,499
Been there all night?

292
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:45,944
[Andrew]
Uh-uh!

293
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,680
l'm not a slut.

294
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:48,884
We had dinner last night

295
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,727
and then met again
for brunch today.

296
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,798
How's his place?

297
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:53,902
Really nice.

298
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:55,850
And you'll
never believe it.

299
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,255
lt's in my neighborhood.

300
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,525
Walking distance.

301
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,070
[Andrew]
Check the CDs!

302
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:02,911
Andrew says
to check the CDs.

303
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,532
No Mariah.

304
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,514
No Cher.

305
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,427
No Judy.

306
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:17,601
A diva-free zone.
Good.

307
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:20,747
Lots of Madonna,

308
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:23,128
but...we love Madonna.

309
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,640
The gays and Madonna.
l don't get it.

310
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,479
You wouldn't.

311
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:28,920
[Andrew]
Show tunes?

312
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,826
Any show tunes?

313
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:32,565
Minimal.

314
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:36,279
Nice classical
selection.

315
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,516
Oh, yes!

316
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,756
What?

317
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,799
He's got that
Nine lnch Nails bootleg

318
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,602
l've been searching
eBay for.

319
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,745
There you go.
You must marry him now.

320
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:47,663
Gotta go.

321
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:57,638
Did l say you were done?

322
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:05,160
Sorry about that.

323
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:06,367
lt's okay.

324
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,475
lt gave me time to snoop
in your drawers.

325
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:11,154
Mmm.
Sounds like fun.

326
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,604
Today's been really...

327
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,982
Yeah?

328
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,547
Great.

329
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,657
l had a great time.

330
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:23,142
So did l.

331
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:26,053
But...

332
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,901
before we see
each other again,

333
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,004
there's something
l need to tell you.

334
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,066
Something that you may think
is important to know.

335
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,768
lt can't be that bad.
Tell me.

336
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:50,053
lf he had something
that...big,

337
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:54,093
that important
to share, then...

338
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,305
He should have
put it in the ad.

339
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,913
How big?

340
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,088
ls he positive?

341
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:03,198
No.
That l could handle.

342
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,907
lt's worse.

343
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,580
Worse?

344
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:09,358
Does he have syphilis?

345
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,599
Hepatitis?

346
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,086
Testicular cancer?

347
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:20,980
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

348
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:22,715
ls he bald?

349
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:25,523
Worse.

350
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,801
He's...

351
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:30,988
He's...

352
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:33,354
[groans]

353
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,930
He's a Republican.

354
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,672
l am so glad that
l did not call him.

355
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,896
Maybe he was lured to it
during college.

356
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,603
Or maybe it's just a phase,

357
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,459
or a ploy to piss off
his purified parents.

358
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,235
l always told myself
l could never be with two types of men:

359
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:02,373
Republicans
and crack addicts.

360
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,084
Maybe he's one of those, um...

361
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,000
''bring the party down from the inside''
kind of Republicans.

362
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,448
l mean, he's not a sign-carrying
fundamentalist abortion clinic bomber.

363
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:11,452
[laughs]

364
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,719
ls he?

365
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,566
He's Republican,
he's not insane.

366
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,410
l'm sure you can
work things out.

367
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,422
Oh, have you fucked him yet?

368
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,898
Not that it's any
of your business,

369
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,372
but no.

370
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,411
l've only
seen him twice.

371
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:26,413
Whatever.

372
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:27,715
[Woman]
Eli!

373
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,658
Does he seem interested?

374
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,098
Definitely.

375
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,195
How can you tell?

376
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,438
Oh, l can tell.

377
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:34,446
[Woman]
Eli!

378
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,615
Anything worth
writing home about?

379
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,825
That's for me to know
and you to be jealous of.

380
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,429
Come on. How big?

381
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:44,151
[Woman]
Mail that!

382
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,200
Not...quite that big?

383
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,217
And for this,
l got an MBA.

384
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,436
Are you bothered by
what l told you?

385
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:59,643
About being a Republican?

386
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,750
No.

387
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:04,963
Yes. l'm sorry.
But how on Earth--

388
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,076
l've heard all
the arguments before.

389
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:10,425
My political choices
are based on economics,

390
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,830
not social issues.

391
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:12,768
But they're
the same thing!

392
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,832
l know,
but they also--

393
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,747
They do not,
and you know it.

394
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,554
[both laugh]

395
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,011
l guess my ad
should have read

396
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:26,083
''Shy, romantic,
and politically conservative.''

397
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,729
Damn right.

398
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,482
Your confession
actually made me think.

399
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:36,223
l don't even think l knew
the political affiliation

400
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,303
of the last, l don't know,
10 guys l dated.

401
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:42,153
What's wrong with that?

402
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:47,681
l think l learned
more about you in two dates

403
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:52,965
than l learned about most guys
l've gone out with...ever.

404
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,458
l'm not exactly...

405
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,025
proud of my history.

406
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,582
ln the past, l usually...

407
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:09,467
jumped into bed with someone
before even learning their last name.

408
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,740
Harris.

409
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:13,548
Huh?

410
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:15,116
My last name.

411
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,602
l remember.

412
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,712
l really like you, Adam.

413
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:27,942
So...l don't want
to rush into anything.

414
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,420
By anything, you mean...

415
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,590
Sex.

416
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:37,612
l mean, that's all
our people seem to do.

417
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:39,819
At least according
to the Republicans.

418
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,425
[laughs]

419
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:43,373
Shut up, stupid.

420
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,861
l want us to get
to know each other...

421
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:51,467
really, really well.

422
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,882
l understand.

423
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:56,555
There's more
to a relationship than sex.

424
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah, exactly.

425
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:01,079
l mean, not that sex
isn't important, but...

426
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,648
friendship,
compatibility.

427
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:05,963
Those are more important...

428
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:07,838
or so the story goes.

429
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,885
[laughs]

430
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,398
Can l still do this?

431
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,739
l think that's allowed.

432
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,132
When do we get to meet
the ad guy?

433
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,798
Don't call him
the ad guy.

434
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,902
His name's Adam.

435
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,474
Right. When do we get
to meet Adam...

436
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:44,183
the ad guy?

437
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,758
Not gonna happen if you
keep calling him the ad guy.

438
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,809
His name even
has ''ad'' in it.

439
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,784
He'll always be the ad guy,
and you know it.

440
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,324
So when do we get
to meet him?

441
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:53,454
Hmm, let's see.

442
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,556
Never.

443
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:56,837
That's it.
Give me his number.

444
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,781
l'm inviting him
to brunch on Sunday.

445
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:00,826
And subject him
to everyone's scrutiny at once?

446
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:01,864
Don't think so.

447
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,300
We'll be on our
best behavior.

448
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,276
Scout's honor.

449
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,181
Really, l was Boy Scout.

450
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:10,465
Last Halloween.

451
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,800
l looked damn good
in that uniform.

452
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,846
Yeah, after you cut
the crotch out.

453
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,580
That did help.

454
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:17,890
This conversation
is not helping your case.

455
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:20,132
Right.
Adam's a Republican.

456
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,975
Are we too
flamboyant for him?

457
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:24,579
You know, l don't have to wear
my chaps to brunch, if that'll help.

458
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,064
Maybe we shouldn't discuss
the government's AlDS policies.

459
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,161
Or the gay marriage issue.

460
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,676
- Rick Santorum.
- Jeff Gannon.

461
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:30,807
- Mary Chaney.
- Pat Robertson.

462
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:32,617
Okay, okay,
you win.

463
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,722
Sunday brunch.

464
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,235
But be nice.

465
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:37,801
Us?

466
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,353
Always.

467
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,984
[groans]

468
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,760
So...what do you do
for a living?

469
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:01,832
Oh, l'm an architect.

470
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,313
Done any buildings
l've seen?

471
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:08,059
Don't know.
What buildings have you seen?

472
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,703
There's that
really tall one.

473
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,557
- So, Vince, tell me--
- [gasps]

474
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:18,942
Vincent.

475
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,451
Huh?

476
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,790
lt's Vincent,
not Vince.

477
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:28,842
lf you value your life,
don't call him Vinnie.

478
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,567
And you?
Where do you work?

479
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,116
l'm a musician.

480
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:38,181
Oh, that's cool.
Are you in a band?

481
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,524
He's a drummer.

482
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,404
The kind my daddy
always warned me about.

483
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,713
Excellent. How long have
you two been married?

484
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,885
For seven years
next month.

485
00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:49,905
Any kids?

486
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,106
No.

487
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:55,752
So...

488
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,993
Yes.

489
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:59,705
Glenn tell us
you like Bush.

490
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,769
Oh, hey.
Ha ha.

491
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,249
We didn't scare you
too much,, did we?

492
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:18,687
Uh, not at all.

493
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,058
[laughs]

494
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:22,800
We're just happy that
Glenn has found someone.

495
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,442
He's a truly wonderful
human being.

496
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,716
l hope you know that.

497
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,796
Well, he's said
the same about you.

498
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:34,582
Flattery will get you
almost everywhere with me.

499
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,896
Chocolate gets you
the rest of the way.

500
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:43,253
Maybe you and Glenn
and me and Andrew,

501
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:45,699
we could all go out
together sometime.

502
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,936
You know, avoid
the singles crowd.

503
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:51,185
Um...sure.
That'd be great.

504
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:53,790
Uh, nothing against
Vincent,

505
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:56,368
and Eli's
a sweetheart,

506
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:58,111
but it would be nice
to hang out with Glenn

507
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:01,528
without his tagg-alongsome...
tagging along.

508
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,471
Know what l mean?

509
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,778
[laughs]
Let's go.

510
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,656
Do you think your
friends like me?

511
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,437
Of course.
Why do you ask?

512
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:21,812
l don't know.

513
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,553
Vincent seems a little
cold sometimes.

514
00:28:26,268 --> 00:28:28,138
He's just jealous.

515
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,513
Maybe.

516
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,392
l just want us
all to be friends.

517
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:37,036
Don't worry.
They love you.

518
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:38,846
Just like...

519
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,390
Um...

520
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:42,021
So who won the game?

521
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,146
Uh, the team with
the cute quarterback

522
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:50,563
beat the one with that guy
from the cell phone commercials.

523
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:53,007
God, you're so butch.

524
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:56,319
That's probably what all your friends
say about me when you're not around.

525
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:59,700
l doubt any of them
give as much thought.

526
00:28:59,771 --> 00:28:59,904
They still
haven't fucked?

527
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,106
They still
haven't fucked?

528
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,482
That's what Glenn said,

529
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:06,052
and l hear him whacking off
in his room after every date.

530
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:07,968
Listen much?

531
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,921
lt'll never last.

532
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,606
l really think
this is gonna work out.

533
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,146
Right here?

534
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:24,098
No. l'm talking about
Glenn's relationship with Adam.

535
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:25,232
Oh, yeah, right.

536
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,341
No, he seems cool.

537
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,119
That's all you have to say?

538
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:31,028
Well, l'd do him.

539
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,947
l want Glenn to be happy,

540
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:37,286
and l don't he has been
for a really long time.

541
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,059
You want him
to be married,

542
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:41,164
just like you do
all our single friends.

543
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,306
There's nothing
wrong with that.

544
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:46,087
People are happier
in couples.

545
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,896
Look at us.

546
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:51,672
l'm sorry.
What'd you say?

547
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,055
l said l don't
trust this guy.

548
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,264
l mean, who uses a personal ad
in this day and age?

549
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,904
You were gonna call it.

550
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,143
That's different.

551
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:01,747
l just wanted
a blow job.

552
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,856
Glenn's not even
getting that.

553
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,510
Yeah, l know.

554
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:09,820
All l'm saying is that
you don't use a personal ad

555
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,124
for a real
relationship.

556
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:13,194
lt's so...

557
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,342
Uh, straight?

558
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,255
Exactly.

559
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:19,957
They seem happy to me.

560
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,734
Of course
they seem happy.

561
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:23,176
They are happy.

562
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:25,984
And l'm proud of them
for not having had sex yet.

563
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,595
You said that...many times.

564
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:32,879
Many, many times.

565
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:35,829
We should throw
a dinner party for them.

566
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:38,877
lnvite the Tates,
the Waldons,

567
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:40,074
and that lesbian couple.

568
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,981
What's their name again?

569
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,996
Something...
hyphenated?

570
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:47,807
l wonder if they
all eat meat.

571
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,249
We know Glenn does.

572
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,301
[knock on door]

573
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,464
[laughs]

574
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:07,021
Aw.

575
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,636
They're beautiful.

576
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:14,921
What happened?
Florist didn't have a complete dozen?

577
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:16,657
[laughs]

578
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:20,201
Happy one month anniversary.

579
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,048
Huh.

580
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,990
And l thought the traditional
one month gift

581
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:26,265
was a subscription
to Entertainment Weekly.

582
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,467
[laughs]

583
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:29,813
You wish.

584
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:35,602
Ahem. The florist was telling me
about the significance of roses.

585
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:41,193
You see, yellow roses
signify friendship, and--

586
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,575
Wait. So...
we're friends?

587
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:48,253
Well, mostly....so far.

588
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:52,937
But red roses,
they symbolize passion....

589
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,685
or...love.

590
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:03,317
l think there's some
passion in here.

591
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:10,450
l think l haven't stopped
thinking about you for the past month,

592
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:13,121
especially when
we're apart.

593
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:26,975
l brought something else.

594
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:32,708
l was thinking
l could spend the night.

595
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:36,382
lt has been a month.

596
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:41,710
l think it's a record
for not fucking in this town.

597
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,527
Which way to the bedroom?

598
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,614
Uh...

599
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,153
down the hall,
first door on the right.

600
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,923
Big bed.
You can't miss it.

601
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,317
Do you need some
alone time?

602
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:01,793
Shall l join you?

603
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:21,400
That was...

604
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,073
Yeah?

605
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,141
Really...

606
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,251
Yeah?

607
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,431
Awful.

608
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,144
[groans]
lt was, wasn't it?

609
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,556
What happened?

610
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,360
l have no idea.

611
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,600
Oh.

612
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,083
l think my nipple's
bleeding.

613
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,555
Oh, sorry.

614
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,930
What were you doing
with your hand?

615
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,599
Well, l was trying to...

616
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:48,413
you know, and then
l wanted to...

617
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,752
lt was supposed to...

618
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:51,934
[laughs]

619
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,667
l saw it in
a Jeff Stryker video.

620
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,212
lt looked good
when he did it.

621
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,947
l'm sure it did.

622
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,755
lt's still in the VCR.
You wanna see?

623
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,992
That's okay.

624
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,681
You wanna...try again?

625
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,190
Oh, God no.

626
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:12,448
l'm just tired.

627
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,150
Let's get some sleep.

628
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:23,520
lt was one of the three worst
sexual experiences l've ever had.

629
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:25,799
No. l'd say it's in
the top two.

630
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:27,435
Scale of 1 to 10.

631
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:28,379
One.

632
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,687
at best.
Ouch.

633
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,666
[Woman]
Eli, get in here!

634
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:35,107
Just a minute!

635
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:37,585
Bitch won't give me
a minute's peace today.

636
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:39,057
Tell me,
it couldn't have been that bad.

637
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,929
Remember when we first met?

638
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,633
You know, and we tried to...

639
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,876
[gasps]
That was bad.

640
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,756
And that's how we knew we were
destined to just be friends.

641
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:50,271
But l don't want
to be friends with this guy.

642
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,742
He's special.

643
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:53,545
l'll try not to take
that personally.

644
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:54,590
[Woman]
Eli!

645
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,753
Have you talked to him
since then?

646
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,704
No. l don't know
what to say.

647
00:34:58,774 --> 00:35:01,843
l really like this guy,
but, man, it was bad.

648
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,357
Well, don't get
discouraged.

649
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:05,560
l'm sure it's just, um...

650
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,808
Oh, well, whatever
the opposite of beginner's luck is.

651
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,083
That would be my luck.

652
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:12,390
[groans]

653
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:13,958
Thanks for listening.
l gotta run.

654
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:15,737
Anytime.

655
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:23,531
[Woman]
Peel it!

656
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:45,692
Hey, watch where you're
going, asshole.

657
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,616
Do you know me well enough
to call me an asshole?

658
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:54,030
lf l've actually
seen your asshole,

659
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:56,075
then l can call you
an asshole.

660
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,898
Think you ever want to,
you know,

661
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:05,469
see it again, after...

662
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:09,255
Let's not discuss this
in the romantic-comedy section.

663
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:12,868
But we can...
discuss it, right?

664
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:15,750
Why?

665
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,625
Well, you were there.

666
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:20,869
Do you want to
go through that again?

667
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,224
Well, l have heard

668
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:30,009
that most peoples' first
experiences are bad.

669
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,142
Too much expectation and all.

670
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:34,197
My thinking exactly.

671
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,033
Next time will be different.

672
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:37,543
Definitely.

673
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:38,842
l can bring my whip.

674
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,297
Oh, you're home.

675
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:18,605
Great.

676
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,209
What are you--

677
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,888
Glenn, this is, uh--
What's your name again?

678
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:25,669
Preston.
My name's Preston.

679
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,184
This is my roommate Glenn
and this is his--

680
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:31,961
his ad...am.

681
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:34,705
So nice
to meet you, Glenn,

682
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,878
and you, too, Adam.

683
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,454
Don't get too close.
He's a Republican!

684
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:40,467
[chuckles]

685
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:43,068
[both laugh]

686
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:47,588
And this is the way
to my bedroom.

687
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,731
See you again soon.

688
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:58,770
Speaking of bedrooms...

689
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:07,110
[Glenn]
Ouch! Teeth!

690
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,308
[Adam]
Sorry.

691
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:13,567
[Vincent moaning]

692
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:14,801
Oh, come on, baby.

693
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,610
[Glenn]
Just ignore it.

694
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:19,526
Come on, baby.
That's it.

695
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,362
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it!

696
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,536
That's it!

697
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:31,977
lt sounds like
a public park restroom in here.

698
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:33,348
Yeah.

699
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,759
Let's see if we
can outdo 'em.

700
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,449
Oh! Oh, yeah!

701
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,287
[moaning]
Oh, yeah!

702
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,695
Yeah, baby!
Fuck my hole!

703
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:45,699
Yeah, fuck my hole!

704
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,303
[moaning]

705
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,567
l cannot compete with that.

706
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,306
lf l wanted to hear
guys screaming like that,

707
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,441
l'd go to the gym.

708
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,544
Rain check?

709
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,987
Sure.
Oh, yeah!

710
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,323
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!

711
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:09,832
Oh, yeah!
Fuck my hole!

712
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,066
Oh, God, yeah!
Fuck my hole!

713
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,517
[moaning]

714
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,369
Better hurry up! the Doctor Who
marathon starts in five minutes.

715
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:32,588
A little dressed up
for the Sci-Fi channel.

716
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,941
What? ls that--
ls that tonight?

717
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:43,170
Sorry. l'm going
to a concert with Adam.

718
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:45,476
Oh. Of course you are.

719
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:54,478
Why don't you call up
that Preston guy?

720
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:57,999
lt sounded like
you two got along.

721
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:59,297
Nah.

722
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:02,681
He seemed a little used.

723
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,052
You know what l mean?

724
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:14,596
Dick.

725
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,125
Heh.

726
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:33,665
l thought l was
the conservative one.

727
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:38,321
We are going to see
Andrew's band tonight, aren't we?

728
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,599
That we are.

729
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:43,675
lt's someplace
downtown, right?

730
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:47,599
Am l dressed okay?

731
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,906
You look perfect.
Let's go.

[giggling]

734
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:17,288
Nice outfit,
by the way.

735
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:18,589
l could see
that fake tattoo

736
00:41:18,662 --> 00:41:19,927
all the way from
the percussion section.

737
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,370
Hey.

738
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,614
l thought it brought
a nice youthful air

739
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:27,288
to the usual
Philharmonic crowd.

740
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,801
[Glenn]
Yeah, exactly.

741
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,308
Complemented
the blue blood

742
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:33,652
and blue hair
just perfectly.

743
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:36,725
You two look so
perfect together.

744
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:37,738
[Andrew]
Yeah, it's about time.

745
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,511
We are so tired
of fixing Glenn up.

746
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,887
How come that never
worked out?

747
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:46,537
Because you were never
looking in the personals.

748
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,706
How often
did you fix him up?

749
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:49,447
- Not that often.
- Hardly ever.

750
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,016
All the time.

751
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:53,698
Yeah, there was the cellist
from the orchestra.

752
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:56,305
Uh, my personal trainer.

753
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,117
Uh, Mary Margaret's
second cousin.

754
00:41:58,189 --> 00:41:59,125
What was
his name again?

755
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,187
Stuart.

756
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:01,635
That's right.
Yeah.

757
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,301
Why didn't
that work out?

758
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,878
Because his name
was Stuart,

759
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,952
and he was more interested
in poppers than in me.

760
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:09,867
Oh, l love poppers.

761
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:12,243
l do.

and the cheese?

- What?
- [laughs]

766
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:25,333

that he's straight.

768
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,918
l wanna feel your skin
on my every limb

769
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,664
But would you think
of me then?

770

and change all mine, too

When l'm through
with your annoying ways

777
00:43:14,437 --> 00:43:17,175
And your foolish games

778

in the palm of my hand

think of me then?

l wanna be bad

793
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:03,059
l wanna make you look
in the mirror twice

you're not gonna win

go and try it

through my demands

802

You'll be all mine

805
00:44:32,622 --> 00:44:42,757

not even through

Feel like a movie today?

810

Maybe,
but l get to pick.

811

Oh, you're such
a movie snob.

817
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:34,500
Hello?

818
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:35,911
Hey, buddy.

819
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:37,614
Rex, what's up?

820
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:38,852
Me.

821
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:39,727
l want to come over,

822
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:42,034
get the day
started right.

823
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,270

l'm busy.

824

825
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:48,427
Are you still with
that same guy?

826
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,369
How about a third?

827
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,318
Some other time.

828
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:56,386
Right on.

829
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:57,938
Some other time, man.

830
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,935
Who was that?

831
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,306
No one important.

832
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:14,966
Oh. Heh.
Hey.

833
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,342
Hey.

834
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:21,997
Who's that?

835
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,336
Bad sweater guy.

836
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:24,607
Yeah.
Been there, done him.

837
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:28,024
He likes to be spanked
while he calls you Mommy.

838
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,195
l should call him again.

839
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,708
You have to help me
come up with ideas

840
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:33,010
on what to get
Adam for Christmas.

841
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,074
Oh, okay.

842
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:35,386
Well, l hear
the Ronald Reagan dildo

843
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,793
is very popular this year.

844
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:37,892
He fucked you
in the '80s.

845
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,065
Now let him
do it for real.

846
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,772
He already has one.

847
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,620
Seriously?

848
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,337
Hey, so what are your plans
for Christmas this year?

849
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:52,086
l plan on reminding everyone
once again that l'm Jewish.

850
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:55,965
Sorry. Brain lapse.

851
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:58,313
Yeah, you'd think with a name
like Eli Rosenberg

852
00:46:58,386 --> 00:46:59,378
you'd remember.

853
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:00,722
Well, hey, what are your plans
for Hanukkah?

854
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,929
The Hanukkah
that was last week?

855
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:05,606
Yeah, that one.

856
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:06,879
The usual, you know.

857
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:09,624
Kugel and brisket
over at my Aunt Flo's.

858
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,466
How is Aunt Flo?
Oh, great.

859
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:13,480
Wish l got to see her
more than once a month.

860
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:15,522
You know,
''once a month.''

861
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:23,851
Maybe you should get Adam
a healthy dose of honesty for Christmas.

862
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:25,122
Meaning what?

863
00:47:25,196 --> 00:47:27,193
Well, meaning that you
should really think about

864
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,042
whether you two
want to keep this going.

865
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:31,144
Think about it.

866
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:32,715
Being gay means being
defined by sex--

867
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:34,824
how we have sex
and who we have it with.

868
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:35,893
lt's what makes us different

869
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:37,069
from the millions
of breeders out there

870
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:41,595
buying dancing Santas
and fruitcake.

871
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:43,225
That, and taste.
Yeah, okay.

872
00:47:43,303 --> 00:47:46,178
But, you know, do you really
want to stay with someone

873
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,694
who doesn't put
the wind in your sails?

874
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:52,740
Well, in five years the sex
will pretty much be gone anyway,

875
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:53,744
so why not?

876
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:54,748
Why not be with someone

877
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:58,993
who meets all
of my other needs?

878
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,438
l'm just worried about you.

879
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:02,344
l want you to be happy.

880
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:03,544
Normally l'd tell you
to get laid,

881
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,286
but that's obviously
not working.

882
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,631
Fuck you.
You had your chance.

883
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:08,798
So does this mean
l should take back

884
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,174
the dancing Santa
l bought you?

885
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,888
Seriously?

886
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:33,604
So, did that guy finally come
to his senses and kick you out?

887
00:48:36,152 --> 00:48:39,325
He had to leave early
for a meeting.

888
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:43,108
So l just thought
l'd go over there later for dinner,

889
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,949
so l was going to come home

890
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:49,632
and get ready for work.

891
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:51,009
Nice surprise.

892
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,774
Well, then,
l should, uh...

893
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,622
get ready.

894
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:05,136
Do you want me
to pour you a bowl

895
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:07,476
and we can talk or whatever?

896
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:11,827
Um...

897
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:14,878
Sorry, l should go.

to deliver your pizza, sir.

00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,716
l told you l'm allergic
to that stupid wreath,

906
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:17,756
so don't complain
if l'm sneezing all night long.

907
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:18,931
Or you could distract me

908
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,878
by opening up
my Christmas package.

909
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:22,945
[record scratch]

910
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:25,363
[chuckles]

911
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:26,699
You're early.

912
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:29,613
And you're not alone.
Nope.

913
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:33,153
Glenn, this is my father,
William Harris.

914
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:37,181
Dad, this is Glenn.

915
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:41,391
Well, it is nice
to meet you...Glenn.

916
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:45,546
l've heard so much
about you.

917
00:50:45,616 --> 00:50:46,984
Here. Go ahead.
Let me have this.

918
00:50:47,054 --> 00:50:48,926
Mom, get in here.

919
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:53,882
Oh!

920
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:01,773
l have been waiting
for months to meet you.

921
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:03,879
Okay, let's take
a good look.

922
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,154
Turn around.

923
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:10,444
Cute. Cute. Cute.

924
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:15,560
Oh, nice ass.
You've done good, honey.

925
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:18,879
And as for you,
you done really good.

926
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:21,953
Now get in the kitchen
and help me with dinner.

927
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,161
Excuse us.

928
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:27,381
No, no, no.
Eat something.

929
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,695
No, l was actually at the '68
Democratic Convention and got maced.

930
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:32,742
[all laughing]

931
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:34,840
[William]
And, no, we don't understand

932
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:36,012
the Republican thing either.

933
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:37,995
Oh, he gets that
from your side of the family.

934
00:51:38,064 --> 00:51:40,563
Well, it must have
skipped a generation.

935
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:45,054
Tell me something, Glenn.

936
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,758
How long have you been gay?

937
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:47,825
Mom!

938
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,741
Oh, don't be shy, dear.

939
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:52,254
Adam came out to us
his senior year in high school,

940
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:55,769
but l knew
a long time before that.

941
00:51:55,837 --> 00:51:59,785
l think l even knew
before you did, right, sweetie?

942
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:03,128
l've never seen
this woman before in my life.

943
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,231
He used to take pictures
for his high school yearbook

944
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:06,540
of all the sporting events.

945
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:08,919
Guess what his favorite was.

946
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,300
The wrestling team.

947
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:14,607
l don't think he knew
what it even meant at the time,

948
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,053
but l knew.

949
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:19,428
Oh, oh! And you never
answered my question.

950
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:21,098
Me?
Of course, you.

951
00:52:21,174 --> 00:52:23,649
Who else am l talking to?

952
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:27,496
Well, l came out at 21,
if that's what you mean.

953
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:30,271
Late bloomer.
Yeah.

954
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:31,679
Well, that's okay.

955
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,417
You got plenty of time
to make up for it,

956
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:37,769
especially now that
you've met our Adam.

957
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:40,375
l'd try to stop her,
but it wouldn't do any good.

958
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,688
l see.
[laughing]

959
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,241
Well, l hope that
my meeting Adam

960
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,409
is the first of many
wonderful things

961
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:49,512
to happen in my life.

962
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:53,058
[Mom] Oh!
Such a good answer.

963
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:54,266
[sighs]

964
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:56,078
l like you.
You're a keeper.

965
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,718
Thank you.

966
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:02,834
Um, but l should...
probably get home.

967
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,314
lt's getting late.

968
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:06,517
You're not staying here?

969
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:07,963
Uh...

970
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,607
No, no, no, no.
lt's okay, guys.

971
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,921
We understand what happens
with you young people nowadays.

972
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:16,226
Oh, honey.

973
00:53:16,299 --> 00:53:18,500
lt even happens with us old people
sometimes, eh, Bill?

974
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:19,945
[Adam groans]

975
00:53:20,015 --> 00:53:21,715
l'm glad
we've already eaten.

976
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:25,329
Well, then it's settled.
You're staying.

977
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:28,176
lf you insist.
Great!

978
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,879
Now be a good boy
and clean your plate.

979
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:30,857
Yes, ma'am.

980
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:38,551
You could have
warned me.

981
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:41,727
Remember the Philharmonic
incident?

982
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,302
Payback.

983
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:46,913
Oh, l'll show you payback.

984
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,932
[chuckles]

985
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,197
[laughing]

986
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:53,306
[dance music playing]

987
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:09,141
[Glenn sighs]

988
00:54:46,168 --> 00:54:47,263
Headache?

989
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,467
Jesus.

990
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:51,953
Sorry, l thought
everyone was asleep.

991
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,592
Well, l did, too.

992
00:54:57,715 --> 00:54:59,916
Oh, oh.
Don't tell Diane.

993
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,089
She thinks l quit.

994
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,608
Um, your secret
is safe with me.

995
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,741
Eh.

996
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:08,255
No, no, no, no.
Don't go.

997
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:13,437
l'm glad we've got
this moment alone.

998
00:55:13,512 --> 00:55:18,899
You know, Adam's been talking
about you non-stop for months.

999
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:23,247
We weren't actually going
to come out here for a visit this year.

1000
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,696
Diane had to meet you.

1001
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,068
Glad she did.

1002
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,687
Thank you, sir.
That's...

1003
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:33,956
nice of you to say.

1004
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:35,467
And if you don't mind
me saying so,

1005
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:38,033
you shouldn't worry
about the sex.

1006
00:55:38,113 --> 00:55:42,027
You and Adam really do
talk about everything.

1007
00:55:42,096 --> 00:55:45,040
Don't be embarrassed.

1008
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:48,850
l'm naked and talking to my
boyfriend's father about our sex life.

1009
00:55:48,923 --> 00:55:51,628
What's to be
embarrassed about?

1010
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:53,003
Sit down.

1011
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:58,588
You know, Diane and l,

1012
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,637
we never slept together
before we got married.

1013
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:03,443
lt wasn't the thing
to do back then...

1014
00:56:03,517 --> 00:56:05,959
not with her, at least.

1015
00:56:06,026 --> 00:56:08,469
And our honeymoon night?

1016
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:13,821
Not the stuff
of fond memories.

1017
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:17,670
For the longest time, sex was something
that we did out of habit

1018
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,048
for the most part.

1019
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:25,597
Diane, well,
she was so uptight back then.

1020
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,375
That's hard to believe.

1021
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:30,517
She seems so...
free-spirited.

1022
00:56:30,594 --> 00:56:33,732
Oh, yeah.
Sure. That's now.

1023
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:36,249
l mean, once we both
kind of loosened up

1024
00:56:36,317 --> 00:56:39,262
and explored
different things,

1025
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,606
it was great.

1026
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:44,309
lt was really great.

1027
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:50,231
You think Adam and l
will work things out?

1028
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:54,760
Well, kids today want everything
immediately, right?

1029
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,828
lnstant gratification
and all that kind of stuff.

1030
00:56:57,907 --> 00:57:00,783
You know,
your generation could learn

1031
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,327
a lot about creating
long-term relationships

1032
00:57:03,395 --> 00:57:07,469
by looking at us old folks.

1033
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:11,723
Nothing is perfect.

1034
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:13,998
l don't know.

1035
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:18,922
Sometimes it is.
Perfect, l mean.

1036
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:21,868
Good.
Welcome to the family.

1037
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:23,936
And if you don't mind,
l think l'll leave first.

1038
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:26,581
l've seen plenty
of you tonight.

1039

[ringing]

1047
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:46,543
[Glenn] Hey, babe.
l have to work late tonight.

1048
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:48,957
Sorry. We're going
to have to cancel dinner.

1049
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:50,294
l know you're busy
tomorrow night,

1050
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,865
so let's hook up again
on Friday.

1051
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:54,814
Call me.
This is Glenn.

1052
00:58:57,763 --> 00:58:58,961
[Adam] lt's me.

1053
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,374
lt's about 2:00
on Friday afternoon.

1054
00:59:01,444 --> 00:59:02,815
l've got bad news.

1055
00:59:02,885 --> 00:59:05,326
The Miller presentation
was moved up to Monday.

1056
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:07,666
l have to work tonight
and all weekend to get ready.

1057
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:10,374
God, l miss you.
Call me.

1058
00:59:12,222 --> 00:59:14,220
[Glenn, on speaker]
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

1059
00:59:14,298 --> 00:59:17,002
My meeting got changed
to tonight and no one told me

1060
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:20,648
so l won't be home
till really late.

1061
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,716
[sighs]

1062
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:24,967
l'll just call you tomorrow.

1063
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,678
[Adam, on speaker]
This is Adam. Remember me?

1064
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:29,088
Got your message.

1065
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:30,755
l'm booked tonight.

1066
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:33,468
My cousin's in town
and l have to meet her for dinner.

1067
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:35,141
But mark me down
for tomorrow night.

1068
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:36,712
l have two tickets
to a big party

1069
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,626
and l want you to go.

1070
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:41,538
No, l'm not going to go.

1071
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:44,485
Music, dancing,
open bar.

1072
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:45,489
Me.

1073
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:47,087
What more could you want?

1074
00:59:47,165 --> 00:59:50,806
l need for it not to be
a Log Cabin Republicans mixer.

1075
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:53,185
l'm not asking you
to give them any money.

1076
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,733
Just come with me
and enjoy yourself.

1077
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,536
l have tried
to bite my tongue,

1078
00:59:57,608 --> 00:59:59,376
but how can you
support that group?

1079
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:00,888
You might as well join
the Aryan Nation.

1080
01:00:00,956 --> 01:00:02,221
You know, if anyone
at my work found out,

1081
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,264
l'd be crucified.

1082
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:05,396
Hey, l went to
your work fundraiser.

1083
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:06,946
What?

1084
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:08,245
That is so different!

1085
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,088
That was for people
who support gay rights.

1086
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:11,826
They don't want to tell me
l'd be better off dead.

1087
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:15,312
That's not what the Log Cabin
Republicans stand for.

1088
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:16,943
Well, it might as well.

1089
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,619
lf you sleep with the enemy,
you become the enemy.

1090
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:21,729
Then what does
that make you?

1091
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:23,303
[sighs]

1092
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:25,983
Fine.
Fine.

1093
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,955
Fuck.

1094
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:39,033
[soft rock playing]

1095
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:41,086
[chattering]

1096
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:51,590
[Australian accent]
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

1097
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:54,607
we uncover the rarest

1098
01:00:54,676 --> 01:00:58,123
of all land-based creatures,

1099
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,495
the gays who can't dance.

1100
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,648
l'm sorry.

1101
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:06,782
For?

1102
01:01:06,858 --> 01:01:08,957
For being an asshole.

1103
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,941
And l do know you
well enough by now

1104
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,615
that, yes, you were
a major asshole today.

1105
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,163
l know.

1106
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:18,330
Sorry, l couldn't look
beyond your stupid politics--

1107
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:19,536
Not helping.

1108
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:22,590
l couldn't look
beyond your politics

1109
01:01:22,657 --> 01:01:24,756
to see that if something's
important to you,

1110
01:01:24,832 --> 01:01:26,634
then l need to support you,

1111
01:01:26,705 --> 01:01:28,373
even if l don't agree
with you.

1112
01:01:43,306 --> 01:01:45,339
You want a drink?

1113
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,197
l want you,

1114
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:52,974
stupid politics and all.

1115
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:39,939
[door opens]

1116
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:02,454
[dance music playing]

1117
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,893
[Man]
Dude, where's my cock?

1118
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:21,373
Where's my cock, dude?

1119
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:39,976
Glenn, it's me.

1120
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,353
Something's happened
to my dad.

1121
01:03:41,425 --> 01:03:43,661
l think it's a heart attack.

1122
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:45,833
He's in the hospital now.

1123
01:03:45,908 --> 01:03:47,644
l'm catching the first
flight l can to see him.

1124
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:51,792
l'm so sorry about tonight.

1125
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:54,366
Of all nights...

1126
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:58,152
l've been looking forward
to it all week.

1127
01:03:58,227 --> 01:03:59,755
l'll call you tonight
after l get in.

1128
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,776
l miss you so much.

1129
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:03,974
l love you.

1130
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:20,507
[beep]

1131
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:23,562
[Adam on speaker,
muffled]

1132
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:30,056
Damn cell phone static.

1133
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:32,029
[beep]

1134
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:08,682
[phone ringing]

1135
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:14,166
Adam!

1136
01:05:14,238 --> 01:05:15,538
Adam, you in there?

1137
01:05:25,852 --> 01:05:27,586
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

1138
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:41,808
[Vincent]
Hey.

1139
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:53,228
You're back early.

1140
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:56,606
Did Adam call today to say
that he wasn't going to make it tonight?

1141
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:58,150
No. Why?

1142
01:06:03,305 --> 01:06:04,367
He's not home.

1143
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:06,144
There's no answer
on his cell,

1144
01:06:06,218 --> 01:06:09,162
at his work,
or his house.

1145
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,169
l mean, l can understand
him being too busy

1146
01:06:11,237 --> 01:06:12,231
to see me any other night,

1147
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,214
but blowing off
Valentine's Day?

1148
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:20,876
Where are you off to?

1149
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:23,111
Well, l figured the bars
would be full of guys

1150
01:06:23,185 --> 01:06:25,958
as depressed as l was
about Valentine's Day.

1151
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:29,775
Maybe someone will
feel sorry for me and l'll get lucky.

1152
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:34,891
Hey.

1153
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:38,710
There's no reason why
anyone should feel sorry for you.

1154
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:40,311
You just haven't met
the right guy yet.

1155
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,340
l hope he hasn't
missed me somehow.

1156
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,529
No way.
He's out there.

1157
01:06:57,192 --> 01:06:59,862
Want to come with me?

1158
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:01,500
We haven't been
dancing in awhile.

1159
01:07:03,283 --> 01:07:05,556
l don't know.

1160
01:07:05,627 --> 01:07:09,368
No, l'll wait,
see if Adam calls.

1161
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,074
lf not, fuck him.

1162
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,356
Maybe l'll go
rent a movie.

1163
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:17,533
You sure?

1164
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,709
Yeah. Yeah.

1165
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:25,068
You go on.
Get laid. Be safe.

1166
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,771
Have fun.

1167
01:07:28,488 --> 01:07:29,788
lf you change your mind...

1168
01:07:33,172 --> 01:07:34,303
l know.

1169
01:08:03,732 --> 01:08:05,203
Hey, buddy.

1170
01:08:07,747 --> 01:08:09,243
Hey, Rex.

1171
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:11,923
Haven't heard
from you in awhile.

1172
01:08:11,998 --> 01:08:13,732
You've been too busy
with my roommate.

1173
01:08:15,213 --> 01:08:17,882
That was fun, wasn't it?

1174
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:20,056
So...

1175
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:23,910
no date tonight?

1176
01:08:23,981 --> 01:08:25,577
No.

1177
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:26,956
Apparently not.

1178
01:08:31,343 --> 01:08:36,125
- What you got?
- Spartacus.

1179
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:38,470
Come and watch?

1180
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:41,313
Watch, then come?

1181
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,354
Your choice.

1182
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:45,694
Uh-uh.
No?

1183
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:53,327
What the hell.

1184
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:00,862
Our sweat becomes
a hurricane

1185
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,100
These moves
are like a twister

1186
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:06,209
[continues indistinctly]

1187
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,275
What you waiting for?

1188
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:14,719
What's your name again?

1189
01:09:14,788 --> 01:09:16,090
What do you
want it to be?

1190
01:10:05,665 --> 01:10:08,642
[phone ringing]

1191
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,648
Hello?

1192
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:20,816
Adam.
Nice to hear from you.

1193
01:10:20,891 --> 01:10:22,695
Where the hell
were you last night?

1194
01:10:24,006 --> 01:10:25,706
No, l didn't
get your message.

1195
01:10:32,272 --> 01:10:33,744
Oh, my God.

1196
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:16,343
l'm so...sorry.

1197
01:11:21,574 --> 01:11:22,875
Me, too.

1198
01:11:32,452 --> 01:11:35,795
No, l mean it.

1199
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:39,073
l'm sorry,
not just for this.

1200
01:11:39,146 --> 01:11:42,924
For being such a jerk.

1201
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:45,494
For everything.

1202
01:11:45,572 --> 01:11:48,208
l'm so very sorry.

1203
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,282
Me, too.

1204
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,135
l'll go say something
to your mom in a minute.

1205
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:11,304
She's holding up well,
considering.

1206
01:12:11,378 --> 01:12:15,224
Too many people
to deal with.

1207
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:16,697
She'll be glad
to see you, though.

1208
01:12:24,265 --> 01:12:27,939
You must have been
so pissed,

1209
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:30,421
thinking l stood you up
on Valentine's Day.

1210
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:38,120
Yeah. l was.

1211
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,144
l haven't had anything
to eat for two days

1212
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:46,483
except condolence casseroles.

1213
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:51,671
So what did you do?

1214
01:12:55,324 --> 01:12:57,799
We can get you something
better to eat later.

1215
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:07,972
Um...

1216
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:10,988
Just went out
with Vincent.

1217
01:13:11,057 --> 01:13:15,004
Got really drunk.

1218
01:13:15,072 --> 01:13:18,747
l was so hung over
when you called.

1219
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:24,135
Feel better now?

1220
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:34,444
Definitely.

1221
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:59,113
When is Adam coming
back to town?

1222
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,856
A few days.

1223
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,802
Aren't you glad
l dragged your ass out here?

1224
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:06,816
Beats moping around
your house, right?

1225
01:14:06,884 --> 01:14:08,984
Right.

1226
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,554
Well, l needed
a sick day bad.

1227
01:14:10,632 --> 01:14:12,504
l so couldn't take
that bitch today.

1228
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:14,171
She...

1229
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:15,776
[clears throat]

1230
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:18,422
You and Adam going to
work things out?

1231
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:20,906
l hope so.

1232
01:14:23,954 --> 01:14:26,225
l feel really bad
about what l did.

1233
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:29,241
Hey, hey, hey.
No one can blame you.

1234
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:31,077
Old habits die hard.

1235
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:32,588
Real hard,
l would imagine.

1236
01:14:32,657 --> 01:14:34,493
Heh heh.

1237
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:37,302
l can't tell him
though, can l?

1238
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:38,437
No, no.

1239
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:39,849
N-O.

1240
01:14:39,919 --> 01:14:42,086
Honesty is no way
to maintain a relationship.

1241
01:15:16,436 --> 01:15:17,929
He just got back

1242
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:21,215
and you're forcing him to go
to the gym already?

1243
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:25,739
Gives us more time
to be together.

1244
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:29,413
Looking for a quick fuck?

1245
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:32,159
A new apartment,
actually.

1246
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:33,796
You're moving out?

1247
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,958
lsn't that what you want?

1248
01:15:39,028 --> 01:15:41,299
Why would you think that?

1249
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,843
What should l think?

1250
01:15:45,856 --> 01:15:48,993
You're spending more
and more time with the ad guy,

1251
01:15:49,069 --> 01:15:50,165
either here,
at his place,

1252
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,768
or with Mary Margaret
and Andrew.

1253
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:52,839
So?

1254
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:54,414
So?

1255
01:15:54,492 --> 01:15:55,757
So you've turned into
one of those couples

1256
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:56,858
who doesn't want
to have anything to do

1257
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:58,064
with your
single friends anymore.

1258
01:15:58,139 --> 01:15:59,406
That is not true.

1259
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:00,814
When was the last time

1260
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:02,150
that you and l did
something together,

1261
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:06,570
just the two of us?

1262
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:08,010
l don't know.
Exactly.

1263
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,950
lt was before he came
into the picture,

1264
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,928
and that's not
friendship, Glenn.

1265
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:12,966
l don't know how
you can say that.

1266
01:16:13,034 --> 01:16:16,376
Yes, l'm spending
more time with Adam,

1267
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:20,123
but that's what you do
when you're dating.

1268
01:16:20,197 --> 01:16:22,067
Don't try to tell me
how relationships work.

1269
01:16:22,137 --> 01:16:23,404
l have been there,
you know.

1270
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,778
But l never ignored you.

1271
01:16:24,849 --> 01:16:27,085
Okay, first of all,
l'm not ignoring you.

1272
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:31,666
And secondly, your relationships
were never, ever serious.

1273
01:16:31,744 --> 01:16:32,941
You'd always come
crawling to me

1274
01:16:33,015 --> 01:16:35,583
whenever you wanted to avoid
moving forward with any guy.

1275
01:16:38,872 --> 01:16:42,411
lf you think that you
were my consolation prize

1276
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:43,983
when my relationships
would end, you're wrong.

1277
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,762
l care about you
far more than that.

1278
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:48,506
And l'm not going to be
your consolation prize

1279
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,245
when you get tired
of playing house

1280
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:51,918
with someone
that's such a bad lay

1281
01:16:51,994 --> 01:16:53,020
that when
you're done with him

1282
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:54,866
you have to go watch
porn for an hour

1283
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:57,141
just to get the bad taste
of him out of your mouth!

1284
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:00,592
Or worse, go off
with your little fuck buddy Rex

1285
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:05,478
while your boyfriend's
father is dying!

1286
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,567
That's not exactly what l would
call a recipe for happiness.

1287
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:42,465
[Glenn]
He's not returning my calls

1288
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:45,010
and he won't
answer the door.

1289
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:49,117
Do you want
to keep this going?

1290
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:51,191
Yes, l do.

1291
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:55,217
You're a bigger man
than l am.

1292
01:17:55,286 --> 01:17:56,814
Yeah, l seem
to remember that.

1293
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,329
[Woman]
Eli!

1294
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:02,509
This bitch needs to die.

1295
01:18:02,582 --> 01:18:04,111
Have you heard
from Vincent?

1296
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:08,000
Come on, man.

1297
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:10,947
He hasn't been home
in a couple of days.

1298
01:18:11,017 --> 01:18:12,511
l just want to know
that he's okay.

1299
01:18:12,589 --> 01:18:14,222
He's fine.

1300
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:18,005
He's...he's staying
at my place.

1301
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:22,496
Just tell him...

1302
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,562
Just tell him l'm sorry.

1303
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,949
[Woman]
God damn it, Eli! Get in here!

1304
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,890
Okay, l got to run, sweetie.

1305
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,456
Hang in there and everything's
going to work out fine.

1306
01:18:31,533 --> 01:18:32,731
How do you know?

1307
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:33,672
lt's just something
you say, Glenn!

1308
01:18:33,744 --> 01:18:35,375
lf l knew
what would happen,

1309
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:36,317
l'd have my own
psychic hotline.

1310
01:18:36,388 --> 01:18:37,517
Good-bye.

1311
01:18:41,743 --> 01:18:44,013
Fill it!

1312
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:45,056
Okay.

1313
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,557
Fill this, bitch.

1314
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:56,933
l quit.

1315
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:11,922
[door opens]

1316
01:19:18,526 --> 01:19:20,763
Hey.

1317
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,137
Hey.

1318
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,643
Are you back?

1319
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:30,398
l know.

1320
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:33,886
Eli told me what's
happening with Adam.

1321
01:19:33,955 --> 01:19:36,592
l'm sorry.

1322
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:41,045
Thanks.

1323
01:19:42,759 --> 01:19:46,937
You know, l should be mad at you
for what you said.

1324
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:49,885
Aren't you?
Well, l was.

1325
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:54,133
l've had a lot of time
to think about it...

1326
01:19:56,146 --> 01:19:57,744
and it boils down
to one thing.

1327
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:00,564
What's that?

1328
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:02,971
Everything
you said was true.

1329
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:07,693
l can't be mad at you

1330
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,633
when it's my own actions
that got me into trouble.

1331
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:11,003
So...

1332
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:18,465
[sighs]

1333
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:20,341
l got so upset,

1334
01:20:20,412 --> 01:20:22,215
and l just went back
to my old ways.

1335
01:20:24,564 --> 01:20:26,630
l kept telling myself
it was okay.

1336
01:20:29,249 --> 01:20:32,890
After all,
monogamy for gay men

1337
01:20:32,965 --> 01:20:34,266
is fucking one person...

1338
01:20:34,337 --> 01:20:36,869
[both]
most of the time.

1339
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:40,821
Exactly.

1340
01:20:43,474 --> 01:20:45,973
But l should know better
at this point.

1341
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:49,966
Still, l'm sorry for
saying it like that.

1342
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:53,342
l don't want
to move out.

1343
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:57,454
l wanted us
to be roommates forever.

1344
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:04,785
l care about you so much.

1345
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:09,210
More than you
care for me, l know,

1346
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,812
but that's my problem.

1347
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:14,331
lt's my issue.

1348
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:18,641
l've realized that...

1349
01:21:21,329 --> 01:21:23,600
when you find someone...

1350
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,889
you'll move on from me.

1351
01:21:35,988 --> 01:21:39,663
We're always--we're always
gonna be friends, though.

1352
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:41,711
You know,
close friends.

1353
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:48,005
And l do love you,
Vincent.

1354
01:21:50,013 --> 01:21:51,988
l love you, too.

1355
01:22:05,143 --> 01:22:09,718
l feel like l need to
make some grand gesture to...

1356
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:11,928
l don't know, make Adam realize
how much l love him?

1357
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,847
l wish l could help.

1358
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,689
Nowadays, my means of relief
don't run to the emotional.

1359
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:19,232
Oh. Hang on a minute.
l need to...

1360
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,832
finish up
with this client.

1361
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:27,321
Oh, yeah, daddy!

1362
01:22:27,398 --> 01:22:30,069
Uhh! Give it to me!

1363
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:31,912
Mmm! Yeah,
that's it!

1364
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:33,753
Oh! Harder!

1365
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:36,428
Oh, yeah. Shake it
back and forth.

1366
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:40,953
Make you do voices,
daddy!

1367
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:42,117
Oh, nice! Yeah.

1368
01:22:42,193 --> 01:22:44,999
Spanish accent.
Ol, man, ol.

1369
01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:47,138
Bring it, man,
bring it!

1370
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:48,617
Oh, it's good.
Okay, okay.

1371
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:49,988
Now, you got that
stuffed monkey?

1372
01:22:50,059 --> 01:22:51,051
Oh, yeah.

1373
01:22:55,749 --> 01:22:57,186
You're into pirates?

1374
01:22:57,254 --> 01:22:58,624
Yeah, l'm sitting here
with my...

1375
01:22:58,695 --> 01:23:00,131
with my parrot.

1376
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:02,368
And we're both so hot
for you, daddy.

1377
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:04,645
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh...

1378
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:06,088
Daddy want a hand job?

1379
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,438
Yeah. Oh, you like that?
Aarrgh! Aarrgh! Aarrgh!

1380
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:11,673
Are you getting
close, daddy?

1381
01:23:11,747 --> 01:23:13,242
Are you getting close?

1382
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,884
[parrot voice]
Aarrgh! Aarrgh!

1383
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:16,831
Oh, yeah.
Give it to me.

1384
01:23:16,902 --> 01:23:18,534
Yeah, anytime now,
daddy.

1385
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:23,562
Anytime, daddy.

1386
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:25,728
Oh, good boy.
Good boy, daddy.

1387
01:23:25,804 --> 01:23:26,833
All right.
You take care.

1388
01:23:28,114 --> 01:23:30,248
Sorry about that.
[laughs]

1389
01:23:30,324 --> 01:23:32,492
You know these priests,
they take forever.

1390
01:23:34,373 --> 01:23:36,314
How goes
the new job?

1391
01:23:36,382 --> 01:23:39,452
Oh, yeah, well, uh,
who am l to complain?

1392
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:41,434
lt's turned a hobby
into a paying gig.

1393
01:23:41,503 --> 01:23:43,202
[laughs]
Yeah.

1394
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,082
So are you gonna be okay?

1395
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:55,561
He-man coffee for you,

1396
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:57,361
herbal tea for me.

1397
01:23:59,175 --> 01:24:00,943
You're not going
all healthy on me, are you?

1398
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:04,223
[laughs]
Just having trouble sleeping.

1399
01:24:08,346 --> 01:24:11,381
Thanks for letting me
come over.

1400
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:12,655
You've been
so busy lately.

1401
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:15,298
l feel like l haven't
seen you in forever.

1402
01:24:15,374 --> 01:24:18,615
l've had so many things
come up.

1403
01:24:18,688 --> 01:24:20,960
Family things,
you know.

1404
01:24:21,031 --> 01:24:22,229
Gotcha.

1405
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:26,778
So, what are
you gonna do?

1406
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:29,056
l don't know.

1407
01:24:30,704 --> 01:24:32,472
l love him.

1408
01:24:34,285 --> 01:24:37,092
l thought everything
would work out for once.

1409
01:24:37,165 --> 01:24:40,405
l know, sweetie.

1410
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:44,586
l was getting used
to having him around,

1411
01:24:44,661 --> 01:24:47,263
being part of a couple.

1412
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:49,780
Me, too.

1413
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:51,949
At least l still have
you and Andrew.

1414
01:24:52,025 --> 01:24:53,965
Some things never change.

1415
01:24:55,806 --> 01:24:57,713
Sometimes they do.

1416
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,905
l hadn't planned on
telling you today.

1417
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,880
Telling me what?

1418
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:09,623
The herbal tea isn't because
l'm having trouble sleeping.

1419
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:12,139
l should
just avoid caffeine,

1420
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:15,014
especially in
the first trimester.

1421
01:25:15,085 --> 01:25:17,688
You mean...

1422
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:20,502
you're going
back to school?

1423
01:25:23,554 --> 01:25:25,721
No!
Yes.

1424
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:35,160
[laughs]

1425
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:40,452
Oh, now you've done it.

1426
01:25:40,524 --> 01:25:44,026
You've gone
and made me cry.

1427
01:25:44,104 --> 01:25:46,272
l'm sorry.
This is just so exciting!

1428
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:48,618
l'm gonna turn into
Tammy Faye any second.

1429
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:53,542
l'm so happy for you.

1430
01:25:53,609 --> 01:25:56,143
You really have it all,
don't you?

1431
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,994
A husband,

1432
01:25:59,065 --> 01:26:00,331
a kid on the way,

1433
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,280
the ideal relationship.

1434
01:26:09,308 --> 01:26:11,372
That's it.

1435
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,788
You are fucking crazy.

1436
01:26:13,859 --> 01:26:15,800
And coming from me,
that's saying a lot.

1437
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:18,275
No. No, no.
lt's what l need to do.

1438
01:26:18,344 --> 01:26:19,940
Are you sure?

1439
01:26:20,018 --> 01:26:22,996
Well, that's why l wanted you here
to help me decide.

1440
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:27,539
But this--
[knock on door]

1441
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:41,298
Hey.

1442
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:42,866
Hey.

1443
01:26:46,091 --> 01:26:48,065
[Adam]
Hey, guys.

1444
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,493
l'm...

1445
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:58,062
l'm glad to see you.

1446
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,510
l tried to call.

1447
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,817
l know.

1448
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,589
Well, l'm...

1449
01:27:03,663 --> 01:27:05,364
l wanted to say...

1450
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:08,883
Do you still have
my green sweater?

1451
01:27:08,952 --> 01:27:10,789
[Glenn]
Huh?

1452
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:11,886
That green sweater.

1453
01:27:11,964 --> 01:27:12,899
Um--

1454
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:15,810
You always said
it looked good on me.

1455
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,687
l think
it's in my closet.

1456
01:27:22,441 --> 01:27:24,642
Can l get it?

1457
01:27:24,715 --> 01:27:26,211
l'm gonna need it
in Atlanta.

1458
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:28,058
Atlanta?

1459
01:27:29,234 --> 01:27:32,909
Yeah. My mom's having
a rough time.

1460
01:27:32,983 --> 01:27:34,854
And, uh...

1461
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:38,165
l thought l gave
L.A. a shot.

1462
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:40,806
lt didn't work out.

1463
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:44,695
Maybe the best thing
l can do is just go back home.

1464
01:27:44,765 --> 01:27:47,937
No. No, l--l don't--
l don't want--l--

1465
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:49,918
What?
l don't--

1466
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,740
l want you to be happy.

1467
01:27:58,119 --> 01:27:59,420
[Glenn]
More than anything.

1468
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:02,367
You, too.

1469
01:28:02,438 --> 01:28:04,639
l hope you can be.

1470
01:28:06,253 --> 01:28:07,884
Can l get the sweater?

1471
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,347
Yeah.

1472
01:28:29,348 --> 01:28:31,378
Aren't you going
to stop him?

1473
01:28:32,862 --> 01:28:35,202
Why should l?
He doesn't--

1474
01:28:35,272 --> 01:28:38,478
He doesn't want me
anymore.

1475
01:28:38,552 --> 01:28:41,222
Okay, l know l haven't been the biggest
supporter of this relationship,

1476
01:28:41,297 --> 01:28:42,928
but l swear, if you don't
go after him right now,

1477
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:44,373
l'm gonna slap you.

1478
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:46,108
He just doesn't want me--
He just--

1479
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,662
Uhh!
What the hell?

1480
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,942
l don't want you
to turn into me.

1481
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:57,050
Oh, honey,
no one wants that.

1482
01:28:57,127 --> 01:28:58,931
Now go!

1483
01:28:59,002 --> 01:29:00,233
Go after him!

1484
01:29:01,278 --> 01:29:04,257
[chuckles]
Thanks.

1485
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:07,939
Thank you.

1486
01:29:09,713 --> 01:29:11,710
This is just
so Molly Ringwald

1487
01:29:11,787 --> 01:29:13,089
at the end of
Pretty in Pink.

1488
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,151
[both laugh]

1489
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,532
Oh, let's watch it!

1490
01:29:22,564 --> 01:29:24,870
l thought we said
all there is to say.

1491
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:26,744
Not everything.

1492
01:29:26,815 --> 01:29:29,623
Just listen to me
for a second, okay?

1493
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:36,488
There's no one l can imagine
spending my life with except for you.

1494
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:41,839
What about
this Rex guy?

1495
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:45,689
l am so sorry for that.

1496
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,958
l just got mad.

1497
01:29:47,032 --> 01:29:48,596
l slipped back into
my old behavior.

1498
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:50,201
lt was stupid.

1499
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:52,811
lt won't happen again.

1500
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:55,696
But you lied.

1501
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:58,871
l know.

1502
01:29:58,947 --> 01:30:00,384
And l know that l have to
earn your trust back,

1503
01:30:00,453 --> 01:30:02,828
and l will.

1504
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:05,196
There's more to it.

1505
01:30:05,273 --> 01:30:08,012
l think...

1506
01:30:08,085 --> 01:30:10,526
l finally know
what the problem is,

1507
01:30:10,595 --> 01:30:12,592
in and out
of the bedroom.

1508
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,992
See...

1509
01:30:19,062 --> 01:30:24,517
you are essentially
an old-fashioned guy...

1510
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:28,226
and a Republican to boot.

1511
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:29,602
And it was always
right there.

1512
01:30:29,673 --> 01:30:31,409
''Shy and romantic,''
the first two words in your ad.

1513
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:32,917
Even after you came out,

1514
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:36,124
you probably always dreamed
about meeting Prince Charming

1515
01:30:36,199 --> 01:30:39,269
and living
happily ever after.

1516
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:41,845
So?

1517
01:30:43,364 --> 01:30:45,600
So...

1518
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:47,908
l'm guessing...

1519
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:52,432
that you probably still
feel the same way.

1520
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,471
A desire for a more
traditional relationship.

1521
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:59,356
And maybe that's what
you need to make things right.

1522
01:31:02,675 --> 01:31:07,993
l know this isn't
exactly traditional.

1523
01:31:08,063 --> 01:31:11,007
Then again,
how can it be?

1524
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:19,603
What are you doing?

1525
01:31:19,677 --> 01:31:22,587
Adam, l love you.

1526
01:31:27,609 --> 01:31:29,243
Will you marry me?

1527
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,056
Are you serious?

1528
01:31:32,129 --> 01:31:36,705
More serious than l've ever been
about anything in my life.

1529
01:31:38,387 --> 01:31:40,693
But this kneeling shit
is overrated.

1530
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,459
l'll only ask
once more.

1531
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,881
Then l need you
to walk off and...

1532
01:31:53,951 --> 01:31:56,485
forget you
ever met me.

1533
01:31:56,562 --> 01:32:00,602
That's impossible,
and you know it.

1534
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:03,052
Then marry me.

1535
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,660
[pop rock]

1536
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:30,900
l feel l'm going crazy

1537
01:32:30,969 --> 01:32:36,253
Trying to figure us out

1538
01:32:36,325 --> 01:32:40,433
All the words
you once said to me

1539
01:32:40,509 --> 01:32:46,158
Have filled me with doubt

1540
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:48,970
Well, l don't know
what's left to do

1541
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:51,646
Hush my heart,
it's thrown to you

1542
01:32:51,722 --> 01:32:54,324
How do l go on
and what do l say?

1543
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:56,465
How do l start to explain

1544
01:32:56,542 --> 01:33:01,790
That everything l wanted

1545
01:33:01,862 --> 01:33:07,317
ls standing
in front of me?

1546
01:33:07,384 --> 01:33:12,302
Everything
you ever wanted

1547
01:33:12,372 --> 01:33:16,880
l hope is inside of me

1548
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,366
lnside of me

1549
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:21,910
Oh

1550
01:33:21,978 --> 01:33:23,848
Yeah

1551
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,606
Everything you wanted

1552
01:33:33,224 --> 01:33:36,167
Well, l'm okay,
l'll be just fine

1553
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:38,838
l tell myself
all the time

1554
01:33:38,914 --> 01:33:43,263
What more can l do?

1555
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:46,402
With all these feelings
that you have

1556
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:49,286
l feel some
down deep inside...

1557
01:33:50,763 --> 01:33:53,295
l love you.

1558
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:54,869
l love you, too.

1559
01:33:56,118 --> 01:33:59,153
Hush my heart,
it's thrown to you

1560
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:01,604
How do l go on
and what do l say?

1561
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:03,648
How do l start to explain

1562
01:34:03,716 --> 01:34:09,262
That everything l wanted

1563
01:34:09,339 --> 01:34:14,486
ls standing
in front of me?

1564
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,741
Everything
you ever wanted

1565
01:34:19,815 --> 01:34:24,061
l hope is inside of me

1566
01:34:24,133 --> 01:34:26,608

1567
01:34:26,677 --> 01:34:29,381
Oh

1568
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:35,172
You see, now everything
l ever wanted

1569
01:34:35,246 --> 01:34:40,426
ls standing
in front of me

1570
01:34:40,499 --> 01:34:45,817
Everything
you ever wanted

1571
01:34:45,887 --> 01:34:50,099
l hope is inside of me

1572
01:34:50,172 --> 01:34:52,809
lnside of me

1573
01:34:52,884 --> 01:34:55,223
Oh

1574
01:34:55,294 --> 01:34:57,735
Yeah

1575
01:35:00,348 --> 01:35:03,052
Everything you wanted

1576
01:35:05,703 --> 01:35:08,009
l hope

1577
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,488
l hope

1578
01:35:10,557 --> 01:35:13,089
ls inside of me

1579
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:15,471
Oh

1580
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:19,183
ls inside of me

1581
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:23,131
[soft rock]

1582
01:35:42,956 --> 01:35:47,600
l just can't stop
loving you

1583
01:35:47,674 --> 01:35:50,619
Wouldn't even try

1584
01:35:50,687 --> 01:35:53,323
lt wouldn't do

1585
01:35:53,398 --> 01:35:58,076
lf l say the words
of what l feel inside

1586
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:01,186
Would it be enough

1587
01:36:01,263 --> 01:36:04,265
To make you mine?

1588
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,716
l'll be loving you

1589
01:36:06,786 --> 01:36:09,457
lf you want me to

1590
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:14,815
You're the someone
l want to hold on to

1591
01:36:14,886 --> 01:36:17,361
l'll be loving you

1592
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:20,203
lf you want me to

1593
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,442
With everything l knew

1594
01:36:22,517 --> 01:36:26,695
l'm still loving you

1595
01:36:26,769 --> 01:36:29,267
Mm-hmm

1596
01:36:29,346 --> 01:36:31,343
Oh, oh

1597
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,778
Everything's all right

1598
01:36:38,851 --> 01:36:40,985
l convince myself at night

1599
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:46,846
Lying here while
it all comes running

1600
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:49,520
lf you could only see

1601
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:51,832
How you got to me

1602
01:36:51,904 --> 01:36:54,643
Maybe you'd try to

1603
01:36:54,717 --> 01:36:57,889
To love again

1604
01:36:57,962 --> 01:37:00,302
l'll be loving you

1605
01:37:00,373 --> 01:37:03,043
lf you want me to...
