00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,106
Hi there.
-Hi.

2
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,300
So glad to see you.

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,807
Kathy, could you take that?

4
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,046
Thank you.

5
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,111
It's my job to market this drug for
Bristol-Myers, and I'm telling you,

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,017
kids won't go for it
unless it tastes like bubble gum.

7
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,682
-Mr. Crowley, you're late.
-All right. Thank you. Bye.

8
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,569
"Everyone just walked by.

9
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,304
"'Why won't anyone buy our newspaper?'
SpongeBob wondered aloud.

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,314
"'They must be rock haters,' said Patrick."

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,648
-John! Give it back to me!
-She's mine now!

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,314
-Give me a minute, okay?
-Give it back to me, John!

13
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,414
You save our spot. Got it?

14
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,754
You better give me back my Fiona!

15
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,060
Help, Mom!

16
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,599
-Help me! She's trying to kill me!
-I'm gonna get you!

17
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,499
-You can't escape!
-No! Mom, help me!

18
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,906
Just give it back to me.

19
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,737
-Mom! She's trying to kill me!
-Megan Kathryn Crowley.

20
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,946
If you kill your brother,
you cannot have your party.

21
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,075
Why not? He stole Fiona.

22
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,917
I didn't steal her, I kidnapped her.
I'm holding her for ransom.

23
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,820
Release the victim.

24
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,327
Time to get ready for your party.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,128
We've got to get moving on
the product launch.

26
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,824
I'm just waiting on legal, John.

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,333
Damn it!

28
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,331
I just missed my train.
I'm gonna have to call you...

29
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,632
I agree. How soon do you need it?

30
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,173
As soon as possible.
I'm presenting to my boss next week.

31
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,572
John, we're loading up the van right now.
Come on!

32
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,343
-Okay, we ready to roll, Kate?
-My name is Jane.

33
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,282
-Kate was yesterday, Mom.
-I am so sorry.

34
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,287
The way the agency shuffles
day nurses on us,

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,187
you'd think they'd, you know,
give you a number instead of a name.

36
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,751
Okay, John.

37
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,324
John, come on, get your butt in the car.

38
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,660
John.

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,658
-Are you bringing your RipStik?
-Yes.

40
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,702
-Do you have to?
-Yes.

41
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,637
...a pain, that's why.
Wait, I gotta catch a cab.

42
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,109
Hi. Come here. Hey, hey. Hello?

43
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,616
-Daddy's meeting us there, right?
-Absolutely.

44
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,784
I am sure he has everything under control.

45
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,384
Taxi!

46
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,196
You need a hand?

47
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,792
Great. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of in a hurry.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,411
Go.

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,213
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

50
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,480
Yes!

51
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,494
Yes!

52
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,061
He totally promised he'd be here by now.

53
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,435
He's on his way, baby. He's on his way.

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,749
Hi, guys.

55
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,420
-Get in there and give her a kiss.
-I know.

56
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,220
-I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear it.
-Go, go, go.

57
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,522
Happy birthday. I made it.

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,629
-Yay!
-Yay!

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,392
Make a wish, Megan.

60
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,731
Who wants cake?

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,307
-I do!
-I do!

62
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,275
Line up single file, or no cake for you.

63
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,108
-All right, how many do we have?
-I'm first! Me first!

64
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,108
-No, I'm the big guy.
-Back to the end of the line.

65
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,729
So, where is Fiona going, anyway?

66
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,561
Lollipop Land?

67
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,169
I'm eight, Daddy. I'm not a baby anymore.

68
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,636
She's driving to Antarctica
to see the penguins.

69
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,009
Really? That's pretty far away.

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,176
Why doesn't she just go
to the Portland Zoo?

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,753
They have a lot of penguins there, too.

72
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,017
-Haven't you ever heard of adventure?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,086
It's gonna take her years.

74
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,197
Won't she need a suitcase?

75
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,028
It's an adventure.
You don't need a suitcase on an adventure.

76
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,466
Well, I don't know about you,
but if I was going on an adventure,

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,764
I would take a suitcase.

78
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:43,308
-That's 'cause you're a businessman.
-That's right. I am.

79
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,675
And you're eight years old.
And happy birthday. And I love you.

80
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,975
Love you, too, Daddy.

81
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,217
-Good night. See you in the morning.
-Good night.

82
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,446
Nighty-night.

83
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,149
Sweet dreams.

84
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,226
Good night, Dad.

85
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,898
-Good night, Daddy.
-Night, buddy.

86
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,029
-Hello?
-Hello, Dr. Stonehill?

87
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,271
-Are you there? Hello?
-Yeah.

88
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,078
This is John Crowley. I don't know
if you've gotten any of my messages.

89
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,273
-Who?
-John...

90
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,739
Jesus.

91
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,377
I'm interested in speaking with you.
I understand from many researchers...

92
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,052
...having a conversation with you
if that's convenient.

93
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,353
Is this a good time to talk?

94
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,558
Dr. Stonehill? Hello?

95
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,697
-Asshole.
-"Asshole?"

96
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,613
The night nurse just left.

97
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,048
What time is it?

98
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,350
I missed you.

99
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,028
This is pathetic. I'm still dressed.

100
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,859
I could help you with that.

101
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,649
Oh my...Kate!
Hi! You're early.

102
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:21,720
6:.00.

103
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,382
-Have you met...
-I'm John Crowley.

104
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,090
John is my husband.

105
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,795
Glad to hear it.

106
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,279
Yeah, let's up
her breathing treatments today.

107
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,821
-What's going on?
-Just a cold. She's awfully congested.

108
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,114
-Call the doc just to be on the safe side?
-Yeah, I left word.

109
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,429
Sweetie? I'm gonna go to work, okay?

110
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,521
Feel better.

111
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,866
Bye-bye.

112
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,165
We're already doing great
marketing the drug to physicians.

113
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,968
It's our direct marketing to patients
we need to beef up.

114
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,976
Mr. Crowley, I'm really sorry.

115
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,876
Aileen's on the line,
she really needs to speak to you.

116
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,847
Okay, thank you. I'm just gonna... Hey.

117
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,181
We're at the hospital.
The doc wants Megan under observation.

118
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,513
-ls she all right?
-Just keep your cell with you.

119
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,524
-Okay. Can I do something?
-I'll call you when I know more.

120
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,289
I should really get back to Megan, so I'll call
you as soon as I know anything, okay?

121
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,955
Bye. Love you.

122
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,799
-Excuse me, please.
-Sir?

123
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,640
My daughter, Megan Crowley,
was brought in for observation.

124
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,045
Yeah.
Actually, they're moving her to the lCU.

125
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,014
-Where?
-That way.

126
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,012
-Aileen.
-John.

127
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,416
Has she told you about the trip that Fiona's
taking with her remote-controlled car?

128
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,188
Yeah, yes, she did. You're right.
That's right, sweetie.

129
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,856
You're gonna see
all the penguins, aren't you?

130
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,195
She might send some postcards
or something like that.

131
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,166
-Lots of good stuff to see along the way...
-It's okay.

132
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,000
...Iike icebergs and maybe a polar bear.

133
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,772
How about some seals?

134
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,061
As you know, Pompe patients suffer muscle
deterioration in every part of the body,

135
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:54,436
so this sort of respiratory complication, well,
that's just an inevitable fact of the disease.

136
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,477
Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley,

137
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,581
Megan is not responding well.

138
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,289
Okay? Now, we've done everything we can,
but she's just...

139
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,824
There's nothing more we can do. I'm sorry.

140
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:21,622
As you know, she was already well past the
life expectancy, for, you know, Pompe kids.

141
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,898
After all, it's not just her lungs, okay?

142
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,066
Her heart, her liver,
these organs have been compromised

143
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,009
and would've become fatally enlarged.

144
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:38,447
Now, I wish that we had a drug
to treat Pompe, but we simply don't.

145
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,278
I'm so very sorry.

146
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,313
Look, maybe...

147
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:51,158
Maybe you can find some small comfort in
knowing that Megan's suffering will be over.

148
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:55,256
Maybe you can see this as a blessing.

149
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,533
-Megan?
-Help!

150
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,070
-Help! Help!
-Megan?

151
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,900
Help! Help!

152
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,099
Baby girl, can you hear me?

153
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,677
-Please, someone come help!
-321!

154
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,837
-Megan Crowley, room 321, please!
-Code Blue!

155
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,040
-Baby girl, Mama's here, all right?
-Let's go! Page Dr. Heder.

156
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,343
-Asystole!
-Yeah, right through here.

157
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,112
Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear Mama?

158
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,551
-Starting compressions.
-I'll switch her out.

159
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,452
-Over here, please. Quickly.
-Hang in there, Megan.

160
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,491
-Hang in there, baby, okay?
-I need to bag her.

161
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,059
-Aileen?
-Some room right there.

162
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,354
Let us in, all right?

163
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,157
-Please, Mrs. Crowley, let...
-Stop it!

164
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,322
Let us help her!

165
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,126
-Please... Megan!
-Aileen.

166
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,633
-Epinephrine, 0.1 mils per kig.
-Got it.

167
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,636
Still no pulse. No reading.

168
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,968
-Forget the weight, come on, get it in there!
-Aileen, Aileen.

169
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,233
-0.1 epi.
-It's all right.

170
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,366
-Come on, Megs. Come on. Come on.
-lV push.

171
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,641
-Okay, just give the epi a couple seconds.
-Still non-responsive.

172
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,375
-All right, charge the defib.
-Charging.

173
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,940
Your daughter is some fighter.

174
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,507
-She's gonna be okay.
-Oh, my God.

175
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,015
Now, look,
she's still a very sick girl, obviously,

176
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:57,077
but her vital signs have improved
and I'm cautiously optimistic.

177
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,651
So, I guess you could say
we dodged that blessing, huh?

178
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,265
-Mrs. Crowley, these came for Megan.
-Thanks so much. Thank you.

179
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,634
Hey, John?

180
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,173
Any time you're ready, man.

181
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,073
You gonna tell us
about the product launch?

182
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,249
John, you okay?

183
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,516
I have to go.

184
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,651
John.

185
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,526
-Where you going?
-Nebraska.

186
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,028
Excuse me, please.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

187
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,634
Best make yourself comfortable, hon.

188
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,324
Oh, dear.

189
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,901
Sir, sir.
That's Dr. Stonehill. He just left, I'm sorry.

190
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,662
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

191
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,894
Dr. Stonehill!

192
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,973
Hey, Dr. Stonehill!

193
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,704
Dr. Stonehill?

194
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,679
-Yeah?
-I'm John Crowley.

195
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,850
-Okay.
-Didn't you get any of my messages?

196
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,880
What messages?

197
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,288
I left you three or four messages
in the last month,

198
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,123
and you even hung up on me
the night before last.

199
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,892
What the hell are you talking about?
I never hung up on you.

200
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,759
Dr. Stonehill, two of my kids have Pompe.

201
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,530
Oh, Jesus.

202
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,204
Well, I'm sorry.

203
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,706
A terrible disease,

204
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,543
but, hell, you shouldn't have come
all this way without talking to me.

205
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,709
I do research, son. I don't see patients.

206
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,014
Well, it's your research
that I'm interested in.

207
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,887
I've read all the journal articles
on Pompe disease,

208
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,395
and all the researchers out there say
that your work holds the most promise.

209
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,659
Get to the point, son.
What do you want from me?

210
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,564
We almost lost my daughter last week.

211
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,903
I need to hear about your research.

212
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,575
Your kids have a genetic disease.

213
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,075
They're missing an enzyme

214
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,917
which metabolizes
a certain kind of sugar, glycogen.

215
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,992
It's defective in Pompe patients.

216
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,954
So, this sugar builds up in the muscle cells,

217
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,431
especially in the heart, the skeletal muscles,
the diaphragm,

218
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,558
which is why they have
a hard time breathing.

219
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,537
-Yeah, I know. I know a lot about that.
-Everybody's making an enzyme,

220
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,201
but you can infuse kids all day long
with their enzyme,

221
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,043
and it's not gonna do any good
'cause it's not gonna get into their cells.

222
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,205
Understand what I'm saying?

223
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,874
Yeah, so that means
that if you put the sugar...

224
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,315
-Don't interrupt.
-Sorry.

225
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,911
I'm making a different version
of this enzyme.

226
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,551
My enzyme has a biological marker,
mannose 6-phosphate.

227
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,323
I'm the only one that's cloned the gene
for phosphotransferase.

228
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,264
I'm the only one who's cloned the gene
for uncovering enzyme,

229
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,497
so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate
onto the lysosomal protein,

230
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,633
and I can deliver
a more effective amount of enzyme

231
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,737
into the cells.

232
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,676
That's why people are citing my work.

233
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,772
That's why you read my name
in the literature.

234
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,148
I can get more enzyme into the cells.

235
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,250
What's the matter, Sal?
Not up on your glycobiology?

236
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,989
I thought Doc was just your nickname.

237
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,291
No, that man's a genius. He's on the verge
of a scientific breakthrough.

238
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,865
Wow. Who knew?

239
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,670
I'm not on the verge of anything, kid.
This is a theory, not a therapy.

240
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,763
I'm just an academic.

241
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,207
-You got any idea how shitty my funding is?
-No.

242
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,679
University of Nebraska
pays their football coach

243
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,773
more money in a year
than my entire science budget.

244
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,512
Nobody's paying attention to this work.

245
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,815
Half my grants don't get approved.

246
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,257
I don't have the money to make my theory
into a useable medicine.

247
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,295
How old are your kids?

248
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,890
Six and eight.

249
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,809
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go home and spend time with your kids.

250
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,910
Enjoy 'em while they're still here.

251
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,216
-How much?
-How much what?

252
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,152
How much money would it take
to prove your theory,

253
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,720
to create your version of the medicine?

254
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,000
I'd need half a million bucks
just to fund the lab work.

255
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,095
-That's why you need me.
-I need you? Why?

256
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,973
Because I'm the founder of
the Pompe Foundation for Children.

257
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,842
I've been working on this disease
for 10 years.

258
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,577
I have never heard of you guys.

259
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:45,145
That's because we're relatively new.
We're just in the gearing-up phase.

260
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,891
-How soon do you need a grant?
-Now would be good.

261
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:54,329
Well, not all the money's in place,
but it will be, and soon.

262
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,433
This is a very exciting time.

263
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,282
-Thanks.
-Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

264
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,392
Hey.

265
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,668
You okay?

266
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,901
-Did you get my messages?
-Your messages?

267
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,447
You suddenly walk out of the meeting

268
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,143
and fly to Nebraska
without talking to me about it,

269
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,413
and you think messages make it okay?

270
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,580
-I'm sorry.
-My God, John.

271
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,681
I wanna find a miracle
as much as you do, okay?

272
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,091
But how could you put your job in jeopardy?

273
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,662
-Aileen.
-How exactly

274
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,130
do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare
if you lose your insurance?

275
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,701
Honey, come on.
Look, I'm not gonna lose my job.

276
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,860
Oh, really?

277
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,599
Pete called here twice last night
to ask if you were okay.

278
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,504
You know, mentally.

279
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,411
I'll just...
I'll call, and I'll smooth that one over.

280
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,277
Yeah, no shit.

281
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,726
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,897
Something in me just kind of snapped.

283
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:42,270
That night at the hospital,
when we thought that we were losing her,

284
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,779
I prayed that if it was her time,

285
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,749
she'd go quickly, without so much suffering.

286
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,727
But morning came, and she pulled through.

287
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,457
Her eyes,

288
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,296
so determined, so defiant.

289
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,304
The fight in her.

290
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,252
Was he worth it? This Stonehill guy?

291
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,020
He's really eccentric, but his science
is way ahead of everybody else's.

292
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:40,257
-He's definitely the one to put our money on.
-lf we had any.

293
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,595
I promised him that we'd raise some,

294
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,896
because he's got this conference up here
next month,

295
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,369
and I said I'd have a check ready for him.

296
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,632
-How much?
-Five hundred.

297
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,799
-That's all?
-Thousand.

298
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,603
Is it $500 or $1,000?

299
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,143
$500,000.

300
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,774
By next month.

301
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:09,689
-Sweetheart, are you totally insane?
-Apparently.

302
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,325
We're holding our first fundraiser
on the 23rd at the school,

303
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,797
and we would love
if you and Frank could join us.

304
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,595
-Ready for your spelling test?
-I'm gonna nail it.

305
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,760
Okay. Good luck.

306
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,065
My name's John Crowley.
I'm calling from Oregon,

307
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,632
and I got your name from
the Atlanta-area Pompe parents' group.

308
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,768
Yeah.

309
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,073
And I was so sorry
not to see you at the reunion

310
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,310
because you were one of
my most favorite people in high school.

311
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,677
Anyway, John and l
are starting this foundation.

312
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,518
-Hey, Dad? Dad.
-No, you know what I mean.

313
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,682
Just make it right.

314
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,784
-Dad?
-Can't you see I'm on the phone?

315
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,159
-Okay, well, tell me what he told you.
-Dad!

316
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,824
No, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I can't talk. All right, bye.

317
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,833
-Yeah, what is it?
-I sold my RipStik.

318
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:51,924
Okay.

319
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,100
Is it enough to give to
Megan and Patrick's foundation?

320
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,041
Yeah, it's more than enough.

321
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,214
-Are you John?
-Yes.

322
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,774
-Marcus Temple. We spoke on the phone.
-Right. Absolutely. Good to see you.

323
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,481
-All the way in from Atlanta.
-Yes.

324
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,686
Well, this is for your foundation,
from my relatives, friends and church group.

325
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,396
My goodness.

326
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,628
Thank you very much.

327
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,102
Thanks.

328
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:52,522
-Hi, Dr. Stonehill. I'm Megan.
-Hi, Megan. I'm Dr. Stonehill.

329
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,724
Yeah, that's why I said, "Hi, Dr. Stonehill."

330
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,995
-Are you coming in or not?
-Yeah, thanks.

331
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,732
Where's Mom and Dad?

332
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,104
They'll be down in a minute.

333
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,771
Patrick's vent alarm is going off,
so they need to fix it.

334
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,678
His alarm goes off even more than mine.

335
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,224
So, what's your deal? You married?

336
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,123
Do you have a wife?

337
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,462
Ex-wives. Two of 'em.

338
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:32,195
-Yeah? How come?
-'Cause I'm so easy to get along with.

339
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,472
-Any other questions?
-No. Your turn to ask one.

340
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,467
You're probably wondering
what grade I'm in.

341
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,046
-What grade are you in?
-I'm in third.

342
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,878
My hobbies are video games and penguins.
How about you?

343
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,144
-I already graduated.
-No, I mean hobbies.

344
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,051
Mostly I just work.

345
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,459
Little bass fishing
every once in a while, but...

346
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,231
What's your favorite subject?

347
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,667
I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. best,
especially the sprint races.

348
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,999
Sprint races?

349
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,301
-Wanna see?
-Sure.

350
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,179
Come on.

351
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,149
-ls he here yet?
-I don't know.

352
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,063
I'm gonna win!

353
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,665
Come on, slowpoke.

354
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,733
Yeah, I won!

355
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,005
I won.

356
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,841
Oh, yeah.

357
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,707
Told you I'm gonna beat you.

358
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,009
Hi.

359
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,877
Dr. Stonehill has two ex-wives.

360
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,284
-I see that Megan's introduced herself.
-Yeah.

361
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,379
-How are you, Dr. Stonehill?
-I'm okay, thank you.

362
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,424
-This is Aileen, my wife.
-So nice to meet you.

363
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,686
-And John Jr.
-Hello.

364
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,057
-Here's Patrick.
-Hi.

365
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,927
-Hey, Patrick.
-I think we should probably go inside.

366
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,359
Yeah, come on inside.

367
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,368
Megan, we'll see you inside. Come on.

368
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,106
-Night, Patrick.
-Good night.

369
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,973
Night, SpongeBob.

370
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,447
-You gotta say good night to Dr. Stonehill.
-Kiss SpongeBob.

371
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,257
-Good night.
-Good night, son.

372
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,555
Good night, Patrick.

373
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,825
I'm not gonna say it again. It is bedtime now.

374
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,960
It's for him.

375
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,137
-Me?
-For good luck. For bass fishing.

376
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,402
Thank you.

377
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,674
You like it?

378
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:00,273
Well, sure. A happy-go-lucky little fellow,
lots of personality, huh?

379
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,154
-He's a plastic toy.
-I know.

380
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,089
Here's the father-daughter dance.

381
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,591
You haven't lived until you've seen
Megan do the Wheelchair Watusi.

382
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,184
Here you go.

383
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:15,198
-Go ahead and eat the cobbler while it's hot.
-Smells great, honey.

384
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,868
This was hilarious.

385
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,632
Bob, we went to this dude ranch.
All right if I call you Bob?

386
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:26,676
You got a check for a half-million dollars,
hell, you can call me Peggy Sue.

387
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,171
I'll just...

388
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,317
Well, Bob.

389
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,592
This is the first installment
against the promised half a million.

390
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,707
Tell you the truth,
that's more than I expected.

391
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,908
Dr. Stonehill, we promise that...

392
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,814
-Yeah, I know.
-lf... In enough time, then...

393
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,887
I know. I know.

394
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,822
You can learn a lot about a person
on the lnternet these days.

395
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,418
Learn about a working-class kid
from New Jersey,

396
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,498
worked his way through
Harvard Business School,

397
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,067
clawing his way up the ladder
at Bristol-Myers.

398
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,669
But what Google can't tell you

399
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,238
is that this scared, desperate, bullshitting
son of a bitch...

400
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,102
-Wait just a minute...
-Don't interrupt.

401
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,541
Will do and say whatever it takes
to get results.

402
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:38,148
Which is why you and me are going
into business together, Jersey.

403
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,409
Excuse me?

404
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,781
I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs
from the university

405
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,446
and giving them the patents to my ideas.

406
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,353
They don't value my work. You do,

407
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,788
which is why I'm setting up my own shop.

408
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,260
Figure any dude in a business suit

409
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
can help me raise venture capital
and run the company,

410
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,161
but who's gonna be half as motivated as
a dad who's trying to save his own kids?

411
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,101
So, this is...

412
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,673
So this is the shittiest offer
you're ever gonna get.

413
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,768
I can promise you less money, longer hours,
lousy working conditions,

414
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,838
plus, if we raise the money,
you're gonna have to relocate to Nebraska.

415
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,011
And with the right business plan,

416
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,058
I can also promise you
a working enzyme for Pompe disease.

417
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,695
I can't cure your kids, you know that.
They're always gonna be in wheelchairs,

418
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,728
but I think I can save their lives.

419
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,571
Outstanding cobbler.

420
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,975
Okay, okay.
So, we agree we can't uproot the kids.

421
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,944
What if Stonehill fails?

422
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,391
Or what if he succeeds too late
to help Megs and Patrick?

423
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,825
-Then what?
-I know.

424
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:03,627
If we're gonna lose them young, you want
to spend every minute you can with them.

425
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,539
John, that day that you flew to Nebraska,

426
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,172
when you suddenly just ditched work and...

427
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,143
My God, I thought you'd lost it.
You scared me.

428
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,449
But once we rolled our sleeves up,

429
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,790
and we started fundraising
and meeting other Pompe families,

430
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,667
it made me feel like...

431
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,331
I mean, do we just accept our fate

432
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:43,032
and do what we're told
by all the well-meaning doctors

433
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,176
and wait for the worst to happen,
or do we fight it?

434
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,681
I think you're making a mistake. I really do.

435
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,382
Even if you were credible as a CEO,
which you are not,

436
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:05,661
the odds against you are crushing.
Nine out of 10 biotechs crash and burn.

437
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,995
So where does that leave your kids
when their dad is flat broke

438
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,162
with no job and no health insurance?

439
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,530
Now, if you stay at Bristol,

440
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,872
the guys upstairs are ready to put you in
the VP slot at the end of the third quarter

441
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,172
with a 40%% salary bump.

442
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,174
John.

443
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,814
Your family's gonna need that money,
aren't they?

444
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,650
Pete, you're right. This is crazy.

445
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,924
I'm chasing the wind.

446
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,162
But I can't just

447
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,361
sit around and wait for my kids to die.

448
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,828
I can't do it.

449
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,362
You have arrived at your destination.

450
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
Come on in. It's open.

451
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,742
-Hey, there, Bob.
-Hey, John.

452
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,873
How are you?

453
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,248
-You have trouble finding me?
-No problem.

454
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,116
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

455
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,829
Ex-wife. She loved cats.

456
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,297
Well, say, what do we...

457
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,903
What are we gonna do?
How about we work up a strategy

458
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,808
for the meeting at Renzler next week?

459
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,949
We don't need to show those guys anything.

460
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,784
The meeting's a formality.

461
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,446
George Renzler and I have known each other
since med school.

462
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,390
He's been telling me for years that
he'd give me the seed money

463
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,930
if I ever decide to make the big move
and set up my own shop.

464
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,591
Well, that's good. That's good,
but, still, all the same, you know,

465
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,260
if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em,
we should have something tangible.

466
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,533
Those guys understand me.
They're real scientists.

467
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,775
They're not like a lot of
these big biotech moneymen.

468
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,746
Okay. All right, tell you what,
how about if we just talk it through,

469
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,612
and then that way we can just sketch up
something rough on paper?

470
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,017
You give it to me,
I'll make up a business plan.

471
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,761
We need to rough out a real strategy.
These guys are venture capitalists.

472
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,027
That rough enough for you?

473
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,135
Bob? Look, Renzler's crucial to us. Without
them onboard, we got zero credibility

474
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,140
-with any of our investors.
-That's why you're here, Jersey!

475
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,506
Whip up some business bullshit
by tomorrow.

476
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,342
-I'm going fishing.
-This is... This is gibberish!

477
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,349
Then you better get busy.

478
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,850
See you.

479
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,601
As you know, the market potential
for an orphan drug is enormous.

480
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,337
If you were still in business school,
I'd give you an A

481
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,711
for all these lovely charts and graphs and...

482
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,048
But school is out.

483
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,054
Most of us here are scientists.
We need to see the science.

484
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,389
Bob, make us believe.

485
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,925
Love to, George.

486
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:18,912
...the phosphotransferase
and the second uncovering enzyme...

487
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,188
At this point, the challenge
is to scale up this process

488
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,953
to produce kilogram quantities of HPGAA.

489
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,153
And the question is
whether or not it's cost-effective

490
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:36,733
to contract this work out
or to build our own manufacturing facility.

491
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:41,999
Either way, we're gonna eventually need
an investment on the order of $10 million.

492
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,734
It's a lot of information
in a short period of time.

493
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,538
Does anybody have any questions?

494
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,613
-This is astonishing.
-Well, thank you, George.

495
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,614
This man is light years ahead of the field.

496
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,247
Okay.

497
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,013
Well, why don't you have your money guys
get together with John

498
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,851
-and work out the business...
-Sounds great.

499
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:04,018
Of course, we'll need you to explain
some of the mundane stuff, Bob,

500
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,959
the nuts and bolts.

501
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,597
-Nuts and bolts? What...
-Yeah.

502
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,223
You're a brilliant theoretician,

503
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:14,327
but you've never actually brought
a new drug to market before, right?

504
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,872
No, I've never brought a drug to market.
I haven't.

505
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:21,809
I mean, for example, how are you getting
the phosphotransferase?

506
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,604
I'm purifying it
out of a lactating bovine udder.

507
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,543
I see. And where are you getting the udders?

508
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,246
From the stockyards.

509
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,985
-Pretty straightforward stuff.
-Not really.

510
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,824
-You can't inject cow protein into people.
-I know that.

511
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,593
The bovine version of the enzyme
is for lab work, for proof of concept.

512
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,296
I'll make a copy of the human enzyme
for actual drug trials.

513
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,668
-What about uncovering enzyme?
-What about it?

514
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,001
How exactly do you plan on making

515
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,303
-an exact replica?
-I'm making it in T-293,

516
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,934
out of human kidney cells.

517
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:58,139
-Oh, my goodness. No.
-"Oh, my goodness. No?"

518
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,910
No. The FDA will never allow that.

519
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,884
-Hey, Bob, just...
-Wait a second.

520
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,650
For Christ's sake, we will change
the cell line before clinical trials.

521
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,659
You've gotta have that process locked down
long, long before you think about...

522
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,353
Bob, why don't we just take a coffee break...

523
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,954
Why are you talking to me this way?
I don't want any goddamn coffee.

524
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,295
Bob, can you just tell us
how you're planning to make

525
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,201
the three enzymes
under FDA-approved GMP in...

526
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,468
I'm not here to cross every "t"
and dot every "i", George.

527
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,671
And I'm not here to be poked and prodded
like a first-year med student.

528
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,111
-This is ridiculous.
-Bob.

529
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,178
This is bullshit.

530
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,481
Bob.

531
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,730
Bob, if you can't answer a question,
you say you're working out the details.

532
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,271
You don't storm out on these guys
like some sort of spoiled child, okay?

533
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,897
-Now, we're gonna go back in there.
-No, I'm not going back in there.

534
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,637
We're going back in there.
This is business, Bob. It's not personal.

535
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,804
That was personal.

536
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,922
Stonehill goes and completely sabotages
the meeting.

537
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,082
Thank you.

538
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,956
I mean, he completely blew my plan,
right out of the gate.

539
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,463
Okay, I get that he's a loose cannon,
but do you still believe in his science?

540
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:26,400
Honey, if I don't raise $10 million in capital,

541
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,666
his science doesn't matter. At all.

542
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,645
What's going on with his arm?

543
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,716
Hey, buddy, you okay?

544
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,847
-You all right?
-I can't throw them anymore.

545
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,519
-When did this happen?
-I don't know.

546
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,723
-You should help him, Daddy.
-That's a good idea.

547
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,732
Okay, here we go. You ready?

548
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,133
-One, two...
-lnto the water.

549
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,899
That was a good shot.
We can do better than that.

550
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,910
Try again.
Let's make, like, a little pellet.

551
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,342
Here, ducky, ducky.

552
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,680
Let's do it again.

553
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,213
Ready? One, two, three.

554
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,520
Give me another piece, John.

555
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,752
I can just throw them.

556
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,099
And you do all the laughing,
and I'll do all the throwing.

557
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:32,996
That's good, the ducky shared.

558
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,900
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

559
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,539
John?

560
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,108
-We're out of time.
-I know.

561
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,688
He doesn't have the strength
to throw a piece of bread to a duck.

562
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,030
-lt scares the hell out of me.
-Me, too.

563
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,098
John, what are you doing?

564
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,903
I'm offering Renzler a deal
he can't turn down.

565
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,657
Excuse me. Morning. Dr. Renzler?

566
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,927
Dr. Renzler?

567
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,335
Sir, good morning.

568
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,933
-John Crowley.
-Crowley?

569
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,168
-Yes, sir.
-What are you doing here?

570
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,265
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

571
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,437
I understand from your secretary that
you're going to be leaving for France

572
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,741
-for a month.
-That's right.

573
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,339
I have a proposal for you,
and I was hopeful

574
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,850
-that you could take a look at it.
-We're running late for a flight.

575
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:59,411
I appreciate that. It'll only take a second,
just to have a quick read.

576
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,684
-Fine. I'll read it in the car.
-lt might interest you.

577
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,191
Good, thank you.

578
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,467
-Does Stonehill know about this?
-Of course.

579
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,115
And he's okay with these terms?

580
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,616
All I need is your signature.

581
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,472
Hello?

582
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,379
Bob.

583
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,819
Bob.

584
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,853
Bob!

585
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,396
Over here.

586
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,725
Bob.

587
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,497
Bob!

588
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,766
Hi. Bob.

589
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,311
What'd you do to yourself?

590
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,221
-I got the investment from Renzler.
-You what?

591
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,384
Listen, I want you to

592
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,696
think about something before you read that.

593
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,855
What the hell is this?

594
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:52,402
Under the circumstances,
this is the best deal that we could ever get.

595
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:57,236
This isn't a deal.
This is the terms of our surrender, for...

596
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,502
Renzler comes in
for a couple of million now,

597
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,704
and you give him the option
of jumping in as a full partner later?

598
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,873
Well, after sabotaging our meeting,
I had to do something dramatic.

599
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,441
And you promise him
we'll be in clinical trials in a year?

600
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,645
We can do this, Bob. All right?

601
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,779
We work harder, we push ourselves,
we work around the clock.

602
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,188
I already work around the clock!

603
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,057
Why don't you just give 'em
my balls in a jelly jar?

604
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,562
There's no other way I could get them
to come back to the table.

605
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,929
Who needs the bastards anyway!

606
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:28,698
Without Renzler, there's no reason for us
to even think about other venture groups.

607
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,672
Fine! Then I won't think
about other venture groups!

608
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,174
Great!

609
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:38,374
Spend the rest of your life dreaming up
great ideas that don't get funded.

610
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,748
Draw brilliant diagrams on the wall
that cure diseases in theory,

611
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,585
but never help a single human being
in reality.

612
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,860
What'd you do? Let me see it.

613
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,485
-It's just barely...
-Let me see.

614
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,633
Put pressure on it.

615
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,971
Got your blood all over this thing.

616
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,345
Want me to add a drop of mine,
make it official?

617
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,686
Or would a signature suffice?

618
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,061
Bob?

619
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:55,182
I'm not paying a dollar more
than 22,000 a unit, okay?

620
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,274
I'm not doing it.

621
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,217
Hi, Bob.

622
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,230
These guys make me feel old.

623
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,100
Scientists get all sensible and careful
when they get old.

624
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,535
Young ones like risk,

625
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,834
not afraid of new ideas,

626
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,074
and you can pay 'em less.

627
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:30,585
We all believe in Bob Stonehill's
bold vision, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

628
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,918
But to reach clinical trials inside of a year,

629
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:39,459
I'm gonna have to ask you
to commit to a brutal schedule.

630
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:45,024
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches to Priozyme Time.

631
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,800
-How long?
-Three, four hours.

632
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,515
Well, if you can get it any quicker,
that'd be good.

633
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,173
I'll try.

634
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,489
Come on.

635
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,789
-Vinh, check the breakers.
-Got it.

636
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:22,161
-No, the whole building's out.
-Well, get the backup generator going.

637
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,231
-We...
-Wait, wait, wait.

638
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,970
You never bothered
to buy a backup generator?

639
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,739
We're in the middle of tornado country,

640
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,575
-for Christ's sake!
-Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist?

641
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:36,414
If I don't have my refrigeration back
in 45 minutes, I lose the whole cell line.

642
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,851
Four months of work pissed away!

643
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,890
It was never in the budget.
We never had the money for it.

644
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,851
-I'm sorry, sir. Your card, it's been denied.
-What?

645
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,757
It got maxed out.
I bought the roller bottle unit for the lab.

646
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,426
Shit, l...

647
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:00,304
Just pay me back by the end of the month,
or I lose my apartment.

648
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,571
Hi, here you go. Thanks.

649
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:06,943
Yes!

650
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,046
Yes!

651
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,053
Sir.

652
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,794
Thank you.

653
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,574
Fiona's in Mexico this week.
They've got pyramids there.

654
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,014
She's still got lots of things to see
before she gets to Antarctica.

655
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,414
Yeah.

656
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,726
She's gonna chop up
all the penguins with an ax.

657
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:54,285
And feed their bloody
remains to the walruses.

658
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,963
I see.

659
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:58,858
What?

660
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,029
Every time you come home for the weekend,
you don't even listen to me.

661
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,469
Megs.

662
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,998
You know what, you're right. I'm sorry.

663
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,670
It's just that I've been so busy

664
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,873
trying to make the special medicine
for you and Patrick.

665
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,747
-I want it pink.
-You want what?

666
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,946
The special medicine. I want it to be pink.

667
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,522
Okay. I guess I can ask Dr. Stonehill.

668
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:28,860
Tell him dark pink, like this.
Not light pink. That's for babies.

669
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,160
Okay.

670
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,364
Here you go.

671
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,840
Dr. Renzler, be reasonable.
The company is only six months old,

672
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,935
and we are making great progress
towards in vivo testing.

673
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,810
I don't know.
The way the company is burning money...

674
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,213
Well, we've got to get a leg up
on the competition.

675
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,685
You know that Zymagen has
far more spending power than we do.

676
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,018
So, what you're saying,
I should have invested in Zymagen.

677
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,287
No, what I'm saying is,
is that we've got to beat 'em to the punch.

678
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,794
Either that, or scare them into buying us out.

679
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,729
Well, you're scaring us investors a hell of
a lot more than you're scaring Zymagen.

680
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,102
You sell the company to Zymagen,

681
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,897
you're in clinical trials
by the end of the fiscal year,

682
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,497
or we pull the plug and cut our losses.
Goodbye.

683
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,339
Hello?

684
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,186
This construct's looking pretty good,

685
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:33,388
but we gotta get better cleavage
between the alpha and the beta subunits.

686
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,363
Well, what if we add a furin site
like the one in uncovering enzyme?

687
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,093
Why would you wanna do that?
Doesn't it have its own...

688
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,395
We need to talk.

689
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,129
-I'm busy.
-You're always busy.

690
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,761
You always wanna talk.

691
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:47,434
Yeah, we could add furin
and try and cleave it before purification.

692
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,970
What are you doing?

693
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,481
-Giving you a preview...
-Guys, would you excuse us for a minute?

694
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:57,815
...of what's going to happen
if we are not in clinical trials in four months.

695
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,719
Our investors will turn out the lights.

696
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,293
Science takes time, Jersey.
Don't they understand?

697
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,227
Yeah, they do.
They can read the Wall Street Journal.

698
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,097
They see that Zymagen
is testing three different Pompe drugs.

699
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,898
They're testing three 'cause they don't know
what the hell they're doing.

700
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:19,407
-I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one!
-I know. I believe you, Bob.

701
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,477
Why else do you think
I put up with all your shit?

702
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,807
Look.

703
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:30,752
I want you to go toe-to-toe
with Zymagen's scientists.

704
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:34,585
-Prove to them that your enzyme is best.
-I can do that.

705
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,954
That's the reason I've entered
into conversations with them

706
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,358
to buy our company.

707
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,794
You're telling me? You're not asking me?

708
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:46,267
Come on, Bob.
I am just being fiscally responsible.

709
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,032
Nobody is gonna tell me how to run my lab!

710
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,667
If I can engineer a deal,
and that is a really big "if,"

711
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,302
you're going to have to forgive me
for all the money I'm gonna make you.

712
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,347
I don't care about money.

713
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,407
I'm a scientist.
I care about more important things than that.

714
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,855
Don't you tell me about
more important things to care about.

715
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,716
Do the math.

716
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:16,029
Either we sell the company
and get a huge cash infusion,

717
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,361
or the investors will shut us down.

718
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,075
Where you going?

719
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:40,623
I'm gonna go take a crap,
if that meets with your fiscal approval.

720
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:03,040
What, they can't drive from the airport
like ordinary people?

721
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,614
Bob, we need to make this happen.

722
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,744
They're gonna ask us some tough questions.

723
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:14,350
Don't take 'em personally, all right?
All right?

724
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,527
These lab results confirm
what I've been preaching for years,

725
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,472
that phosphorylation is key
to enzyme absorption.

726
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,812
My theory works for Pompe,

727
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,781
and eventually it'll work for
enzyme replacement therapies

728
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,648
for other lysosomal storage disorders.

729
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,382
-ls it too complicated?
-Too complicated?

730
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:51,517
The number of variables built into
your approach are mind-boggling.

731
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,961
I mean, Jesus, if you get even
one piece wrong in the synthesis,

732
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,124
just one carbohydrate ends up
in the wrong position...

733
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,533
Well, it's gotta be done right,
like anything worth doing.

734
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,835
You've never actually gotten
a drug approved.

735
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:09,844
Isn't it naive to think you can solve
these kinds of manufacturing challenges?

736
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,812
Bob? Bob?

737
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,818
You're right, I'm a theory guy.

738
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,987
My head is in the clouds.

739
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,057
Which is why we need you.

740
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,932
Unless, of course, your reputation

741
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,904
for solving protein-manufacturing problems
is undeserved.

742
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,441
Nice one.

743
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:47,380
-I still need to hear about profitability.
-Certainly, certainly.

744
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:53,287
As you know, this is not
a one-time treatment. It's a lifelong therapy.

745
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,186
And these patients,

746
00:59:55,291 --> 01:00:01,230
they are going to generate revenue
over the span of their lifetime that is...

747
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,461
But even if you make a usable enzyme,
clearly it won't work for all patients.

748
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:09,060
So, what survival rate do we need
to achieve a robust profit?

749
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:13,131
What rate of patient death
can be defined as acceptable loss?

750
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,068
Acceptable loss?

751
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,945
I understand the question.

752
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:32,595
Because the profit margins on this
orphan drug are so incredibly high, the...

753
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:39,697
Even with a mortality rate of,
say, 25%% over five years still indicates

754
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:45,763
that there is a highly lucrative
revenue source to be realized.

755
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,087
Gentlemen, we have a deal.

756
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,505
Dr. Robert Stonehill to see Barry Renee.

757
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:00,212
I have a Dr. Robert Stonehill
to see Dr. Renee.

758
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,343
-Sir, you need to be cleared.
-I'm just gonna use the restroom.

759
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,356
-You need to be cleared to do that, sir.
-Just need to...

760
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,689
-You need a security badge.
-Jesus.

761
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,992
Well, can I have a security badge
so I can go take a pee?

762
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,897
Yes, sir. He will give that to you.

763
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,838
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, John.

764
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,075
You getting comfortable?

765
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,885
Define "comfortable."

766
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,451
You haven't cashed it yet?

767
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,418
I haven't earned it yet.

768
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,455
I'll cash it when we have a usable enzyme.

769
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:11,512
Well, it sure is beautiful.

770
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,290
It sure is big.

771
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,160
The kids love it.

772
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,099
Seize the day.

773
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:36,875
Okay.

774
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,080
I'm stuck on this call.

775
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:52,355
Just wanted to let you know how thrilled
we are to have you onboard, John.

776
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,088
It's an honor.

777
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,924
-You remember Dr. Kent Webber.
-Of course.

778
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,432
-It's good to see you again.
-Good to see you, too.

779
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,401
I'll let the two of you get into it.

780
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,667
-I'm expecting great things.
-Yes, sir.

781
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:13,446
I've got some pretty good ideas
about how to help the flow of information

782
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,540
between the four core enzyme groups.

783
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,052
Whoa, John, slow down.
That's not our established procedure.

784
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,247
Pardon me?

785
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,190
The four core teams are essentially
in competition with each other.

786
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,285
It's an entrepreneurial model. It works.

787
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:32,095
I'm all for competition,
but surely there must be some channel

788
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:38,868
for allowing sharing scientific insights
that can help develop all four enzymes.

789
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:43,975
John, in the interest of saving us time,
let me be blunt.

790
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,443
Most of the scientists here don't like the idea

791
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,646
of having a non-scientist
as senior VP of the Pompe program.

792
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,214
Especially one whose objectivity

793
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:59,055
might be clouded
by having children with the disease.

794
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,393
I'm telling you this
in your own best interests.

795
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,299
Erich wanted to buy Stonehill's ideas,

796
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:11,032
and he couldn't do that without also
swallowing you as part of the pill.

797
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,872
My advice to you, John,
is to keep your head down.

798
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,342
-Thank you for that wisdom.
-You're very welcome.

799
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:29,525
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!

800
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:31,493
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!

801
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,085
This is my lab now! Get out!

802
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,426
I'm just trying to explain the protocol!

803
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,501
-You're wasting my time.
-Dr. Stonehill...

804
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Fine.

805
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,540
What do you want?

806
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:54,273
I just dropped by to say that I think
that we might be missing an opportunity

807
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,250
to open a dialogue
with the other three core teams.

808
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,947
The other core teams? Core teams.

809
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,580
Core bullshit.

810
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,789
I'll come back another time.

811
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,626
The decline in muscle strength
is very troubling, of course,

812
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,068
but it's really, in both kids,

813
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:20,734
the organ enlargement, the liver,
and especially the heart,

814
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,641
that's the real threat to their lives.

815
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,677
We'll continue to monitor
the rate of cardiac enlargement.

816
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,877
-We'll keep tabs on their other organs...
-How long?

817
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,217
-I don't like to predict.
-Please.

818
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,225
Dr. Waldman, we won't hold you to it.
We just need to know something.

819
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,885
John.

820
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,962
How much more time do we have?
How long?

821
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,967
Well,

822
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,970
if there's another respiratory crisis,
all bets are off,

823
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,441
but otherwise,

824
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,344
Megan, maybe a year.

825
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,351
Patrick, less.

826
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,390
Thank you.

827
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,502
Marcus.

828
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:27,667
-Get the phone.
-What?

829
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,745
-The phone.
-Who is it?

830
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,379
-Hello?
-Hi. Is that Marcus?

831
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,508
-Yeah, yeah. What time is it?
-Yeah, I'm sorry. It's late.

832
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,383
-It's John Crowley.
-John, what you doin'?

833
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,816
You okay?

834
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,726
Hey, look, I gotta ask you a favor.

835
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,190
-Morning, Gavin.
-Morning, sir.

836
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,892
Is my 1 1:00 with Henessey confirmed?

837
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:56,836
Yes, and there's the breakfast meeting
down in the cafeteria.

838
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,338
Breakfast meeting?

839
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,001
There was an e-mail that came in
over the weekend.

840
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,907
Everyone on the Pompe project was invited.

841
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,980
-Who called the meeting?
-Mr. Crowley, I believe, sir.

842
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,379
What?

843
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:16,418
Something that people ask me all the time
is how we have two kids with Pompe.

844
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,355
By the time we realized
that Megan had Pompe,

845
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,457
I was already pregnant with Patrick.

846
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,365
I mean, I can't tell you
how many doctors we saw,

847
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,199
and the message was always the same,

848
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:32,502
that there is no drug to treat Pompe.

849
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:36,442
But thanks to you, all of you,
that message is changing.

850
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:41,005
What you've given us,
and a lot of other families, is hope.

851
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,675
So, thank you.

852
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,784
Good job, Aileen.

853
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,651
Now I'd like to welcome the Temple family,

854
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,787
who've come all the way from Georgia
to be with us here today.

855
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,231
Thanks, John.

856
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,602
Hi.

857
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,770
I'm Marcus.

858
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,075
This is my wife, Wendy.

859
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:17,084
Our daughter Lauren, our oldest daughter,

860
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:22,146
Lauren wanted to come today
and say hi to all you guys.

861
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,683
She's a little weak,

862
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:30,925
but she wanted us
to show you guys her picture

863
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,061
and to send you her love.

864
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,201
And this is our daughter, Megan.

865
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,743
The most beautiful girls are named Megan.

866
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,975
Megan is four months old,
and you can't see it yet,

867
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,341
but she has Pompe, too.

868
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,665
I...

869
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,639
I can't tell you what it means to us

870
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:17,711
to have all of you working on a medicine
for our children.

871
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,881
Thank you.

872
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,318
Thanks so much.

873
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,894
-Hey, Kent.
-John.

874
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,631
So what did you think of the event?

875
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:54,515
In medical research, John,
objectivity is key.

876
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,112
If researchers get all emotional,

877
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:03,817
all desperate to help suffering patients,
they'll cut corners.

878
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,120
It's counterproductive.

879
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:09,960
Counterproductive is having
four core teams of scientists

880
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:14,502
working together on the same disease,
but not talking to each other.

881
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,370
Most of these guys have never
even seen a kid with Pompe before.

882
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,237
I don't see how that's relevant.

883
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:24,608
Did you see Erich?
That's the kind of motivation that we need.

884
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:29,150
I'm gonna ask him to get the core team
to stop competing, start working together.

885
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,515
Create a leadership team.

886
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,150
Well, if you hope to sell
this leadership team idea,

887
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,454
there's only one way to convince Erich.

888
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:40,892
And what's that?

889
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,863
Keep your guy, Stonehill, off the team.

890
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:50,228
In his short tenure here, he's managed to
alienate a remarkable number of colleagues.

891
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:53,331
You can't put him on a team
that's supposed to build cooperation.

892
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:57,435
So, decide how badly
you want your leadership team,

893
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,380
then do what you have to do.

894
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,928
That's it.

895
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,771
Dr. Stonehill, please.

896
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,732
Turn it down. Yes.

897
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,106
Yes, the music.

898
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,245
I said down!

899
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,781
This guy's impossible.

900
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,682
I like that song.

901
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,687
Hey.

902
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,297
What's up, John?

903
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,829
-Everything all right at home?
-Yeah.

904
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,807
Have you heard that Erich Loring

905
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,211
has agreed to put together
a leadership team?

906
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,314
Yeah, I heard some rumor about it.
What bullshit.

907
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:15,721
Now I'm gonna have to spend a couple of
hours a week jawin' with Zymagen guys?

908
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,885
No.

909
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,129
No. No, you won't,
'cause I'm not putting you on the team.

910
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,293
What'd you say?

911
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,397
I really wanted to.

912
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:29,966
You're not putting me on the team?
Is that what you said?

913
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,836
What are you, some varsity track coach?

914
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:38,980
They didn't buy our company 'cause
they like your lvy League charm, Jersey.

915
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:41,011
It's me they wanted.

916
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:44,847
You can't bench me.
It's against the laws of nature.

917
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:48,980
You're still gonna be able
to prove that your theory is right.

918
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:54,256
Yeah, but other scientists are gonna
evaluate my results, right? Not me.

919
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:58,595
Everyone here reveres your science.

920
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,831
This is about interpersonal issues.

921
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:08,202
-Who put you up to this?
-The decision was mine.

922
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,040
It's for the overall good of the program.

923
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,878
"For the overall good of the program."

924
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,553
Wow, John, you really got
the corporate lingo down good.

925
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:22,249
What's next, "Acceptable loss?"

926
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:39,899
No.

927
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,600
Does anybody really know how to do this?

928
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,301
Except for us.

929
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,949
-But wait, who's going?
-It's John's turn still.

930
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,713
Nice one.

931
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,084
Okay. I'll get it.

932
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,062
Nice one, Megs.

933
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,292
Hello? Marcus, hi.

934
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,327
Oh, my God.

935
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,804
Man. I almost got 'em down.

936
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,135
You guys sit tight, okay?
Here, John, grab him.

937
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:17,405
If there is anything we can do,
anything at all, will you call?

938
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:21,279
Okay.
We love you guys so much.

939
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,143
Okay, bye-bye.

940
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,686
Aileen.

941
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,116
That was Marcus Temple.

942
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,526
Lauren...

943
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,093
She...

944
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:43,232
He said she went in her sleep,
that it was peaceful.

945
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,930
How old is she?

946
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,208
How old was Lauren?

947
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,643
Lauren was nine years old.

948
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,782
Come here.

949
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,904
That way, we can be certain
that we're developing the correct one.

950
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:25,306
Forget certainty, and let's try and figure out
which enzyme has the better odds.

951
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,142
If we develop only one enzyme,

952
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,415
what would happen
if we guessed the wrong one?

953
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,514
Mr. Crowley, I've asked Kent
to set up a testing protocol

954
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,820
to help us guess right.

955
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,428
We'll do an exhaustive range of tests.

956
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:46,262
I'm calling it
"The Mother of All Experiments."

957
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:52,730
The four enzymes will be color-coded,
yellow, blue, green and magenta,

958
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,933
and known only by those color codes

959
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:58,274
so no researcher will know
which one he's testing.

960
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:02,713
Only after we pick a winner,
the secret identity will be revealed.

961
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,219
Come on, Megan!

962
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,030
But I want to!

963
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,138
-Just roll your wrist.
-I can't.

964
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,279
It's okay. It's all right. Let's try another one.

965
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,911
Okay. Let's try again. Ready?

966
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,557
Ready?

967
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,821
One, two, three, go!

968
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,564
-Big winner!
-Yay!

969
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,101
Here you go, look at that. You got a penguin.

970
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,782
Hey, Bob. Bob.

971
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,477
How you doin'?

972
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,184
I brought you some ribs.

973
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,362
Not as good as the ones
from The Corner Saloon,

974
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,490
but if you're hungry...

975
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,839
What do you want?

976
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,443
The results.

977
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,884
"Mother of All Experiments."

978
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,283
Well,

979
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,617
which enzyme did they choose?

980
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,288
The leadership team
spent the whole afternoon arguing.

981
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,833
Two enzymes, coded yellow and green,
are ahead of the others,

982
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,232
but it's too close to call.

983
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:06,466
Tomorrow, we spend the day hashing it out
to decide which one to choose.

984
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,905
Bob. I'm asking you to read this.

985
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,983
I value your opinion
more than anyone else in the world.

986
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,644
Well, maybe you should have valued
my opinion a little sooner,

987
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,315
instead of playing hatchet man
for the bean counters.

988
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,987
-Get the hell out of my lab.
-It's in your interest to know about this, Bob.

989
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,498
Get out.

990
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,229
-Wouldn't it benefit you...
-Get out.

991
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:04,291
The green enzyme's the best.
Show 'em my analysis, they'll understand.

992
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,095
Hey, wait up, Bob.

993
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,968
Is the green enzyme yours?

994
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:14,041
I recognize patterns in the results.
I'd know my baby a mile away.

995
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,610
-So the green one is yours?
-No.

996
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,737
No, it's not.

997
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,647
My theory is still the best,
but it's not ready for manufacture.

998
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:30,085
Theirs is crude and uninspired,
but it's ready.

999
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,161
Bob, I don't even know the words
to say thank you.

1000
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,631
Don't bother.

1001
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,826
I didn't do it for you.

1002
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,048
Yes, it is!

1003
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,822
-Oh, my gosh. Do you see the kite up there?
-Yeah.

1004
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,049
That's so cool!

1005
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,852
Annie, careful!

1006
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,461
-Building a bastion.
-Right there. Yeah.

1007
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,726
-Three!
-Okay!

1008
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:47,927
Dad, like... Ready?

1009
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:51,472
-Dad, you promised no more phone calls.
-I know. I know I did, but...

1010
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,597
What's in there?

1011
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,005
We can take turns burying the phone
when I get back.

1012
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,668
Okay! I'll start digging a hole.

1013
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:59,406
-You hold that for a sec.
-John Crowley.

1014
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,712
John, it's Kent Weber.

1015
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,013
Kent, hey. Did you get
my suggested protocol for the clinical trials?

1016
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,548
Yeah.

1017
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,149
You made some
pretty optimistic assumptions

1018
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,057
about where our enzyme supply will be.

1019
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,893
I see.

1020
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:21,293
Well, what do you think
that a more realistic...

1021
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:27,171
John, I'll give it to you straight.
The clinical trial will be for infants only.

1022
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,876
Infants need so much less enzyme,

1023
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,777
and, as you know,
our initial supply will be so limited.

1024
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,980
And the drug has much higher odds
of being effective

1025
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,646
with infants than with older children.

1026
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,191
We have to consult Erich on this.
We have to consult Erich.

1027
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,626
I already did. He confirmed the decision.
Infants only.

1028
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,223
I understand your personal reasons for...

1029
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:59,235
These decisions have to be
made objectively, rationally.

1030
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,569
I'm sorry. I...

1031
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,269
I really am.

1032
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,464
Hold it, pal.

1033
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:27,470
-Mr. Crowley, what are you doin' in here?
-I was just...

1034
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,211
-You're not authorized.
-No... I can explain everything.

1035
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,184
What's the matter, Chuck?
Is there a problem?

1036
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,746
Yeah, there's a problem.
I got Mr. Crowley in here without clearance.

1037
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,223
That's my fault, now.

1038
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:43,559
I got busy in the lab, I sent Jersey boy here
to get me a couple jugs of enzyme.

1039
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,429
Sorry.

1040
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,068
Thanks, Chuck.

1041
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,645
Thanks for saving my ass.

1042
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,080
It's really big of you,

1043
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:13,786
especially after what went down between us.

1044
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,529
You mean your ruthless,
cold-hearted betrayal?

1045
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:25,830
Yeah, well, when I thought about it
from your point of view...

1046
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:31,671
Shit, if it was my kids dying, I wouldn't
have hesitated to crush you like a bug.

1047
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,525
Do you remember when we first met,

1048
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:53,828
and you told me that
I should stop chasing miracles

1049
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,836
and should go home and enjoy my kids,

1050
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,367
while they're still here?

1051
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,704
-Yeah.
-I made the wrong choice.

1052
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:27,624
-Jersey, you know what a sibling study is?
-No.

1053
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:32,604
It's a drug trial with just two patients
with the same genetic inheritance.

1054
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,607
Siblings, with the same disease.

1055
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,441
Megs and Patrick.

1056
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,714
Well, would Zymagen
go for something like this?

1057
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,585
There's real research value in it.

1058
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:52,021
And with just two patients,
it wouldn't take much enzyme.

1059
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:55,095
But Webber would have to sign off on it.

1060
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:59,756
Well, let's not tell him
till we've got our ducks in a row.

1061
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:05,203
I could draw up a protocol and see if I can
find a hospital willing to administer it.

1062
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:09,874
-Bob.
-Well, don't get your hopes up, kid.

1063
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,943
It's a Hail Mary.

1064
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,841
Ducks in a row.

1065
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,184
"Stonehill, careful review, protocol,
Sibling Trial,146,

1066
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,720
"are pleased to inform you Megan Crowley
and Patrick

1067
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:56,346
"have been accepted into the trial!"

1068
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:59,220
-I just got it.
-Quack, quack, quack.

1069
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:00,624
Have you talked to him yet?

1070
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:04,960
No. I did the science. You make the sale.

1071
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,267
Thank you.

1072
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,601
-Good luck.
-Right.

1073
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,278
-Does he have about five?
-He does, yeah.

1074
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,848
-Thanks.
-No problem, Mr. Crowley.

1075
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,719
Hey, Kent? Knock-knock.

1076
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,389
Got a minute?

1077
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,287
Kent?

1078
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,792
-Do you have any idea what you've done?
-Excuse me?

1079
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,390
We got a call this morning
from Portland Rose Hospital,

1080
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,662
about sending them enzyme for your kids?

1081
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,295
Right. Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.

1082
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:49,274
You and Stonehill set this up behind
my back. Now you come to me.

1083
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,277
It's all tentative.

1084
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,475
You want this company
to sponsor a drug study,

1085
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,917
for two children whose father
is an executive of this company?

1086
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,012
Have you never heard the term
"conflict of interest?"

1087
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,283
It has nothing to do with a...

1088
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,188
Do you know what the FDA would do
if they found out?

1089
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,490
There is strong scientific justification
for this study.

1090
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,461
There is great research value.

1091
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:13,693
I'm a doctor, John.
I know the research value!

1092
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,800
But you guys just can't go off half-cocked
without consulting us!

1093
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:19,873
And I'm sure that if we just go
and talk to Erich, we can...

1094
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,373
Erich already knows.

1095
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:25,310
-He's furious about being blindsided.
-I didn't try to blindside anyone.

1096
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,008
This is the reason
why we have a reporting structure,

1097
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,950
why we have established procedure,
why there is protocol.

1098
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,315
You heartless, bloodless machine.

1099
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:40,986
You just have to fight me
every step of the way! Don't you?

1100
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:44,963
You just hated it when I brought
the kids with Pompe to the doorstep!

1101
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:48,968
You weren't thinking about those kids when
you put your children into that program

1102
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:53,973
and jeopardized a decade's worth of
research investment made by this company!

1103
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,703
This is not about a return on an investment!

1104
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,540
It's about kids,

1105
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:02,143
kids with names, dreams,

1106
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,945
families that love them.

1107
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:10,819
You've jeopardized your chances
of ever getting your kids treated.

1108
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,585
I'm not arguing science with you!

1109
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,152
On every level!
On every level, you've stood...

1110
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:05,275
I was just drafting a letter of apology
for senior management,

1111
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,314
but I guess we're past that point.

1112
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:14,180
I just spoke to Erich,
and we are terminating your employment.

1113
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,790
Okay, I'll pack up my stuff.

1114
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,917
Just one thing, John.

1115
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:24,896
I may well be
a tight-ass pencil-pushing company man,

1116
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,297
but I resent being called heartless.

1117
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,801
-Look...
-Just let me finish.

1118
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:33,103
The reason we're terminating
your employment,

1119
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:36,176
is to eliminate the conflict of interest.

1120
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:41,280
This strategy was brought to my attention
by our colleague, Dr. Stonehill,

1121
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:43,475
in rather crude terms.

1122
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,247
This will allow the sibling trial to proceed

1123
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,650
for its purely scientific value.

1124
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:59,228
Have your desk cleared out
by the end of the day.

1125
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:02,362
Kent, what's with the...

1126
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,001
I wanted to make sure you didn't
punch me out before I could tell you.

1127
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:12,540
Well,

1128
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:18,382
-thank you very much for firing me.
-My pleasure.

1129
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:21,217
-I never liked you.
-Likewise.

1130
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,057
Hey, you guys,
bring anything you want extra...

1131
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,185
-Mom! Mom!
-What?

1132
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:30,058
-Can I bring the bow and arrow?
-Yes, yes.

1133
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:35,063
Hey!

1134
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,433
John, what...

1135
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:44,571
What?

1136
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:50,983
We have a usable enzyme
that's ready for clinical trials.

1137
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,821
When? When will it be ready?

1138
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:59,723
Megs and Patrick start their infusions
before the end of this month.

1139
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:01,954
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

1140
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:04,764
Oh, my God.

1141
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,161
John.

1142
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:10,861
Hey, John, Daddy's here.

1143
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:13,098
-Oh, hi, guys.
-Hey, Dad.

1144
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,737
Why is Mommy sad?

1145
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:19,609
Not sad, baby, so happy.

1146
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,281
So happy.

1147
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,285
Why is Mommy being so weird?

1148
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,049
Well, it's because
we got the special medicine

1149
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,592
for you, Megs, and for you, Patrick,
and you're gonna get it really soon.

1150
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:34,126
That's great!

1151
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:52,178
So, who wants to push the button?

1152
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,524
Megs, Patrick, you ready?

1153
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:29,979
When will we know if it's working?

1154
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,143
It'll be a while, honey.

1155
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,845
It's not pink.

1156
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:16,760
Excuse me?
Your Uncle Bobby is here.

1157
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,922
I don't know.

1158
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:29,635
-You can go back if you like.
-Okay.

1159
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,141
-John.
-Uncle Bobby.

1160
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,447
They wouldn't let me in unless I was family.

1161
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,251
-Some things for the kids.
-Thanks.

1162
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,953
Sleeping, huh?

1163
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:56,326
Hey, thanks for coming.

1164
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,401
I'm a scientist. Gotta track the experiment.

1165
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:16,311
I wish your enzyme was the one
that passed the test.

1166
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:22,285
But the one the kids are getting,
it's the right one, right? I mean...

1167
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,930
It's gonna help them.

1168
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,928
Yeah, you guys have done
everything humanly possible.

1169
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,271
We just have to see what the tests show.

1170
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:41,914
You and I have had our differences,

1171
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:45,508
and I just want you to know something.

1172
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,111
I want you to know that...

1173
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:50,019
-Yeah.
-Don't interrupt.

1174
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:51,352
Okay.

1175
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:57,054
I want you to know
that I appreciate everything

1176
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,064
that you've done for Megs and Patrick,

1177
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:02,761
and I'm never gonna forget it
for the rest of my life.

1178
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:08,441
Not gonna kiss me, is he?

1179
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,442
I will restrain him.

1180
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,540
Don't tempt me.

1181
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:20,684
Daddy loves SpongeBob,
Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1182
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:35,597
-Stop!
-Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1183
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:37,068
Guys?

1184
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:40,367
What's going on?

1185
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:43,504
What's so funny?

1186
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,072
What are you laughing at?

1187
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,243
What are you laughing at?

1188
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:53,416
Sugar.

1189
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,921
It's a sugar high.

1190
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:03,428
The enzyme's breaking down
the sugar in their muscles.

1191
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:06,021
-The medicine's working?
-Yeah.

1192
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:08,762
John.

1193
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:19,005
Megs!

1194
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:20,505
Hi.

1195
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,827
-John, drive safe!
-Enjoy the ride!

1196
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:45,829
Rock and roll!

1197
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:50,367
-Bye! Have fun.
-Bye!

1198
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:30,482
Yes!

1199
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,649
Yeah! Yeah!
