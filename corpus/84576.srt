1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,960
My whole life,
I always hated school.

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,600
Oh, thank you, Snowball.

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,920
No more Fs.

4
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
No more Fs.

5
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,880
All right, I admit it. I took
Mrs. Herman's grade book.

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,760
I set fire to it. I peed on it.
But before you pass judgement...

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,560
you got to hear
my side of the story.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,160
Let's go back to the beginning.

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
That's me in the window
over there, and that's my dad.

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Now, I was only
five years old...

11
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,160
but I already knew
that I hated school.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,320
You see, I had just
gotten over the chickenpox...

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,000
and I was having a little
trouble making friends.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
Can I play with you guys?

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,240
Why do you have dots
on your face?

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
Dot-face.

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,720
And then I met Sammy.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,760
Now, this kid
really hated school.

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,080
He hated teachers,
he hated coloring...

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,840
he even hated recess.

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
It was incredible.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Sammy, come on.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
Look at the big, chubby baby.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
It's disgusting.

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
What are you looking at?

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll be your friend.

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,120
Handsome.

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Sammy.

29
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,280
Now, Sammy was the worst
speller in the class...

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,880
and I felt really bad for him,
so I decided to help him out.

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
You stole the answers?

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:11,400
...C-l-O-P-A-T-H.

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
"Sociopath."

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,400
That's correct, Sammy.

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,800
You're the winner.

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,600
Sammy and l, we cheated our way
through elementary school.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,640
By the time we got
to junior high, we were experts.

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
You're late, Davis.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
Hey, relax, man.
Everything's cool.

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
I thought I told you
to come alone.

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,000
He's cool. He's my partner.

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,200
Evan Rosengarden.
When we needed a book report...

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,280
a term paper, or a science
project, we went to him.

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,400
he would do anything
for a little porn...

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,040
as long as it wasn't soft-core.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,680
This better not be soft-core.

47
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,680
I hate soft-core.

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,320
So does my dad.

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
It was a smooth operation...

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,440
Holy smokes.

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
until Rosengarden got sloppy.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
Yes, well, the reason
I'm calling, Mr. Davis...

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,640
is because your son
gave my son a dirty movie.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
And it was perhaps
the weirdest dirty movie...

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,880
that I've ever seen.

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,160
I want to know how
Handsome got his hands...

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,640
on something this...
super dirty.

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,920
Perhaps you should talk to him.

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Oh, don't worry. I will.

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,840
I most certainly will.

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
Handsome.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Yes, Daddy?

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,960
Listen...

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,200
Now, my dad's porn
was so weird...

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,920
there was no way
he was gonna talk about it.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,720
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,880
And the truth is...

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,040
that was the least
of his problems with me.

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,440
-Good night.
-Good night, Daddy.

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,440
I was the type of kid
that wouldn't even get up...

71
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,560
to go to school in the morning
without putting up a fight.

72
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Now, being a single parent
is never easy...

73
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,360
especially when your kid is me.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,120
I taught him that move.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
Basically, we were at war...

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,840
and I wasn't going
to let him win.

78
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,160
I am not going
to let you win!

79
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,920
Now, he used to threaten
to send me away all the time...

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,720
and I would threaten him
with running away from home.

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Sammy was always there
to talk me out of it.

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,560
That's a big-ass suitcase.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Listen, Handsome, I need
some help with geometry.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,680
You know, some secret help.

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
Geometry? I don't go
to school anymore.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,920
But everybody
has to go to school.

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
Not me.

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,040
Listen, Handsome, this is crazy.
Where are you gonna sleep?

89
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
Well, I'm not sleeping
at the nut house.

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,520
My dad told me that
they got kids there...

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
that eat their own shit
with a fork and knife.

92
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,320
-Really?
-Yes. Really.

93
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,560
Hello, world!

94
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,080
Now, this used to happen
all the time...

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,480
but Sammy knew that I was
always gonna come back...

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,680
and I was always
going to help him cheat.

97
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,840
Did you say something
about geometry?

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,000
You bet your frickin' ass
I did.

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,880
And by the time
we got to high school...

100
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Sammy and I had taken cheating
to a whole other level.

101
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
We had gone from
small-time spelling bees...

102
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,320
to mid-terms, finals,
and everything in between.

103
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,640
You name it, we stole it.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
Now, there were two other guys
we always worked with.

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,760
Everything's cool?

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,200
Now, Sammy and l
may have hated school...

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
but Victor hated everything.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,680
His motto was,
"l hate everything."

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,480
Now, we all took our jobs
very seriously...

110
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
You finished yet?

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,160
But nobody took it
as seriously as Applebee.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,560
Brilliance requires patience.

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,000
You see, he was the man
in charge of the crib sheets.

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,400
Now, every cheating outfit needs
a guy who can write small...

115
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,360
and this guy wrote crazy small.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
That is a masterpiece.

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
It should be hanging
in a museum.

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,440
I hate museums.

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
The four of us
were a real solid unit.

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,800
We were efficient,
we were loyal...

121
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,000
and we had our own copy
of the janitor's key.

122
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,640
Do you know
why I called you in here?

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Did I win some kind
of award or something?

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,160
No, you did not win any awards.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,200
Do you have something
you want to tell me?

126
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
I love you?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,360
Stand up.

128
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't understand.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,000
I said stand up.

130
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
That's a ball.

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,120
That's another ball.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
They like to travel together.

133
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,400
Marla, he doesn't
have them on him.

134
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I'd like you to schedule
an assembly for sixth period.

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,640
I know what you kids say
about me.

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,200
Well, I'm not a bitch.

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,160
I am not a lesbian.

138
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
I am not...Medusa.

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,600
You know, I wasn't always
a principal.

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,000
When I was your age...

141
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,280
every weekend, we'd go
to the wrong side of town...

142
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,760
so that we could listen
to live Negro music.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
Yes.

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Can I get my award now?

145
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Get out.

146
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
Now.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,920
OK, the cornerstone
of our operation was the key.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,600
-Everything's cool?
-It's cool.

149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,560
It opened every single door
in the school...

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
so we could steal any test
at any time.

151
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,520
Hey, guys, I saved
some seats for you.

152
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,840
The key is what put us on top.

153
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,200
Biology is killing me.

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,200
We love being on top.

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
I'd do anything for some help.

156
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,480
Or the bottom.
They're both good.

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,120
So, you're gonna
hook us up, right?

158
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,320
We'll talk later.

159
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,800
I heard a rumor that Stark
is shutting you guys down.

160
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,440
Everybody please take a seat.

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,640
Do I look shut down?

162
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
This isn't funny, Davis.

163
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,200
If I lose my eligibility...

164
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm gonna stab you.

165
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
Cribmaster.

166
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,120
See, everybody was looking
to get ahead...

167
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
and we always had the answers.

168
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm sorry about
the stabbing thing.

169
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
I overreacted.

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,840
You're the greatest.

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,800
This is the second time
I am asking you to be seated.

172
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
I will not ask again.

173
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,480
North Point Academy
is not a public school.

174
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,880
We do not have
public school problems--

175
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,560
no teen pregnancies,
no gunplay, no drug epidemics.

176
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Public school
is so much cooler.

177
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,680
We do, however, seem to be
in the midst of a crisis.

178
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Douchebag.

179
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Douchebag!

180
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,960
Will somebody
please get her out of here?

181
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh, that's classic.

182
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,160
She's not doing "dildo"
anymore?

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,680
No, she's back to "douchebag."

184
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,480
I had a telephone call
this morning...

185
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,200
from one of your parents...

186
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,960
who gave me some
very disturbing information.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,240
Apparently,
a group of seniors...

188
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,800
has gotten its hands
on a copy of the janitor's key.

189
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,040
I hate rats.

190
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,520
As we speak, a locksmith is
going throughout the school...

191
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
changing the locks
on every single door.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,440
No more tests will be stolen.

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,200
Pass it down. I want everyone
to get detention today.

194
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
Detention.

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
Detention.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,440
Sweet.

197
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
Trash bag.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
-Trash bag.
-Douchebag.

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,400
We got to do a job today.

200
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you have a head injury?

201
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,760
We've got to do a job today.

202
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,520
Stark's little threat has
everyone else running scared.

203
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,760
We do a job today,
we go down as legends.

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,680
Does anybody have
any tests coming up?

205
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,160
Does anyone know
of any test that's coming up?

206
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,040
How can there be no tests
coming up? This is school.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
But Teddy doesn't cheat.

208
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,120
I know all about Teddy.

209
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
Teddy.

210
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,400
Can I talk to you for a second?

211
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,160
As I'm sure you know...

212
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,840
me and my associates here
like to do favors for people.

213
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,280
You know my position.

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,480
Now, Teddy hated cheating.
As far as she was concerned...

215
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,480
the only true act of rebellion
was cursing out a teacher.

216
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,880
Just hear me out.

217
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,000
How many times have you
been forced to see Dr. Newman?

218
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,520
I don't know. Like, seven,
maybe eight times.

219
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,240
That guy is nosy.

220
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,520
He's the school psychologist.
That's his job.

221
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,800
Well, I don't care who he is.
That guy's nosy!

222
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,720
OK. What would you say
if I told you...

223
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
that I could get you
your file from his office?

224
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,080
You could read every little word
he's ever written...

225
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,080
about why you do...
what you do.

226
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,280
This one's free.

227
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,040
Spread the word.

228
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
We're still in business.

229
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Detention at our school...

230
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,760
meant helping the janitor
clean the building...

231
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,200
and that meant that there
was only one man...

232
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,880
standing in our way.

233
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
Oh, my God!

234
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,080
Somebody just puked in there!

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Puked.

236
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,280
You know...vomited?

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,720
Every day, somebody make
a puke in my school.

238
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,880
North-south elevator.

239
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,360
Mother of crap!

240
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm freaking out here, man.
Handsome's gone too far.

241
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
-We're not even stealing a test.
-What are you doing here?

242
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,680
You're supposed to be
by the elevator!

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,160
Well...I'm not.

244
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,640
Handsome Davis.

245
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,840
What's the matter with you?

246
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,320
When he's in there,
he's gonna look at my file.

247
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,320
I have secrets.

248
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
This is unacceptable!

249
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,760
Get your ass
back to the elevator.

250
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
I have a right to my privacy.

251
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,760
Now!

252
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
Teddy, Teddy.

253
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,280
I only have one question:

254
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
Where are...

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,960
your trash bags?

256
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
Something fish.

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,240
We're dead.

258
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,640
We're not dead.

259
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,760
There is a person up here.

260
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,920
I no understand.

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
He take sleep.

262
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
What you doing?

263
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
Where am l?

264
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
You're in my roof.

265
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,600
My school. My beauty.

266
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,720
He's panicking.

267
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
He's not panicking.
He's getting stronger.

268
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you think you could
help me down, 'cause...

269
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm a little scared of heights.

270
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,600
Help yourself!

271
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,800
You! You broke
my roof in my school!

272
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
My roof you broke!

273
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
No, I didn't.

274
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
I just see you there.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
It wasn't me.

276
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,840
-You up in roof.
-No, I wasn't.

277
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,320
You must be confusing me
with somebody else.

278
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
We can sit here all day
and argue...

279
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,080
but let's just agree...
to disagree.

280
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,600
Wait!

281
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,840
What's your name?

282
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
-My name?
-Yes.

283
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
My name is Jimmy Carter.

284
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,240
Jimmy Carter.

285
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,560
Your name?

286
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,680
Teddy Roosevelt.

287
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
Roosevelt. You?

288
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,960
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

289
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,760
There's no relation there.

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,760
Dude, we're screwed.

291
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
They actually were related.

292
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,920
You idiot.

293
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
He doesn't know that.

294
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
-You're racist.
-Shut up!

295
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,280
What is your name, huh?

296
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,240
Now, there were still plenty of
other presidents to pick from.

297
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,560
George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln...

298
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Zachary Taylor...

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,880
but Applebee, well,
Applebee was Applebee.

300
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,800
Napplebee.

301
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,600
This is all
because of you, Napplebee.

302
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,600
Stop calling me Napplebee.

303
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,560
You know, I should
kick your ass right now...

304
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Napplebee.

305
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Not my name.

306
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,120
I don't care what your name is.
I'm gonna kick your ass!

307
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
What about my ass?

308
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,800
You kick his ass,
you have to kick my ass.

309
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
I kick all ass.

310
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,160
Victor, count to ten.

311
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,000
Now, let me explain
something about Victor.

312
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,600
Victor was famous
for always having a plan.

313
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
I have a plan.

314
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,760
I think we should kick
Napplebee's ass.

315
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,920
That's not gonna happen.

316
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,560
The man abandoned his post
in the middle of a job.

317
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,760
He has to pay for his sins.

318
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
He writes crazy small.

319
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,600
All right, let's do this
one more time.

320
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,000
Applebee, what did you have?

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,440
I had a dream.

322
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,880
And in that dream,
you looked at my file.

323
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,880
Did you look at my file?

324
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,480
Applebee?

325
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,640
-I had a Nestle's Crunch.
-Excellent.

326
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,720
Anybody can make
a blanket denial...

327
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,120
but a great liar
gives you details.

328
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,080
No matter what
she says she knows...

329
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,280
all we gotta do
is give her the details...

330
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,640
because, my friends,
bullshit is in the details.

331
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,160
Were you up
in the ceiling yesterday?

332
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
I don't remember.

333
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,040
How can you not remember
whether or not...

334
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,720
you were up in the ceiling?

335
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
I'm not so good at memory.

336
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,160
Is he the one?

337
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes, that's him.

338
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Jimmy Carter.

339
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,600
Now, do you want to tell me
what you were doing...

340
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,120
in the ceiling?

341
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,200
You mean the ceiling
by the candy closet?

342
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,440
-What were you doing up there?
-I already told you.

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,920
I was getting candy.
I remember it distinctly.

344
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
I wanted a candy bar,
but I only had a $5 bill.

345
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,280
See, I only wanted
one candy bar...

346
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,200
but I was forced to buy five
because I didn't have any ones.

347
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,560
-I remember it distinctly.
-What are you talking about?

348
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You're the one who told us if
we didn't sell enough candy...

349
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
there'd be no senior trip.
I figured I'd climb up there...

350
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,040
Ieave the money,
and take the candy.

351
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,240
Are you trying to sabotage
the senior trip?

352
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,320
What I don't understand is,
what were Sammy, Victor...

353
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,880
and Jonathan doing
up there with you?

354
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,280
I can't eat five candy bars
by myself.

355
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,080
Applebee had a Nestle's Crunch,
Victor had a Snickers...

356
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,400
Sammy had two Snickers,
and I had a Reese's Pieces.

357
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,800
If you don't believe me,
ask one of the guys.

358
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,600
They'll say the same thing.

359
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Your friends told me...

360
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,080
they weren't actually
getting candy bars.

361
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,480
In fact, they admitted
they were cheating.

362
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,360
And they said you were
behind the whole thing.

363
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,560
Now...

364
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
you tell me the truth...

365
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,480
and I promise I won't be
that hard on you.

366
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,760
Jonathan Jacob Applebee.

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,240
Nestle's Crunch.
That's all I'm saying.

368
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,680
I am sick and tired
of your special ed bullshit!

369
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,440
Jonathan Jacob Applebee.

370
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
Nestle's Crunch.
That's all I'm saying.

371
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm still not sure
what it is...

372
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,800
you were doing
up in the ceiling...

373
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
We were getting candy.

374
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,520
but I know you weren't
getting candy.

375
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,240
I also know that you've been
pulling detention on purpose...

376
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,680
so that you could be alone
in school with Marty.

377
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,960
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

378
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,960
If I punish you for cheating...

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
it will have to go
on the permanent record...

380
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,560
so instead I am reducing it...

381
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,560
to destruction
of school property.

382
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,240
That'll be
three days suspension...

383
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,160
and your parents
have to come to school...

384
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,400
and I'm gonna tell them
what I'm telling you.

385
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,080
This is your final warning.

386
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,440
I hope you're happy.

387
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,440
I hope you're happy.

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,120
Three-day suspension.

389
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Is this how I brought you up?

390
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,560
Your behavior
is completely inappropriate.

391
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,160
Inappropriate?

392
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Two words:

393
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Dog porn.

394
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
I don't know what
you're talking about.

395
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
Don't bullshit me, Dad.

396
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
It was in the corner
of the closet.

397
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,680
All right, first of all--
First of all, all right--

398
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,960
What about...

399
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
the doberman?

400
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,080
Look...

401
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,800
I know I'm in no position
to preach to you.

402
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,080
I'm sure you don't even
respect me...

403
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,640
but I care about you,
and I care about your future.

404
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,280
And I am begging you--
begging you--

405
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,120
stop the cheating. Please.

406
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,480
Stop the cheating.

407
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
And I did stop cheating.

408
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,200
It lasted three days.

409
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
Somebody want to take
a stab at it?

410
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,520
Now, Mr. Harkin
was a real genius.

411
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,640
The problem was
that he was so smart...

412
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,480
no one ever had a clue
what he was talking about.

413
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,640
I can't believe
no one else knows this.

414
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,720
OK, let's get a couple
of things straight.

415
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,480
I don't like to have my
teaching methods questioned...

416
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,560
and I especially don't like it
when parents call me at home.

417
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,480
And I really don't like
to have to hear sob stories...

418
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,160
about how badly
certain students...

419
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,960
need to get
into Tufts University.

420
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,440
Mr. Shapiro, you don't need
to take notes on this.

421
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
Loser!

422
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,520
But you can write down
the following:

423
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,680
tomorrow's Regents' exam
will count as your midterm...

424
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,840
and no amount of parental
pressure will change that.

425
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,760
But that's not fair.

426
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,000
You haven't taught us any
of the material on the Regents'.

427
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,400
Well, everything will be covered
at today's review.

428
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,880
You know what?

429
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,760
I have taught in the heart
of a ghetto...

430
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,880
and none of those
ghetto kids...

431
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,080
were anywhere near as whiny
as any of you.

432
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,680
Did you get that, Mr. Shapiro?

433
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,040
Mr. Harkin?

434
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,760
I can't make the review 'cause
I have a doctor's appointment.

435
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,640
Well, unless you want
to fail my class...

436
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,360
I suggest you get your notes
from someone else.

437
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,000
Don't worry, Mr. Harkin.

438
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,360
I'll cover him.

439
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
This is bullshit, man.
He never taught us anything...

440
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,720
from the Regents'.

441
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,600
He's just too lazy
to make up his own test.

442
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,560
You know what that means,
don't you?

443
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,320
Unpassable?

444
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,960
Unpassable.

445
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,720
Cheaters love to use
the word "unpassable."

446
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
Usually it's just bullshit,
you know?

447
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,840
A way to justify what we do.
In this case, however...

448
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,120
we truly were dealing
with an unpassable test.

449
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,200
You do the eyeball,
I'll do the crisis.

450
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,160
Which crisis?

451
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,520
"lf they're your friends,
they'll understand."

452
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,720
I don't like that one, man.

453
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
It's gross.

454
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,120
It works.

455
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
The best way
to distract a teacher...

456
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,120
is to manufacture
a teen identity crisis.

457
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,680
Mr. Harkin?

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Can I talk to you a minute?

459
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,480
Sure, Handsome.

460
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,840
Now, I could have exploited
my parents' divorce...

461
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
or faked an eating disorder,
but I knew an even better way...

462
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,040
to grab Mr. Harkin's attention.

463
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,160
Sometimes...

464
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,080
when I'm in
the locker room, and...

465
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,080
everybody gets...

466
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,440
naked...

467
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
I feel really funny.

468
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,160
Funny?

469
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
Funny how?

470
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
There's nothing wrong...

471
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,880
with admiring the male form.

472
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,720
Just don't stare at it
for too long.

473
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,840
It's frowned upon.

474
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,680
-So I'm not going to hell?
-Of course not.

475
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
God doesn't hate me.

476
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,760
Your God doesn't hate you.

477
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,040
What about my friends?

478
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,200
Well, if they're really
your friends...

479
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,160
then they'll understand.

480
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,200
Right. Let's get started,
everyone.

481
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,880
Hey, did I hear you guys...

482
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,440
doing a crisis on Harkin?
'Cause I am in.

483
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,960
Handsome?

484
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,080
Can I speak to you alone
for a second, please?

485
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,040
Yeah, give me one second.
I'll be right back.

486
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Thanks.

487
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,720
He has to pay
for his mistakes.

488
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,040
He's one of us.

489
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,760
He's good at what he does.
I admit it.

490
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
He writes crazy small.

491
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,120
Yeah, you know, you keep
saying that, but who cares?

492
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,800
Bottom line here:
Applebee broke protocol.

493
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,160
We have to shut him out now.
Teach him a lesson.

494
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,480
Just this once.

495
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,680
But you have to promise me
you'll start being cool again.

496
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
I promise.

497
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
What are you doing here?

498
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,080
Helping Sammy study.
What are you doing here?

499
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
The same.

500
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,880
Yeah.

501
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,640
I never really
understood Julie.

502
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,960
I mean, she actually
believed that hard work...

503
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,040
and determination would pay off.
What a sucker.

504
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,440
What are you looking at?

505
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,360
A woman.

506
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,720
It seems like only yesterday
she was just a girl, but now...

507
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,640
she's a woman.

508
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't know if it was
because of Julie...

509
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,480
or Mrs. Stark or what,
but Sammy started to change...

510
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,240
and I was not about
to let that happen.

511
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,880
Hey, man. What's up?

512
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,120
Why weren't you
at the review today?

513
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,200
I told you I had
a doctor's appointment.

514
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,000
A doctor's appointment.
I get it.

515
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,240
You're not going to school
tomorrow, are you?

516
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,840
You're gonna fake sick.
You're gonna retest.

517
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,440
It's the lowest form
of cheating.

518
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,520
I would never do the sick cheat.
I despise the sick cheat.

519
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm just using Julie's notes
to help me study.

520
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,480
She takes great notes.

521
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,560
So you must know it cold
by now then.

522
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,280
Yeah, I wish.

523
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,800
Well, let me give you
a few pointers.

524
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,120
"A." Excuse me. "B...

525
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,880
"D, D, A, B."

526
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,120
Get out.

527
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,280
You don't have to do anything.
The hard part's over.

528
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,400
We were lucky last time.

529
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,920
Nothing went
on our permanent record.

530
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,040
I like my permanent record
the way it is.

531
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,040
Lucky.

532
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,760
That's Julie talk.

533
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,760
Look, I've decided
to study. That's it.

534
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
OK.

535
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,880
All right.

536
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm leaving.

537
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,920
Here I go. Out the door.

538
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,840
But I have news for you.

539
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,240
There's no such thing
as a permanent record.

540
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,880
The permanent record
is something they invented...

541
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,760
to get inside your head with.

542
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,960
It only exists
if you believe in it.

543
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,920
-Really?
-Yes, really.

544
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,280
The greatest hoax
in the history...

545
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,720
of institutionalized
education...

546
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,360
is the myth
of the permanent record.

547
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,160
And let me tell you something.

548
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,240
Sammy Green is not
about to fall for it.

549
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
Do you know what this test is?

550
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,720
-Don't do this to me.
-Do you know what it is?

551
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,800
-You're a bad person.
-Do you know what it is?

552
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
It's unpassable.

553
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,840
What is it?!

554
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,760
-It's unpassable.
-I can't hear you.

555
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
It's unpassable!

556
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
-And what are we gonna do?
-We're gonna pass!

557
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,240
Pencils.

558
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,040
Bubble smackers.

559
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,320
Jimmy Carter!

560
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
No, thank you.

561
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,680
These are big letters.

562
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,040
I did the best I could,
but I'm no cribmaster.

563
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,760
Drop it already.
The letters are fine.

564
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,600
We need Applebee.
It's not too late.

565
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,480
Forget about the crib sheets.
This is multiple choice.

566
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,360
-This is cake.
-Cake?

567
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,520
What if Victor mis-sequenced
on the eyeball?

568
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,280
Hey! How do I know you didn't
mis-sequence on the crib sheets?

569
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,720
Applebee never mis-sequenced.

570
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,400
Who's Applebee?

571
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,520
-Come on!
-Hey!

572
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,400
Look, nobody mis-sequenced.

573
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,600
This is business.

574
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
And today...

575
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,800
we do it without Applebee.

576
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,240
You have 45 minutes.

577
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,720
There will be
no bathroom breaks.

578
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
You have 40 minutes.

579
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,280
There will be
no bathroom breaks.

580
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
When I say, "Pencils down..."

581
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,560
All pencils must be down.

582
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,520
Turn your papers over.

583
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,920
Time to begin.

584
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
You may begin.

585
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,920
OK, first of all,
you gotta remember...

586
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,600
never to sit next to somebody
that you're cheating with.

587
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,760
It looks too suspicious.

588
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,040
And then there's crib sheets.

589
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,640
Crib sheets are a tricky thing,
but I swear by them.

590
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Never write on your body.
Never write on your clothing.

591
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
You always have to be able
to destroy the evidence...

592
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,400
at a moment's notice.

593
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,520
Now when you're done
copying off your sheet...

594
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
just keep looking busy.

595
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,920
All right.

596
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,080
Pencils down, everyone.

597
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,600
Pass your papers forward.

598
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,920
And perhaps most importantly,
always get a couple wrong.

599
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Always leave a couple blank.

600
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,840
Never--and I mean never--
get 100%.

601
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,720
You made me fail.

602
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,320
I made myself fail.

603
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,880
I exhibited
unprofessional behavior.

604
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
Look, my cribbing skills
are worthless without you guys.

605
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,840
I have finished
grading your exams...

606
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,840
but first I would like to see
the following students outside:

607
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,280
Sammy Green, Handsome Davis,
and Victor Barone.

608
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,000
You punks...

609
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,880
must think
I'm some kind of idiot.

610
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,120
What the hell
are you talking about?

611
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,000
What am I talking about?
What am l--

612
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,880
I got a classroom
full of kids in there...

613
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,480
and the highest mark
that anybody got was 55.

614
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,960
Sammy, you got 81.

615
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,240
Handsome, you got 84.

616
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,560
And Victor, you got 100%.

617
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,320
Congratulations, Victor.

618
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,640
Can anybody explain to me...

619
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,920
the root of this
freak occurrence?

620
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
What the hell
am I doing out here?

621
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
Handsome, calm down!

622
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,280
Do you think I cheated?!

623
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,400
Give me the test right now,
Mr. Harkin, right now!

624
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760
All right, I'll give you
the test next period.

625
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
No, not next period.

626
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
Right now! Right now!

627
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,040
I'll take it right now!

628
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm ready for the test.

629
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,440
Handsome...

630
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,360
put your shirt back on
and go back to class.

631
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm sorry I accused you.

632
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,320
Was Hampston involved?

633
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,120
No, not at all.

634
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,840
You're certain?

635
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,840
Yeah. He's a good kid.

636
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
He's just a little
confused right now.

637
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,000
But he knows his physics.

638
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,680
All right, then.
It's time to get ugly.

639
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,120
What do you think she'll do?

640
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,280
I shouldn't be talking to you.

641
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,760
That excites you, doesn't it?

642
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,840
Do you want to go out
for a drink?

643
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,920
What happened? What happened?

644
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Oh, well, look who it is.

645
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,240
The great leader of men.

646
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
Just tell me what happened.

647
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,920
I'll take it right now!

648
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
That was awesome, Handsome.

649
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,400
You're the man!
You're the man, Handsome!

650
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,120
You know, she's sending out
red letters...

651
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
with their transcripts.
This is serious.

652
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,920
No, it's not. Julie,
both you and I know...

653
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,920
that there's no such thing
as a permanent record.

654
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,200
Oh, that's right.

655
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
It's just something
they invented...

656
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,840
to get inside your head with.
The greatest hoax...

657
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,440
in the history of
institutionalized education...

658
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
Stop it!

659
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
is the myth
of the permanent record.

660
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,440
Now, Stark's biggest threat...

661
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,800
was that she could keep us
out of college.

662
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,760
See, a red letter
on your permanent record...

663
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,480
meant that no college would
even consider your application.

664
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,960
Look, I am really sorry
about the red letter.

665
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,160
Please just pick up the phone.

666
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,440
By the way, in case
you were wondering...

667
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,000
who this is, this is Handsome.

668
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,080
Handsome Davis.
We met in kindergarten.

669
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,360
I was the kid with
the chicken pox. Dot-face.

670
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,080
Does any of this ring a bell?

671
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,480
I've been thinking about this
for a long time...

672
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,320
Victor and I might not
get into college.

673
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,600
She's bluffing.

674
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
You don't know that.
You don't know everything.

675
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,920
Yeah...

676
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,360
Handsome.

677
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,000
It's time for us to get out.
I don't know. Go legit.

678
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,800
Start doing whatever it takes
to get into a good college.

679
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
What's it gonna be, Handsome?

680
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,720
I promise to stop
cheating on tests...

681
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,320
but I'm still gonna plagiarize.

682
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
We agreed to quit cheating...

683
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,040
but Sammy took it
one step further.

684
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,880
-Yes?
-I'm with the student court.

685
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
I couldn't believe it.

686
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,760
My best friend
was a founding member...

687
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,000
of an extracurricular
activity.

688
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,440
What's the student court?

689
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,040
I don't know.

690
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,280
I think they went soft.

691
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,080
Douchebag!

692
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Teddy, it says here
you have detention...

693
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,920
for the rest
of the school year.

694
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,440
I could do that time
standing on my head.

695
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,320
It also says you'll be
attending summer school.

696
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,040
Why are you
bothering me, dildo?

697
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,760
I mean, douchebag.

698
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,840
Because I think
I can get you out of it...

699
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
if you let me take your case.

700
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,040
Ever since the first grade...

701
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,280
I had been making fun
of the studiers.

702
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,680
Now I was one of 'em.

703
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,280
Davis, I need a favor.

704
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,720
Look, I'm sorry, man.

705
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,720
I'm out of the favor business.

706
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,480
This is important.

707
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,320
Look, I've been clean
for nine weeks.

708
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,920
Try Lipnick
or the Benjamin brothers.

709
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,440
You know what? I take back...

710
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,560
every apology
I've ever made to you guys.

711
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,840
Student court.

712
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,280
This is all your fault.

713
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,160
You turned us
into a bunch of Shapiros.

714
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,760
I'm not a Shapiro.

715
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,600
I'm an advocate
for student rights.

716
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,000
You're the founding member
of an extracurricular activity.

717
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,320
What makes you think you're
any different from Shapiro?

718
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,440
I don't take notes.

719
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,000
I said this before,
and I will say it again.

720
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,640
Mrs. Herman. Herman was one
of those teachers...

721
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,600
who loved the sound
of her own voice.

722
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,840
Now, she thought that
she could make us take notes...

723
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,840
on everything she said,
but we had other plans.

724
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,880
The only way to pass my class
is to take good notes.

725
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,840
Or have a friend
who takes good notes.

726
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,120
Hey, Noga.

727
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
You want to be friends?

728
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,080
Mr. Barone?

729
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,040
Would you like me to put an "F"
in my grade book right now?

730
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,200
No, ma'am.

731
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
Now as I was saying,
if you've taken good notes...

732
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Iike Mr. Shapiro over here...

733
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,720
Loser.

734
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,840
you will have no problem
on tomorrow's test.

735
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,800
Don't worry. I'll photocopy them
after school...

736
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,640
and you can pick them up
at my place.

737
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,000
Thanks, Noga.

738
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,360
You know,
you're a really cool girl.

739
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,200
Victor used to always say that
note-taking was for suckers.

740
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,840
His motto was: Why take notes
when there's always a girl...

741
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,360
willing to give it up for free?

742
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,880
I stand here before you
knee-deep in the bullshit.

743
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,240
English.

744
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,880
I don't get it, man.

745
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,600
None of the girls are willing
to give up their notes.

746
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,360
It's like they all of a sudden
have self-esteem.

747
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,560
That's impossible.

748
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,360
It's a little possible.

749
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,520
It was Julie.

750
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
It doesn't make sense.

751
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,760
Why should we keep giving
our notes to the boys?

752
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,600
Do you want some boy
who's not Shapiro...

753
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,120
taking your admission spot
from your reach school?

754
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,080
But just because we're giving
them notes doesn't mean that--

755
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,080
Tufts.

756
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,920
And they will not be
your friends...

757
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,520
in five years when they're
in a penthouse in Manhattan...

758
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,720
and you're sitting
in an apartment in the dark...

759
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,120
because you can't pay
your electric bill.

760
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,440
She got waitlisted.

761
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,360
I'm on a waiting list
because of them.

762
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,600
She's taking it pretty hard.

763
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
We are not whores.

764
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,560
We are not whores.

765
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,520
She got to every single girl.

766
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,400
She is good.

767
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,640
We are not whores!

768
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,960
We are not whores!

769
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,720
Hey, what about Shapiro?

770
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,400
What do you think, Shapiro?

771
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,080
I'm not a whore.

772
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,680
I hate Shapiro.

773
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,320
I should kick his ass.

774
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,600
My money's on Shapiro.

775
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,600
The book. We should only
be tested on what's in the book.

776
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,280
Note-taking
should not be mandatory.

777
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,520
We should not have to listen
to her when she talks.

778
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,240
-It's not fair.
-Fair?

779
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,160
If she wanted to, she could
factor in spelling or conduct...

780
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,240
or penmanship.

781
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Hey...

782
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,360
I have a plan.

783
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,200
Hello?

784
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,840
Hello. Is Mrs. Herman there?

785
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,160
No. She's gone to bed.

786
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,600
Would you like
to leave a message?

787
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,800
Is this her son?

788
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,760
Yes.

789
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,160
Well...you don't know me,
but I'm your real father.

790
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,320
The one who gave you up.

791
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,200
The one who never loved you.

792
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,720
I just called to tell you that
my feelings haven't changed.

793
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,400
Why?

794
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Why are you doing this to me?

795
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
Because I hate adoption.

796
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,080
Have a pleasant evening.

797
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,720
Why would you do
something like that?

798
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,360
What?

799
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,240
Because adoption
is an unnatural act.

800
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,000
It's against God's plan.

801
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,560
What? Adoption is awesome.

802
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,240
It keeps poor kids off crime.

803
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,240
You called from my house.
From my phone.

804
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,240
We're going to get 69ed
with the star.

805
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,840
You know...

806
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,960
I don't know about you...

807
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,960
but I hate Gradebook,
and I hate her fake little kids.

808
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,960
You're being insane.

809
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,440
Do you even know them?

810
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,560
Yeah, I know them a little.
From gymnastics camp.

811
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,280
They're freaks.

812
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,280
Call the freaks up
and apologize.

813
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,520
I got a plan.

814
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,720
Hey, listen, kid.

815
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,000
I screwed up.

816
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,200
Adoption is awesome.

817
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,320
It keeps poor kids off crime.

818
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,760
Now, if you give me that test,
I'll give you 47 bucks.

819
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,600
I was thinking something
more like...four hundred.

820
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,120
Jesus, you are
so goddamned greedy.

821
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
It is what it is.

822
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,400
Fine. Have it your way, Greedy.

823
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,320
Four hundred it is.

824
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,440
Look, I am a businessman.

825
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,560
I'll get you that test.

826
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,560
That was beautiful.

827
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,320
Well, I know how to deal
with adopted kids.

828
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,960
Does anyone know
Rexler's number?

829
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,880
Do this somewhere else.

830
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,400
-What is your problem?
-It's like a sickness with you.

831
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,200
It's time to grow up.
Teddy's on the wagon.

832
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,640
-Teddy's on the wagon?
-Teddy stopped cursing.

833
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,280
She realized she couldn't be an
idiot for the rest of her life.

834
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,880
Teddy was never an idiot.

835
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,760
She was a genius,
and you killed her.

836
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,160
Sammy, this is bigger
than me, you...

837
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,880
and Teddy put together.

838
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
This is note-taker
versus non-note-taker.

839
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,480
This is teacher versus student.

840
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,440
Corrupting the children
of the Gradebook?

841
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,200
This is our chance to become
a part of history.

842
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,520
Get out of my house.

843
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,640
Come on, man.

844
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,920
Peer pressure.

845
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,360
What is the big deal?
We're not gonna get caught.

846
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,360
You won't get caught. You'll
weasel your way out of it.

847
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,240
Just do me a favor
and just get out of my house.

848
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,880
-Are you breaking up with me?
-Just get out.

849
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,280
Yo! Get Rexler on the line.

850
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,640
Rexler.

851
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,600
Dude, where's your dad?

852
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,080
Home-wrecker.

853
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,080
Please hold for Handsome.

854
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,880
Rexler, tonight's
your lucky night.

855
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,200
This job is too big.

856
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,320
It's not too big.

857
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,880
It's too big.

858
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,360
-Hello?
-All right, Greedy.

859
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,880
I got your money.

860
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,760
Mr. Victor, we got a problem.

861
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,240
We got a problem.

862
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,000
Greedy was ambushed...

863
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
by his own fake brother.

864
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,760
It's like I always say.
You can't trust a fake brother.

865
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,520
OK. Tell him that he can split
the 4 bills with Greedy 2 and 2.

866
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,480
He doesn't want money.

867
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,040
That adopted little prick.

868
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,320
Get him on the phone.
Everybody's got a price.

869
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,880
-Six hundred.
-No, thank you.

870
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,120
-Eight hundred?
-No, thank you.

871
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,320
A thousand.

872
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,800
No means no, Mr. Victor.

873
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,960
Do you remember
the balance beam?

874
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,480
Yeah.

875
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,560
If it wasn't for me, you'd have
no dismount, and you know it.

876
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,600
I don't want your dirty money.

877
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,760
We're screwed.

878
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,880
We're not screwed.

879
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,480
Who was the hottest girl
at camp?

880
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,640
What?

881
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,360
Who had the best body,
the biggest tits...

882
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,600
the sweetest smell?
Come on. Give me something.

883
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,760
Allison Westbrook.

884
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,760
She smelled...

885
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,400
amazing.

886
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,000
Handsome, you're a genius.

887
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,280
I'm gonna promise
the kid a hand job.

888
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,600
Are you crazy?

889
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,640
That's what we're doing, right?
We're selling sex?

890
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,960
No, my friends.

891
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,400
We're selling romance!

892
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,920
What?

893
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,520
The kid's only fifteen.
He wants the whole package.

894
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,080
He wants to go horseback
riding on the beach.

895
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,800
He wants a candlelit dinner.

896
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,920
He wants to sip champagne
with her in a hot tub.

897
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,840
I would love to sip
champagne in a hot tub.

898
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,640
You guys are so very,
very wrong.

899
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,000
Just trust me.

900
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,000
We didn't even know Allison.
We didn't know her phone number.

901
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,120
We didn't know where she lived.
But we knew how to lie.

902
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,760
Do you remember...

903
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,720
Allison Westbrook?

904
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,760
I think about her all the time.

905
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,080
She smelled
like a moist flower.

906
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,080
Well, then
it's your lucky day...

907
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,920
because she is a close
personal friend of mine...

908
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,640
and I was just talking
to her a few minutes ago...

909
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,360
on the phone, and she said
that she'd be willing...

910
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,560
to go horseback riding
with you on the beach...

911
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,440
and to have a candlelight
dinner with you...

912
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,840
and sit in a tub
and drink champagne.

913
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,160
I don't know, man.

914
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,160
How about a hand job?

915
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,840
Two hand jobs...

916
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,120
and a dry hump.

917
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,440
Deal.

918
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,200
That's one horny
little bastard.

919
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,920
Romantic.

920
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,520
Hello?

921
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,800
Say I didn't get the test.

922
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,000
-He didn't get the test.
-What?

923
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,880
All right.
Now don't say anything.

924
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,000
Just listen.

925
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,200
I got the test,
and it was beautiful.

926
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,320
I get to the house...

927
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,280
and Horny and Greedy
are both there waiting for me.

928
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,640
Mr. Victor.

929
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,120
My brother has something
he wants to tell you.

930
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,320
I want what he wants.

931
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,680
I was blown away.

932
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,920
Turns out Greedy
is just as horny as Horny.

933
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,000
I knew it.

934
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,320
So I renegotiate.

935
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,880
Here's the new plan.

936
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,040
I want you to get
everybody out of there.

937
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,160
-Tell them the party's over.
-Explain.

938
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,720
There's no way we're gonna
get away with this...

939
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,400
with six different people.
Somebody's bound to screw it up.

940
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,040
This is the smart move.
You know what?

941
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,360
You got twenty minutes to get
everybody out of there...

942
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,920
so we can look up
the answers together.

943
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,400
Just you and me.

944
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,400
Why?

945
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,520
I just couldn't screw
everybody like that.

946
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,760
Oh, really?

947
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,440
I'll take it right now.

948
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,880
You're angry.

949
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,560
But now...

950
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,680
is not the time
to deal with that anger.

951
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,320
So, put your shirt back on...

952
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,680
and let's go look up answers.

953
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,520
You're a real idiot, Napplebee,
you know that?

954
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,880
You're not in charge
of me, Victor.

955
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,680
I am in charge. I got the test.
That means I'm in charge.

956
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,320
Napplebee.

957
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,680
Cribmaster or Applebee.

958
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,640
Not Napplebee.

959
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,880
Hey...

960
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,480
Victor's right. You can't crib
with this many people.

961
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,840
It's too risky.

962
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,200
Tonight, we sing.

963
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,400
I don't sing. I crib.

964
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,600
Tonight, everybody sings.
Nobody cribs.

965
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,720
Who died and made you Victor,
king of cheaters?

966
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,680
At least I'm actually
a cheater.

967
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,840
What are you saying?
I'm a cheater!

968
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,040
No, you're not!

969
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,920
You're not a cheater.
You just write small.

970
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
I don't wanna hurt you...

971
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,200
but maybe...

972
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,400
maybe...

973
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,560
Let him go, Rexler.

974
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,640
Hit me.

975
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,560
You have to hit him now.

976
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,600
OK? Those are the rules.

977
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,960
Did you look at my file?

978
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,720
You have to hit him.

979
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,120
Did you see the thing
about my penis?

980
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,160
I'm not gonna let you get hurt.
OK? I promise. Just hit him.

981
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,120
Hit me. Hit me!

982
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,640
What's it gonna be, Nipplebee?
Hit me!

983
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I got angry, confused, scared.

984
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,960
So we looked up the answers...

985
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,640
and we finished
making up the song...

986
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,960
but something was missing.
At least, for me it was.

987
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,600
See, I started cheating
when I was six years old...

988
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,080
but this was the first time
I ever cheated without Sammy.

989
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,800
Hello?

990
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,920
Crippled elves do dance around

991
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,760
A devil covered by blue dress

992
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
I'm in no mood
for Beethoven.

993
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,640
It's not Beethoven.
It's the answer song.

994
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,280
We got the test.

995
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,800
Congratulations, but I really
just want to go back to sleep.

996
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,520
Dairy causes diarrhea

997
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,600
Chunky, creamy butter cheese

998
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,240
See you at school.

999
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,080
Wait, wait, wait.
Seriously, wait.

1000
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Bad Billy does dope

1001
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,440
Bitches and brews

1002
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,520
But can't even build
a cigarette--

1003
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,480
Crippled elves do dance around

1004
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,600
A devil covered by blue dress

1005
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,000
Dairy causes diarrhea

1006
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,120
Chunky, creamy butter cheese

1007
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,040
Bad Billy does dope,
bitches, and brews

1008
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,840
But can't even build
a cigarette boat

1009
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,680
Allah bangs booze every day

1010
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,680
Above a bridge behind a cave

1011
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,560
Nobody left too early.
Nobody got too many right.

1012
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,920
Everything was going perfectly.
It was a cheating miracle.

1013
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,520
Carpet crawler can't eat eagle

1014
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,800
Before chicken during day

1015
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,480
Time's up, everyone.

1016
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,160
If I see anyone writing
on their papers now...

1017
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,000
I will put seven Fs
in the grade book.

1018
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,440
It seemed too good to be true.

1019
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,000
Sammy, Victor...

1020
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,360
Mrs. Stark
would like to see you.

1021
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,640
I assumed after I handed down
my punishment to you...

1022
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,120
that you would've been
smart enough...

1023
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,400
to leave cheating behind you.

1024
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,120
My sources tell me that's
exactly what you have done.

1025
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,440
I am so proud of you.

1026
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,560
Especially you, Sammy,
for starting the student court.

1027
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,280
And here are your red letters.

1028
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,200
I want you to keep them
as souvenirs.

1029
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,560
You know, I am no stranger
to rebellion.

1030
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,480
When I was your age and we used
to pile into the phone booth...

1031
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,840
I was always at the bottom
of the pile.

1032
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,840
Yep.

1033
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,240
To the myth
of the permanent record.

1034
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,800
I'll drink to that.

1035
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,120
Mr. Victor, this is Horny.

1036
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,320
My brother and l
are very interested...

1037
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,520
in collecting
what is rightfully ours.

1038
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,200
If you do not make good
on your offer...

1039
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,360
we will have no choice
but to--

1040
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,520
to continue calling.

1041
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,280
As we got closer to graduation,
the only thing...

1042
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,080
that mattered anymore
was getting into college.

1043
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,800
You see, the thick envelope
means you're in...

1044
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,200
and the thin envelope means
you are screwed.

1045
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,360
Now, the best part
about getting into college...

1046
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,520
is that there's no reason
to behave anymore.

1047
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,200
Most teachers just accept it,
look the other way...

1048
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,360
but Herman...
Herman was different.

1049
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,840
You kids are so naive.

1050
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,160
What you don't realize is that
your college acceptances...

1051
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,920
are contingent upon your final
high school transcript.

1052
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,120
Don't screw with me...

1053
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:22,040
because this grade book
can keep you out of college.

1054
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,040
I hate that grade book.

1055
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,440
That grade book is a Shapiro.

1056
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,600
You can't say that.
The grade book is a thing.

1057
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Yeah, but it has Shapiro power.

1058
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,720
Yes, it does.

1059
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,240
It does, indeed.

1060
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,680
You're late, Mr. Green.
That's an "F" for the day.

1061
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,560
But I wasn't late.
I was here. I just--

1062
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,760
That's another "F"
for talking back.

1063
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,960
Now, I have to leave class
to make a personal call.

1064
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,960
I suggest you use
the time wisely.

1065
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,200
There might be a quiz tomorrow.

1066
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,240
My name is Mrs. Herman.

1067
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,560
I'm a bitch.

1068
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,960
She could come back any second.

1069
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,320
Take it easy, Shapiro.

1070
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,640
The "F."

1071
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,760
For twelve years...

1072
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,320
they have been using the "F."

1073
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,000
Twelve years...

1074
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,600
of us doing stuff
we don't want to do...

1075
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,600
all because of the "F."

1076
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,280
So, what happens?

1077
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
We finally make it
to the finish line...

1078
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:54,960
and this bitch tries
to use the "F" one last time.

1079
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,960
You know what? "F" the "F."

1080
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,600
I'm taking all the Fs away.

1081
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,040
All right, Davis.

1082
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
-Send it.
-What?

1083
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,800
The grade book.
Throw me the grade book.

1084
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,160
Let's do it, man.

1085
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,120
Let's get rid of all the grades:
"A" through "F."

1086
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,200
They are the tools
of the enemy.

1087
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,280
Come on, man.

1088
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,960
Don't do it.

1089
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,560
Don't tell me what to do.

1090
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,240
No more Fs.

1091
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,320
No more Fs.

1092
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,640
I thought I could treat you
like adults...

1093
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,880
but you're not.
You're animals...

1094
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,560
uncivilized animals.

1095
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,760
Do you people have any idea
how much time I spend...

1096
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,680
giving out grades...

1097
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,120
grading your papers,
grading your exams...

1098
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,760
grading your homework
assignments?

1099
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,920
That grade book is my life.

1100
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,480
Dude, we just pissed
on her life.

1101
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,080
If I don't have that book
by tomorrow morning...

1102
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,360
no more senior trip.

1103
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,080
No Yankee game,
no "Death of a Salesman."

1104
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,040
Jesus, man.
Everybody wanted that trip.

1105
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,680
It's only a matter of time
before somebody talks.

1106
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,280
Grades...

1107
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,800
are the way we maintain order
in this institution.

1108
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,640
This morning,
on my way into my office...

1109
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,000
I noticed a letter that had
been slipped under my door.

1110
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,000
"Dear Mrs. Stark...

1111
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,640
"last Tuesday...

1112
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,160
"l, along with
twenty fellow students...

1113
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,480
"witnessed the taking
of Mrs. Herman's grade book.

1114
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,680
"lt is unfair for an entire
class to be punished...

1115
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,040
"for the sins of an individual.

1116
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,240
"And that individual is...

1117
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,720
"Victor Barone."

1118
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Signed, "Anonymous."

1119
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,520
Why are you telling me this?

1120
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,400
This has nothing to do with me.

1121
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,440
Because I am tired
of playing the cop.

1122
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,320
I want the student court
to handle this.

1123
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,840
The student court's
really busy right now.

1124
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,160
I always thought that the four
of us would be friends forever.

1125
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,120
You have it cleaned up
by graduation.

1126
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,680
But Stark finally figured out
a way to tear us apart.

1127
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,080
Whoever did this...

1128
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,640
did this...

1129
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,680
-so they could see me go down.
-I'll handle this.

1130
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,200
Now, Applebee, this is serious.

1131
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,240
Did you write the letter?

1132
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,080
This is the United States
of America.

1133
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,880
What are you talking about?

1134
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,600
The letter doesn't really
mean anything on its own...

1135
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,400
but I'm gonna have
to interview everyone...

1136
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,720
that was there that day.

1137
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,240
If one person goes on record
that they saw you take it...

1138
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,960
you're finished.

1139
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,040
That'll be my job.
To make sure no one testifies.

1140
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,240
OK, but I don't know
anything about that.

1141
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,960
I understand.

1142
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,080
What are we gonna do
about Applebee?

1143
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,720
I'll take care of Napplebee.

1144
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,040
I'll kick his ass.

1145
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,400
I don't want you
doing anything.

1146
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,920
I don't want you talking
to anybody. Just be cool.

1147
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,720
Sammy's right.
You gotta stay cool.

1148
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:03,000
I gotta say, it feels great
to be back in business with you.

1149
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,880
Yeah, really great.

1150
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,240
You're pathetic.

1151
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,520
I'm pathetic?

1152
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,920
I'm not the one
who worked her ass off...

1153
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,120
and then got rejected by Tufts.

1154
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,080
Honestly, Handsome...

1155
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,400
I would love to see
you guys go down.

1156
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,960
All of you.

1157
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,160
I'm sorry you feel
that way, Julie.

1158
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,520
But let me paint you
a little picture.

1159
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,400
Graduation...

1160
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,560
they call your name.

1161
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,440
You're on your way
to pick up your diploma.

1162
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,280
Then you hear your classmates
chanting something.

1163
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,440
You can't make it out
at first, but...

1164
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,520
it starts to get louder
and louder.

1165
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,520
"Julie is a rat."

1166
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,080
"Julie is a rat."

1167
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,240
Please just state your name
for the record.

1168
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,080
This is such a joke.

1169
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,720
Just state your name
for the record.

1170
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,760
You're a joke.

1171
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,200
This is awesome. Nobody talked.
We're in the clear.

1172
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,280
Are we?

1173
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,800
Now, Victor was famous...

1174
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,920
for having some
pretty crappy plans...

1175
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,440
but this one had to be
the crappiest.

1176
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,960
Napplebee.

1177
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,920
And I didn't see
because that morning...

1178
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,920
I had woken up
with an eye infection.

1179
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,640
Sometimes I get them.

1180
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,920
I want to go on the record
right now.

1181
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,160
-What?
-I want to do this right now.

1182
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,200
Victor is gonna destroy you.

1183
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,040
Well, hallelujah.

1184
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,240
Why do you want
to do this to yourself?

1185
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,720
Napplebee!

1186
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,240
My name...

1187
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,520
is not Napplebee.

1188
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,760
Not...

1189
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,720
Crapplebee.

1190
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,400
It's not Applebutt.

1191
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,600
Please state your name
for the record.

1192
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,920
My name...

1193
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,240
is Jonathan Jacob Applebee.

1194
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,120
I am gonna bash
that kid's head in...

1195
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,800
with a hammer.

1196
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,240
If the jury finds you guilty,
which they will...

1197
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,240
you're gonna be expelled.

1198
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,800
Stark won't even let you walk
at graduation.

1199
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,360
My parents are gonna kill me.

1200
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,280
There is another way.

1201
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,600
I have the authority
to offer you a deal.

1202
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:47,040
You know,
he's never seen karate...

1203
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,560
Iike my karate.

1204
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,480
There's not gonna be
any karate.

1205
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,760
You get an "F" in the class...

1206
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,040
but the "F" won't go
on your final transcript.

1207
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,600
It won't?

1208
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,640
No. You get to go to graduation,
then you make up the class...

1209
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,000
in summer school.
It'll be like it never happened.

1210
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,800
But you have to give
a full confession.

1211
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,240
I'm gonna choke him to death.

1212
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,560
Then, after
he stops breathing...

1213
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,040
karate.

1214
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,600
Victor never
got to do any karate...

1215
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,040
but he sure did sing
like a canary.

1216
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,280
I couldn't believe it.

1217
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,640
He decided to rat me out,
and Stark had finally won.

1218
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,720
My punishment,
well, my punishment...

1219
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,720
was the same as Victor's.
We could go to graduation...

1220
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,680
but we wouldn't get our diplomas
till after summer school.

1221
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,640
Was I angry about it?
Of course I was.

1222
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,720
But no one was as angry
as Horny or Greedy.

1223
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,320
Mr. Victor,
this is your last chance.

1224
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,640
My last chance?

1225
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,000
For what?

1226
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,400
The deal.

1227
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,640
You guys don't get it, do you?

1228
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,080
It's never gonna happen.

1229
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,560
You lose.

1230
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,880
I win.

1231
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,200
You know what, Victor?

1232
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,360
You can shit on our fantasies.

1233
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,360
You can beat the crap
out of us.

1234
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,120
You can remind us
that we're not really brothers.

1235
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,560
But at least we're not rats.

1236
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,240
Everyone knows who you are.

1237
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,040
Even Shapiro.

1238
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,920
Back at the beginning
of the year...

1239
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,560
the four of us
were best friends.

1240
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,560
By the time we got
to graduation...

1241
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,080
things had fallen apart.
Sammy had gotten soft...

1242
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,080
Victor and Applebee
had turned into rats...

1243
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,720
and everybody, well,
everybody was blaming me.

1244
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,640
Listen, Sammy.

1245
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,480
Have a nice life.

1246
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,000
And now, to give out the awards
in math and science...

1247
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,680
I call to the podium
Alex Harkin.

1248
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,480
Love you, Mr. Harkin.

1249
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:34,440
This is my favorite part
about being a teacher.

1250
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,600
I wasn't gonna
necessarily be a teacher...

1251
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,840
but l, as you know,
became one...

1252
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,880
and the winner of the award...

1253
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,080
for outstanding achievement
in chemical science is...

1254
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,200
Julie Merkle.

1255
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,000
Come on up here, Julie.

1256
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,920
I'm sorry.

1257
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
Not your fault.

1258
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm sorry that I looked
at your file.

1259
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,360
The award--
the winner of the award...

1260
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,840
for outstanding achievement
in physics is...

1261
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,480
one of my favorite students...

1262
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,240
Handsome Davis.

1263
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,480
Come on up here, Handsome.

1264
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,840
OK. I admit it.

1265
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,200
I stole the midterm...

1266
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,480
I took my dad's porn...

1267
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,840
I flirted with Mr. Harkin,
I broke the ceiling...

1268
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,440
I lied to the fake brothers,
I looked at Applebee's file...

1269
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,360
I read the thing
about his penis...

1270
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,680
I pissed on the grade book...

1271
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,840
and I pissed off
all of my friends.

1272
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,320
But you know what?

1273
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,720
When the four of us
were cheating together...

1274
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,560
it was the sweetest thing
I ever knew.

1275
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,400
It was horseback riding
on the beach...

1276
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,920
a candlelight dinner,
champagne in a hot tub.

1277
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,400
-He's my hero.
-I agree.

1278
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,600
Stark did everything she could
to ruin graduation for us...

1279
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,000
but, actually, it ended up as
one of our greatest victories.

1280
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,440
Cheated on the midterm.

1281
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,240
Take it right now.

1282
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,720
-Cheater!
-Cheated on the midterm.

1283
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,760
Because it wasn't just me
who won that award.

1284
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,040
It was for Sammy for winning
that spelling bee...

1285
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,000
and it was for Applebee
for writing crazy small...

1286
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,480
and it was for Victor...

1287
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,560
for knowing how to deal
with adopted kids.

1288
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,720
You see, cheating is what made
the four of us famous--

1289
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,840
the most famous cheaters
in North Point history.

1290
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,400
Everything is bullshit.

1291
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,360
It is what it is.
