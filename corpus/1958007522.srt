1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,582
<i>It all started</i>
<i>with the breakup.</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,818
<i>First from one person,</i>

3
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,287
<i>and then from</i>
<i>the rest of society.</i>

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,956
<i>I should say now,</i>
<i>I never meant</i>

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,157
<i>for any of this to happen.</i>

6
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>What eventually became of me</i>

7
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:28,462
<i>was not what</i>
<i>I had set out to become.</i>

8
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,565
<i>I wanted what any of us want,</i>

9
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,432
<i>to make a difference</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

10
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>To love and be loved.</i>

11
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,338
<i>Possibly to rescue a dog.</i>

12
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,944
<i>Maybe I was just trying</i>
<i>to make sense of</i>

13
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,112
<i>this crazy world of ours,</i>

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,515
<i>which is impossible.</i>

15
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,450
<i>Our universe consists</i>
<i>of patterns so complex,</i>

16
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>it's impossible to know</i>
<i>what you're missing,</i>

17
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:54,822
<i>let alone where to look.</i>

18
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:58,893
<i>How can you explain something</i>
<i>you don't truly understand?</i>

19
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,343
<i>Wait.</i>

20
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,779
<i>What are you doing?</i>

21
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,048
<i>Don't you see,</i>
<i>Ashley?</i>

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,183
<i>I am setting you free.</i>

23
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,194
<i>The cult was founded in</i>

24
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,830
<i>the spirit of social</i>
<i>consciousness,</i>

25
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:38,465
<i>as its doctrine included</i>
<i>largely vegetarian diets</i>

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
<i>and a ban on social traditions</i>

27
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,837
<i>deemed inauthentic</i>
<i>by the cult's leader.</i>

28
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:45,640
<i>A ban that</i>
<i>was strictly enforced.</i>

29
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,642
<i>Little did they know, however,</i>

30
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,376
<i>this was their fearless</i>
<i>leader's last night on Earth.</i>

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,612
Ooh!

32
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,380
God, why do you
keep doing that?

33
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,349
-'Cause it's funny.
-Ugh, if it was funny,

34
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,851
-I would laugh.
-I'm laughing.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,955
I don't laugh like that.

36
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,724
Oh, you absolutely
laugh like that.

37
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,425
You know, for somebody who's
so hypersensitive to others,

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,663
your lack of self-awareness
is shocking, Scout.

39
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,297
Scout?

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,899
Scout, please. I--

41
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,166
Ooh!

42
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,404
- I hate you.
- No!

43
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,306
Fear releases dopamine,

44
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,442
which simulates the feeling
of falling in love,

45
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,411
a feeling which doubles down

46
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,813
when you finally realize
you're safe.

47
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:27,682
So, technically,
like, you're welcome.

48
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,349
Nope. Mm-mmm.

49
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,853
-What about, like, uh--
-Mm-mmm.

50
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,187
Okay. Fine.

51
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,393
What are you tweeting?

52
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:40,928
Politics.

53
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,930
Oh, what-- what politics?

54
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,198
You hate politics.

55
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,400
No, I don't.
I care a lot about politics.

56
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,802
What kind of politics?

57
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,271
Fine. Mitch McConnell's pushing

58
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,807
a confirmation in
the Ninth Circuit,

59
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,909
but HuffPost just
released a dossier th...

60
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,379
Sorry, I just fell asleep.
Just got bored listening

61
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:03,316
to all that horse race politics.
It's like, zoom out.

62
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,153
It has nothing to do with
the bigger picture,

63
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,421
which is arguably
much more important.

64
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,289
Do you even know
what horse race politics is?

65
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,958
Or are you just repeating
something that

66
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,960
you heard in a podcast?

67
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,497
Repeating something
I heard off a podcast.

68
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,766
Yeah.

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,333
Whi-- which is like
a verbal retweet.

70
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,336
It's the same concept,
basically.

71
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,340
Okay. Fine, true.

72
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,376
You're right. I'm sorry.

73
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,278
I love you.

74
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,814
Hmm.

75
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,252
Psst, your line is,
"I love you, too, Natasha."

76
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,289
Any time.

77
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,325
Right. It's just love is like

78
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,029
an incredibly powerful
human emotion.

79
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,565
And it feels, like,
reductive to limit it

80
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,232
to call and response.

81
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,702
You know,
it's like, "Marco," "Polo."

82
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,538
-"I love you." "Polo."
-I love you, too.

83
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,007
You know what I do love,
though?

84
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,577
Popcorn.

85
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,945
I'm gonna make some.
I'll be back.

86
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,515
Please don't eat in bed, Scout.

87
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,518
I can tell when you do,
'cause there's crumbs.

88
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,386
I'm serious. It wakes me up.

89
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,890
Scout, are you even listening?

90
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,424
Polo.

91
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,429
You were so scared.

92
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,600
You were like, "Ah!"

93
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,467
Do you ever hate people so much

94
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:31,338
that you find yourself
rooting for global warming?

95
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,776
Wake me up for the revolution.

96
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,911
L-O-L.

97
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,528
<i>Okay. I'm in a parking lot.</i>

98
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,429
<i>A security guard approaches,</i>
<i>nervously.</i>

99
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,065
<i>He's new to the job.</i>

100
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,169
<i>Probably because the job</i>
<i>didn't exist before.</i>

101
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,804
<i>I miss my cousin.</i>

102
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,672
<i>You know, I'd do anything</i>
<i>to get him back.</i>

103
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,406

00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,021

<i>I don't know, like,</i>

116
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,608
Good morning, my love.

00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,543
<i>-What we do know...</i>
-Natasha?

118
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,078
<i>... is the more you know,</i>

119
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,880

120
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,916
Natasha?

121
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,627
"I can't do this anymore.
I'm leaving. Natasha."

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,930
Very funny, Natasha.

123
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,100
Good-- good joke.

124
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:08,870
Natasha?

125
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,507
"P.S. This is not a joke.

126
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,209
It if was meant to be funny,
I'd laugh.

127
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,477
And the fact that you probably
are laughing right now

128
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:18,846
is even more evidence
that we were

129
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,548
never compatible
in the first place.

130
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,516
And furthermore,
evidence that--"

Oh, my God.

132

benevolent dictator's

of a better world.

337
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,139
If elected benevolent dictator,

338
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,876
I will work tirelessly
to promote the ideals

339
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,011
we hold dearest
here in Scoutopia,

340
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,447
including environmentalism.

341
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:49,416
Uh, I believe music should be
played at a reasonable volume.

342
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,453
Also, I don't think
we need an Oxford comma.

343
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,254
There I said it.

344
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,826
I promise to pass
the Bechdel test.

345
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:02,229
I promise to invest in
innovation over tradition.

346
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,064
Because you know what they say.

347
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,903
The definition of insanity
is these prices!

348
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,706
It's time to give the power
back to the people

349
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,576
by taking it away
from them entirely.

350
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,211
So, vote for me
for benevolent dictator

351
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:21,281
and I promise to wish you well.

352
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,523
Also, death to all squirrels.

353
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:32,493
Thank you. Thank you.

354
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,663
Thank you, Scout.

355
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,297
Way to read the room.

356
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,667
All those in favor of Scout
for benevolent dictator,

357
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,236
please say, "Aye." Aye.

358
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,540
All opposed?

359
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:47,909
Abstentions?

360
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,343
Doge, work with me here,

361
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,979
we can't pass this
without a quorum.

362
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,780
Great. The motion passes.

363
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:55,750
As of this moment, Scout is
officially benevolent dictator

364
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,118
of the sovereign nation state
of Scoutopia

365
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,320
on this 23rd day of Scoutember.

366
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:04,124

Tourists.

419
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,283
Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying

420
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,885
to get a hold of you
for two days.

421
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,654
Sorry. Natasha cut me out
of the family plan.

422
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:23,124
Don't apologize,
it takes away your authority.

423
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,793
Ooh, so, she's really gone, huh?

424
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,596
I don't know, Britney,
I feel like there's a chance.

425
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,230
You got a dog?

426
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,966
I love dogs. Come here.

427
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,669
Yes, I got a dog.
I'm an entirely new person.

428
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,403
Careful,
she doesn't like flannel.

429
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:38,539
Okay, you're clearly
emotionally distraught.

430
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,109
- I'm not distraught.
- Trust me, you're distraught.

431
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,610
Remember when Clarissa left

432
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,311
and you didn't eat anything
for three days?

433
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,680
Have you been eating?
I brought snacks.

434
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,714
I'm eating.

435
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,315
Popcorn doesn't
count as a food.

436
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,817
-Neither does rosé.
-Yes, it does.

437
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,586
So, she really took everything.

438
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,121
You're gonna
have to get new stuff.

439
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,321
Actually, I don't--

440
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,490
I don't feel like
I want new stuff.

441
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,926
-You have to have stuff.
-Why?

442
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,427
Because it's stuff.

443
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,929
Did you-- did you fall
and hit your head?

444
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,164
Yes, why?

445
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,532
'Cause you're bleeding.

446
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,600
You're also acting
really weird.

447
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,101
I'll go get Band-Aids.

448
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:08,603
Natasha took all the Band-Aids.

449
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:09,904
Bitch.

450
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,471
- I'll take care of it.
- Stop.

451
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:12,840
-Oh.
-What are you doing, honey?

452
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,776
I wiped it. I wiped it.

453
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,244
Now you have blood
on your shirt.

454
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,645
Now I have blood on my shirt.

455
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,547
You're right,
I'm gonna go change.

456
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,414
-You have blood on your shirt.
-I know, I'll change.

457
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,117
Honestly, I'm glad she's gone.

458
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,186
-Britney? Oh.
-No, Natasha.

459
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,354
we didn't get along.
And I get along with everyone.

460
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:29,690
I mean, Clarissa and I
get along great,

461
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:31,592
and she's a raging narcissist.

462
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,360
-You need to spackle this.
-She wasn't a narcissist.

463
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,862
Uh, yes, she was.

464
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,264
She dressed up as herself
for Halloween,

465
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,765
including a wig.

466
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,432
Look, can we stop talking
about my exes

467
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,169
and focus on
the amazing transformation

468
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,435
that is underfoot?

469
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,272
I am an entirely new person.

470
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,673
You have popcorn in your teeth.

471
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:48,408
-You have popcorn in your butt.
-Great.

472
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:50,310
- Can I borrow this?
- Yes.

473
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,612
You know what?

474
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,080
As a matter of fact...

475
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,348
So, are there cups, or...

476
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:58,085
we supposed to just chug this
like a poor person?

477
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:01,823
All clothing except
for jumpsuits is illegal now.

478
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,025
-Scoutopia.
-What's Scoutopia?

479
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,392
It's my sovereign nation state.

480
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:07,662
Girl, you can't just
wear jumpsuits.

481
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:10,698
Yes, I can, Ashley.
Imagine the future, okay?

482
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,300
-What are people wearing?
-Jetpacks.

483
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,801
Fenty by Rihanna.

484
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:15,435
What? No, no.
They're wearing jumpsuits,

485
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,238
utilitarian jumpsuits.

486
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,873
I mean, the technology exists.

487
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,008
Why hold ourselves back?
What are we, the coal industry?

488
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,710
It's been 48 hours.

489
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,646
Oh, yeah, Ashley,
as if time were linear, okay?

490
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,248
Viva la revolución.

491
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,016
-This is fun.
-Why can't you just

492
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,085
have sex with a Tinder person,
like a normal human being?

493
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,120
Did you know
Natasha's dad voted for Trump,

494
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:34,856
and I didn't
say anything because, like,

495
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:36,657
I didn't want it to be,
I don't know, awkward.

496
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,326
I mean, we live our entire
lives on autopilot.

497
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,994
And why? For what? Why?

498
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,530
I've been on autopilot
this whole time? I had no idea.

499
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,566
You can't spell success
without seceding.

500
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,102
That's why I'm
my own country now, okay?

501
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:51,606
From now on, if something
is not 100% authentic

502
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:55,408
to who I am, I'm out.
I'm not doing it. Scoutopia.

503
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:57,278
Do you still want to go
to the brunch rave?

504
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,280
Obviously, it's a brunch rave.

505
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,682
Okay, great, Britney,
put this in your jumpsuit.

506
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,185
I love brunch.

507
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,524
Did you know there's
no such thing as local honey?

508
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,860
Bees aren't even native
to North America.

509
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,996
Everything we've been taught
to believe in is a lie.

510
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,898
Do you want me to get started
about the gold industry?

511
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,833
I mean, you want to talk about
a corrupt industry--

512
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,467
Okay, I hear you.
But literally, who cares?

513
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,737
I do. About everything.

514
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,437
But every day I'm trying
to meditate

515
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:25,773
and be more like him.

516
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:27,608
- The DJ?
- Ugh, no.

517
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:29,243
No one wants to be
more like a DJ.

518
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:30,778
Like him.

519
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,747
Feet firmly planted,
waving in the breeze.

520
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,549
Going whenever life takes you.
A party full of music,

521
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,919
and yet only one of us
is brave enough to dance.

522
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,487
Okay, you just got dumped
by your fiancée,

523
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:41,989
so maybe we take a beat.

524
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,858
That's exactly my point.

525
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,626
I don't even believe
in marriage.

526
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,094
And Natasha knew that.

527
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:48,729
As far as I'm concerned,

528
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,463
straight people should have
been marching to get out

529
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:51,899
rather than gay people
marching to get in.

530
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,267
Hmm, fair.

531
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:54,635
And who was the first--

532
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,003
who was
the first woman to be like,

533
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,739
"Oh, I want to throw
a love party

534
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,408
and I'm going
to invite all my friends

535
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,076
and I'm going to wear white.

536
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,844
And then no one else at
the party gets to wear white."

537
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:05,713
You gotta find a jiggly piece.

538
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,715
"But some of my friends
are going to wear a dress

539
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,317
in a different color,
and that color

540
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,819
is going to match
the accent color on my flowers.

541
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:13,654
And then when I finish
with my flowers,

542
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,455
I'm going to throw it
at my friends."

543
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,024
Damn, you're good.

544
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:18,960
"Also, I want a cake.

545
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:20,962
What kind of cake?
I don't know.

546
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,864
I'm going to try all the kinds
of cake in a day of testing.

547
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:25,465
Even though as an adult woman,

548
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,234
I've clearly had
all the kinds of cake.

549
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,869
No, I want you to line the
cake types up in front of me.

550
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:30,638
And then I'm gonna taste
them one by one.

551
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,273
A carrot cake.
Yellow cake. Princess cake.

552
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,508
Ribbon cake.
Sprinkle cake. Confetti cake.

553
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,044
I want to try all of
the kinds of cake."

554
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,646
I love cake.

555
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,181
Are we done with this bit
or do you have more?

556
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,550
"Also, I want everybody
to bring me presents,

557
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:45,419
but I get
to pick which presents."

558
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,788
How hard did you hit
your head today?

559
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,157
I don't know, Ashley,
just hard enough.

560
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,526
No!

561
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,861
Jenga.

562
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:57,698
- How could you do that?
- Scout effing Durwood.

563
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,467
- Who's that?
- That is--

564
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,069
Scout fricking Durwood.

565
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,972
Can you please,
'cause I have this. 'Cause--

566
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:07,708
What the S are you doing here?

567
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:10,478
Oh, hi.
Uh, Jade, this is Ashley.

568
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,912
- Ashley, Jade.
- Hi.

569
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,547
- Britney.
- Britney, yeah.

570
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:16,083
And this is
The Inuit word for love.

571
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,519
Come again?

572
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,388
The Inuit word for love.

573
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,057
Sorry, what's the Inuit
word for love?

574
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:25,059
My baby.

575
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,028
Right. And-- and what's the
baby's name?

576
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,663
The Inuit word for love.

577
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,999
-Which is...
-Oh, I can't say it,

578
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,934
because that would be
appropriation.

579
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,003
But my husband and I just
really wanted to pay homage

580
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:37,605
to the people
who came before us.

581
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,940
So, it's kind of like
a respect thing.

582
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:43,512
That's what this feels
like right now. Respect.

583
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,446
Well, he is Canadian, right?

584
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,947
Oh, beautiful language.

585
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,716
- Canadian?
- Inuit.

586
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,217
Oh, I know.

587
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,386
Did you guys know
they have over, like,

588
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:53,788
a hundred words for snow?

589
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:55,990
Did you know that
no, they don't?

590
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:59,693
See, the Inuit language makes
a compound word out of nouns

591
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,462
and their modifiers.

592
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,432
So, white snow, for example,
becomes one word, whitesnow,

593
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,133
or yellow snow to yellowsnow.

594
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,169
Not to be confused
with slipperysnow.

595
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:10,271
Or is it gonnasnow
or snowysnow?

596
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,274
Did you know Americans have
13 different words

597
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,975
for the submarine sandwich?

598
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,813
Hero, hoagie, grinder, sub,

599
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:22,850
meat bed,
tuna pocket, bread basket,

600
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:26,821
slider, pita futon,
pizza... roll.

601
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,155
There's a lot.

602
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,690
There's so many,
I could keep going.

603
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,292
And yet only one word for love.

604
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,360
Speaking of which,
where is Natasha?

605
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,062
Uh, we-- we broke up.

606
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,064
Well, most relationships end.

607
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,966
Except for the one
you have with yourself.

608
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,935
That, you can
hold on to for forever.

609
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,736
Unless you're
an asshole about it.

610
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:46,040
Can you please-- can you please
not curse in front of the baby?

611
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,075
I didn't curse in front
of your baby.

612
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,678
You-- you did. You said--
you said the A word, Ashley.

613
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,346
-It's not appropriate.
-I'm sorry.

614
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,081
I didn't know I was cursing
in front of your baby.

615
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:55,382
Yeah, and now you woke him up.

616
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:56,650
You woke him up.

617
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,385
I'm not in front
of your baby.

618
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,187
Well, you woke him up with your
cursing, so... Come here.

619
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,822
Oh, hi.

620
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,424
- Do you want to hold him?
- No, I don't.

621
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:04,892
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

622
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,093
-I'm totally fine.
-You won't drop him.

623
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:07,728
I am-- I'm good, without the--

624
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:09,830
Scout, I literally
don't mind, okay.

625
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,765
No, I don't-- I don't--
I don't want to hold the baby.

626
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,268
-Scout. Scout.

Just wait till they have kids.

700
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:56,123
Nobody understands new moms
except for other new moms.

701
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,526
Only a mom can tell you that.

702
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,697
Hello?

703
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,264
Is that a baby?

704
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,568
Hello?

705
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,269
I'm a new mom, where are you?

706
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,205
I can help you.

707
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,841
I'm here, are you lost, Hayden?

708
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,008
I have bars in my purse.

709
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,177
Scout, wait up.

710
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:18,946
Scout, why you walking so fast?

711
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,215
Because I can.

712
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,883
Do you see these cars
down there?

713
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,418
Yeah.

714
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,019
Every one of them thinks
that their destination

715
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,789
is the most important
on the road.

716
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:31,492
But if any one of them tries
to beat the system by--

717
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,093
by changing lanes, or--

718
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,496
or moving faster than
the speed of traffic,

719
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,965
then the entire system
breaks down,

720
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:40,167
and every one of them
is moving more slowly

721
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,570
than if they'd been moving
together the whole time.

722
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,937
Come on.

723
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:47,776
That's why driverless cars are
going to be such a big deal.

724
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,277
Not only do
they mitigate human ego,

725
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,179
they mitigate human error.

726
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,616
For what is humanity,
if not a vessel

727
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,384
..for well-intended mistakes.

728
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,887
Whoa.

729
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,221
You, like,
think about a lot of stuff.

730
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,323
It's a prison!

731
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,796
See that car over there?

732
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,430
- Yeah.
- Okay, well,

733
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:11,265
idling your car
for more than, like,

734
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,233
10 seconds at a time,
horrible for your engine.

735
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,135
-But I thought that--
-No, that is a myth.

736
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,271
It's also terrible for
the environment.

737
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,907
And in neighborhoods
where it happens a lot,

738
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,208
it delays
brain development in kids.

739
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,243
It results in childhood asthma.

740
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,012
And yet people
do it all the time.

741
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,615
People go to drive-thrus
to idle their car.

742
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,249
Idle car, idle heart.

743
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,919
Well, maybe she doesn't know.
I'll go tell her.

744
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,787
No, you can't go around
correcting people

745
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,455
who don't want to be corrected.

746
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:36,256
It's rude and it's ineffective
and they hate you.

747
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,660
And yet I can no longer abide
living in a world

748
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:40,160
so wedded to being wrong.

749
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,397
Therefore, Scoutopia.

750
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,166
- Whoa.
- Hey,

751
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,402
what route did you guys take?
That took forever.

752
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,170
You guys hungry?
I want some tacos.

753
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,739
Wait, we're not wedded
to being wrong.

754
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:54,141
I don't know, Ashley
just upgraded to the 11.

755
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:57,177
What, my phone? Shoots in 8k.
How cool is that?

756
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,345
It's also
planned obsolescence.

757
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,013
I want to join Scoutopia.

758
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,816
Wait, are we still
talking about this?

759
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,218
Scoutopia doesn't exist,
Britney. Scout made it up.

760
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,186
Okay, first of all,
all countries are made up.

761
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,922
And second of all,
no, you don't.

762
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,891
It is very hard being
a Scoutopian.

763
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,425
Like, we can't even chew gum

764
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,561
unless it's specifically
labeled biodegradable.

765
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,362
Gum isn't biodegradable?

766
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:18,131
No, it's also the second most
littered item on the planet.

767
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:20,133
Cigarette butts are number one.

768
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,172
-Talk about a sticky situation.
-Yeah, well, you're welcome.

769
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,406
Look, my parents
raised me to believe

770
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,008
that I could be anything.

771
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:29,577
Do you know
how stressful that is?

772
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,179
Oh, I didn't know
you were born in the '90s.

773
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:33,715
Let me join Scoutopia.

774
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:36,283
I don't know, running
a sovereign nation state

775
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,785
is going really well
for me right now,

776
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,453
and I don't want
to jeopardize that by, like,

777
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,421
attracting human followers.

778
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:42,824
Okay, well,
then who's that creeper?

779
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:44,024
What?

780
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:49,363
Hi. Sorry, I, like,
couldn't help but overhear you

781
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,699
at the brunch rave.
And I totally agree.

782
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,568
And also traffic?

783
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,603
Pew! Who knew?

784
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:56,905
Oh, thank you.

785
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,907
What's Scoutopia?

786
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,374
It's our sovereign
nation state.

787
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,175
-Do you want to join?
-Yes.

788
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,913
No, no, to this.
We don't even know this person.

789
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,048
I don't know, Scoutopia has
open borders, it's like...

790
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,584
-They do?
-Mmm-hmm.

791
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:12,020
Okay, well,
you just can't chew your gum.

792
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,220
Oh, yeah, no problem.

793
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:14,822
You have to-- Yeah. Give it.

794
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:16,189
Hand it over. I'll take it.

795
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,158
Yeah. Safekeeping.

796
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,727
Okay, great. This is great.

797
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,428
Scout, what are you doing?

798
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,031
-This is insane.
-Oh, no, no,

799
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,566
idling your car is insane.

800
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,067
This is inspiring
social change.

801
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:30,038
-What's next?
-Next we live our lives

802
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,740
and go through the world trying
to make it a better place.

803
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,242
Starting with our Pledge of
Allegiance to the flag.

804
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,812
-We don't have a flag.
-Don't we?

805
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,315

Bless--

885
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:50,097
Out, demon. Out, evil spirit.

886
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:55,203
Take not this woman's soul,
for we value her among us.

887
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,370
- ...You.
- Why do you bless

888
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:58,973
someone after
they sneeze, Ashley?

889
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:01,441
You don't bless them
after they cough or burp,

890
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:03,211
after they fart.

891
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,812
Thank you, Kourtney.

892
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,882
So why bless someone
after they sneeze? Ashley.

893
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,384
Superstition.
People used to think that

894
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,054
after you sneeze,
the devil was gonna--

895
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:16,824
That the devil
was gonna steal your soul.

896
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:19,927
That the devil was gonna
reach inside your nose holes,

897
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,798
pull your soul out of it and
replace it with an evil spirit.

898
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,800
Is that what
you believe, Ashley?

899
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,102
-No--
-No, of course not.

900
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,905
Because Ashley is a rational,
thinking human being.

901
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,840
Or... is she?

902
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:36,577
Because knowing all of this,
when Kourtney sneezed...

903
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,846
She blessed her. Why?

904
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,717
Because you value tradition
over original thought.

905
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,451
-Okay, isn't that right?
-I wasn't--

906
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,921
Thinking? No, of course
you weren't thinking.

907
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,756
But are any of us thinking,
when we--

908
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,758
when we throw our money away
on lottery tickets

909
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:53,493
or climb aboard
the deathtraps we call cars?

910
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,495
No. How could we be, okay?

911
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,798
We are all too--
we're all too...

912
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:01,434
distracted by
this constant deluge of--

913
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,738
Of advertisements

914
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:07,675
trying to get us to limit
our capacity for rational--

915
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:09,543
Rational...

916
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:11,712
My B.
Thought it was on vibrate.

917
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,281
What is wrong with you?

918
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,049
...Thought.

919
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,718

Okay, I just talked to the DJ.
They said they'd turn it down.

1003
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,205
So...
Oh, no conflict is approaching.

1004
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,773
Protect your leader.
Scoutopia.

1005
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:01,876
-Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey, girl.

1006
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:04,513
-Not a girl.
-Yeah, we're not guys. So...

1007
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,681
Yeah, obviously. You guys
come here alone, or, uh...

1008
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,917
Mm, no,
we came with each other.

1009
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:14,355
Oh... All right,
yeah, I see what's going on.

1010
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:15,923
Yeah, I'm actually--

1011
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,858
I'm actually a lesbian
trapped in a man's body.

1012
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:20,261
-So totally get it.
-Doubt it.

1013
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:22,597
Must be so hard for you
to shop for bras.

1014
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:27,902
What size do you even buy?
42 AA extreme!

1015
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:30,938
-Baby size.
-Got a nice lift.

1016
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:34,141
You know my girlfriend
is, uh.. bi.

1017
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:37,546
Swing through later if
you wanna have a little fun...

1018
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,213

1019
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:40,948
What was that about?
That was crazy.

1020
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:43,017
-What's his deal?
-Ugh...

1021
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,086
-What an awful...
-what is your face doing?

1022
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,956
A bisexual girlfriend?
What is this, college?

1023
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,925
-I'm just having some fun.
-Stop.

1024
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,194
Like, what kind of monster
says no to fun?

1025
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:57,331
-Oops, oh, no, what do I do?
-Stop. Homewrecker.

1026
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,033
Not a homewrecker.
I'm a party starter.

1027

Let's get a drink.

1031
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,042
For the last time,
my name's Kourtney.

1032
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,110
-Oh, where's Britney?
-I don't know.

1033
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,879
You know what? She's probably
still in the bathroom.

1034
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,649
Peeing in a onesie
is not a game.

1035
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,784
Yeah, it's not a game.

1036
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,727

My God, you scared me.

1047
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:02,830
I know. 'Cause, um,
fear releases dopamine,

1048
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:05,933
which simulates
the feeling of falling in love.

1049

00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:28,856
Yeah, I do.

1061
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,329
People think marijuana
is, like, this big bad drug,

1062
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,064
but do you know how
many toxins are in Tylenol?

1063
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:38,700
-I'm Goochie, by the way.
-Gooch?

1064
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:40,735
Yeah, short for Goochman.

-Uh, that depends.

-It's fair. You can have some.

Wow. I've never made

1187

Hey, I know this is fast.
Maybe it's my lesbian vibes.

1188
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:05,252
-Yeah.
-But I think I love you, Scout.

1189
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:08,255
-Polo.
-What?

1190
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,058
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1191
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:12,492
Too much blue light
before bed isn't good for you.

1192
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:15,429
Releases cortisol,
messes up your metabolism.

1193
00:53:15,963 --> 00:53:19,167
Ooh, I will cortisol
you all night, girl.

1194
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:20,735
Ow! Ow.

1195
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,870
No low tables with
sharp corners. Scoutopia.

1196
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:25,439
No low tables with sharp
corners. This is illegal now.

1197
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:28,308
Come on, move it.
You, come on, help me.

1198
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:32,180
Okay, let's go.
Come on. Scoutopia, let's go.

1199
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:39,219
Guess this is how
we leave a party now.

1200
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:43,124
-Scoutopia.
-Okay, let's go, let's go, go,

1201
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,826
-go, come on, come on.
-Yeah. Whoo.

1202
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:47,028
-That's my job. That's my job.
-Oh.

1203
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:50,965
Just go. Turn around.
Go, go, go.

1204
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:56,571
Don't fake it 'til you make it.
Fake it 'til you become it.

1205
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:58,338
- Yeah.
- Scoutopia.

1206
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:00,575
Yeah, 20%.
All right. Totally.

1207
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:03,845
Totally. Buzz me tomorrow,
we could hash out the deets.

1208
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,680
All right, peace.

1209
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,516
Fuck, yeah.

1210
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,986
Oh, dang, bro, I'm sorry.

1211
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,222
I was totally in my
head trying to close this deal.

1212
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:16,924
Uh, peace offering?

1213
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:20,595
Fucking, my girlfriend left for
like a bunch of lesbians, so...

1214
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:23,363
Saturdays are for the boys!

1215
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:26,534
Dope shades, by the way.
I really like them.

1216
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,102
I had a pair just like them.

1217
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,271
Lost them on a jet ski
at my cousin's place in Tahoe.

1218
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:34,341
Yeah, we used to get
up there, like, once a year.

1219
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:38,378
Bunch of dudes, you know, just
hanging out doing dude stuff.

1220
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:42,315
Still got the key,
you know, just in case.

1221
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:49,023
Anyway, I got a vodka tonic
calling me "Daddy" upstairs,

1222
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,692
so, uh, I better hit it.
Good talking to you.

1223
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:55,395
You know, Tahoe's
only seven hours from here.

1224
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,632
Six if I open her up.

1225
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:00,868
Nah, man, that's-- that's really
dope of you to offer,

1226
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:03,037
but I-- I gotta pass.

1227
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:06,607
-Thanks anyway, though.
-Saturdays are for the boys.

1228
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:12,213
You know what, bro? Fuck it.

1229
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:17,350
Um, excuse me. Sorry.

1230
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,452
I don't mean to
step on anybody's toes,

1231
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:22,924
but I'm mostly positive
that we missed my stop.

1232
00:55:23,057 --> 00:55:24,158
I think we passed it.

1233
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:25,893
Oh, God.

1234
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:30,497
Mm.

1235
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,935
<i>♪ Taxi, take me home ♪</i>

1236
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:36,771
Oh, God, thank God.
Can you turn on the AC?

1237
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:39,106
Um, sorry, do you know
that cigarette butts

1238
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,542
are, like, the most
littered item on the planet?

1239
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:43,476
What are you,
from Planet Do-Gooder?

1240
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:48,182
Ugh, thank God.
I am starving.

1241
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:50,818
We've been intermittently
fasting because apparently

1242
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:53,654
that's a thing.
On top of these insane hours,

1243
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:56,123
it's only going to get worse
the closer we get to November.

1244
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,860
Wait, do you guys
know each other?

1245
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:02,163
What, is she-- Are you kidding?
I cannot take her right now.

1246
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,734
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Please trade me.

1247
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,870
Come on,
we get to smoke cigarettes

1248
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,872
even though
we lobby against tobacco.

1249
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:13,608
We don't believe in AC
because we're "leaning in"

1250
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:15,475
and we say
we're going to go to the gym

1251
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,979
all the time,
but we haven't been since 2016.

1252
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:19,780
Come on, please.

1253
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,984
Fuck it.
Anarchy's dead anyway.

1254
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:25,553
Yes, sister.
You're not gonna regret this.

1255
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:27,188
Have you ever had
brunch on a Tuesday?

1256
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:29,824
Okay, my friends are
definitely wondering where I am

1257
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:32,026
and also what
the fuck is happening?

1258
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,329
Don't worry. You're next.

1259
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,901
Everybody!
Show's about to start.

1260
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:41,769
Let's do it! Whoo!

1261
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:44,605
-Welcome, welcome, welcome.
-Hi, welcome. Welcome, hi.

1262
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,540
-This is 100.
-Thank you. You are crazy.

1263
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:48,342
How did everybody find
jumpsuits so fast?

1264
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:49,644
Oh, my God, it's Ashley.

1265
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:51,679
-Hi. Hi, welcome.
-Hey.

1266
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:53,547
-So happy to have you
-Really happy to have you.

1267
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,850
-Come on in. Hello.
-Welcome.

1268
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,518
-Where did you popcorn?
-Thank you for coming.

1269
00:56:57,652 --> 00:56:59,020
Hurry on in.

1270
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,453
I heard she literally
only eats popcorn

1271
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:01,956
and cold pressed juice.

1272
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:05,860
I heard that she's
a certified Pilates instructor.

1273
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:09,096
You know how plastic
bags cost $0.10? She did that.

1274
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,232
Guys, none of this is true.

1275
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:13,567
-Shh, it's starting.
-You gotta calm down.

1276
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,704
Hi, hi.

1277
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,942
-Ladies and gentle-ladies.
-Nonbinary friends

1278
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,578
-of all shapes and sizes,
-welcome to Scoutopia!

1279
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:28,916
And now,
without further ado.

1280
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,785
The one you've
all been waiting for.

1281
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:33,453
Your hero and mine,
Scout Durwood!

1282
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:35,488
Scout Durwood.

1283
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,225
Oh, Scout!

1284
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:41,662
I love you!

1285
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:45,533
Yeah!

1286
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:52,139
- Rosé all day.
- Oh, gosh.

1287
00:57:53,507 --> 00:57:56,377
Oh, you guys,
she's just--

1288
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,778
Ah.

1289
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:01,182

1333
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,992
I want to talk to
you today about caterpillars.

1334
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:35,429
And more importantly, about
the butterflies they become.

1335
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:39,400
See, inside its cocoon,
a caterpillar releases

1336
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:43,370
the digestive enzyme that
disintegrates its body comple--

1337
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:47,107
That disintegrates
its body entirely.

1338
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:49,877
And from that primordial goo,

1339
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:52,647
an entirely new creature--

1340
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,949
An entirely--

1341
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,886
An entirely new creature is--

1342
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,155
An entirely
new creature is born.

1343
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:04,024
What are you doing?

1344
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:05,793
Oh, don't worry,
I've already heard this podcast.

1345
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:07,228
-It's cool.
-Put your phone away.

1346
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:08,663
Yeah, show your leader
some respect.

1347
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:10,164
It's okay, Kourtney. Carrie.

1348
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:12,299
Ashley's free
to do whatever she wants.

1349
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:15,502
We value individual choice
here in Scoutopia, do we not?

1350
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,771
I said do we not?

1351
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:21,809
Nothing is more
important than individual loss

1352
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:24,245
-and critical thought.
-Critical thought.

1353
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,015
Yeah, great. Thank you.
Now, Ashley, what, uh--

1354
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:29,551
what's so important
it couldn't wait?

1355
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:31,185
Oh, nothing. I've just--
I've already listened

1356
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:33,521
-to this podcast, so...
-What podcast?

1357
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:34,989
Yeah,
what are you talking about?

1358
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:36,591
Have you not noticed?

1359
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:38,727
Most of what she's saying
she heard on a podcast.

1360
01:02:38,859 --> 01:02:40,327
What? No.

1361
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:44,031
Is that true?

1362
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:47,935
Uh, technically,
yeah, it is.

1363
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,505
But wouldn't it be insane
to think I researched

1364
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,375
-everything myself?
-No, right, but anecdotal news

1365
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,176
is problematic,
and that's often the basis

1366
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,445
for podcast narratives, so...

1367
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,347
Interesting point, Ashley.

1368
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:01,716
You got it.

1369
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:03,752
Anyone else here
listen to podcasts?

1370
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:05,352
Oh, I do.

1371
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,223
Perhaps I am not
the free thinker I aspire to be.

1372
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,258
Everyone,
take out your phones.

1373
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:12,893
Go ahead, take them out.
That's right.

1374
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:16,698
In 1971, there was a famous
anti-littering campaign

1375
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,299
nicknamed the Crying Indian.

1376
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:21,235
Their nickname, not mine.
Yeah. Problematic. Yeah.

1377
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:22,970
In that commercial,

1378
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,774
a Native American
man sheds a single tear

1379
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:27,908
in response to highway litter.

1380
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:30,110
And who sponsored that campaign?

1381
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:33,013
Beverage
manufacturing companies.

1382
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,049
Who were trying to avoid

1383
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:37,885
regulation on their newly
released invention,

1384
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,688
non-reusable packaging.

1385
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,990
Yeah, people who litter
are monsters, they said.

1386
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:45,192
But how dare we criticize
the corporations

1387
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:47,361
who are filling
their hands with trash?

1388
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,197
Treat the symptoms,
ignore the disease.

1389
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:52,399
You know where
I first heard about

1390
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:54,435
-the Crying Indian campaign?
-On a podcast?

1391
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:57,237
On a podcast.

1392
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:59,473
Cell phones are illegal now.
Scoutopia.

1393
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:00,742
Everyone please smash--

1394
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:05,346
-- phones. Ashley?

1395
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:08,082
-Yeah.
-Would you like to go next?

1396
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,652
-No.
-Why not?

1397
01:04:10,785 --> 01:04:12,620
You can't expect us
to follow you blindly.

1398
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:14,589
That goes against
everything that we stand--

1399
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:20,094
-...for.
-Look, the point of Scoutopia

1400
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:21,830
is to be better
versions of ourselves.

1401
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:23,531
I thought the point
of Scoutopia

1402
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:26,601
was to be fiercely judgmental
and mostly vegetarian.

1403
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:28,435
You are free to make whatever
decision you wish to make,

1404
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,937
as long as
you make the right one.

1405
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,005
-Now smash your phone.
-No.

1406
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:33,842
Don't you see
you are holding on

1407
01:04:33,974 --> 01:04:35,577
to something
that is holding you back.

1408
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,311
I'm trying to help you.

1409
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,748
Look, I get that you don't
want to wear a bra anymore.

1410
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,982
I mean, who does?
And honestly, these jumpsuits

1411
01:04:42,116 --> 01:04:45,152
are super comfy,
but this is insane.

1412
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:48,790
Au contraire, Ashley,
this is insane.

1413
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,157
Tap twice if you like me.

1414
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,359
Tap twice
if you wish to be liked.

1415
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:56,865
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

1416
01:04:56,997 --> 01:04:58,833
-Stop it.
-Tap, tap, tap.

1417
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:00,735
They threaten you with obscurity

1418
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:02,704
and from obscurity,
you obey.

1419
01:05:02,837 --> 01:05:05,439
-Hey, you're scaring me.
-Good! You'll appreciate it

1420
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:08,909
even more when you finally
realize that you're safe.

1421
01:05:09,544 --> 01:05:11,846
-Give me my phone.
-No, I-- ow!

1422
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:14,381
-Natasha has cancer.
-What?

1423
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:16,818
"Just found out it's cancer,
but my new girlfriend

1424
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,586
is the perfect nurse.

1425
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,454
Thank you to everyone for
all your thoughts and prayers.

1426
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,624
#FuckCancer, #Hope"

1427
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,025
Scout, I had no idea.

1428
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:27,494
Most relationships end.

1429
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:31,198
Even our relationship with
our existence on this plane.

1430
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,601
-Death is all part of it.
-Shh.

1431
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,471

Twitter notifications

What are you doing?

1497
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:40,247
Don't you see, Ashley?
I am setting you free!

1498
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,551
Oh! Oh!

1499
01:09:44,786 --> 01:09:47,655
Sorry I'm late,
peeing in a onesie's no joke.

1500
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:51,759
-Who are you?
-Everybody, get down!

1501
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:54,227
Since when do you have a gun?

1502
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,863
Conceal and carry, baby.

1503
01:09:55,997 --> 01:09:58,800
Second Amendment for life!
Fucking idiot, Carrie.

1504
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:01,969
She's gone! That person's gone!

1505
01:10:02,103 --> 01:10:03,437
Oh, my God, is that 'cause
she used a straw?

1506
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:04,972
I saw her use a straw.

1507
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:06,406
Don't worry, guys, I got this.

1508
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,676
Oh, my God, are you flirting
with me right now?

1509
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:11,278
-What do I do, Scout?
-Run towards the light.

1510
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:12,814
Okay!

1511
01:10:13,614 --> 01:10:16,450
Kourtney, no.
We have to explore this.

1512
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:20,220
Okay, I need everyone to just
give me a minute.

1513
01:10:20,353 --> 01:10:24,592
Eenie, meenie, minie-- ooh!

1514
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:44,212
I think she's gone.

1515
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:47,380
Ooh.

1516
01:10:48,049 --> 01:10:49,249
No, no, no, no.

1517
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:56,758
Doge?

1518
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:00,762
Doge, doge.

1519
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:04,364
Oh, my goddess,
I thought I lost you, too.

1520
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:09,103
Oh, shade. I cannot believe
how badly this is going.

1521
01:11:09,237 --> 01:11:11,438
I lost my coat.
I lost my friends.

1522
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,508
My dog won't even talk to me.

1523
01:11:14,142 --> 01:11:16,911
At least now I officially
have nothing left to lose.

1524
01:11:20,413 --> 01:11:21,682
Touché.

1525
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:27,588
This is your stop.

1526
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,092
Oh, I think
this is your stop.

1527
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,492
I'm closer to La Brea.

1528
01:11:33,194 --> 01:11:35,362
Oh, my God,
I cannot with this girl.

1529
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:42,036
Bubbla. Britney. Welcome.

1530
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:46,874
There are over
30,000 bees in this hive,

1531
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:48,609
and yet only one queen.

1532
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:51,311
Do you feel like there's
something special about you?

1533
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,714
Something that separates
you from everyone else?

1534
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,118
-No.
-Me neither.

1535
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:58,920
Because we are the Britneys,

1536
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:02,824
universal followers who maintain
order by supporting our hive.

1537
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:06,194
Without us, no leader can lead,
for without us...

1538
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,196
there's no one to be led.

1539
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:10,965
Did you know there's
no such thing as local honey?

1540
01:12:11,098 --> 01:12:13,067
Bees aren't even native
to North America.

1541
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:15,136
-I read that on a podcast.
-A great sentiment.

1542
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:18,673
However, think-- think of
all the wonderful things

1543
01:12:18,806 --> 01:12:20,340
they've done
since they arrived.

1544
01:12:20,473 --> 01:12:22,143
They take
the sweetest bits of this,

1545
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:23,978
the most potent bits of that.

1546
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:27,815
You know, if bees go extinct,
that all of humanity will die.

1547
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:30,852
Yet another sticky situation.

1548
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:33,054
Pure change is more
than just a great idea.

1549
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:34,889
I get a great idea.
You got a great idea.

1550
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:37,525
We all get great ideas.
It's about follow up,

1551
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,861
follow through, followers.

1552
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:42,663
Go be that follower, Britney.

1553
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:44,732
Don't let your leader give up.

1554
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:47,134
Scram. Get out of here.

1555
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:50,805
-Wait, where are you going?
-Well, this is your stop.

1556
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:52,707
I don't even know where I am.

1557
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:56,110
Wait, has your car
been idling this entire time?

1558
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:59,046
Don't you care anything
about the environment?

1559
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,515
Idle car, idle heart.

1560
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:03,251
Scout?

1561
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,152
Scout, wait up!

1562
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,623
So this is what
the end of hope looks like.

1563
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:12,293
Nothing to hold on to,
nothing to hold me back.

1564
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:13,861
Scout.

1565
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:15,730
Scout. Hi.

1566
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:17,598
Oh, my gosh. Britney.

1567
01:13:17,732 --> 01:13:19,033
-Hi.
-Where have you been?

1568
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:20,868
I took a Lyft.
I thought I told you.

1569
01:13:21,002 --> 01:13:22,303
Yeah, but that was
two days ago.

1570
01:13:22,435 --> 01:13:23,938
I know.

1571
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:25,640
So what did I miss?

1572
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,008
Well, kind of a lot.

1573
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:29,710
Uh, I was confronted
by my evil twin.

1574
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:32,412
I singlehandedly negated
all of the good

1575
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:34,148
I set out
to create in the world.

1576
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:37,385
And in a quest for power,
I have become everything I hate,

1577
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:40,721
as evidenced by the fact that
everyone I love now hates me.

1578
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,623
Oh. That sounds tough.

1579
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:44,792
Yeah, Britney,
this is all turning out to be

1580
01:13:44,926 --> 01:13:47,728
significantly tougher than
I ever dreamed it could be.

1581
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:49,397
Well, hey, don't give up.

1582
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,132
What you mean, don't give up?

1583
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:53,968
Everything I've done since
Natasha left me is garbage.

1584
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,037
Not everything.

1585
01:13:56,804 --> 01:14:00,041
I pledge allegiance
to the wacky waver

1586
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:03,044
of the United States
of Scoutopia...

1587
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:06,647
And to the shepublic
for which it stands,

1588
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:09,250
one nation under Scout,

1589
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:15,122
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for Scoutopia.

1590
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:19,126
Scout, life is a party
filled with music.

1591
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,030
It'd be a shame if you were no
longer brave enough to dance.

1592
01:14:23,431 --> 01:14:24,899
Thanks, Britney.

1593
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:27,435
You're right and I needed that.

1594
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,537
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1595
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,706
I have a cult to save.

1596
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:35,176
Yeah! Go do it!
You got this, Scout.

1597
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:37,477
Oh, my God. I'm doing it.
I'm a Britney

1598
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:40,114
and I'm a follower
and I'm doing it.

1599
01:14:40,247 --> 01:14:42,383
Wait, Scout, wait up.
God damn it.

1600
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:45,286
I'm an idiot. Okay.

1601
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:47,421

I can't do this.
What am I doing? I can't just--

1606
01:14:57,331 --> 01:14:59,233
I'm going to do this.
I got this. Okay.

1607
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:02,336
Eyes on the prize,
changing the world.

1608
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,338
You've got this, Scout.

1609
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:06,140
Into the abyss.

1610
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:17,651
- Hello?
- Oooh!

1611
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,690
You're right.
That's fun. That's-- ooh!

1612
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,060
-Who are you?
-Oh, how rude of me.

1613
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:27,328
I'm Scout.

1614
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,263
That's impossible. I'm Scout.

1615
01:15:29,397 --> 01:15:30,664
Surely you can't think

1616
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:32,933
there's only one of you
in the universe.

1617
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:35,569
Oh, you do?

1618
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:38,539
-Well, how quaint.
-There's more than one of me?

1619
01:15:38,672 --> 01:15:40,074
There's more
than one of everybody.

1620
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:41,675
Literally everything
in the universe

1621
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:43,411
exists because
of patterns in math.

1622
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:45,880
I forgot
how endearingly preoccupied

1623
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:48,549
this universe is
with trying to be special.

1624
01:15:48,682 --> 01:15:51,218
Spoiler alert,
there's no such thing.

1625
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,989
I'm from an alien planet
populated entirely

1626
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:58,259
by people who look
and act just like you.

1627
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,227
I've come to take you there.

1628
01:16:00,361 --> 01:16:02,863
Come on, let's go home.

1629
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:04,665
I-- I--

1630
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:10,404
What are you doing?
Don't you want to come home?

1631
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:12,306
- What about my friends?
- What about them?

1632
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,642
You said it yourself.
They're medium friends.

1633
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,043
Yeah, but
they're my medium friends.

1634
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:17,778
Okay, well, now
I'm your medium friend.

1635
01:16:17,912 --> 01:16:20,681
Technically,
I am a liaison between worlds.

1636
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:23,050
A medium, if you will.

1637
01:16:23,184 --> 01:16:26,087
Devastating, really,
that this world can't be saved.

1638
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,988
These separations
are never pleasant.

1639
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:30,024
But as they say,
the fate of the universe

1640
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:32,993
-depends on us, so...
-Separations.

1641
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:36,831
Do you know where the word
utopia comes from, Scout?

1642
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:38,567
Yeah, obviously it's Greek.

1643
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,702
"Ou" meaning not, and "topos",
meaning place. Utopia.

1644
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:45,172
- Not a place.
- Mm-hmm. But a youtopia?

1645
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:46,774
Y-O-U.

1646
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:49,443
Now there's a juice
that's worth the squeeze.

1647
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:51,045
A metopia?

1648
01:16:51,178 --> 01:16:54,381
There are infinite topias
in the universe.

1649
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:56,917
Generally speaking,
people prefer to mix and match,

1650
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,253
entropy being
what it is and all.

1651
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:01,288
But every once in a while,
the conversation

1652
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:04,593
gets a little too... rowdy.

1653
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:06,293
One of these
separations begins.

1654
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:08,195
You can already
see the roots of it here.

1655
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:10,164
I mean, there are infinite
points of view available,

1656
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:13,200
and yet most people prefer
an echo chamber of their own.

1657
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:15,803
Right, but there's no way
the solution is to have

1658
01:17:15,936 --> 01:17:17,071
fewer points of view.

1659
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:18,873
What about the point of view

1660
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:21,041
that you shouldn't, um,
vaccinate your children?

1661
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:23,677
Um, that's not a point of view.
That's incorrect.

1662
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:27,047
That's-- Wait, is there an
entire planet of anti-vaxxers?

1663
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:29,450
Well, they've never technically
populated an entire planet.

1664
01:17:29,584 --> 01:17:32,686
One person gets the measles
and the whole planet's gone.

1665
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,589
I mean, you should
see Natashatopia.

1666
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:37,258
It's nothing but collared
shirts and Twitter feeds.

1667
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:39,594
Natasha's
not on another planet.

1668
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,162
She just tweeted about cancer.

1669
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:43,230
Oh, honestly,
most people on Twitter

1670
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:45,299
are actually just citizens
of Natashatopia.

1671
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:47,334
I mean, haven't you noticed
the redundancies?

1672
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:50,104
Ugh-- Who's still even
on Twitter these days?

1673
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:52,607
In Scoutopia,
we don't even have smartphones,

1674
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,643
just portable podcast devices.

1675
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:56,810
Huge fan of yours,
by the way.

1676
01:17:57,978 --> 01:17:59,380
Oh my God,
you listen to my podcast?

1677
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:01,715
Everyone on Scoutopia
loves your podcast.

1678
01:18:02,483 --> 01:18:04,218
Just like we love you.

1679
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,788
No. If there's one thing

1680
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:10,191
all citizens of Scoutopia
must agree on

1681
01:18:10,324 --> 01:18:12,527
it's that there's
no such thing as love.

1682
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:14,663
Except for self love.

1683
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,997
That, you can
hold on to for forever.

1684
01:18:17,632 --> 01:18:19,601
Come home with us, Scout.

1685
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:21,802
We love you
like no one else can.

1686
01:18:22,637 --> 01:18:25,105
And isn't that what everyone
wants in the end?

1687
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:27,308
To be loved?

No!

1763
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,119
- Ow.
- Are you okay?

1764
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,822
What the fuck Ashley?

1765
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:37,057
I shot somebody.
Oh, my God, my body.

1766
01:22:37,725 --> 01:22:39,359
Gosh, did I pick wrong?

1767
01:22:39,493 --> 01:22:42,095
No, no, you picked right.
I'm-- I'm alien Scout, hello.

1768
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:44,331
You monster.
She doesn't want anything to do

1769
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,200
-with your bullshit plan, okay?
-No, I do.

1770
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,902
-I do. I want it...
-Life is not about surrounding

1771
01:22:48,035 --> 01:22:49,604
yourself
with like-minded individuals.

1772
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:52,105
It's about exposing yourself
to new perspectives

1773
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:53,541
- you never dreamed existed.
- Yes, I do.

1774
01:22:53,675 --> 01:22:58,078
-It's about--
-No. No. Take me to...

1775
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,315
-Scoutopia.
-What?

1776
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:03,050
Imagine a world
where you didn't have to worry

1777
01:23:03,183 --> 01:23:05,587
about rape, Ashley.
Like, just for starters.

1778
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,523
Ima-- Imagine never having to
have another conversation about

1779
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:11,325
the importance of science
over belief. Imagine--

1780
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:14,261
Did I mention the entire
planet is also gluten-free?

1781
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:16,664
It's usually a big draw.
Come on, I gotta go there.

1782
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:19,099
- If only I live long...
- Wait, I have an idea.

1783
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,401
I knew I kept this
for a reason. It's my gum.

1784
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:23,571
I can use
it to seal the wound.

1785
01:23:24,606 --> 01:23:27,341
-Stop that.
-What is the matter with you?

1786
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:29,878
She's going to be fine.
There's no such thing

1787
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,445
as deadly force on Scoutopia.

1788
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:35,015
We're not on Scoutopia.
We're in my apartment.

1789
01:23:35,148 --> 01:23:37,417
And your apartment is?

1790
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:42,590
-Scoutopia.
-A portal to Scoutopia.

1791
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:45,058
-A portal to Scoutopia.
-I opened it just a minute ago.

1792
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,529
I thought we were going, and
then this happened and so--

1793
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,496
but we gotta go now 'cause
it will close eventually.

1794
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:51,465
Takes a lot of energy
and we're very eco-fre--

1795
01:23:51,599 --> 01:23:53,535
You know-- I don't
have to explain it to you.

1796
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:55,003
You've already-- We gotta go.
Gotta go.

1797
01:23:55,135 --> 01:23:56,704
- Okay.
- What about me?

1798
01:23:56,838 --> 01:24:00,542
Oh. Well, I guess...

1799
01:24:01,341 --> 01:24:03,343
most relationships end.

1800
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:06,581
Yeah. I guess they do.

1801
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:09,349
Hey, I'm-- I'm really
sorry about everything, I--

1802
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:12,286
Don't apologize.
Takes away your authority.

1803
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:16,390
Good. Maybe-- maybe
it's about time someone did.

1804
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:21,194
Looks like I was
the medium friend all along.

1805
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:23,531
Yeah. You were.

1806
01:24:25,132 --> 01:24:26,568
Oh. I was.

1807
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,137
-Okay.
-Are you ready now?

1808
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:32,707
I'm ready. Wait.

1809
01:24:36,476 --> 01:24:38,412
-I want you to keep Doge.
-Okay.

1810
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:41,049
So a part of
me will always live on.

1811
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:42,650
Oh, you can take Doge
to Scoutopia.

1812
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:44,484
Everyone on
that planet has a rescue dog.

1813
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:47,354
Literally everyone
on the planet is you.

1814
01:24:47,487 --> 01:24:48,590
-So, they all have a--
-Oh, okay.

1815
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:50,424
In that case,
bye, guys.

1816
01:24:50,558 --> 01:24:53,193
-Bye.
-Say bye, Doge. Bye.

1817
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:57,264
-What's that?
-It's the Inuit word for love.

1818
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:01,669
Now what?

1819
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,038
Now it's your turn, biotch.

1820
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,640
I'm here to take you home, girl.

1821
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:07,709
-Who are you?
-Wait, wait, I got this.

1822
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:10,044
Okay, how much
do you know about bees?

1823
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:13,447
I'm taking you
to Ashleytopia, honey.

1824
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:15,248
-Ashleytopia?
-Yeah. You know how you feel

1825
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:16,818
-about high-low dresses.
-Yes.

1826
01:25:16,951 --> 01:25:18,553
That they're
the mullets of evening wear.

1827
01:25:18,686 --> 01:25:22,023
Imagine a world
where they don't even exist.

1828
01:25:22,155 --> 01:25:23,758
Huh?

1829
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,561
Imagine a world where cap
sleeves are a thing of the past.

1830
01:25:26,694 --> 01:25:28,295
So, this is
what we're doing now?

1831
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:29,731
We're all just gonna
go to our own planets

1832
01:25:29,864 --> 01:25:31,599
where everyone
has the same beliefs?

1833
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:33,367
You're flirting with me
right now. Come on, let's go.

1834
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,168
Okay, I'm not gonna
go to an alien planet.

1835
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:37,905
I'm not doing it. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna leave the house

1836
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:40,273
because I don't have
a reason to stay here.

1837
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:41,843
But I'm not gonna teleport.

1838
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:43,544
-Anywhere.
-Bye.

1839
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:45,613
It's a--
it's a death machine.

1840
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:47,548
I heard about it on a podcast.

1841
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:51,385
-Have fun.
-Hey, my next ride is here.

1842
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:53,453
-You gonna be okay?
-I think so.

1843
01:25:53,588 --> 01:25:56,456
All right, well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

1844
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:58,693
And remember,
things won't get better

1845
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:01,696
unless you demand
for them to change.

1846
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:03,798
Holy cannoli.
Biodegradable gum.

1847
01:26:03,931 --> 01:26:06,801
-I get to chew gum again.
-Check out that gum.

1848
01:26:06,934 --> 01:26:09,403
Well, this is exciting.
I love chewing gum.

1849
01:26:09,537 --> 01:26:12,874
It's not really the consistency
I'm used to. This is not--

1850
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,810
Okay. Well, bye, Britney.
Thank you, Other Britney.

1851
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:19,246
I can get used to this.

1852
01:26:20,414 --> 01:26:22,382
Oh, I'll get it.

1853
01:26:22,517 --> 01:26:25,119
Hello? Hi. Sorry,
the door was open.

1854
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:26,621
Hey. Oh, that's okay.

1855
01:26:26,754 --> 01:26:28,990
Well, I'm here on behalf
of the organization,

1856
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:30,792
You Are Not a Loan.

1857
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:33,493
We grant micro loans
to women-run businesses

1858
01:26:33,628 --> 01:26:35,462
in the developing world.

1859
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:37,464
I was wondering if I could just
have a moment of your time.

1860
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:39,967
You can have
all the moments of my time.

1861
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:42,003
Also, uh, what's a micro loan?

1862
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:43,705
Really? Oh, uh, yeah.

1863
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,439
A micro loan
is like a macro loan,

1864
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:47,374
but smaller,
because it's for women.

1865
01:26:47,508 --> 01:26:49,409
-Well, that's not okay, right?
-Yeah.

1866
01:26:49,544 --> 01:26:51,112
Would you be
interested in helping?

1867
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:54,115
-I would love to help.
-Really?

1868
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:55,983
If you'll have me, yes.

1869
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:58,820
-Wow, I wasn't expecting this.
-Me neither.

1870
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:03,124
Yeah, well, uh, do you wanna
go door to door with me?

1871
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:06,226
-I would love nothing more.
-Oh, that's so great.

1872
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:08,029
This is such
a passionate cause of mine.

1873
01:27:08,162 --> 01:27:10,998
You know, macro loans,
those are too big for women.

1874
01:27:11,132 --> 01:27:13,868
But if you get a small--
just a small enough amount--

1875
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,937
We don't require as much.
