1
00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:04,963
Ladies and gentlemen,
tom segura.

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:09,051
[Cheers and applause]

3
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:23,565
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,442
Thank you. Very nice of you.

5
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,735
Thank you.

6
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:30,864
I hope I live up
to your expectations.

7
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:36,870
I realized today
that I need a hobby,

8
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:41,792
because my workday
just started, like, now.

9
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:45,712
Right now.

10
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,130
I mean, here's the thing,

11
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:52,761
it's not even
that big a part of my day.

12
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,680
So even if it doesn't go well,
it's like, ah, you know,

13
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,015
still a pretty
good fucking day.

14
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:01,102
Like, it was...
wasn't a bad day.

15
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,146
It just... you know, that part at
work that, for an hour,

16
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,397
just didn't go to my liking,

17
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:08,569
and then I had
a great day otherwise.

18
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,947
'Cause my whole life is
basically, you know,

19
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,907
it's... it's... it's hotels.

20
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:18,202
Being in a hotel,
just waiting for the show.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,789
Sad, right?

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,332
I'm just waiting
for the show to start.

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,792
And you're like,
what... what am I gonna...

24
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,627
I mean, you can only jerk off
so many times

25
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:29,506
before you're like, all right,

26
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:33,677
I'm gonna do it again, but...

27
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:36,930
Right now it hurts.

28
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,557
I should find
something else to do.

29
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,268
I absolutely ruin hotel rooms.

30
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:48,483
Like, if you stay in a hotel
room after I stayed there,

31
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:53,071
shit is gonna itch on you, okay?

32
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,991
Just being honest.

33
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,993
Come on, hotels are great.

34
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:58,994
Everybody loves hotels.

35
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,286
Especially when you check in

36
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,579
with your significant other.

37
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,748
Why?
Because you know in a hotel

38
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,291
you're gonna have sex,

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,669
and you're gonna have
an elevated form of sex.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,546
You're gonna have
hotel room sex,

41
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,381
which is, let's have sex,

42
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:16,469
but let's also
disrespect this room.

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,804
Yeah.

44
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:22,726
I do that too,
except I'm alone.

45
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:27,522
Like, I always wipe my balls
on the curtains,

46
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,901
because I know
they don't change those.

47
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:33,945
Think about that the next time
you want some sunlight.

48
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:39,659
[Laughter] Or don't.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,914
Just know that it's on your
hand, you know what I mean?

50
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,875
Here's what I've been trying
to figure out.

51
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,419
I got into
online shopping recently.

52
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,130
I guess that's a thing.

53
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,506
Here's what
I've been doing though.

54
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,717
I shop for things
that are, like,

55
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,469
way out of my price range.

56
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,180
And then after a while,
I go, "oh, yeah."

57
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,016
I can't afford that."

58
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:07,437
Like today,
I was looking at yachts online.

59
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,898
And then I was telling myself
I didn't want them,

60
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,901
as if they were an option,
you know?

61
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,945
I was like, "155 feet?
That's not even"

62
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,113
"big enough for
all my friends and family.

63
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,573
I'm not getting that shit."

64
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,575
What the fuck am I doing?

65
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,993
You ever do that?

66
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,327
You ever go down, like,
a rabbit hole online,

67
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,371
and then, like,
six hours have gone by,

68
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,207
and you're like, "I'm shopping
for the private jet"

69
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,711
"that best suits my needs.

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,088
"I think I found...
this is it right here.

71
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,213
The g550."

72
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,133
How much is this? Place order.

73
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:39,094
$53 million?

74
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,346
Well, maybe not now,
but maybe later.

75
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,641
I'll just bookmark
that shit for now.

76
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:48,561
Boop.

77
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,980
You know what that is?

78
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,815
That's a sense of entitlement.

79
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:55,193
That's me thinking I should be
associated with this thing.

80
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,987
And I haven't earned it.
I haven't.

81
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:00,573
Neither have you, but also me.

82
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,494
I get that feeling the most when
I get upgraded to first class.

83
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,496
Yeah. I fly every week.

84
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,623
I never buy
a first class ticket.

85
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,624
I buy coach tickets.

86
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,834
I buy them so much,

87
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,710
I get bumped up to first class.

88
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,798
I am telling you, the moment
I get bumped up to first class,

89
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,217
I get washed over
with this feeling.

90
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,385
I'm like, "look at these fucking
poor pieces of shit"

91
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,140
on my flight. Ugh."

92
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,433
I'm so much better than them.

93
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,144
Don't stand next to me.

94
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:32,313
Ugh, dude.

95
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,440
I dare you to try
to come up from coach

96
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,609
and use the first class bathroom
when I'm there.

97
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,112
I'll put my hand on your chest,
okay?

98
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,990
No. No.

99
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,825
There's a pig trough
in the back.

100
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,952
That's for you guys.

101
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:51,124
That's for the big ballers
up front.

102
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,417
Some people
buy first class tickets.

103
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,170
I always feel like they know
you got upgraded.

104
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,713
They always give you
the look like,

105
00:04:56,714 --> 00:05:01,134
"by the way, we fucking know."

106
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:05,513
You can sit up here,
but you're not like us.

107
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,140
God, it's so weird.

108
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,684
People... people ask me cra...
like, I get asked

109
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,103
fucking travel advice
from strangers.

110
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,981
Can we just break down
how crazy that is?

111
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,275
Like, people come up to me,
and they're like,

112
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,193
"hey, you travel a lot, right?"

113
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,485
And I'm like, "yeah."

114
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,280
They're like,
"where should I go?"

115
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,243
Uh, I don't fucking
know you, man.

116
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,745
You ask travel advice to people
who know you intimately.

117
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,913
They know you well.

118
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,122
They can guide you

119
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,832
based on what
they know about you.

120
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,169
I mean, you don't ask strangers
dining advice, right?

121
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,337
You're like, "hey, man,
where should I eat tonight?"

122
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,173
I know I've never met you before
in my life,

123
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,050
but do you think you could give
me a recommendation?

124
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,344
Uh, yeah. You should try
this dim sum place.

125
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,223
But then, that person might go,
"oh, I hate the asian world."

126
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:50,100
And you're like, "oh, shit."

127
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,518
I didn't know that about you."

128
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,437
"Yeah, I killed,
like, four of them."

129
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,982
"What are you, like,
a serial killer, or something?"

130
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,483
"Yeah."

131
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,362
Now, you're in an awkward
conversation

132
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,700
with a serial killer.

133
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,244
Here's all I'm saying.

134
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,079
I can't tell you where to go.

135
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,123
I can tell you where not to go.

136
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>Wherever they film
the first 48 on a&e.</i>

137
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,839
Oh, if you're not familiar with
the show, here's what it is.

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,261
Camera crews follow real
homicide detectives

139
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:29,764
for the first 48 hours
after a murder.

140
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,893
And the reason that that time
distinction is so important,

141
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,021
is that after 48 hours, uh,

142
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,151
they give up on that murder.

143
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,526
They're like,
"that's some old shit.

144
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,155
What do you want to do today?"

145
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,073
You're like,
"how about you keep trying

146
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,616
"to solve that murder, man?

147
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,285
"That shit happened on monday.
It's wednesday.

148
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,829
We're not gonna
solve that shit."

149
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,455
Really?

150
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,209
There are so many amazing
moments on that show... so many.

151
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,544
A lot of the episodes
take a similar path.

152
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,213
I'm blown away, first of all,

153
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,174
at how many times there's
a witness to a murder.

154
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,633
It's crazy.

155
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,260
I always thought murders
happened in dark alleys,

156
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,345
nobody saw shit.

157
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,762
No. Every other episode,

158
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,348
they're like,
"you see that shit?"

159
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,183
And the guy's like,
"I saw that shit. Yeah."

160
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,978
"Where?" "Right fucking here."

161
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,979
"Really?"

162
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,314
"I was standing here,

163
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:24,444
and then he killed
that dude there."

164
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,073
"What did he look like?"

165
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,868
"He was, like, 5'2" to 6'8",
something like that."

166
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,288
"That's the fucking description
you're gonna give us?"

167
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,416
"Uh-huh."

168
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,709
"Anything else about him?"

169
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,128
"Yeah, he had ears too."

170
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,713
"Thanks, man."

171
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,089
"No problem."

172
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,718
They still will
sketch that shit out.

173
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,844
And they show it to people.

174
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,845
"Do you know this guy?"

175
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,930
And everyone's like, "nah."

176
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,683
But then one guy'll
be like, "yeah!"

177
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,101
That's cricket right there."

178
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,396
They're like, "oh, shit."

179
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,730
You know him?"

180
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,234
"I been knowin' cricket
27 years."

181
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,693
"What's his real name?"

182
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,694
"Man, that's just cricket.

183
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,779
I don't even know."

184
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,365
Stop being white and weird.

185
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,824
That's a perfect fucking
impression,

186
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,703
and you know exactly
who that was, okay?

187
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,290
Yeah, it's a black guy and
he's wearing a wife beater,

188
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,335
and he's got on a dirty hat
and he's got a cigarette

189
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,796
hanging out of his mouth,
and he looks like he's about 33,

190
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,717
but you find out
he's 76 years old.

191
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,803
And he speaks super aggressively
to the cops.

192
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,389
Like, "I been out here
for a minute!"

193
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,514
And they're like,
"all right, all right.

194
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,642
"Jesus christ.

195
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,770
When was the last time
you saw him?"

196
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,107
"He came through
with jellyfish last week.

197
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,649
They were lookin'
for some smoke!"

198
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,527
And they're like,
"all right. Jesus christ."

199
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,572
They always cut to the whitest
detective from that guy too.

200
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,657
They cut from that guy
to a guy who's like,

201
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,036
"I don't think
he's gonna help us out.

202
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:02,375
We're gonna have to find
cricket on our own."

203
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,463
That show has the best moment
in television.

204
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,672
It's the most dramatic thing you
could ever see,

205
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,634
'cause it's real life,
and that is the interrogation.

206
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,636
The interrogation is amazing.

207
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,388
Because here's the thing
about drama...

208
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,765
if you want to have
a great, dramatic moment,

209
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,933
raise the stakes.

210
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,059
Guess what?

211
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,436
There's no higher stakes

212
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,728
than somebody being questioned

213
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,315
about taking
somebody else's life.

214
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,317
It's inherently compelling
television.

215
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,027
It is also super serious.

216
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,324
But the detectives insist on
using the suspect's street name,

217
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,617
so the whole thing turns
into a fucking cartoon.

218
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,662
Like, they're literally like,
"your life is on the line.

219
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,704
"We need to talk to you.

220
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,956
"Why don't you have a seat,

221
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,291
"uh, little stank?

222
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,918
"Why don't you sit down
for a second?

223
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,382
Did you or did you not
know dookie shoes?"

224
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,885
"I don't know no dookie shoes."

225
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,721
"I got a picture of you hanging
out with dookie shoes."

226
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,766
"I mean, I seen him.

227
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,810
I don't know him."

228
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,104
And then, they'll throw one bit
of evidence against the wall,

229
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,939
hoping it'll solve the case.

230
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,276
They'll be like, "well, we were
talkin' to nah'mean",

231
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,071
and he said that you were at
the 7-eleven last week."

232
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,781
And he'll be like, "yeah,
I shot him in the face."

233
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,493
And you're like,
"goddamn, really?"

234
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,078
That's all it took
to break you?

235
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,122
Dude, lie.

236
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,583
Lie for longer.

237
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,335
You can kill somebody,
you can't lie

238
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,670
for ten fucking minutes
about it?

239
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,464
Like, dudes will break
on anything.

240
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,549
They'll be like,
"we heard you had on

241
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,966
a blue shirt last friday."

242
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,136
"Yeah, I stabbed
those four people."

243
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,181
Dude, a lot of people
have blue shirts, man.

244
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,433
You could still
get out of this.

245
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,103
Here's what I've learned
watching that show, okay?

246
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,356
Lawyer up.

247
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,107
You can't handle that shit.

248
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,527
Everybody's like,
"I'm gonna talk to the cops

249
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,944
and straighten
this whole thing out."

250
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,238
You're gonna do 25 to life.

251
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,865
Have fun with that, man.

252
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,617
Nobody asks for a lawyer.

253
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,538
I've seen 300 people get
interrogated on this show.

254
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,331
Two of them were like,
"can I talk to a lawyer?"

255
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:10,336
And both times, the detectives
were like, "fuck!"

256
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,880
And then, at the end of those
episodes, it said on the screen,

257
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,927
"all charges against tayshaun
were dropped."

258
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,221
Or jim. Pick a fucking name.

259
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,723
Let's be honest.

260
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,975
There's no jims on the show.

261
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,563
I've seen every episode, and
none start with,

262
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:32,024
"hey, bryce, can we talk to you
for a second, man?

263
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,526
Where were you last friday?"

264
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,530
"I was over at tanner's house.

265
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,284
"Then skylar had a party,
so we went over there.

266
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:45,288
"And then, we picked up connor,
and we had pancakes.

267
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,498
"Sorry, bro.

268
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:52,962
Detective bro, bro."

269
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:58,509
I swear to god, there is no more
liberating and fun thing to do

270
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,177
in this world than scream

271
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,513
in your best aggressive
black guy voice.

272
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,308
Holy shit. So much fun.

273
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,101
I highly recommend you do it.

274
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,394
Not if you're black.

275
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,520
If you're black,
you already do it.

276
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,730
But if you're white, do it.

277
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,898
Do it in public.

278
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,858
Do it where
there are black people.

279
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,695
And here's a little secret,
if you do it well,

280
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,322
there is a possibility

281
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:23,451
that a black guy
will yell back in return.

282
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,286
I do it all the time.
I live in los angeles.

283
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,037
Pick your spot.
I go to crenshaw.

284
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,832
There's never a shortage there.

285
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,626
I do. I hang back and I go,

286
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,711
"hey, yo!"

287
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,507
And sometimes... sometimes,
a black guy'll go, "sup, d?"

288
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:41,595
[Laughter]

289
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,726
I did it to
big daddy kane one time.

290
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,686
I swear to god.

291
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,104
I swear... hand to god.

292
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,564
If you don't know
who big daddy kane is,

293
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,776
you can go fuck yourself, okay?

294
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,778
I was standing
on sunset boulevard.

295
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
- A limousine pulled up.
- Whoo!

296
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,740
Likefor sunset?
Really? All right.

297
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,034
[Laughter]

298
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,786
A limo pulled up, like,
I don't know, 30 feet from me.

299
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,330
I was just, like, all right.
See the door open.

300
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,956
Who's getting out of this limo?

301
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,501
Expecting, like, a bachelor
party or some shit.

302
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,752
Fucking big daddy kane.

303
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,296
I'm like,
get the fuck out of here.

304
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,298
And something just took over,
you know?

305
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,676
The spirit grabbed me.

306
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,512
And I was like, "'sup, kane?"

307
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,557
And his head whipped around,
and he was like, "you?"

308
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,226
And I was like,
"nuh-uh. That wasn't me.

309
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,520
"Somebody over there
did that shit.

310
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:36,399
That wasn't me."

311
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,488
If you ever see big daddy kane,
please do the same shit to him.

312
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,368
Every week,
it's another city for me.

313
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,162
I get asked the same questions
every week by people.

314
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,208
"Are people
the same everywhere?"

315
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,959
No.

316
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,715
Some places suck
and they have shittier people.

317
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,717
I just gave you
a sociology degree.

318
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:06,970
How about that? You like that?

319
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,181
Here's one universal truth
about people, though.

320
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,182
This one is true,

321
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,517
and that is that everybody

322
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,394
just wants to connect.

323
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,731
It doesn't matter where you go,
or what language you speak,

324
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,982
people just want to connect.

325
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,068
And you know when you have
chemistry with somebody.

326
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,112
You know if you're like, "I want
to hang out with this person,"

327
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,197
or "I want
to date this person,"

328
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,366
or "I want to harness this
person to the bottom"

329
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,411
"of my big rig and drive them
around for a while

330
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,414
"and bury them 18 miles west
of lake worth.

331
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,499
And when I drive by,
I'll get a boner."

332
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,045
We all have these thoughts,
right?

333
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,964
Sometimes there's nothing there,

334
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,549
and people try
to force a connection.

335
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,342
I think that shit's rude.

336
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm checking into a hotel
a few weeks ago.

337
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,846
The guy comes from
behind the counter

338
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,139
and he goes,
"where are you from?"

339
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,599
I said, "los angeles."

340
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,310
And he goes, "yeah,
I got family in denver."

341
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:59,065
And I was like,
"what a coincidence."

342
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,443
And he goes, "yeah,
they got a furniture store."

343
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,278
And I was like, "ah."

344
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,114
I like to sit on furniture.

345
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,784
We're two for two.

346
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,411
I have shoes on.
Do you have shoes on?

347
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,664
Do you like to walk around?

348
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,540
Let's fucking party.

349
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,501
There's nothing there.

350
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,878
Sometimes,
there's nothing there.

351
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,087
And that's okay.

352
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,422
You're not supposed to connect

353
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,299
with everybody on the planet.

354
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,592
That would be absurd.

355
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,635
You should embrace that.

356
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,886
I've been doing this.

357
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:29,846
You should do this too.

358
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,263
Next time you're at a bar

359
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,557
or you're just out
walking around,

360
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,351
and somebody goes, "hey, man."

361
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,604
Just go, "nope."

362
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,482
I'm all friended up."

363
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,192
And if they're like, "I just
want to know what time it is."

364
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:48,656
Be like, "I only tell my friends
what time it is."

365
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:53,536
You'll feel like a dick, but
then you get over it real quick.

366
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,955
I feel like no matter where
I go, ten times a day,

367
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,042
I find myself
asking myself this question...

368
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,169
I find myself going
like, "hey, man",

369
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,464
"is anybody else
seeing this shit right now?

370
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,926
Have I stepped into a parallel
fucking universe or something?"

371
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,221
Like, I went to buy a coffee
just a few weeks ago

372
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,097
from a coffee place.

373
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,391
Just so there's no confusion.

374
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,851
I didn't go to a shoe store.

375
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,895
I went to a coffee place, okay?

376
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,521
I go to the lady
behind the counter,

377
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,147
and I go,
"can I have a coffee?"

378
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,901
And she goes, "well,
we have a special promotion",

379
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:29,071
"and today, for $2,
you can get this drink,

380
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,324
"and it has vanilla, and... and
there's whipped cream

381
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,786
and there's sprinkles on it."

382
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,872
"And I was like," that's cool.

383
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,041
"I don't want that.

384
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,960
May I have a coffee?"

385
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:48,841
"And she goes,
it's the last day...

386
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,260
Of this special promotion."

387
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,511
And I was like,
"oh, I think I understand

388
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,514
"the full scope
of the promotion.

389
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,975
May I have a coffee?"

390
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,477
And she's like,
"you're a fucking loser."

391
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,773
Here's the thing, this woman
was enormous, okay?

392
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,777
She was hu... she looked like four
people melted into one.

393
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,986
So I was like, "you know what?"

394
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,320
"You're super fat.

395
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,030
"You know when
shit tastes good.

396
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,202
Hook that shit up.
I want to try it, all right?"

397
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,789
And she goes, "it's $2."

398
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,081
And I go, "all right."

399
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,833
And then I extended a $20,

400
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,586
and she goes...

401
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,379
And I go, "I'm sorry?"

402
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,882
And she goes, "I don't have
the change for that."

403
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:36,305
And I was like, "oh, so what
do you want to do now?"

404
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,601
Are you saying I have too much
money to shop here?"

405
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,478
And she goes,
"we just can't handle it."

406
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,062
And I was like, "handle it?"

407
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,731
It's a 20."

408
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,776
Like, I didn't put the hope
diamond on the counter,

409
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,235
and go,
"figure it out, stupid."

410
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,696
Like, it's reasonable, right?

411
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,281
And she was just all shoulders.

412
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,200
Like, mm.

413
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,453
And I go, "nothing?
You have no solution?"

414
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,955
And she goes,
"do you still want coffee?"

415
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,247
I'm like, "yeah.
That part's never changed."

416
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,751
That's why I'm here."

417
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,171
I go, "you can't
resolve this at all?"

418
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,340
And she goes, "you could ask
somebody else for change."

419
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,803
And I go,
"another customer in line?"

420
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,971
And she goes, "yeah."

421
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,681
And I go, "what about the box"

422
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,058
with buttons in front of you?"

423
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,894
And she goes...

424
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,395
So I turn around
to the line of people,

425
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,314
and I go, "excuse me",

426
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,733
"do any of you guys
have change?"

427
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,194
And everybody was like,
"you fucking asshole."

428
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,613
"Like, you're at
the place to get change.

429
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,033
You're right there."

430
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,326
Well, then this one arab
guy... and I'm not saying

431
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,661
that means anything...
but he was,

432
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:45,374
so why leave it
out of the story?

433
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,085
He goes, "I have everything."

434
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,754
And I was like, "oh."

435
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,840
And then he opened his attache

436
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,093
and he had every denomination
of every currency.

437
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,761
Like, where I could go,
"I want one of those,

438
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,014
and I want one of those,
and I want one of tho..."

439
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:05,435
he's like, "yes, yes, yes."

440
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,604
Now, enjoy your pussy drink."

441
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,233
Okay. All right.

442
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,401
And I want you to know
something.

443
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,777
I drank that pussy drink,

444
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,945
and that's the best shit
I've ever had

445
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,990
in my entire life.

446
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,076
Pussy drinks forever.

447
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm not sure that's what they're
called, so take your chances.

448
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,248
But it would be cool if you went
to a starbucks tomorrow,

449
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,709
and you're like, uh,
"can I get a pussy drink?"

450
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,460
And they're like,
"I think I know what you want.

451
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:34,298
Hold on a second."

452
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,303
Can we just all agree on one
thi... can we just

453
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,305
fucking get onboard
with the fact

454
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,685
that it is time to see
an end to the man

455
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,147
who walks around in public
with a cowboy hat on,

456
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,776
like he's not wearing
a cowboy hat in public?

457
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,569
I see these guys everywhere.

458
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,073
Banks, grocery stores, airports.

459
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,867
And now, not only do I see guys
wearing cowboy hats,

460
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,828
but they have adopted
the cowboy persona.

461
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,790
Like where they think they're
actual fucking... like the...

462
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,918
[snickers]

463
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,045
Well, pardon me, ma'am.

464
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,547
I'll tell you what.

465
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,092
I'll tell you what.

466
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,509
I'll tell you what.

467
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,054
You look fucking ridiculous
right now.

468
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,889
Like, you're a cowboy, really?

469
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,933
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

470
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,768
A-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.

471
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,771
Get the fuck out of here.

472
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,522
Here's all I want from cowboys.

473
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,775
Just be cowboy all the way,
all right?

474
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,318
Work with livestock.

475
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,154
Like, if somebody says,
"let's go get a beer."

476
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,698
I want to hear you say,
"I got to shave some sheep."

477
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,617
End your disputes
with a pistol.

478
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,243
If somebody cuts you off
in line, be like,

479
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,998
"meet me at the saloon at noon.

480
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,041
I'm a cowboy."

481
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,627
And you better ride
a horse everywhere.

482
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,879
If you wear a cowboy hat,
you shouldn't be allowed

483
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,923
to sit in cars
or look at planes.

484
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,010
You should just be like,
"I'll tell you what.

485
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,887
"I'll tell you what.

486
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,807
San francisco sure
is a pretty city."

487
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,934
Yeah, I'll see you there
in six months,

488
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:13,856
when you get there
on your fucking horse.

489
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,441
If you're a cowboy,
then I am a knight.

490
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,862
I'm a knight, and I'm gonna wear
armor every day,

491
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,364
in case somebody
wants to joust.

492
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,907
And you leave me alone,

493
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,575
because I'm doing
the queen's work.

494
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,577
Okay, mummy?

495
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,329
You know who likes to be cowboys
more than anybody?

496
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,998
Do you know who?
Three-year-olds.

497
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,251
Because they're not
developed yet.

498
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,545
And they go, "mommy."
[Imitates gun]

499
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,296
And you go, "yes,
you're a cowboy."

500
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,673
"And your sister's a princess.

501
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,218
"And your father's
fucking batman.

502
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,677
"'Cause you live in la-la land.

503
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,512
You don't know
what's going on right now."

504
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,098
Cowboy hats should
come with class rings.

505
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,017
'Cause I feel like the same guy
that buys one

506
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,561
buys the other anyway,
you know?

507
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,607
[Laughter and applause]

508
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,359
"Check it out.

509
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,987
"'87.

510
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,865
I scored 14 touchdowns
that year."

511
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,283
"What are you doing now?"

512
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,367
"I'm just thinkin' about
killing myself."

513
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,037
Oh, okay.

514
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:15,084
Why don't you get a corvette
and make it a whole kit?

515
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,169
Mm.

516
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,796
[Sighs]
I just realized my fucking...

517
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,964
I do have a hobby.

518
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,049
It's probably the saddest,

519
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,260
most pathetic hobby there is.

520
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,138
And that is just watching
television shows.

521
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,224
What is lamer than, like,
"what do you do for fun?

522
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:34,519
What's your hobby?"
"Oh, fucking, I watch tv."

523
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,563
That's so indicative
of our country.

524
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,899
And, like, some people are
amazing with their, like...

525
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,192
"oh, I b... I build furniture."

526
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,484
You're like, "that's your job?"

527
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,736
"No, no. I'm a urologist."

528
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,571
But, like,
on the side, like, I...

529
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,993
oh, I like to... I like
to watch my shows.

530
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,162
I don't like the way people
knock tv though.

531
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,331
It's all the... all
the same cliche shit

532
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,457
they said when we were kids,

533
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,875
they now say as adults, right?

534
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,168
They're like, oh, you know,

535
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,836
you... you know,
you watch too much tv,

536
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,131
it'll rot your mind,
or, you can't learn

537
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,090
anything from television.

538
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,341
But that's not true.

539
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,592
You can learn a lot
from television.

540
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,219
For instance,
without television,

541
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,804
I would have no idea

542
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,601
that steven seagal
is out of his fucking mind.

543
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,518
Or alive.

544
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
I also didn't know that.

545
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,439
He has a show.

546
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,774
It's not a scripted show.

547
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,069
It follows around
the real steven seagal.

548
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,239
And every episode begins
with him looking in the camera

549
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,283
and saying, "I don't know
if you knew this or not",

550
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,828
but for the last 20 years,
I've been a cop."

551
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:37,499
And you're like,
"what did you just say?

552
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,251
"I thought you've been making
shitty movies

553
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,210
"for the last 20 years.

554
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,920
What are you talking about?"

555
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,174
And you watch this show, he
has the most unlikeable quality

556
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,968
in a human being,
which is that he is an expert

557
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,511
in everything.

558
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,972
Literally, if a dog walks by,

559
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,975
he's like, "that's a shih tzu,
boxer, hound mix right there."

560
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,269
And they're like,
"how do you know that?"

561
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,690
He's like, "I've been working
with dogs for, like 35 years."

562
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,275
Then, a helicopter flies by.

563
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,194
He's like, "that's a hub-106."

564
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,112
And they're like,
"how do you know that?"

565
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,072
And he's like,
"I've been flying helicopters

566
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,160
for, like, 47 years."

567
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,788
Then he does the thing though,
that everybody does

568
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,790
who knows something
about everything.

569
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,335
Everybody has a friend,
no matter what you're doing,

570
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,379
they know the history of it all,
they know every topic,

571
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,546
every fucking fact.

572
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,215
If you're eating dinner,

573
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,342
they're like, "you know,
forks are from the roman times",

574
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,344
and they would sculpt them
out of bark."

575
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,928
And you're like,
"will you shut the fuck up,

576
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,056
and let me finish this please?"

577
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,516
Seagal will do that too,
but you know he's making it up.

578
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,061
He'll be like, "you know,
they also call that helicopter"

579
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,354
a skippy."

580
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,938
And they're like, "why?"

581
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,523
And he goes, "listen to it."

582
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,567
Skip-skip-skip-skip-skip-skip...
that's bullshit.

583
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,819
You made that shit up.

584
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,446
"Nah, seriously."

585
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:54,743
It just blows my mind... it really
does... that everybody

586
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:59,664
in this room... everybody... has
this real world possibility

587
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,751
in their lives... all of us,
we could go tonight,

588
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,963
if we wanted to... tonight,
you could go to louisiana,

589
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,965
you could start
a fight in a bar,

590
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:13,595
and there is
a real world possibility

591
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:18,308
that steven seagal

592
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,061
will arrest you.

593
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:24,773
Isn't that insane to you?

594
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,316
I've lost sleep over this shit.

595
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,818
I mean, that's crazy.

596
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,029
That's literally like
if you leave here,

597
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,906
and you roll through
a stop sign,

598
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,243
and then, sylvester stallone
is like, "hey, roll it down."

599
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:39,455
"And you're like,
get the fuck out of here.

600
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,581
You work here?"

601
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,751
And he's like,
"it's my passion."

602
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,129
"Will you say adrian
or something?"

603
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,048
"Nah."

604
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,091
It's nuts.

605
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,592
You have to watch this show.

606
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,928
He... he panders to every group
according to race,

607
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,846
knowing full well
there's a camera crew

608
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,889
following him around.

609
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,599
He doesn't give a shit.

610
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,725
If you're white, he's like,
"how's it going?

611
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:05,188
"All right." [Snickers]

612
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,899
And then, to black people,
he's like, "what's up, cuz?"

613
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,735
And they're like,
"hey, what's up?"

614
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,781
"I'm holding you down, so holler
if you need somethin'."

615
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,784
"Okay."

616
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,328
And then, to all latinos...

617
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,621
spanish speaking people...
he insists on speaking

618
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,123
horrifically broken spanish,

619
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,375
even if they start the
conversation in english.

620
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,376
If they're like,

621
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,419
"hey, yeah, I called 911.

622
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,753
Thank you for coming."

623
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,424
The thing is...
he's like, "ah, hold on."

624
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:37,262
<i>Mucho queso."</i>

625
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,638
They're like,
"I think my english

626
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,098
is way better
than your spanish, man."

627
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:45,103
<i>And he's like, "no gracias."</i>

628
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,356
And then, to all asian people,
he bows,

629
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,358
regardless of where
he meets them.

630
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,195
If you're asian, and you cross
steven seagal's path,

631
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,071
he's like, "ha."

632
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,948
And they go, "hey, I was born
here, you dick."

633
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,991
Like, you don't
have to do that."

634
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,617
And he's like, "sorry."

635
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:04,790
I've been doing martial arts
for, like, 85 years."

636
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:10,253
He trains other cops
in hand-to-hand combat.

637
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,255
I think that's infuriating.

638
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,590
For those cops.

639
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,258
It's not like
we're hanging out,

640
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,759
we're like, "hey, man,
do you want to do, like",

641
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
"a couple shots,
and then go down the street?

642
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,515
Steven seagal is teaching people
how to throw punches."

643
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,683
And we're like, "okay.
Let's fucking go."

644
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,852
No. It's you're a cop,
and you show up at work,

645
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,687
and they're like,
"we're gonna go over

646
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,190
"hand-to-hand combat today,
so you can protect yourself

647
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,649
if you're in a really
dangerous situation."

648
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,984
You're like, "oh, cool."

649
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,444
"Who'd you bring in
to teach us?

650
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,488
Like, some navy seals,
or green berets?"

651
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,947
And they go, "no."

652
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,201
We brought in steven seagal."

653
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,869
And you're like, "are we
shooting a fucking movie"

654
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,246
this week or something?"

655
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,872
They're like, "uh-uh."

656
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,249
"Okay, I'll pass, 'cause
that's ridiculous.

657
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,251
I don't want to be
a part of that."

658
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,211
That's literally like
if you were, like, at nasa,

659
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,795
and they're like, "all right,
future astronauts."

660
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,923
"We're gonna go over
space exploration,

661
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,343
"and to get us started, why
don't you welcome captain kirk?

662
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,887
Come on out, man."

663
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,722
And you're like,
"is he qualified to do this?"

664
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,391
And they're like, "oh, you've
seen him do all that shit."

665
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,725
"Yeah, he knows
what he's talking about, man.

666
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,478
He's been up there."

667
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,106
They show him teaching people
how to fight.

668
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,108
It's horrible.
He's bloated now.

669
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,859
He doesn't have
the same range of motion.

670
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,155
He's like, "everybody line up."

671
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,659
If somebo...
if somebody throws a punch,

672
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,247
you can...
you can block it like that.

673
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,083
[Exhales]

674
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,252
And then... and then,

675
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:36,089
you can kick 'em
in the throat like that.

676
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,384
Are you kicking a child
in the throat right now?

677
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,887
Some people's throats
are down there.

678
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,598
I like havarti cheese the most.

679
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,726
What's your favorite?

680
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,942
Um, I'm sorry that I'm fat.

681
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:59,070
I just realized how fat
I was by how winded I got

682
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:03,283
from just doing
those little motions.

683
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:06,536
[Groans]

684
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,746
Jesus. It's ridiculous.

685
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,081
Sometimes I just look
in the mirror,

686
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,418
and I'm like, "fuck."

687
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,129
I lie to myself all the time.
I cheat.

688
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,799
Like, I'll look in the mirror,
and I'm like, "hmm."

689
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,928
Yeah, that's what
you look like."

690
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,096
It's all these little things
that you don't think about

691
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,598
and you just do it automa...

692
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,266
here's where I really had
to call myself out.

693
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,893
I was getting
into a shower in a hotel,

694
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,895
and it was
one of these hotel bathrooms

695
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,439
where there's just
mirrors everywhere.

696
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,150
And as I was stepping
in the shower,

697
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,361
I looked, and I was like,
"oh, my god."

698
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:44,073
Like, "look at you."

699
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,742
"I can't believe somebody
lets you fuck them.

700
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,620
This is crazy."

701
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,666
I always like it
when I eat myself out of breath.

702
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,460
I feel like
that's a good boost to my day.

703
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,045
You know, I'm eating,
and then I go...

704
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,090
[staggered deep breath]

705
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,802
It's better a few moments later,
when you get to think about it,

706
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,971
and you're like,
"why did I just stop?"

707
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,391
To take a deep breath.

708
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,600
Oh, yeah.

709
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:14,312
My body also needs air,

710
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,399
you fat fucking turd.

711
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,153
I did the fattest thing
you can do a week ago.

712
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,405
Maybe not the fattest thing.

713
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:24,822
I think the fattest thing
you can do

714
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:29,369
is probably eat
another fat person, right?

715
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,330
Like, if you're fat
and you see another fat guy,

716
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,792
and you're like,
that guy looks delicious,

717
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,044
you're super fat.

718
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,671
I didn't do that.

719
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,548
I did, however, go out to eat.

720
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,675
I went out to breakfast.
I had croissant.

721
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,884
Everybody knows
what a croissant is, right?

722
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,845
It's a flaky-looking thing.

723
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,931
I ate one, and one is enough.

724
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,725
And then I left this place,

725
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,935
and I was walking
down the street.

726
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:57,773
And I saw a bakery,
and I was like,

727
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:02,736
"I wonder what their croissants
taste like."

728
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,863
So I entered a second venue

729
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,325
to shovel bread
into my stupid, fat mouth.

730
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,287
And the big payoff
is that when I was done,

731
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,789
I got to go, "oh, no."

732
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,916
"The first place
has better croissants.

733
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,544
Yeah."

734
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:26,594
I had catastrophic diarrhea
this morning.

735
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,638
And I just found out

736
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,515
that not everybody does.

737
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,601
Here's how I found out.

738
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:37,729
We moved... my wife and I
moved to a new place.

739
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,607
In the new place,
the living room couch

740
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,444
is closer to that bathroom
than it was in the old place.

741
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,989
So the second day we're there,
I go in there, I do my thing.

742
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,410
When I walk out, my wife is
no longer sitting on the couch.

743
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,204
She's now standing,
holding car keys.

744
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,542
And she goes, "do you need
to go to the hospital?"

745
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,046
And I go, "for what?"

746
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,759
And she goes, "for what
just happened in there."

747
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,511
And I go,
"what just happened in there?"

748
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,723
And she goes,
"is that normal for you?"

749
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,433
And I was like, "I don't even
remember what happened",

750
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,727
so I guess so."

751
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:21,063
She goes, "jesus, how often
do you shit like that?"

752
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,817
And I was like, "every day."

753
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:27,612
She goes, "oh, my god.
Is there blood in there?"

754
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,322
There could be. I don't know.

755
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:33,159
I just go, bap!
And I hit flush.

756
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,577
And she goes,
"you don't look at it?"

757
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,995
And I go, "where am I
supposed to look?"

758
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,497
"It's everywhere.

759
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,081
"You want me to look
at each individual piece?

760
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,795
No, I paint the bowl,
and then I wash it away."

761
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,259
That's how I found out,
at 34 years old,

762
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,181
that not everybody
has diarrhea every day.

763
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,647
I feel like, you know, wives
have to get in one last jab too,

764
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,400
'cause first of all,
this wasn't even an argument.

765
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,609
This was a conversation.

766
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,404
And she won
the conversation, okay?

767
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,697
She did.

768
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,824
I feel horrible
about my digestive system.

769
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,368
You win. It's settled.

770
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,452
I'm sitting on...
I'm sulking, like...

771
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,913
[Sighs] On the couch.

772
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,706
She's going to leave this day,
right?

773
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,958
And she stops at the door
as she's leaving the house,

774
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:26,796
and she goes, "you know,
you're probably gonna die."

775
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,256
And I was like, "cool, babe.
Have a good day."

776
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:32,385
I'll see you
when you get home."

777
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:33,762
Then I started thinking
about it,

778
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,972
and I'm like,
"maybe I am gonna die."

779
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,016
I went to the doctor that day,

780
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,936
and I'm... I'm gonna be
completely honest with you.

781
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:43,354
I went to the doctor,
and I was like, "all right."

782
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,441
I'm just gonna get a checkup,
see what's going on."

783
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,276
The honest truth is I knew

784
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,528
it wasn't gonna
be awesome, okay?

785
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,822
I knew the doctor
wasn't gonna be like,

786
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,992
"you might be surprised to
hear this, but you're perfect.

787
00:33:55,993 --> 00:34:00,830
Like, you're a perfect
physical specimen, man."

788
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,874
I knew
that wasn't gonna happen,

789
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,709
but I didn't expect him
to be a dick.

790
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,294
Usually, they're not.

791
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,504
I feel like in my experience,
doctors are polite.

792
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,756
Almost overly polite,

793
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,967
where it's phony
and condescending.

794
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,384
When they go,

795
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,095
"ah, really interesting story
you got there."

796
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,431
Doctors do that because
you're telling them a story,

797
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,016
and doctors don't want
to hear a story.

798
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,268
Doctors want to hear
"this hurts,"

799
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,186
not "I was over at my friend
charlie's house",

800
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,731
"and we went to move
the ottoman, and...

801
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,024
"I mean, you can use it
as a coffee table,

802
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,442
"or you can use it
as an ottoman.

803
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,068
It's up to you,"
and your doctor's like,

804
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,071
"I want to blow my fucking
brains out right now."

805
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,617
I go in there,
I sit on the exam table,

806
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,453
which is my least favorite table
to sit on in the world

807
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,998
'cause it's the only table that,
in 30 years,

808
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,334
I've sat on where my feet
don't touch the ground.

809
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:51,088
So I feel like a fucking
toddler, waiting like...

810
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,967
[giggles]

811
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:57,428
My doctor comes in.
He doesn't say hello.

812
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,931
He doesn't say good morning.
He just walks in.

813
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,184
He points at me, which is
super aggressive, you know,

814
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,102
to start a conversation
with somebody.

815
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,270
Like, "hey, man."
You're like, "hey.

816
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,939
What's up, man?"

817
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,859
And he goes, "do you want
something for your hair?"

818
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,612
And I go, "what?"

819
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:19,450
And he goes, "do you want
something for your hair?"

820
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,954
And I go, "I don't get it."

821
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,455
And he goes,
"has nobody told you

822
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,582
that your hair's falling out?"

823
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,754
I was like, "damn. No."

824
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,133
And he goes, "ah. Sorry."

825
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm like, "all right."

826
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,180
Then he pulls my chart
out of the slot, super dramatic,

827
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,348
so that it makes
a fucking noise.

828
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,432
He goes... [Exhales]

829
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,934
I'm like... and he goes,

830
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:49,022
"wow!"
And I'm like, "really, 'wow'?

831
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:49,939
Is it full-blown aids?"

832
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,484
Like, "why is 'wow'?"

833
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,152
And he goes, "you weigh 245."

834
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,197
And I go like, "yeah,
like, I knew that shit."

835
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,950
And he goes, "you weighed 230
last time you were here."

836
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,746
Not exactly what I would call
weight loss."

837
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,998
I'm like, "are we at
a fucking roast or something?"

838
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,251
Like, "what are you doing?"

839
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,795
Then he says,

840
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,505
"you know
you're the fattest patient

841
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,051
I've seen all day."

842
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:21,931
And I go,
"it's 9:30 in the morning."

843
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,726
And he goes, "still."

844
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,770
He's like, "you know,
we ran your blood work."

845
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:33,149
It turns out your muscle enzymes
are through the roof."

846
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,443
And I go, "yeah, man,
like, I'm super strong."

847
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,528
Like, how is that a problem?"

848
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,781
And he goes,
"they're off the charts."

849
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,741
I'm like, "even better."

850
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,869
I'm probably
your strongest patient, man."

851
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,830
And he goes, "I don't think
you understand muscle enzymes."

852
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:52,043
And I go, "that's true.
I don't know what they are."

853
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,545
And he goes, "well, the only way
you could have them this high"

854
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,882
"would be, like, 'a, '
if you were an olympic athlete,

855
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,094
which, clearly you're not."

856
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:05,098
I'm like,
"dude, what is the deal, man?"

857
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,474
And he goes,
"the other way would be

858
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:10,020
if you were a cocaine addict."

859
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,108
And I go, "I don't do coke."

860
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,985
And he goes, "I'm your doctor.
You don't have to lie to me."

861
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,861
And I go, "I'm not lying."

862
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,863
And he goes, "I can't treat you
if you're not gonna be honest."

863
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,365
And I go, "hey, man,
aren't cokeheads skinny?"

864
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,910
Isn't that, like,
part of the deal?"

865
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,287
And he goes, "usually, yeah."

866
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,538
The nurse comes in.

867
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,083
She takes my chart
out of his hands,

868
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,543
and she goes, "oh, my god."

869
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,672
"His muscle enzymes
are so high.

870
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,715
Maybe he runs marathons."

871
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,845
And my doctor goes,
"look at him."

872
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,262
So at this point, I go,
"this was a lot of fun.

873
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,306
"Thank you for having me today.

874
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,391
I'm gonna leave now,"
and he goes, "all right."

875
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,019
Then he goes,
"ho... hold on a second.

876
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,603
Do you have a ring
on your finger?"

877
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,232
And I go, "yeah."
And he goes, "you're married?"

878
00:37:56,233 --> 00:38:00,820
And I go, "yeah,"
and he goes, "to a guy?"

879
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,238
And I go, "no."

880
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,615
And he goes, "oh.
I thought you were gay."

881
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,828
And I go, "why?"
And he goes, "I don't know."

882
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,872
I'm like, "all right, dude."

883
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,540
And he goes,
"hey, I'm just kidding."

884
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,416
And I go, "that's fine."
He goes, "but check it out."

885
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,712
And he takes my chart,
and he shows it to me,

886
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:21,174
and he had written "gay?"

887
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,758
On my medical chart.

888
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,928
[Laughter and applause]

889
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,557
The thing that gets sent
to other doctors

890
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,767
has his inside... [Chuckles]

891
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,937
"Maybe he sucks cock" joke
written on it.

892
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,318
I went home. I told my wife.

893
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,904
She's like, "oh, my god,
what are you gonna do?"

894
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,864
And I was like,
"what do you mean?"

895
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,741
And she goes, "I mean, are you
ever gonna go back there?"

896
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,659
I'm like,
"are you out of your mind?

897
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,578
"That's the funniest
fucking doctor in the world.

898
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,830
Of course
I'm going back there."

899
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,000
I have, like, don rickles
as my primary care physician.

900
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,418
That's amazing.

901
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,170
I'm faking injuries
to go back to this guy.

902
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,546
"You know
you're a piece of shit."

903
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,925
I'm like, "I know."

904
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,928
He's fucking amazing.

905
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,512
Oh, my god.

906
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,431
I do think about death.

907
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,809
I just want it to be justified,
you know?

908
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,938
Like, if I die violently,
you know,

909
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,564
maybe I have, like,

910
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,233
serena williams
sitting on my face,

911
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:24,195
and... I don't know,
venus is polishing me off,

912
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,240
and they're trying to fit
a racket in my ass

913
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,950
or something like that.

914
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:32,079
Then my wife comes in, boom,
and I'm, like, fucking done.

915
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,164
It's fun that way.

916
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,083
I don't want it
to be a dumb death.

917
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,669
I feel like there's dumb deaths
that they kind of subtly mock,

918
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,046
like, on the news. They do.

919
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,505
They'll be like,
in local news...

920
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,507
they'll be like,
"and then, also coming up,

921
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,345
"a guy was trying to get a soda
out of a vending machine,

922
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,346
and then it fell on him."

923
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,890
And they're like...

924
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,143
and you're like...

925
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,393
'cause that could happen
to you.

926
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,645
It could be, like, you know,

927
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,688
like, I would go
to the fucking mall,

928
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,524
and then I fall down the stairs,
and then they send a news crew,

929
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,943
and they're like,
"what happened?"

930
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,611
And they interview
the dumbest fucking guy,

931
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,906
and he's like,
"I seen him fall.

932
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,117
And then
he don't move no more."

933
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,743
And you're like,
"that's my eulogy?

934
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,704
Thanks a lot, man."

935
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,333
I felt like I was gonna die
a few months ago.

936
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,585
I called a car service
to take me to the airport.

937
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,296
You know, when you're like,
"I got 60 bucks.

938
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,840
Let's fucking do this, right?"

939
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,425
This nice town car
comes to the house.

940
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,219
The guy gets out.
He's got all white hair.

941
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,470
Much older man.

942
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,972
From the beginning,

943
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,266
he makes me uncomfortable
when he calls me sir.

944
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,558
I don't know
if you've ever had a guy

945
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,311
way older than you
call you sir.

946
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,272
You're like, "hey, man.
You're, like, 1,000 years old."

947
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,690
"You have a couple weeks
to live, maybe.

948
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,609
How about we drop
the formality, okay?"

949
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,987
I get in the car, he goes, "the
temperature all right, sir?"

950
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,446
I go, "it's fine."

951
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,906
He goes, "would you like
a bottle of water, sir?"

952
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,783
And I go, "you don't
have to call me sir."

953
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,993
You can just call me tom."

954
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,452
And at that moment,

955
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,123
all of his professionalism
went out the window.

956
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:04,920
'Cause the very next thing
he said was, "you smoke weed?"

957
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,673
And I was like,
"I mean, yeah, sometimes."

958
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,467
And he goes,
"do you want to smoke some now?"

959
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,554
And I was like, "I mean, yeah."

960
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:19,394
But I don't think my driver
should be offering me, you know?

961
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,811
He doesn't miss a beat.

962
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,980
He opens the console.
He takes out a joint.

963
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,774
He lights it.
He passes it back.

964
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,320
I hit it out of respect, right?
'Cause he's old.

965
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,906
And then I give it back to him,
and the next thing he says is,

966
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,785
"yeah, I can't drive
unless I'm fucked up."

967
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,580
I'm like, "did you hear
what you just said?"

968
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,457
And he goes, "yeah,
I'm ripped right now."

969
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,334
I'm like, "well, hands on
10:00 and 2:00, motherfucker."

970
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,627
Like, "keep it together."

971
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,922
I go, "so is that all you do?
Smoke weed?"

972
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,465
I can handle a guy
that smokes weed.

973
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,925
He goes, "well, I love it all."

974
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,219
And I'm like, "what's all?"

975
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,887
That's a broad statement."

976
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,973
He goes, "I love coke.
I love heroin."

977
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,141
"But there's nothing
like smoking rocks,

978
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,935
you know what I'm saying?"

979
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,812
And I was like, "no, I don't
know what you're saying."

980
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,981
Mind you,
this is while he's driving,

981
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,276
so it's actually like,
"I love smoking rocks, man.

982
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:11,362
You know what I'm..."
I'm like, "dude, turn around."

983
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,488
So I go,
"can I ask you something?"

984
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,864
He goes, "yeah. What's up?"

985
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,366
I go, "what's it like
to smoke rocks?"

986
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,867
I've never done that before."

987
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,119
And he goes,

988
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,873
"ooh-ooh!"

989
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:27,295
[Applause]

990
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:28,670
I was like,
"is that the whole sentence?

991
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,298
Is that it?"

992
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,633
He goes,
"that shit is the best!

993
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,385
"What I like to do personally,

994
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,763
"is I like to sit
in my apartment and fire 'em up.

995
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:42,477
"And then I look
out the peephole.

996
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:45,020
"And I watch people
walk around.

997
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,690
"And I just freak the fuck out

998
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,652
about what's
gonna happen next."

999
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,362
And then, he gave me
a head nod like,

1000
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,364
"doesn't that sound awesome?"

1001
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,575
I was like,
"dude, that sounds terrible.

1002
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,369
"That's called a panic attack,

1003
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,081
"and that's a horrible
sales pitch for crack.

1004
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,708
Now, I'm definitely
not gonna try it."

1005
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,710
We pull up to the airport,
and I go,

1006
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,171
"it's none of my business,
but I think you're too old

1007
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,672
to be messing
with all these drugs."

1008
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,925
And he goes,
"I don't do it anymore, tom."

1009
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,136
Yeah, it was "sir"
at the top of the ride.

1010
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:20,306
Now,
it's "tom, you piece of shit."

1011
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,808
"I don't do it anymore.
I did it when I was younger."

1012
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,519
And I go, "all right."

1013
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,604
And he goes, "I mean, I still
do it every once in a while."

1014
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,815
"But you know what they say,
if you do something

1015
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,860
every once in a while,
it's not that bad for you."

1016
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,069
And I was like, "dude,
I think they mean that about",

1017
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,365
"like, pizza and chocolate."

1018
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:40,909
"Nobody ever means that
for crack, just so you know."

1019
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,994
I've never heard,
"what are you doing?"

1020
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,412
"I'm smoking rocks."

1021
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,749
"Well, not every day, okay?
You crazy kid."

1022
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,419
Weed's not a big deal, though.

1023
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,670
I don't know why the fuck

1024
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,671
people make a big deal
out of weed.

1025
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,549
You know? You...

1026
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,134
[cheers and applause]
You see it change.

1027
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,594
I mean,
states have it legalized.

1028
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,055
I don't know why...
the perception, I find,

1029
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,015
from other people
about california,

1030
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,518
they think that we're like
the wild fucking west.

1031
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,269
Like, people, they're like,
"aw, you live in I.A.

1032
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,687
"You guys just smoke joints

1033
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,731
and tell the cops
to suck your dick, right?"

1034
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,068
And I'm like, "yeah,
that's exactly right, yeah."

1035
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,530
"You should do that too
when you come out.

1036
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:20,533
"L.A.P.D. Is super into that.

1037
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:21,950
"But take your joint,
flick it at 'em,

1038
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,869
"be like, 'suck my dick, man.'

1039
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,583
they'll laugh
and high-five you... it's fine."

1040
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,585
It's so dif...
I mean, first of all...

1041
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:31,752
all right, let's be clear.

1042
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,128
If you get a medical card,

1043
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,339
one of the things
that people don't know,

1044
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,174
they have expiration dates
on them,

1045
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,843
and you have to renew
your card all the time.

1046
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,136
And it's not what you think.

1047
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,638
It's not exactly
the easiest thing.

1048
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,014
You literal...
you have to get in your car.

1049
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,683
You have to drive down
to a place.

1050
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,104
That's it... that's all
you gotta do, is go drive there.

1051
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,940
Takes, like, five minutes.

1052
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:56,277
But my card expired
three years ago.

1053
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:57,736
I still haven't renewed it.

1054
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,530
I tried to go to a dispensary
a few weeks ago,

1055
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,365
and there's two rooms.

1056
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,742
There's the room they check you
out in, they check your stuff,

1057
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,120
and then, there's the main room
with all the goodies, right?

1058
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,496
And the guy took my card,
and he goes,

1059
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,624
"dude, I can't let you in.

1060
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,875
Your card expired
three years ago."

1061
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,170
I was like, "come on, man."

1062
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,467
And he was like, "all right."

1063
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,638
I was like, "wow, I'm
a really good negotiator, huh?"

1064
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,933
I didn't real... well,
once you put it like that, yeah.

1065
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:34,315
Getting that medical card
is surreal.

1066
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:35,983
My experience was surreal.

1067
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:39,528
I went to a doctor's office,

1068
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:43,115
and it's not dr. Dickhead
that I was telling you about.

1069
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,575
This is a different doctor.

1070
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,827
He's a doctor
because he got a business card,

1071
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,872
and he put "dr." On it.

1072
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,043
His office
was such a piece of shit,

1073
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,046
that you could hear
the conversation going on

1074
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,966
between the doctor
and the patient ahead of you,

1075
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,760
which is never
supposed to happen.

1076
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,472
So as I'm waiting for my turn
to go in, I'm waiting,

1077
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,599
and I hear the doctor go,
"oh, what is your medical need

1078
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,184
for marijuana?"

1079
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,603
And the guy in there goes,
"oh, I have a bone disease."

1080
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:16,231
And I was like, "oh, shit.
I don't have a bone disease."

1081
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,400
Like, I thought you could just
be like, "weed's awesome."

1082
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,612
And he'd be like,
"yeah, I fucking know," like...

1083
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,282
So I start to panic internally...
like, what am I gonna say?

1084
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,992
And in my mind,
I just go to the worst shit.

1085
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,327
Like, in my mind, I'll be like,
"just say you have aids.

1086
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,786
Like, just tell him
you have aids."

1087
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,497
Then he'll be like,
"when did you find out?"

1088
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,874
I'll be like, "I just found out,
like, five minutes ago."

1089
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,209
"You don't seem
that bummed out."

1090
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,585
"Well, I'm just happy
to be here,

1091
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,671
so let's wrap
this shit up, man."

1092
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,756
For some reason, I pictured him
asking me to prove it,

1093
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,383
which they would never be like,
"prove it,"

1094
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:44,301
and you're like, "oh,
I left my aids card at home."

1095
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,136
I don't have it on me."

1096
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,846
Then I go,
"that's way too dramatic.

1097
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,348
Just dial it back."

1098
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:50,974
I'm like, "ah, I'll just say
I have cancer."

1099
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,643
That's much more believable."

1100
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,770
Then I start thinking
of all my family members

1101
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,605
that have died of cancer,
and I'm like,

1102
00:46:56,606 --> 00:47:01,276
"man, if I say I have cancer
just to get weed,

1103
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:05,864
I am getting cancer
next fucking week."

1104
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,199
By the time
I have that thought,

1105
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,409
I'm sitting in front
of the doctor.

1106
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,077
He's like... I go, "what?"

1107
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,913
He goes, "what is your medical
need for marijuana?"

1108
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:16,500
And the best I can come up with
on the spot is,

1109
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,294
"my eyes hurt."

1110
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,004
And he goes,
"do you have vision problems?"

1111
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,257
And I go, "oh, yeah."

1112
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,717
And he goes,
"you don't wear glasses?"

1113
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:28,512
And I go, "can't. Hurts."

1114
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,598
"Everything hurts. Ow, ow.

1115
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,517
Ow, ow."

1116
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,853
He writes me a prescription.
I go to leave.

1117
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,856
As I leave, I see the guy
who's going in next,

1118
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,193
and I don't know why I think
it's gonna be funny to listen.

1119
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,529
'Cause I think he's not gonna
get it, and I'll tell you why.

1120
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,531
I completely judged the guy,
'cause the guy's

1121
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,452
your typical I.A. Cholo
mexican gangbanger, okay?

1122
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,454
It's a very specific look.
You've seen movies.

1123
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,163
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

1124
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:59,334
It's khaki dickies
with an oversized white t-shirt,

1125
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,878
chuck taylors, an I.A. Hat,

1126
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:06,258
and also an I.A. Tat in, like,
this general area here.

1127
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,009
So it's like,
"aw, if I lose my hat,

1128
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,473
I still have my favorite team
right fucking here."

1129
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,559
So I listen at the door.

1130
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,644
I'm like... [Laughs]

1131
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,019
And I hear the doctor go,

1132
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,563
"what is your medical need
for marijuana?"

1133
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,189
And the guy goes,

1134
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,402
"I just really like the way
that weed makes me feel."

1135
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:29,072
And then the doctor wrote him
a prescription for that.

1136
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,491
Yeah, you don't have to lie.

1137
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,033
You can just be like,
"weed's awesome."

1138
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,328
And he's like,
"yeah, I fucking know.

1139
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:35,788
"I feel sorry
for all the people with diseases

1140
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,123
"that keep coming in here, man.

1141
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,708
"The last dude's eyes
didn't even work.

1142
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,670
"It was sad.

1143
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:46,089
<i>You're lucky you have
your health, ese."</i>

1144
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,301
<i>"Orale."</i>

1145
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,348
I'm always trying to set goals.

1146
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:59,353
My latest goal... I'm trying
to be less polite, you know?

1147
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,229
'Cause the world
is not as polite

1148
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,232
as you're raised to believe
it's gonna be, you know?

1149
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:08,654
I don't understand why we accept
that when you say "thank you,"

1150
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,531
people don't have
to say "you're welcome" anymore.

1151
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,282
People have stopped.

1152
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,536
Now, you say "thank you," and
people give you a nod, like...

1153
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,412
I want to stab you
in the fucking ears

1154
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,498
if you do that shit to me.
I do.

1155
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,291
I'll go, "thank you,"
and they go...

1156
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,417
I go, "did you not...
did you not just hear"

1157
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,002
what I just said to you, man?"

1158
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,755
And you get, like,
a follow-up nod.

1159
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,006
So now, I skip it all.

1160
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,552
I just take shit, and I go...

1161
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,889
I find rudeness everywhere.

1162
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,557
I think the rudest person
in the world

1163
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:39,267
is a person that waits
outside of a grocery store

1164
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,478
with a petition for you
to sign.

1165
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,189
What a fucking asshole you are.

1166
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,400
They do that, and do you know
why that's a shitty thing to do?

1167
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:49,277
They're systematically trying
to ruin your happiness.

1168
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,987
'Cause you're leaving
the grocery store,

1169
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,656
and you're feeling what?
You're feeling happy.

1170
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,157
You're like,
"oh, I got soy milk.

1171
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,786
It's gonna be a good week.
All right."

1172
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,038
And then they stop me ab...
"sir, could you look at this?"

1173
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,623
I'm like, "look at what?"

1174
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,333
And they're like,
"do you want children to starve

1175
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,710
and die on the streets?"

1176
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,797
And I'm like...

1177
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:13,051
"Now I do... now that you just
ruined my day, I do, yeah.

1178
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,638
I want you to die first, but
then I want all of them to die."

1179
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,139
I say the opposite
of whatever they're trying

1180
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,892
to fucking get me to sign.

1181
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:23,270
Like, "this is to teach blind
people how to do shakespeare."

1182
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:26,565
I'm like, "I hope
they all go deaf first."

1183
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,024
And they're like, "jesus."

1184
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,568
I'm like,
"yeah, that's fucking right.

1185
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:32,696
You're the asshole, not me."

1186
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,198
"This is to end the war
in afghanistan."

1187
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,701
I go, "I fucking love
the war in afghanistan."

1188
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,203
"It's my favorite war.

1189
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,873
I hope it goes on
for 1,000 years."

1190
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,291
And they're like,
"you're crazy."

1191
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,084
I'm like, "that's right.
I'm crazy."

1192
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,338
Remember my face and never
ask me to sign shit again."

1193
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,342
I can't get over rude people.

1194
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,637
I was in a hotel
a few weeks ago.

1195
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,306
I go down to the hotel gym.
I get on the treadmill.

1196
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:02,517
I run, I don't know,
70 miles, right?

1197
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,020
[Laughter]
170 miles, thank you.

1198
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,438
170 miles.

1199
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,273
But I'm alone.
There's nobody in there.

1200
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,025
I'm sweating.
I'm hyperventilating.

1201
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,902
[Groans]

1202
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,904
Then, out of nowhere,
I just hear, "getting it in?"

1203
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:17,282
And I go, "jesus christ! What?"

1204
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,784
This guy goes,
"you getting it in?"

1205
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:21,119
I go, "getting what in?"

1206
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,537
He says,
"you getting a workout in?"

1207
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:25,707
I go, "doesn't it
fucking look like it?"

1208
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,250
He goes, "yeah, you just
gotta keep doing it."

1209
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,837
And I go, "okay."

1210
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,922
He goes, "nah,
I used to be like you."

1211
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,215
And I go, "what?"

1212
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,550
He goes,
"I used to be like you.

1213
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,093
"You just gotta keep
eating right

1214
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,512
and keep doing it,
and you'll get there."

1215
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:41,139
And I was like,
"dude, I'm disabled."

1216
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,267
[Laughter]

1217
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,730
And he was like, "I'm sorry.
I didn't know that."

1218
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,440
Let me...
let me point something out.

1219
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,194
It's okay for me to make jokes
about disabled people

1220
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,279
and people
with horrible diseases

1221
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,615
because they make me
uncomfortable,

1222
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,242
and I don't want
to be like them.

1223
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,497
[Laughter]

1224
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,043
Maybe that makes me
a bad person,

1225
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,878
but I'm an honest person,

1226
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,172
and I'm telling you,
that shit is terrifying.

1227
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,465
I don't want to be like them.

1228
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,758
Here's another bit
of information.

1229
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,427
I also don't want
to look at them.

1230
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,137
I don't.

1231
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,099
<i>I refuse to watch
the michael j. Fox show</i>

1232
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,185
because I don't want
to see shaky face

1233
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,646
not stand still for one frame.

1234
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,607
[Laughter and applause]

1235
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:36,236
The guy can't eat soup.
It's depressing, okay?

1236
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,238
Try to pawn this thing off
as a comedy?

1237
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,781
Get the fuck out of here.

1238
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,951
You're bumming everybody out.

1239
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:45,079
How many parkinson's jokes
am I supposed to applaud

1240
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,538
with this thing?

1241
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,498
I won't watch the show.
I've seen a commercial.

1242
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,625
I will not watch that show.

1243
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,002
You know why? A version of it

1244
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,171
plays in my head,
and it is fucking awful.

1245
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,590
And I think
it's probably accurate.

1246
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,258
I really do.

1247
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,635
I bet you that show is nothing
but setups for that shit.

1248
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,931
I bet it's just like, here...
in the next episode he goes,

1249
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:06,558
"dad, can you help me
hammer in this nail?"

1250
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,312
And he goes, "you know
they don't trust me with those."

1251
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,773
And then you get to go,
at home,

1252
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,443
"I get it.
He's got fucking parkinson's."

1253
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,988
You don't think
that's been fucking pitched

1254
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,199
in the writers' room?

1255
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,161
"It's pasta night.
Dad, can I get some parmesan?"

1256
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,371
"That's one thing
I can do forever."

1257
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:32,042
[Laughter]

1258
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:35,630
"I'm good. I said I'm good."

1259
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,053
You don't think the episode idea
has been talked about,

1260
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,013
where he goes to work,
and his coworker gets to say,

1261
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,932
"you know, I got to get
my wife a vibrator."

1262
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:51,478
"That's one thing
my wife doesn't need."

1263
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,687
And then you get to go,
"I get it.

1264
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,024
He's got fucking parkinson's."

1265
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:59,153
I don't want to see that shit.

1266
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,737
I'm sitting at home.

1267
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,030
I'm trying to have
fucking dinner.

1268
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm sitting on my couch.

1269
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,365
We have a table,
but I'm an adult,

1270
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,993
and I can sit wherever I want.

1271
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:08,787
So I'm sitting on the couch,
about to have dinner,

1272
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:10,914
and this fucking... a girl...

1273
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,834
two girls... one girl... a girl...

1274
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:16,878
two... one... a girl... two girls...

1275
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:21,466
one girl who has two heads
on one body comes on.

1276
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,550
Their heads face each other.

1277
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:26,513
Their heads are like, "Mmm."

1278
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,056
They look like
they're gonna grunt.

1279
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,766
They look like they're gonna go,
"Mmm... Aah!"

1280
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:33,020
Like that, but they don't.

1281
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,646
This comes on tv.

1282
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,857
There's no warning
on the screen,

1283
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:41,111
like, "hey, in a second,
you might shit yourself."

1284
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:45,365
Put down whatever
you're holding, seriously."

1285
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:48,076
I'm sitting there,
about to eat chicken paprikash,

1286
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,078
and it's hot, and I go...
[Blows]

1287
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,496
And then I look up, and I go...

1288
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,540
[screams]

1289
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,876
Ten seconds later,
I'm wiping the back of my legs.

1290
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:59,629
Now... I'll be honest,

1291
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,464
when she first appeared
on-screen,

1292
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:05,719
I was like, "hey, lady, you've
got something on your shoulder."

1293
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,388
"No, you, you've got something
on your shoulder."

1294
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,307
But then, I realized,
"tommy, why are you so upset?

1295
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,520
"You love monsters." Now...

1296
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,190
[sighs]

1297
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:20,234
Here's what's upsetting
about this show.

1298
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:22,903
If you're gonna air
a fucking freak show,

1299
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,530
which is what that is,
do you mind?

1300
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,075
Could you please include
the freaky shit?

1301
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,409
That's why we're watching.

1302
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,911
You watch this show,

1303
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:32,913
the two girls with
the fucking one body, two heads.

1304
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,207
[Mumbles] They're like, "what?"

1305
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,791
"Yeah.
Here's what she likes to do.

1306
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,377
"She likes to get, fucking,
her nails done.

1307
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,046
What's the problem?"
You're like,

1308
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:44,174
"she has two fucking heads
that face each other.

1309
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:48,344
Why are you cutting out scenes
that I know exist?"

1310
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,305
There's got to be days
where one of them is like,

1311
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:51,806
"I feel like
going out tonight."

1312
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,934
"Well, I feel like
staying home."

1313
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:58,646
"Well, I control the legs.
We're fucking going."

1314
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,275
Where's that?

1315
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,945
What about people that one of
'em loves and one of 'em hates?

1316
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,114
That has to happen.
They have separate minds.

1317
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,406
"We're going to tony's house."

1318
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,909
"I fucking hate tony."

1319
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,286
"Well, I'm gonna blow him,

1320
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,745
"so you better get ready
for ball duty.

1321
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,371
Meh."

1322
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,251
[Laughter]

1323
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:21,169
I can feel your judgment.

1324
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,256
I reject
your judgment completely.

1325
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:27,092
First of all,
everybody loves blow jobs.

1326
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:29,594
Secondly, I'm not
making this shit up.

1327
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,973
If your siamese twin sister
is doling out bjs,

1328
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:34,933
you're along for the ride.

1329
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,602
You don't have to participate,
but you're at least there,

1330
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,980
I don't know,
giving notes, I guess.

1331
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,273
"Mm, mm, mm."

1332
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:44,443
"You have horrible technique.
Meh."

1333
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:49,073
"I can see your teeth. Meh."

1334
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:55,621
"Why is it so dry? Meh."

1335
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,415
All right, we'll move it along.

1336
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,001
I get it.

1337
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:05,463
Not everybody's on board
with double-headed bjs.

1338
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,257
Will you at least admit to me,

1339
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:09,384
and more importantly
to yourself,

1340
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,094
that you would love to see

1341
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:16,266
the girl with two heads
take a shit?

1342
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,352
Just to see
if the faces match up, right?

1343
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:21,562
Just to see
if one of them's like... [Grunts]

1344
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,981
And the other one's like,
"hey, take it easy.

1345
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,192
It's my ass too, you know."

1346
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:27,236
Oh, come on.

1347
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,493
I really wish
that each and every one of you

1348
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,621
could see
my internet search history.

1349
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:42,250
Because I think you would all
say the same thing.

1350
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,668
I think you would all be like,

1351
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:49,090
"this is one sick, twisted,
deviant pervert,

1352
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:53,094
who also loves current events."

1353
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:57,265
My history is literally
a back-and-forth volley

1354
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,351
of, like, "big, sloppy tits"

1355
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:02,645
smacked back and forth
by 13 cocks."

1356
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,233
"What's going on in syria?"

1357
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,695
I feel badly about watching
so much of it too.

1358
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,655
You know why? 'Cause it's lazy.

1359
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,866
I know watching
that much porn is lazy.

1360
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,411
It gets in the way
of other things I want to do,

1361
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:19,871
like learn another language.

1362
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,497
I'd love to learn
another language,

1363
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:26,420
but there's
too much porn to watch.

1364
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:29,423
Why not combine the two, right?

1365
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:31,091
Have you seen
these language videos?

1366
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:32,926
They are boring.

1367
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:36,221
"The man is sitting down."
You're like, "all right."

1368
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,556
Have you seen an anal gangbang?

1369
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,435
Super exciting.

1370
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:43,019
Here's what I propose.

1371
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,354
You download the series,

1372
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,732
and then tutorial number one
begins to play.

1373
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,609
All right? Here's what happens.

1374
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,403
An elevator door opens.

1375
00:58:51,404 --> 00:58:54,906
A woman is giving a guy
a blow job, all right?

1376
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,700
Like, an aggressive blow job.

1377
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,870
Not one of these, like...
[Hums] No.

1378
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,457
I mean, like... [Gagging]

1379
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,584
Where you're like,
"jesus christ!

1380
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,961
"Is the answer in there?

1381
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,838
Is that why she's doing that?"

1382
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,508
And she has tears
running down her face

1383
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,177
and slobber all over herself.

1384
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:19,389
And she goes... "[Gagging]".

1385
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,433
"Which way is the subway?

1386
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:23,726
[Speaks spanish] [Gags]".

1387
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:28,107
You're like,
"now it's sinking in."

1388
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:31,859
Some of you
didn't like that one.

1389
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,362
I can tell by your faces.

1390
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,906
Maybe that's because
you're more advanced

1391
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,119
and you're ready
for tutorial number two.

1392
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,120
In this one,

1393
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,872
a man is chained to a wall.

1394
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,334
His arms and his legs
are chained,

1395
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,544
and he's completely naked,
and you're like,

1396
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:53,214
"whoa. What's going on here?"

1397
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,550
And then, a few seconds later,

1398
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,344
a woman enters frame,

1399
00:59:57,345 --> 01:00:02,765
and she's wearing, I don't know,
a 15-inch strap-on.

1400
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,977
She doesn't say hello
or tap him on the shoulder.

1401
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,271
No warning, just bow!

1402
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,440
You're like, "holy shit!"

1403
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,567
And she just goes
to hammer town.

1404
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,361
She's like, "bow! Bow! Bow!"

1405
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:17,572
And you're like,
"what the fuck?"

1406
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:21,493
And then, after, like,
the tenth stroke, she goes,

1407
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,578
"this salad is too spicy.

1408
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,914
[Speaking spanish]".

1409
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:31,336
And you're like,
"I'm learning spanish.

1410
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:36,133
Can somebody pass me
a kleenex?"

1411
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,138
[Sighs]

1412
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,225
Mm.

1413
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,187
I'm married.

1414
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,857
You like that segue?

1415
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,817
I like being married. I do.

1416
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,195
You see a lot of comics, you go
to shows, and they'll be like,

1417
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:58,946
"I love getting
out of the house,

1418
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,698
just so I can get away
from that bitch."

1419
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,325
And you're like,
"wow, sounds like you married

1420
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,036
a real fucking asshole, man.
That's awesome."

1421
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,538
I like it.

1422
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:07,788
You know what the best part
of being married is?

1423
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,833
You get to stop pretending.

1424
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,586
And that's what
fucking dating is.

1425
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,879
It's an act.
You're on broadway.

1426
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,632
For however long you're dating,
you're doing an act,

1427
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,427
and it looks exhausting.

1428
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,762
That's why if you're dating and
you've ever been out in public,

1429
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,764
and you see married people
look at you like this,

1430
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,058
and you're like, "what the fuck
are they looking at?"

1431
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,770
They're tired for you.

1432
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,688
It is... it's an act,

1433
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,482
and it's exhaust...
you see it all...

1434
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,816
dating is a guy going,

1435
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,445
"uh, just so you know,
I'm this guy."

1436
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:42,198
And the girl's like, "well, just
so you know, I am this girl."

1437
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,658
And then you get married,
and you're like,

1438
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:47,203
"uh, so can we knock
this shit off?"

1439
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,413
And she goes, "I hope so",

1440
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:53,334
"because I gotta fart
pretty bad.

1441
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,712
I've actually had to fart
for, like, four years."

1442
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:01,509
"All right. Let that fart out."

1443
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,596
Sexually liberating
to get married.

1444
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:06,222
It is, really is.

1445
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,807
Especially for men,
'cause here's what happens.

1446
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,601
When you start dating somebody,
you know,

1447
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:11,519
your first thing is like,
all right, you see the girl,

1448
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,354
and you're like,
"I want to get in there."

1449
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,399
That would be... or however you
phrase it in your head, right?

1450
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,652
[Laughter]

1451
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,404
Right, and then,
you go out on a few dates,

1452
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,032
and as you get closer to the
act... the magical act happening,

1453
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,618
a lot of times a woman
will ask a guy.

1454
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,744
She'll be like, "oh, so, like,
what are you into?"

1455
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,037
What do you like?"

1456
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,624
And this is
when a man's brain goes,

1457
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:37,086
"don't scare her.

1458
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,714
You could fuck this up for us."

1459
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:42,425
So we lie to you, and we're
like, "oh, I like to hold hands."

1460
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,637
"Uh, I like if you go...
[Blows]

1461
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:48,473
On my neck. That's cool."

1462
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:50,684
Then you get married,
and you're like,

1463
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:53,603
"I want you to yank
on my ball bag

1464
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,771
"like you're stuck at sea

1465
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,192
and this is the only motor
that's gonna take you home."

1466
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:02,112
[Laughter and applause]

1467
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:07,742
A lot of girlfriends
can't handle that shit.

1468
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,577
Girlfriends will be like,
"ugh, what?"

1469
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:10,870
But a wife?

1470
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:14,499
A wife will go, "that it?"

1471
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,501
And you're like, "oh, yeah,
I get you for, like, 50 years."

1472
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,169
She's like, "yeah,
I'll spit butter in your ass."

1473
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,506
Whatever you want, man."

1474
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:25,801
Or whatever.
Margarine, I don't know.

1475
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,557
Whatever you're into, so...
olive oil.

1476
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:33,393
You find, the longer
you're with somebody,

1477
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:35,562
you're like,
everybody has something.

1478
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:39,733
Everybody has something weird
and kinky and different.

1479
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:41,984
Everyb... and you suppress it,
and you go, like, "oh, my god."

1480
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,071
"If anybody knew... oh, my god.

1481
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,781
I would fucking die
if somebody knew."

1482
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:47,990
Everybody has something.

1483
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,367
And you're like,
"no, not everybody.

1484
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,578
What about jim?
He wears a blazer."

1485
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:54,330
Jim too.

1486
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,792
Jim likes to be hit in the nuts
with a wrench, okay?

1487
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,921
Jim's out of his fucking mind.

1488
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,299
I tour the country.

1489
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,051
I ask people all the ti...
I hear shit.

1490
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,969
You cannot make this sh...
I was at a show.

1491
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,680
I asked people in the aud...
like,

1492
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,931
"what's your fucking
craziest thing?"

1493
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,349
And a lady in the front row,

1494
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,892
she goes, "I have one."
And I go, "what is it?"

1495
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,061
And she goes, "oh, never mind."

1496
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,854
[Laughter]

1497
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,898
I go, "what is it?"
And she goes, "all right.

1498
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,359
"I like to think
of different scenarios

1499
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,236
in which to kill my husband."

1500
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:27,363
And I was like, "damn."

1501
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,864
And he was sitting right there,
and he was like,

1502
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,577
"that's what's up.
That's what she likes."

1503
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:35,622
I was like, "really?"
And she was like, "oh, yeah."

1504
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:36,956
I go,
"you go, 'I'm super horny.

1505
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,249
"'I had the best dream

1506
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,793
"'that you were floating
in the pool,

1507
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:42,462
and then I threw a cement block
at your head.'"

1508
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:46,006
and she goes,
"that would be a great one."

1509
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,760
Same show, I swear to you,
a lady goes, "I have one."

1510
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:50,303
And I go, "what is it?"

1511
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:53,723
And she goes, "I like to sit
on my husband's face."

1512
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,516
And I go,
"that's not that unique.

1513
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,852
You can't really claim that
that's your weird thing."

1514
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,605
And she goes, "yeah, but I only
like to feel his eyelashes"

1515
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:01,939
against my butt cheeks."

1516
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,941
And I was like, "what?"

1517
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,443
[Laughter]

1518
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:09,823
And she goes, "mm-hmm."

1519
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:10,948
And I was like, "I didn't even
know that was a thing."

1520
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,199
And she was like, "oh, yeah."

1521
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,411
Like, "where the fuck
have you been?"

1522
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,580
And I'm like, "what if he, like,
you know, sneaks a lick",

1523
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:18,706
like, ah-ah, like that?"

1524
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:21,709
And she goes, "I go, 'no!'"

1525
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,797
I just want to feel
squink-squink-squink."

1526
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:33,680
So stop feeling weird and sit
on people's faces, all right?

1527
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:37,975
That's what I want you
to leave here with.

1528
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:42,897
Guys, we've covered
a lot of stuff tonight.

1529
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,065
We really have.

1530
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,610
Some of you might, you know,
not think highly of me.

1531
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,862
I don't know,
some of you might be like,

1532
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:50,363
"this guy's fucking stupid."

1533
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,031
Some of you might think
I'm offensive.

1534
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,574
Some of you might think
I'm unenlightened.

1535
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,785
I don't know.
But I will tell you this.

1536
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:59,330
I believe in humanity. I do.

1537
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,666
I believe
we're all here together,

1538
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:04,251
and I believe there's
no such thing as coincidence.

1539
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:07,672
And I think
I can tell you the story

1540
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:10,174
that will also make you
believe this, all right?

1541
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:13,344
A few years ago,
I was in washington d.C.,

1542
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:16,556
and I was sharing a cab
with a woman I didn't know.

1543
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,141
Never met her before in my life.
We're splitting the cab.

1544
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,645
Midway through the ride,
as I'm looking out my window,

1545
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,771
I hear the woman go,

1546
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,815
"hey."

1547
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:27,274
And I thought
she was gonna be like,

1548
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,861
"hey, like, you want to fuck
or something?"

1549
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:31,362
And I was gonna be like,
"I can't.

1550
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:34,032
I'm married.
So make it quick, all right?"

1551
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:38,411
I look over, I'm like,
"what is it?"

1552
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:40,538
And she goes, "is this yours?"

1553
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:41,997
And she's holding a wallet.

1554
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,833
And I go, "no, it's not mine."

1555
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,126
And she goes, "oh, it must be
the previous rider's wallet."

1556
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,545
I'll just give it
to the driver."

1557
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:50,506
And I go, "don't do that.
Look at him."

1558
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,134
"He looks like a cab driver.

1559
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,053
"He probably smokes crack
every once in a while.

1560
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,765
You can't trust these guys."

1561
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:00,349
I go, "give it to me."

1562
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,809
I'll get it back
to the rightful owner."

1563
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,144
And she goes, "really?"
I go, "yeah."

1564
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,438
She gives me the wallet.

1565
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:08,232
Now, I feel obligated
to find the owner.

1566
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:11,026
But here's the honest-to-god
truth, I really want to.

1567
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,362
I've always dreamed
about finding a wallet.

1568
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,572
I don't know why.

1569
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:16,365
I dreamed
I would find a wallet,

1570
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,534
I would open it,
it would have $1,000 in it,

1571
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,327
I would get it back
to the rightful owner,

1572
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,079
it would turn out to be,
like, will smith,

1573
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,748
and then he'd be like,
"do you want a helicopter?"

1574
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,458
And I'd be like, "yeah."

1575
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,334
And then I'd be like,
"I got a family in denver.

1576
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:30,380
Do you like furniture?"

1577
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,800
So I open this wallet.

1578
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:37,887
It has $2,
a grocery store rewards card,

1579
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,180
and a community college I.D.

1580
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:44,852
So I have found
not will smith's wallet.

1581
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:46,813
But I still try
to do the right thing.

1582
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:49,607
I call the grocery store,
I explain the situation,

1583
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,108
and I go,
"can you help me out?"

1584
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:55,362
And they go,
"no, we're a grocery store.

1585
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,531
"We don't track people down.

1586
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:01,243
Eggs are on sale.
Go fuck yourself."

1587
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,495
And I was like, "cool."

1588
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,455
Thank you.
Thank you for your help."

1589
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,415
Then, I call
the community college,

1590
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,793
and I speak
to literally every department

1591
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:11,128
in the community college
for 41/2 hours,

1592
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,422
before I finally get
a contact number.

1593
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,592
I call the number,
and a man answers the phone

1594
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:20,387
who I can only imagine
has never used a phone before,

1595
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:24,433
'cause he actually answers
the phone with a noise.

1596
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,019
So just to break
this shit down,

1597
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,895
I don't know if you've ever
used a phone before,

1598
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:29,647
but usually,
when you call someone,

1599
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,024
[mimics phone ringing]
And they pick it up,

1600
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:33,026
they say, "hello."

1601
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:34,694
That's fucking it.

1602
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:36,111
That's what people say
when they answer the phone.

1603
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,322
Maybe if they're
in a bad mood, "what?"

1604
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,074
Those are the two options.

1605
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:42,409
This man answers the phone...
[Mimics phone ringing]

1606
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,619
Picks it up, and he goes,

1607
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,789
"ah."

1608
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:51,544
And I go, "hello?"
And he goes, "wah."

1609
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:54,922
And I go, "I'm gonna talk,
and then you talk."

1610
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,842
And he goes, "yeah."

1611
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,969
Like, it was the first time
someone explained to him

1612
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,763
how fucking phone calls work.

1613
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,058
Up until that point, he was
just like, "that made a noise."

1614
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:06,475
"I'm gonna make a noise too.

1615
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,603
Ah."

1616
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,522
So I go,
"hey, I found this wallet."

1617
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:14,025
"I was given your number. I'm
trying to return the wallet."

1618
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:17,236
And he says,
"it's probably my son's wallet.

1619
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,113
"He's always losing shit

1620
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:23,200
because he's a piece of shit."

1621
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,244
That's the first thing... I don't
even know how to respond.

1622
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:26,746
I'm like, "ah."

1623
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:29,749
I go, "well, can I give him
his shit back?"

1624
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,542
He goes, "he's a real asshole."

1625
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:35,004
And I go, "we're talking
about your son right now?"

1626
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:36,338
And he goes,
"yeah, I don't think

1627
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,464
he's gonna amount to anything."

1628
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,258
I go, "jesus christ."

1629
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,802
I go, "maybe he will amount
to something"

1630
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,932
if he gets his wallet back."

1631
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:47,391
And he goes, "yeah, yeah."

1632
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,476
I'll let him know you called."

1633
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,854
And then he hangs up the phone

1634
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,607
without taking my information.

1635
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:57,068
So his plan is to go to his son
and be like,

1636
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:59,112
"some guy found your wallet.

1637
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:00,446
Yeah, I don't fucking know,"

1638
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,198
and just, like, walk away.

1639
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,575
So I'm super frustrated.

1640
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,243
I tried to do the right thing,
right?

1641
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,787
I forget about the wallet.

1642
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,623
A year goes by.
A year, a calendar year.

1643
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,499
I go back to d.C.

1644
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,087
I go in town, I call a friend,
we go to a restaurant,

1645
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:17,755
just a random restaurant.

1646
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,341
We sit down, and the waiter
comes up to take our order,

1647
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,303
and I go, "justin?"

1648
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:25,930
And he goes,
"how do you know my name?"

1649
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:29,767
And I go,
"dude, I have your wallet."

1650
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:31,602
And he goes,
"oh, do you have it on you?"

1651
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:34,521
I go, "no, I don't fucking
walk around with your wallet."

1652
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:38,275
"I don't go, 'I got my wallet,
and I got justin's wallet.

1653
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,946
Now, I'm ready to go out.'
No, you fucking psycho."

1654
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,324
And he goes, "do you want
to hear about today's specials?"

1655
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:46,993
And I go,
"do you want to acknowledge

1656
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:50,746
that this is an amazing moment
in both of our lives?"

1657
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,123
And he goes,
"what do you mean?"

1658
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:53,624
"What do I mean?

1659
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:58,087
"I found your wallet in a cab
in d.C. A year ago.

1660
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:01,090
"I don't know how many cabs are
here, but I think it's a lot.

1661
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:04,551
"I got told no 100 times by
100 people trying to find you.

1662
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,847
<i>"My hotel room used to look like
an episode of ncis.</i>

1663
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:12,518
"There was pins and charts
connecting shit to each other.

1664
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:14,394
"I spoke to your father,
who's not a fan.

1665
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,480
"I don't know
if you knew that or not.

1666
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:19,233
"I come to a restaurant
at random,

1667
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:21,235
"I get seated in your section,

1668
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,196
"and I recognize you
from your I.D.

1669
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:25,280
"That's burned into my memory.

1670
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,075
You don't think
that's fucking amazing?"

1671
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,827
And he goes,
"we have a prime rib special.

1672
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:31,871
We also have a penne pasta."

1673
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:33,873
I can't eat.
I'm like, "what the fuck?"

1674
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:35,374
He comes by, I go,

1675
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,126
"look, I don't want
to make a big thing here,

1676
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,545
"but I do remember that I have
your wallet in my bag...

1677
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:41,130
"my bag in my hotel room.

1678
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,589
If you want to come by,
I will give you your wallet."

1679
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,133
And he goes, "okay."

1680
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:47,053
I go back to the hotel.
I hear a knock at the door.

1681
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,972
And now, I'm expecting him
to lose his shit.

1682
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:53,226
I think the situation
merits freaking the fuck out.

1683
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:55,061
I think he was playing it cool,
and now he's gonna be like,

1684
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:56,812
"I didn't want
to say this earlier.

1685
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:01,400
We should open a surf shop
in maui together, you know?"

1686
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,776
Or, like,
"this is my newborn son.

1687
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:06,697
I want you to have him,"
like that shit.

1688
01:12:06,698 --> 01:12:08,323
So I hear a knock at the door.

1689
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,658
I open the door,
I'm like, "hey."

1690
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,077
And he goes,
"hey, you got my wallet?"

1691
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:13,037
And I go, "yeah,"
and I give it to him,

1692
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,580
and he goes, "cool."

1693
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,041
And he turns around,
and he walks away.

1694
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,086
No.

1695
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:21,795
It is not cool.

1696
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,214
So I open the door,

1697
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:24,757
and I see him
about to get on the elevator.

1698
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,759
I go, "hey, justin!"
And he goes, "yeah."

1699
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,595
And I go, "your dad's right...
you're a fucking asshole",

1700
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:31,222
and you're never gonna
amount to anything,"

1701
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:33,599
and I shut the fucking door.

1702
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,976
[Applause]

1703
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,229
You fucked up, justin.
You could've been here, man.

1704
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,396
Thank you, guys.
You were amazing.

1705
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,523
Have a great night. Thank you.

1706
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,776
Thanks a lot.

1707
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,946
[Cheers and applause]
