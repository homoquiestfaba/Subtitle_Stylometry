1
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,409
Can you tell us your name?

2
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,551
Do you understand me?

3
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,490
Yes.

4
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,696
I understand.

5
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,007
Where am I?

6
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,150
You are safe now.

7
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,592
Do you remember what happened
to you?

8
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,631
Is this a hospital?

9
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,639
It is like a hospital.

10
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,842
I don't understand.

11
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,598
<i> Hey. It's me, Kate.</i>

12
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,668
<i> Got the new camera</i>
<i> and it's ready to go to Japan.</i>

13
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,006
<i> So, my boyfriend is flying in</i>
<i> from San Francisco.</i>

14
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,478
<i> I wish he was on my flight,</i>
<i> but that's okay.</i>

15
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,013
<i> I need to sleep on the plane</i>
<i> anyway.</i>

16
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,550
<i> And I don't know how Chris</i>
<i>is going to react to traveling.</i>

17
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,756
<i> So, Chris is</i>
<i> one of my closest childhood</i>
<i> friends.</i>

18
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,892
<i> We went to kindergarten</i>
<i> together.</i>

19
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,495
<i> And what's cool is</i>
<i> he speaks some Japanese,</i>

20
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,998
<i> and he really needs this trip.</i>

21
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,134
<i> He needs some good luck.</i>

22
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,237
<i> Good mojo.</i>

23
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,177
<i> He actually</i>
<i> had a breakdown earlier this</i>
<i> year.</i>

24
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,948
<i> His brother died in a horrific</i>
<i> accident.</i>

25
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,854
<i> You know,</i>
<i> we've been talking a lot and</i>
<i> I...</i>

26
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,624
<i> I think he's doing okay.</i>

27
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,596
<i> So I'm doing my thesis</i>
<i> on religious studies,</i>

28
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,267
<i> specifically how religion</i>
<i> changes myth and vice versa,</i>

29
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,969
<i> and I want to photograph</i>
<i> obscure shinto shrines</i>

30
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,672
<i> and Buddhist temples in rural</i>
<i> Japan.</i>

31
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,112
Do you know this woman?

32
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,716
Where did you get this?

33
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,885
He asked where you got this
material.

34
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,065
Yeah, is it nice?

35
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,835
All right, I don't know. Hold
on.

36
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,305
Excuse me, how long 'til we get
there?

37
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,177
Ten minutes.

38
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,180
You hear that?

39
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,184
Okay, see ya soon.

40
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,720
I love you too.

41
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,822
Bye.

42
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,127
I can't believe you still
haven't met.

43
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,166
Has it really been that long
since I saw you?

44
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,735
Yeah. Goes by in a blink.

45
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,973
Well, I'm really glad you came.

46
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,976
Me too.

47
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,009
Nice to finally meet you.

48
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,077
I was beginning to think you
didn't exist.

49
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,949
- You good?
- - Yeah.

50
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,217
All right.

51
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,950
He's, uh...

52
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,120
He's not at all like I imagined.

53
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,356
What did you imagine?

54
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,126
I don't know.

55
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,862
Not him.

56
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,733
<i> You don't like him.</i>

57
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,001
<i> Yeah, sure. Sure I do. Yeah.</i>

58
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,838
<i> I like him. He seems fine.</i>

59
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,139
<i> No you don't.</i>

60
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,075
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

61
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,216
Like, you two have been friends
for how long?

62
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,521
I just can't believe
he's never tried anything.

63
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,391
Yeah, well, not everyone is
like you.

64
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,396
<i> If you say so.</i>

65
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,369
Are you jealous?

66
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,005
No.

67
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,208
I'm not.

68
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,850
Should I be jealous?

69
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,852
'Cause I'll be jealous.

70
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,995
So, how'd you come to learn
Japanese?

71
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,397
Always wanted to come here.

72
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,332
Is it what you expected?

73
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,068
So far.

74
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,504
You know,
if we had trains like this in
America

75
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,206
I would not travel any other
way.

76
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,413
You two have been friends for a
long time.

77
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,086
I've never had that kind of
relationship
with a woman.

78
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,389
What are you guys talking about?

79
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,291
You.

80
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,436
You guys want anything
from the dining car?

81
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,872
I'm good. Thanks.

82
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,141
Kate?

83
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,111
She's good.

84
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,955
So, this is our room.

85
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,696
Feeling like a third wheel.

86
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,968
It's only for one night.

87
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,559
Are we looking
for anything in particular,
or...

88
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,562
Babe, how about this?

89
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,434
Exactly.

90
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,374
Wow. Come look at this temple.

91
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,978
Chris? Can you read this?

92
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,453
Looks like some kind of journal.

93
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:32,724
It's a kitsune.
A shapeshifter. Half woman,
half fox.

94
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,726
Do you think we could find this
place?

95
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,060
I think so.

96
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
Oh...

97
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,274
How much is it?

98
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,743
No, she's asking where we got
it.

99
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,516
Sorry, not for sale.

100
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,755
- Well, she said it's not for
sale, so...
- Okay, I got that.

101
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:08,092
Ask her how much it is,
how much she wants for it.

102
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,662
Leave now. Closed.

103
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,442
Do you think you said
something to insult her?

104
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,777
- Kate.
- What?

105
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,744
No.

106
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,479
No, I, I mean by accident.

107
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,515
You know? Maybe he said
the wrong word or something.

108
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,584
No. I didn't.

109
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,824
We'll find it online. All right?

110
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,526
Come on.

111
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,068
Babe. Can you please
explain to your viewers

112
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,537
why you won't be joining us
on this evening's adventure?

113
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,739
Jet lag.

114
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,508
There you have it, ladies and
gentleman.

115
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,410
Tune in next week
to discover how our heroes,

116
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,313
Chris and James,
got themselves into trouble.

117
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,562
Who is this woman?

118
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,436
Who is this woman?

119
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,607
That is a good question.

120
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,298
Hello?

121
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,679
The book.

122
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,243
Okay, okay, okay.

123
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,782
A whiskey.

124
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,384
Okay.

125
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,949
It's unlucky place.

126
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,886
Very unlucky.

127
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,789
Ah. I have a friend.

128
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,293
She's
interested in temples and
wants to start with this one.

129
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,799
This was not the start.
This was the end.

130
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,872
This temple.

131
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,611
It will make you... sick.

132
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,894
Sick.

133
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,068
Do not go there.
Many other temples in Japan.

134
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,079
I'm, I'm sorry.

135
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,542
How did you get this?

136
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,713
It's a long story.

137
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,751
Mmm, my head.

138
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:49,620
Wow.

139
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,490
Sorry I left you so
early last night.

140
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,026
Looked like you were having a
great time.

141
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,962
James said you made a friend.

142
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,264
A friend?

143
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,977
Oh, you know
that temple inside the book?

144
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,080
I can find it.

145
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,715
Doubt you can find
this place in any travel guide.

146
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,850
Yeah. You sure that's such a
good thing?

147
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,940
Oh.

148
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,951
That went well.

149
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:56,373
What's he say?

150
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:00,010
Um, he's asking why we came
here.

151
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:04,415
What's he saying?

152
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,351
Um, he's asking
why we came to his village.

153
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,909
Okay, okay.
He's saying this guy, hitoshi,

154
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:35,079
went up to the temple
and he had visions or something.

155
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,821
Holding his eyes.

156
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,433
Okay.

157
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,001
What is it. What is he doing?

158
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,238
Um, I don't,
i don't understand him, so...

159
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,380
<i> Mucho arigato.</i>

160
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,973
Hey, we're just going
to go for a walk, okay?

161
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,341
Yeah.

162
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,444
How great is this place?

163
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,213
It's perfect.

164
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,382
See ya later?

165
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,622
You are American.

166
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,457
You speak English?

167
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,527
It's been a long time.

168
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,532
They say you are here to visit
the temple.

169
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,504
The man in the village, he
said, uh...

170
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,840
You lost your sight there...

171
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,818
So, what's with all this...
Mystery about the temple?

172
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,657
What happened there?

173
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,162
Some children disappeared.

174
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,700
They had been playing in the
mountain.

175
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:10,707
It became night,
and the children had not
returned.

176
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:17,814
The search party
discovered a man living at the
temple.

177
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,286
He was a monk. A wanderer.

178
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,557
They questioned him
about the missing children.

179
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,897
But his answers were not
believed.

180
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,901
So, then what happened?

181
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,471
They killed the monk.

182
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,875
The children were never found.

183
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,186
Every year we burn candles,

184
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,456
and pray that the children will
return.

185
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,393
Someone was there, I...

186
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,333
Nobody.

187
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,637
Enjoy the show?

188
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,346
I'm sorry I woke you guys.

189
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,326
<i> We could feel it.
</i> <i> As we got closer it knew we</i> <i> were coming.</i>

190
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,598
<i> We should have gone back.</i>

191
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,691
Who helped you find the temple?

192
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:28,498
The boy, seita.

193
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,373
All right. Isn't that something?

194
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,677
It's terrible. I hate it.

195
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,079
It's just a spider, baby.

196
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,683
Yeah, it looks like
it eats birds or small children.

197
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,559
Oh!

198
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,149
It's so quiet up here.

199
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,018
I was just thinking the same
thing.

200
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,088
It's cold, though.

201
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,890
Hold up.

202
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:27,891
What?

203
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:28,858
Here.

204
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,129
What? No. Honestly, I'm okay.

205
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,841
Thanks.

206
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,022
What do you think
the monk did to those kids?

207
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,690
I don't want to think about it.

208
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,596
I can't tell you how many
shirts of mine
have mysteriously gone missing.

209
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,898
Never to be seen again.

210
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,087
I gotta take a leak.

211
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,089
Yeah, you do that.

212
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,891
Have fun!

213
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,270
Hey. Let's go find him.

214
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,139
James!

215
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,275
James!

216
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,812
Hey.

217
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:30,980
Hey, where were you?

218
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,616
I'll show you. Come on.

219
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,962
How cool is this?

220
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,898
It's an old mine.
I bet it goes on for miles.

221
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Who's coming with me?

222
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,971
How about on the way back down?

223
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:58,741
Oh, come on.
Where's that spirit of
adventure?

224
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,644
I want to find the temple first.

225
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,580
I mean...

226
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,114
We might not be able to find it
again.

227
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,817
We'll leave something
on the path to mark it.

228
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,162
Fine. Fine.

229
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,367
You sure, babe?

230
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,202
Gift from my stepmother.

231
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,879
Hey, look. It's the statue from
the book.

232
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:38,114
We found it!

233
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,766
We must be close.
Chris, what do they call her?

234
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,271
This is a kitsune.
A shapeshifter protects the temple.

235
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,345
Bit of a letdown.

236
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,063
Look like little graves.

237
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,800
Maybe the monk-man
made them for his victims.

238
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,370
Was that supposed to be a joke?

239
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,505
I know. Right? I'm sorry.

240
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,909
I thought it was, then I said
it.

241
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:58,481
We should probably get out
of here soon. The sun's
starting to go down.

242
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,417
We still have time.

243
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,153
Look, I know you're not into
this.

244
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,355
- That's not true.
- It isn't?

245
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,826
Look, I just... I don't want
to walk down the mountain in
the dark.

246
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,460
We do have flashlights.

247
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,430
True. I just don't want
to have to use them.

248
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,102
Okay.

249
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,840
Hey.

250
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,376
I love you.

251
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,879
I love you too.

252
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,520
James?

253
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,109
I thought I saw...

254
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,279
- Saw what?
- I don't know, just...

255
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,349
You're right.
It's getting dark. We should go.

256
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:41,317
We can always come
back tomorrow.

257
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:45,454
No, I don't want to, i
just... I want to find
Chris and I want to go.

258
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,487
Chris!

259
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,257
Yeah?

260
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,730
Chris?

261
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,366
Grab a flashlight. Grab a
flashlight.

262
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,101
Chris!

263
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,706
Hold it.

264
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:45,381
Is he breathing?

265
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,249
Yeah. Yeah, he's breathing.

266
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,217
What do we do?

267
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,754
Oh, Jesus. Thank god.

268
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,592
Something pulled me through the
floor.

269
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,663
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

270
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,066
We're just going to have to
wait here,

271
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,601
make ourselves comfortable,

272
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,269
- and go down for help
in the morning.

273
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:08,571
- No, I'm not spending
the night here.

274
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,072
Yeah? What do you suggest?

275
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,308
Let's get you out of here.

276
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,101
I'm going to take a walk.

277
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,140
A little moonlight stroll.
Care to join me?

278
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,144
We should stay here.

279
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,546
He's good. You're good, right?

280
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,120
Okay.

281
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,688
I'll be back in a few.

282
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,359
Be careful.

283
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,627
Yep.

284
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,800
He's going for help
first thing in the morning.

285
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,202
Okay?

286
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,506
He's not what I expected.

287
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,811
He said the same thing about
you.

288
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,414
I like him.

289
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,418
You do?

290
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,322
Yeah.

291
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,167
What do your parents think?

292
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,571
Mom's undecided.

293
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,542
Dad keeps trying to set me up
with some golf pro at his club.

294
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,614
- No ulterior motives there.

295
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,196
I never told him.

296
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,699
Never told him what?

297
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,704
About his baby.

298
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,843
So you're the only one who
knows.

299
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,747
What made you think of that
right now?

300
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,417
I don't know.

301
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,894
There were these... little
grave markers.

302
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,832
You cold?

303
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,901
I'm okay.

304
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,236
Okay.

305
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,677
- I'm going to tell him when we
get back.
- Tell me what?

306
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,880
Can, can you point that
somewhere else?

307
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,922
- What was it you were going to
tell me?

308
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:14,857
- Nothing. I wasn't talking
about you.

309
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,826
Never mind.

310
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,963
I think I got a pretty good
idea.

311
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:27,736
James.

312
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,540
James.

313
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,549
No, wait. What are you going to
do?

314
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:16,385
Where are you going? James!
James!

315
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,694
I'm going to go back to the
village.

316
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,730
Okay. You've got all the food
and water

317
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,665
- you need here in my bag.
- No.

318
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,400
I'll send someone in the
morning.

319
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:42,911
I told him.

320
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,951
We're going to need some more
firewood.

321
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,020
It's okay.
Why don't we just go back
inside...

322
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,456
Fine.

323
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,627
I'll be right back.

324
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,322
Go fuck yourself.

325
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,057
No, please.

326
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,726
Come on, come on!

327
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,629
Oh... no.

328
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,701
Flashlight died.

329
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,705
This place isn't right.

330
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,300
No.

331
00:58:58,302 --> 00:58:59,968
You gotta be kidding me.

332
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,086
James?

333
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,688
What's the matter?

334
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,925
What are you doing?

335
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:26,194
Kate. Wait.

336
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,730
He needs me.

337
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,036
Kate!

338
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,707
Aaah!

339
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,361
James...

340
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,779
Hello?

341
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,455
Hello?

342
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,328
Hello?

343
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:12,374
Hello?

344
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,365
Let me help you!

345
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:47,035
James!

346
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,712
Help!

347
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,550
Help me!

348
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,258
Please, someone help!

349
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,582
There's no way out.

350
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,237
Do you know why you are here?

351
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,643
We're trying to find a miss
Thomas.

352
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,349
Kate.

353
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,592
Christopher.

354
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,496
What happened to her?

355
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,473
Why is seita here?

356
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,222
The boy from the village.

357
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,498
He's in the hallway.

358
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,184
There is no boy.

359
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,478
Where is miss Thomas?

360
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,686
We know you killed James.

361
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,229
What happened to me, Chris?

362
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,734
Where's Kate?

363
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:41,970
James!

364
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,812
Why did you kill your friend?
