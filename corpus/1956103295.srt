1
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,655
Hot water  please 

2
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,907
Excuse me?

3
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,215
He said  car is closed 

4
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,559
He get for you 

5
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,559
 Thank you 
 You're welcome 

6
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,061
American?

7
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,808
Guilty 

8
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,315
First time to Turkey?

9
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,069
No  no  no 

10
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,789
Been here   

11
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,372
   a long time ago 

12
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,421
Different life 

13
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,006
 Now you come back 
 Yes 

14
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,383
Looking for something 

15
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,554
Hey 

16
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,274
My brother 

17
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,815
He say   

18
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,108
   you can find whatever you wish
in Turkey 

19
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,523
Yeah?

20
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,191
How about a man who kidnapped
his own daughter   

21
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,071
   and took her away
from her American mother?

22
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,995
An abusive man 

23
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,740
So not a real man 

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,872
No love for the child 
Just a need to punish his ex wife   

25
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,131
   to take the one thing away from her
that meant everything to her   

26
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,515
   with no intention
of returning the child 

27
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,384
Do you think that   ?

28
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,721
Excuse me 

29
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,430
Do you think I could find
that man in Turkey? Or maybe   

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,641
   on his way to Turkey?

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,063
I   

32
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,318
   would not be looking for such a man 

33
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,651
It would be   

34
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,116
   dangerous 

35
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,946
For you 

36
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,713
Men like him would think that 

37
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,002
And  God as my witness 
I would give him a chance 

38
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,209
To stop 

39
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,256
To reconsider 

40
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,838
To think about the worst thing
that could ever happen to him 

41
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,059
To imagine that 

42
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,004
There are two kinds of pain
in this world 

43
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,842
Pain that hurts 

44
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,219
Pain that alters 

45
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,261
Today   

46
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,064
   you get to choose 

47
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,735
Baby 

48
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,154
Oh  baby  Oh  my God 

49
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,152
 Oh  God 
 Mom!

50
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,527
Oh  my baby 

51
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,946
Are you okay?

52
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,660
My baby 

53
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,630
The State Department doesn't know
a thing about it  Grace  No one does 

54
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,134
Just that 45 minutes ago 
someone delivered your daughter   

55
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,126
   to the desk downstairs 

56
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,223
Oh  I love you so much 

57
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,096
I love you  I love you 

58
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,184
My favourite driver 
always on time like clockwork 

59
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,400
 Samuel 
 Roberto   

60
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,075
   it's not easy getting in and out here 

61
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,654
Copy Centre?

62
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,529
 Copy Centre?
 Yes 

63
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,074
Lift off!

64
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,339
How am I today?

65
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,838
The same  only worse 

66
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,559
Every day I know less 

67
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,564
Welcome to the club 

68
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,366
Thanks for the Lyft 

69
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,305
And a piece of advice:

70
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,178
Always be nice to anybody
who has access   

71
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,346
   to your toothbrush 

72
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,313

I don't get to choose

83

Why are you doing this?

97
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,373
I got your name on a piece of paper
in my pocket 

98
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,543
It's all that matters 

99

 Weathermen are the best

 Weathermen are the best 
 Dolphin trainers are totally the best 

107
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,988
You don't have to know anything 

108
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,080
There are screens on the sides
and the front 

109
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,667
 You don't see anything 
 They are the best  You curl their hair

00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,557
I don't want a drink 

128
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,863
I don't want a drink 
I don't want a drink 

129
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,864
 God   

130
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,858
   grant me the serenity to accept
things that I cannot change   

131
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,238
   the courage to change
the things I can   

132
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,874
   and the wisdom
to know the difference  

133
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,293
Would you  ?

134
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,381

One step  Keep going 

139
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,917
All right 

140
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,126
There you go 

141
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,644
Could you just help her get
in her apartment?

142
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,473
Thanks 

143
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,142

146
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,527

This is the point where usually I'd give
you a chance to do the right thing

00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,673
But not tonight  Tonight I'm gonna need
your cameras  cell phones

 That's right  For who?

181
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,953
 For Amy  For Am  
 For who?

182
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,586
Make sure
I get a five star rating  junior 

183
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,255
Fuck 

184
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,584
Hello  Susan 

185
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,329
What?

186
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,246
How in God's name
did you know it was me?

187
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,261
 I could smell you 
 For God's sake  I just peed 

188
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,974
Yeah  but you ate
asparagus vinaigrette   

189
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,217
    with soy sauce 
 Oh  you 

190
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,270
No  I smelled your perfume 
How are you?

191
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,636
 You good?
 Better now 

192
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:57,942
Very good 

193
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,565
 Brought you something 
 Soup 

194
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,607
 How'd that thing in Turkey turn out?
 Happy ending 

195
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:04,937
No pun intended 

196
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,782
Well  I guess
that means you owe me dinner 

197
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,158
I didn't agree to pay for dinner  I    

198
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,825
 You gonna try to weasel out?
 I'm not  I just    

199
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,965
No  no  no  my friend 
I don't work for free 

200
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,498
How's Brian?

201
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,262
 He's good  He's got a new book out 
 Yeah?

202
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,384
 Maybe I should read it 
 Oh  yeah 

203
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,851
You know  if geopolitics of Nepal
prior to the 1816 Sugauli Treaty   

204
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,434
   is your bag  definitely 

205
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,390
 Friendship has its limits 
 So does matrimony 

206
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,939
I haven't read it yet 

207
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,900
Doubt I ever will 

208
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,733
You here on business?

209
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,902
Meetings 

210
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,857
Meetings  huh?

211
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,992
Well  birthdays are the hardest 

212
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,373
I know I always think
of my brother on his 

213
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah 

214
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:04,549
I was folding laundry the other day   

215
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,923
   and I realised that I didn't have   

216
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,801
   any clothes left
that Vivienne had ever seen 

217
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,599
I can't say that's a bad thing 

218
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,638
What?

219
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,521
She didn't appreciate
my taste in clothing either 

220
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,567
I'd buy something 
the next day it was missing 

221
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,612
I'd ask her about it   

222
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,646
   she'd say she didn't know
what I was talking about  and    

223
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,450
She'd act like she didn't know
what I was talking about 

224
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:36,705
 I don't know what happened to
those purple shirts you used to buy  

225
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,120
And then I'd put one on that she liked 

226
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,461
What?

227
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,379
I didn't say anything 

228
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:56,683
I'm sorry if I made a mistake
coming to you on Vivienne's birthday 

229
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,769
I just   Robert  I've been thinking:

230
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,405
Maybe you should go back  huh?

231
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:10,114
It's great  you helping all these
random people and everything   

232
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,660
   but it's not gonna fill
that hole in your heart 

233
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,407
Go home  huh?

234
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,294
Make peace with it 

235
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,963
That's what Vivienne
would have wanted 

236
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,963
Oh  hey 

237
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,427
 Always a gentleman 
 That's right 

238
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,521
Hey  I'm obligated
to tell you these things   

239
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,357
   being I'm the only friend you got 

240
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,027
Airport  please 

241
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,775
Hey  Mr McCall  maybe you could find
out who did this to Fatima's garden 

242
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,362
Kids 

243
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,837
 What up  man?
 How you doing?

244
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:01,314
Hey  You should make
the building do that 

245
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,143
It's what they supposed to do 

246
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:08,398
 Supposed to do  and  will do 
are two different things  Miles 

247
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,859
 Yeah  but you live here  right?
 That's right  I pay the rent too 

248
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,106
 You should let somebody else do this 
 Like who?

249
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,990
Shit  I don't know 

250
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,736
Anybody 

251
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,328
 Not a tenant 
 You're right 

252
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,503
I guess anybody could do it 
but nobody does  Miles 

253
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,753
Ends up with everybody complaining   

254
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,455
   because nobody did
what anybody could have done   

255
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,507
   or should have done to begin with 

256
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,712
Yeah 

257
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,843
All right 

258
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,176
You know they got   They got
painting companies around here 

259
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:46,687
I know they charge six   seven hundred
dollars to do the job  I know that 

260
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,142
Word?

261
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,940
Shit  I'll do this for 350 

262
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,231
You?

263
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,991
Yeah 

264
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,570
 What?
 Nothing 

265
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,238
What  I look handicapped
or something?

266
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:03,027
It's a quick dip and roll 
It ain't rocket science 

267
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:04,992
No  you're right 

268
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,962
I'm an artist  man 

269
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,881
I go to Bridgeview Arts 

270
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,795
Why aren't you in school?

271
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,554
I don't be doing
all them everyday classes 

272
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,304
You know  I got a   Got a special talent 

273
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,180
Yes  you do 
And it takes talent to make money 

274
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,521
But it takes brains to keep it  Miles 

275
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,105
Well  I'm out here making my money 

276
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,114
Short money  Miles 

277
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,316
That's short money 

278
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,372
I'll tell you what 

279
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,330
Three fifty's a little high   

280
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,656
   but I appreciate the offer 

281
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,293
All right 

282
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,879
 All right?
 All right 

283
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:59,127
It's gonna be a lot of work  man 

284
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,683
 All right  Mr McCall 
 All right 

285
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,834
 So you still out here doing this?
 Yes  I am 

286
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,794
You ain't covering nothing 

287
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,664
Not yet 

288
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,961
What is this? Walmart paint?

289
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,755
Primer  You gotta prime it
before you paint it 

290
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,249
Don't teach you that in art school?

291
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,262
Yeah  I knew that 

292
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,303
I've been thinking about your offer 

293
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,520
Been calibrating    

294
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,604
Two fifty 

295
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,270
 Two fifty?
 Yeah 

296
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:58,439
Two fifty 
I'll take care of all of this for you 

297
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,703
 For 250?
 Yeah 

298
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:06,161
All right  But you can only work on it
after school 

299
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,455
 Shi  
 Don't curse 

300
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,619
What time you get out?

301
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:15,005
 Three fifteen 
 Okay  after school  3:15  Deal?

302
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,537
Okay?

303

All right 

304
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,418
 But cash  all right?
 Okay  cash 

305
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,881
 Don't be checking me 
 I'll be checking for you 

306
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,592
All right 

307
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,392
Miles 

308
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,227
Stay off them corners  son 

309
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,270
Gun oil on his lips 

310
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:41,738
Nine millimetre at his feet
was registered to the victim 

311
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,862
No other prints in the house 

312
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:47,623
 You have questions?
 Well  Mr Calbert did work for us 

313
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,623
When something occurs to one of ours 
the agency is obligated to look into it 

314
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,037
So  yes  you will be hearing from us 
Thank you 

315
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:57,416
 Susan  Susan 
 Keep it locked down until we get there 

316
00:31:57,584 --> 00:32:00,214
I can't find a file 
When did he become one of ours?

317
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:03,259
I don't know  Upstairs kept him
off the radar for some reason 

318
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,473
Susan 

319
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,928
 Car's here  It's okay?
 Oh  hey  Oh  you look great 

320
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,145
 What about a tie? You need a tie 
 I'd do what she says  Brian 

321
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,556
 You have one?
 Got it 

322
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,274
 Great  That's perfect 
 All right  I'll see you later 

323
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,095
 Have fun  sweetheart 
 Bye 

324
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,401
Yeah  I'm gonna have to go there
and cross the T's  Wanna come?

325
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,226
Oh  damn  and leave this shitty office?

326
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,452
Brussels has the best chocolates 

327
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,782
Well  we'll go  We'll find out 

328
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,658
Today  I broke a personal best:

329
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:34,366
Successive days alive 

330
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,005
All right 

331
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,084
Here  I got photographic evidence 

332
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:42,881
That's the portrait of my sister  Magda 

333
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,706
I was 9 

334
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:46,302
The war came 

335
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,716
Like most families  we were separated 

336
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:54,057
My sister  Magda  and I were sent
to different camps 

337
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,644
I never saw her again 

338
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,154
Sixty years later   

339
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,773
   I'm in Paris   

340
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:05,649
   and I see somebody auctioning
my painting 

341
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,823
Twelve million  can you imagine?

342
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:12,909
 You got to have proof   they say 
 to get it back  

343
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:16,496
Now I got here the proof 

344
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,420
Wait till the judge sees this 

345
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:23,634
Looks like there's coming a storm 

346
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,511
It's time for your check up  Sam 

347
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,053
Hello  sweetheart 

348
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:38,693
He's still obsessed with the painting 
Tried to help him years ago 

349
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:42,232
He said he had proof it was his 
even way back then 

350
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,857
He didn't 

351
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,744
No record  no bill of sales 

352
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,362
He just keeps going back to court
to hear the same thing 

353
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,576
Guess it gives him something
to focus on 

354
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:57,753
It helps when you have nobody left 
you know?

355
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,049
 The reading went great 
 Embarrassing 

356
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:11,555
 No 
 I signed two books  That's all 

357
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:13,895
Thank you 

358
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,274
 Sure we can't drop you at the airport?
 No  I'm fine  Thank you 

359
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,232
 Thanks for coming  Good night 
 All right  Good night 

360
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,524
 Do me a favour 
 Yeah?

361
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,227
See what you can find out 

362
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,857
 Yeah?
 Oh  another dinner  then 

363
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,574
 I'll see what I can do 
 Yeah?

364
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,364
I do fly off to Brussels tomorrow 

365
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,648
 Thought you were retired 
 Oh  I am 

366
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,622
Just like you're dead 

367
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,492
 Okay  Very good  Good night 
 Good night 

368
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,631
I saw you painting yesterday  Miles 

369
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,554
It's primer 

370
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,593
It ain't paint 

371
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:53,966
So all this bullshit under there 
it don't show through 

372
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,048
My brother painted that 

373
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,312
It's the place we grew up 

374
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,135
Yeah? Well  you live here now 

375
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,895
Powder of some sort 

376
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,358
Hard drive contents and cell records?

377
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:54,451
You'll have them later today 

378
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,996
Susan 

379
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,830
Okay  Thank you 

380
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,710
 You okay?
 Yeah  I'm fine 

381
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:16,762
Right behind you 

382
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,862
I don't know 

383
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,316
Seems to me the judge   

384
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,367
   he didn't even pay
any attention to me 

385
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,196
I mean  he hardly looked
at all the evidence I had 

386
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,084
Well  that's it 

387
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,829
It was a very rare painting  Sam 

388
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:54,592
Maybe   Maybe that's the reason
why it looks so familiar to you 

389
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,734
This is my sister  Magda 

390
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:16,903
Was younger 
but that's the only picture survived 

391
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,533
My uncle   

392
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,658
   commissioned the portrait   

393
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:24,945
   as a gift for her 12th birthday 

394
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,330
Was a young artist  just beginning   

395
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:30,627
   but  oh  you should have seen it 

396
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,422
Not just the resemblance   

397
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,546
   but a spirit that shone through it 

398
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,884
It glowed  you know  like a beacon 

399
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,175
 My little brother   she'd say 
 My Sammy  

400
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,930
I could never protect her 

401
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,310
To lose her twice   

402
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,234
   I can't imagine 

403
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,410
 Hello  Susan 
 I had no idea you were an art lover 

404
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,369
That information you wanted
just came in 

405
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,495
 Kind of surprising 
 Okay 

406
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,042
 I'm sending it to you right now 
 Good 

407
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,576
 Yeah?
 Hey 

408
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,249
Calbert's bank records are fine 

409
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,916
Texts  e mails 

410
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,838
No marital discord 

411
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,256
No girlfriends 
no boyfriends  no lovers 

412
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,835
Not even an inappropriate message
to a co worker 

413
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,551
And what about the wife?

414
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:28,311
Oh  come on  Dave 
Women fuck around too 

415
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:34,726
Think about it  When's the last time
you sent your wife flowers?

416
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,188
Noted  Noted 

417
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,204
Data on Calbert's hard drive
just came in 

418
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:47,043
We'll talk about it on the plane 
I wanna get out of here 

419
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,622
Run some theories by Stan 

420
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,757
All right  Watch 

421
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,777
 I'll see you downstairs at 6?
 You got it 

422
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,739
How about some
of that delicious Belgian chocolate   

423
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:32,161
   you're always talking about?
Or you're not getting on the plane 

424
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,248
Guess I'm going back out 

425
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:54,482
Oh  crap 

426
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,573
Oh  great 

427
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,494
Oh  my  

428
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,251
What do you want?

429
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,460
Get up  bitch!

430
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:16,043
No! You're hurting me!

431
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,038
Where is the money?

432
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,129
I don't have any money!

433
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,384
Where is the money?

434
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:29,798
Fucking   Fucking why?
Who the fuck are you?

435
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,472
Come on!

436
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,501
No! Oh  fuck! Let go!

437
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,553
Brick will make this pop out 

438
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,638
Picasso this entire building 

439
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,063
 Picasso it? Yeah  okay 
 Yeah 

440
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,602
How much?

441
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,385
It's on the house 

442
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,349
I like that 

443
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,398
 You been drawing a long time?
 Since   

444
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,737
   about third grade 

445
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,406
What is this?

446
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,697
That's how I sign my work 

447
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:39,366
My brother  he was a boxer 
It's the right hand of God 

448
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,504
He catch you with it  you know 

449
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,170
You go to heaven or    

450
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,223
Okay 

451
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,847
 He still fighting?
 No 

452
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,645
Somebody shot him 

453
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:00,687
Coming back from the gym 
Not even ganged up on or nothing 

454
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,984
Just wanted his gym bag 

455
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,075
What?

456
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,412
I didn't say anything 

457
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,621
Anyway   

458
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,999
   my grandmother says if you don't   

459
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,380
   remember somebody out loud   

460
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,338
   they die twice 

461
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:35,762
Grandmother was wise  Hey  Brian 

462
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:39,981
Yeah  listen  I'm reading your book
right now  and I can't believe you    

463
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,576
Yeah 

464
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,168
Yeah 

465
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,013
Got it 

466
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,677
Yo  Mr McCall  you good?

467
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,811
Hey  yo  Mr McCall 

468
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,690
Oh  thanks  Dave 

469
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,595
No  the  

470
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:35,224
The police in Brussels  they say that   

471
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:39,434
   it happens in these hotels 
these robberies 

472
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:42,815
But she never wore any jewellery 

473
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,392
Not even a watch  and    

474
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:50,903
Except for this 

475
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,741
Here 

476
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,078
What'd the agency say?

477
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,456
They said   

478
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:09,043
   they'd do everything in their power 

479
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,417
They're working with Interpol 

480
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,881
Promised to find whoever it was 

481
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,968
But   

482
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,064
   I don't know what to do now 

483
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,350
Where's the phone?

484
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:34,018
Is it yours?

485
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:37,615
It's not mine!

486
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:42,995
Where the fuck is it?

487
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:45,223
  things to remember as the storm
continues its march northward 

488
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:48,304
We saw what Frances did
in the southeast part of the country 

489
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,430
It appears to be moving as slowly
as it left the Gulf Coast 

490
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,928
That is what worries meteorologists 

491
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,152
Even as the storm is moving up
the Eastern Seaboard   

492
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:01,732
   every city and town that has been hit
has experienced a storm surge    

493
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,534
  dangerous flood levels 

494
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:13,446
National Guard has been deployed in
several states to prepare for lootings 

495
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,419
All right  Watch 

496
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:10,224
 I'll see you downstairs at 6?
 You got it 

497
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:14,468
 I'll see you downstairs at 6?
 You got it 

498
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,827
You got fat  Dave 

499
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,731
I was in the same lobby   

500
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,518
   when that bomb went off 

501
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:09,192
Looking right at you   

502
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:13,159
   when that hotel came down on us 

503
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:18,871
You were there and then you weren't 

504
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,247
Wasn't my day 

505
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,675
I went to your funeral 

506
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:30,047
Grieved a long time over you 

507
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:35,933
Susan  she knew?

508
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,351
I was your partner for seven years 
Kept nothing from you 

509
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,479
I'm sorry  Dave 

510
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,266
I am 

511
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:52,074
I never had a chance
to say how sorry I was   

512
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,739
   about Vivienne 

513
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,410
You still at the beach?

514
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:02,543
Not in a long time 

515
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,628
Well  I got me that cabin 

516
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,260
Take the wife and kids up
a couple times a year 

517
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,679
Wouldn't have any of it   

518
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:18,176
   if it weren't for Susan 

519
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,641
Life got   

520
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:26,188
   dark 

521
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:30,398
She talked me off that ledge
I was heading over 

522
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:33,451
Probably over a bowl of soup 

523
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:41,236
I owe her my life 

524
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,166
You ever talk to the boys?

525
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:48,126
No  not for years 

526
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:53,587
Hell of a team we were  right?

527
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,765
 She never pushed a button  Dave 
 Who?

528
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,559
Susan 

529
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:02,933
On the elevator 

530
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,230
She never pushed her floor number 
I checked all the video 

531
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,525
Backpackers got on first 

532
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,320
They pushed number 16 
She didn't have to 

533
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,739
They knew what floor she was on 

534
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:19,915
They find them?

535
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,704
Pieces of them 

536
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:26,158
Couple of tweakers 
with sheets as long as my arm 

537
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:29,041
My good arm  anyway 

538
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,211
Gas explosion 

539
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,458
 At least that's what they're calling it 
 What do you call it?

540
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,054
Tying up loose ends 

541
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,347
Autopsy report 

542
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,474
Stab wound 

543
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,521
Two millimetres  The lower third rib 

544
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,357
 Close quarter technique 
 Exactly  That was taught 

545
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,693
This was no robbery 

546
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:57,608
Something else went on in that room 

547
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:02,371
Mac  whatever it is 
whatever you need   

548
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,200
   I'm in 

549
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,675
 I know 
 Same mud 

550
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:15,879
Same blood 

551
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,160
What's the deal  bro?

552
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:39,168
 This is about some other case?
 The Russians 

553
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,248
Listen 

554
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:46,838
 York 
 Dave 

555
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,930
Listen  the gun   

556
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,274
   next to Calbert was on his right side 

557
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,771
He was right handed  Why?

558
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,938
His wife was shot
by somebody left handed 

559
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,938
Somebody else was in that room 

560
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,410
Powder residue
came from a latex glove 

561
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:15,288
Twenty thousand euros were found
in the backpackers' flat 

562
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:18,076
 Hey  Bob 
 Dave 

563
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,166
Those guys were set up 

564
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,626
Right  Agency assets are taken out
all the time 

565
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:29,256
Opposite side
loves sending a message 

566
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:30,586
Why stage it?

567
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,392
They didn't know he was one of ours 

568
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:37,306
Susan was about to figure out
who was in that room 

569
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:41,186
That's why she was killed  Dave 
The two were connected 

570
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:44,115
I'll get back to you when I know more 

571
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,783

Don't have her bury two sons 
You hear me?

591

01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:00,338
 Man  ain't spelled G U N  son

You got a choice 

643
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,640
You got talent  You got a chance  Don't
wanna hear about your environment   

644
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,307
   what your mama didn't give 
white man won't give you no shot 

645
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:13,056
You got a chance 

646
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,608
Use it while you're still alive 

647
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:18,152
You don't know what death is 

648
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,687
You have no idea what death is!

649
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,570
 Make a decision 
 All right 

650
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,036
Hey  yo  Mr McCall 

651
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:39,666
 Why me?
 Why not you?

652
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:47,885
But   But why me?

653
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:51,135
Let's find out together 

654
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,654
With a storm this size 
that surge could be 6 feet 

655
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:01,895
It's the speed of the hurricane
and that giant eye   

656
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,489
   that could absolutely
deluge the coast 

657
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:06,365
Frances is very slow   

658
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:09,782
   due to the amount of rain
that Frances is holding   

659
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:14,042
   and that it's moving so slowly 
It appears in no hurry to move on 

660
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:17,246
Awaiting another press conference
with the governor about efforts   

661
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:20,207
   to prepare for the storm
and the inevitable rescues   

662
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,169
   and the following recovery effort 

663
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,669
Governor's already said
that he may ask the president   

664
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,262
   to declare the state
a federal disaster    

665
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:29,507
 Hello?
 Mr McCall?

666
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:35,345
 Who is it?
 It's me  Miles 

667

 Yeah  I saw it 

668
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:46,573
This is your change for the extra paint 

669
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:49,529
 That's all of it?
 Yeah 

670
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:54,004

 Yes  I do 

672
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,760
 Would you like something to drink?
 Yeah 

673
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,552
Come on in 

674
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:09,798
Iced tea or water?

01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:00,455
Is it somebody's birthday?

703
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:02,042
My daughter 

704
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:03,577
Nice 

705
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:08,804
How old is she?

706
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,551
She's 5 

707
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:11,191
Guess you don't fly that often  huh?

708
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:16,279
Been driving in the opposite direction
of Logan for the last three minutes 

709
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:49,361
Hey!

710
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:49,729
No crust either 

711
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,313
 Mom?
 Eat up  sweetie 

712
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:54,478
Mom says I have to go
to the dentist  She never has to go 

713
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,108
 The gardener?
 Grapes 

714
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:58,995
 Can I have a treat?
 You know where the grapes are 

715
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,872
Oh  my God 

716
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:07,202
My life is so hard 

717
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,949
 Here's your grapes 
 What   ?

718
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,672
 Come on  Show me what you can do 
 But   Seriously?

719
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,883
 Seriously 
 Come on 

720
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:17,003
Hi  baby 

721
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:21,422
Mommy made a nice map 

722
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,757
A  Maine  Very good 

723
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,717
B  New Hams  

724
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,429
 New Hamster  

725
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:30,929
Carol  who is it?

726
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:38,106
Carol?

727
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,535
It's New Hampshire 
not  New Hamster  

728
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:44,034
But I like it as  New Hamster  

729
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,238
 Okay  leave it  New Hamster  
 The front doorbell is broken 

730
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:50,119
Your old Army buddy was
at the back door for five minutes 

731
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:53,327
Actually  I was his team leader 
seven years 

732
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:57,338
Oh  my   Baby  I'm so sorry 
I must have forgot   This is  

733
01:12:57,503 --> 01:13:00,553
Got the days mixed up  This is Robert 
This is my wife  Carol 

734
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:03,014
 Hi  My pleasure 
 Hi  Pleasure to meet you 

735
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:05,555
 These are our daughters  Molly  Alice 
 Hi  Hi 

736
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:08,049
 Come here  Say hi to  
 Make yourself at home 

737
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:10,102
 Thank you 
 Call him Mac 

738
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,635
 Do you want some coffee?
 No  I'm fine  thank you 

739
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,979
 Sorry about the mess  We were  
 No problem 

740
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:17,185
 I gotta get these two off to school 
 Okay 

741
01:13:17,356 --> 01:13:20,526
Girls  let's go  Out of these pyjamas 

742
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:24,945
Nice 

743
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,743
 Robert  nice to meet you 
 Oh  my pleasure 

744
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:29,828
 Sit down  Come here 
 Yep 

745
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,243
Take these off  Let's go 

746
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,501
 You all right?
 Yeah 

747
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:35,834
Get those teeth brushed 

748
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:40,091
 You got a beautiful family 
 Thanks 

749
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,304
What's going on?

750
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:49,433
I took this off the guy   

751
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:53,772
   who tried to kill me yesterday 
It's like you said  they're cleaning up 

752
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,814
Everybody who's looking
into the Brussels hit  nobody's safe 

753
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,939
You  your family  nobody 

754
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:02,607
That's military grade encryption 

755
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:05,646
You should take it to your office 
run the numbers   

756
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,704
   and check the names
against passenger manifests   

757
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,826
   in and out of Brussels
in the days surrounding the flight 

758
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:14,754
Whoever we're looking for made calls
to that phone 

759
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,750
I'm on it  I'm on it 

760
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,195
Tell me I'm wrong  Dave 

761
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:52,487
You gonna answer it?

762
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,790
What happened  Dave?

763
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,424
You died 

764
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:16,768
That's what happened 

765
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:23,016
Three months after you disappeared   

766
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,440
   government shut us down 

767
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:28,778
I went private right after 

768
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:33,074
Doing the same things you and I did
for God and country   

769
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:36,872
   killing names
on a piece of paper  Only now    

770
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,997
Now there's a price next to them 

771
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:42,174
 We killed the enemy 
 Who said they were the enemy?

772
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,544
Not us  Not me 

773
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:48,343
We just followed orders 

774
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:55,475
Mac  there are no good
and bad people anymore 

775
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,849
No 

776
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,385
No enemies 

777
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,099
Just   

778
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:02,936
   unfortunates 

779
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,855
And Susan?

780
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,531
Unfortunate 

781
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:18,664
No one knew the Brussels contract
was a deep agency asset 

782
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:23,541
Susan was gonna figure out
who was in that dining room 

783
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,799
She was the only one
who could have  right?

784
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:29,962
Until you crawled out of your grave 

785
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,765
You get the chocolate?

786
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,814
Oh  fuck 

787
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:01,865
Susan worked
in a dangerous world  Mac 

788
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:05,328
Could have happened anytime
by anybody 

789
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,211
 But it wasn't anybody  it was you 
 Just    

790
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,926
You spare me
the righteous bullshit  all right?

791
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,061
You do what you have to do
and you move on 

792
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:22,684
There's no moving on from this  Dave 

793
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,941
 We gotta pay for our sins 
 What about you?

794
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:28,483
 Do you deserve to die for yours?
 Hundred times over 

795
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,939
All right  Well  guess what 

796
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,360
There is no sin 

797
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,375
No virtue 

798
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:43,332
It's just shit people do 

799
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:49,714
They trained us to kill people
and risk our lives doing it 

800
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,588
Then one day  you get a call
saying they're done with you 

801
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:55,716
 Thank you for your service 
Here's a plaque  

802
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,844
You need a job? Good luck 

803
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:01,261
You need medical insurance?
See the VA 

804
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:05,851
One day  you're an asset 

805
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:09,359
The next  you're a fucking afterthought 

806
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,070
It was a natural evolution 
It's who we were 

807
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:20,455
It's what we did  It's what you did 

808
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,946
 Now it's what we do 
  We ?

809
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,580
It's not just me  Mac 

810
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:32,555
It's all of us  Ari  Resnik  Kovac 

811
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:34,513
All of us 

812
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:37,467
Family 

813
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:58,741
Gentlemen 

814
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:00,316
Mac 

815
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,990
Looks pretty good for a dead guy 

816
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,962
We all want you to know 
none of this is personal 

817
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,462
What you do
and become is not my concern 

818
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:14,247
The world is full
of so called men like you 

819
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,301
And in a perfect world   

820
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:19,593
   everything we do
comes with a price   

821
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:23,224
   but this ain't a perfect world 
People do bad things 

822
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:25,808
If you're lucky  you get a chance   

823
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:27,893
   to set it right 

824
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:32,060
But most of the time 
it goes unpunished 

825
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,145
This ain't one of them times 

826
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:38,147
The mistake you made
was you killed my friend   

827
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,570
   so I'm gonna kill
each and every one of you   

828
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,740
   and the only disappointment is
that I only get to do it once 

829
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:48,750
Train's gotta go 
Alice has music practice at 7:45 

830
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:51,174
 Hey  Ari  fellas!
 Hey  Carol 

831
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:55,213
 Robert  hope to see you again 
 Nice to meet you too!

832
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:01,126
Dave said you could give me a lift
to the station?

833
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,141
 Bye  Daddy!
 Bye  Dad 

834
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:04,763
Help and company?

835
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,640
Let's go 

836
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:08,561
See?

837
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:10,765
Help and company 

838
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,806
 You take the little one!
 Okay 

839
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:20,397
Come on 

840
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,371
See you at work!

841
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:47,216
Look  I don't think
my wife had a favourite 

842
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:50,926
She never gave
a lot of thought to clothes 

843
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:57,324
I'm fine  I'll bring something over
in the morning 

844
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,120
Who's coming after me?

845
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:20,134
The men who killed Susan 

846
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:23,251
Why?

847
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:27,508
Because you're a loose end 

848
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:00,667
 What's up  Miles?
 Hey  yo  what up  man?

849
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:04,175
 Where are you?
 I'm at your crib  actually 

850
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:07,551
 I don't have time right  
 Finishing up these walls 

851
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,876
Going with the spearmint green 

852
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:13,090
Yo  you got any food around here?
I'm starving 

853
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:22,558
What's all that barking?

854
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:24,769
Go to the window 
Tell me what you see 

855
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,570
Yeah 

856
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:30,066
Hey  these dogs outside going crazy 

857
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:33,777
Listen  Hey  Out toward the street 
tell me what you see 

858
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:37,036
Oh  it's just some dude out here
delivering pizza 

859
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:38,242
Hang on 

860
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,193
Hey  yo 

861
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:12,987
Hey  yo  Mr McCall 

862
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,871
Shit 

863
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:18,825
Oh  shit 

864
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:23,371
 I think somebody's trying to get in  
 Miles  listen carefully 

865
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,250
Go to my bedroom 
You'll see a bookshelf 

866
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:28,958
 Go  Just go 
 Yo  what?

867
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:30,299
 Hey  yo  what  ?
 Miles 

868
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:33,264
 All right  All right 
 Miles  See it?

869
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:35,295
 Yeah 
 All right 

870
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:38,219
Middle shelf  there's a book
by Richard Wright: Native Son 

871
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:40,638
 What?
 Listen  Just do what I tell you 

872
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,427
 Native Son 
 Pull it out 

873
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:45,311
 Want me to read it?
 Pull it out  You'll see a button 

874
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:47,269

I don't know who the kid is 
or if he means anything to you 

966
01:45:22,781 --> 01:45:25,121
I took the chance that he matters

981
01:47:23,777 --> 01:47:25,857
Is that in your playbook?

982
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:28,319

I'm    

1009
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:42,261
I'm working on a superhero character 

1010
01:52:42,429 --> 01:52:45,349
 What's his power?
 What's his power?

1011
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:49,267

You know  he has   

1013
01:52:51,355 --> 01:52:54,575

1014
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:56,693

So   So you can understand   

1024
01:53:57,421 --> 01:54:00,841
   that when a resident says things   

1025
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:05,388
   that are  
That are grandiose by nature   

1026
01:54:06,722 --> 01:54:09,142
   we tend to dismiss it 

1027
01:54:09,308 --> 01:54:14,438
So you can imagine
how surprised we were today when  

1028
01:54:14,605 --> 01:54:16,025
When    

1029
