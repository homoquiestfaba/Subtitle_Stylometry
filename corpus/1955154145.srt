1
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:16,506
Wind. There is nothing as fast

2
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,563
Pull you coastwise like a flying.

00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,516

00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:50,358

approaching the average.

8
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,590

00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,543
Sometimes I can barely remember
a time when we were all together.

25
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,908
But still I will always do

26
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,385

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,727
Nice talking to you. take care.

37
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:34,138
Ok, then.bye

38
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:39,065
well dady, if you want a woman to split up,
then  you have it, I guess

39
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,022
and then there is mom

40
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,539
Probably the only person in the planet
who loves surfing as much as I do.

41
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,410
she is Definitely not the typical mom.

42
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,882
krakers?
- Oh, I love Krakers.

43
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,856
so do I,
but not for breakfast.

44
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,990
Is that it?
- Do not be silly, Megan.

45
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:02,513
what kind of mom give just Krakers
without soup

46
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:05,783
Mom, can not have soup for breakfast.

47
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:08,034
why not Megan, soup is good food.

48
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,543
Broky like soup for breakfast. don't yout?

49
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,236
Broky is a dog, he drank from the toilet .

50
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:17,668
Okay, let me see  what  can I make you,  Meg

51
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,981
I can make you a wondurdul tuna sandwiches

52
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,719
I Do not want you to get the wrong idea.

53
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,907
Mom is not usually not this bizarre.

54
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:30,201
it is just a bit of bad luck
she is been little bit distracted

55
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,320
And if you think about it,
the Life is really cool that way.

56
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:43,283
Oh, we forgot not them
Get Fast in the tent!

57
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,848
may be mom is lonely.
But enentually she set a couple of dates.

58
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,986
is he alwayws so enthusiastic

59
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:05,636
that is nothing. Last mother's date is
still in the body cast

60
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:09,588
body cast?
- they sound like a full recovery.

61
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,623
But I have my doubt

62
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,488
OK, I'm not the popular, in diary
I see it right now.

63
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:26,434
I mean, if  it was not for a week  last year.

64
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,511
Beside I was related to tube or somthing.

65
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,833
actually, I got to told them that I was

66
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:36,905
And when Heather found out that I was not ... it was bad.

67
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,455
you are not your cousin, Megan

68
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,362
I have a cousin who looks like her.

69
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,397
and she sings pretty well.

70
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,646
You can't sit on our table anymore.

71
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:54,232
I am telling you
Kater em you, claws is that pulls would be totally cool.

72
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,519
that would be miserable idea.

73
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:01,080
And what about the x-ray vision?
- Changing the shape?

74
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,081
that be fresh

75
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,633
the truth is,  the diary
I want to be in the popular group only for one reason.

76
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:12,149
Kater Kolbern the most extreme kid in high school.

77
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,678
last year he skid down the entire mountain.

78
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,625
Well, he fell mostly, but he was still totally  radical.

79
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:25,224
Does anyone know the answer?

80
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:28,381
Kater?
What?

81
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,646
- Mr. Singh!
- Do you the answer?

82
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,640
Mr. Singh, I do not even know what the question is?

83
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,973
for long time I do not Think Kater does even exist.

84
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,854
But then there is this wind surfing
and coming to my mother's store ...

85
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,582
Man, you should see me in the air, I was getting yesterday
like a big time rap after rap. Dude.

86
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,649
Hey. Hey.

87
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,029
What is your name again?
- Korgan, Migan ...?

88
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,681
Fegan.
- Megan.

89
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:11,387
Can I have some chips?
- Yes, go ahead.

90
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:20,621
Man,  they are cool.  what are they?
- barbecue  I mean With cream and onions.

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,481
Windsurfing is cool you know, because ...
there is wind, right ...

92
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:33,578
Aand also there is surfing
so you like windsurfing

93
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,797
I have never thought it that way

94
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:41,442
Thanks for chips ... Megan.
See you on the water

95
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,748
I like your hair
- thanks

96
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:51,807
I know.

97
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:54,147
It is now all  in my diary

98
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,182
Because everything has changed.

99
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:00,015
- What do you mean, you met a guy?
- His name is Cosmo.

100
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,452
- Cosmo Cola.
- He sounds like an alien.

101
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:06,106
Is it?
- I did not notice, Trev.

102
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,750
Wait a minute, where did you meet this guy mom
- It's very silly

103
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,074
I was windSurfing ...

104
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:25,866
It was rediculous,  but it is great too

105
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,545
Meg, he wanted to rescue me from the waves.

106
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,446
- Mom, you were not drowning.
- Sure, but not the point.

107
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,706
He was willing to help.
- I have bad feeling

108
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:37,917
We started talking,
and he just clicked.

109
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:41,149
are you alright?
I saw you being blewed up by the wind.

110
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:45,667
- I'm windsurfing
- I'm Koz. glad to meet you

111
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:47,595
We talked for hours, I guess

112
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:53,849
I mean, He has this ... childish like quality,
that I found so refreshing

113
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:57,126
- Candy?
- Sure.

114
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:02,077
Okay. And where is that Cosmo Cola from?

115
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,930
Canada. Yukon.

116
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:08,312
Mom, there no place called Yukon

117
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,042
Yucon, it must be deserted
it is mystery or something.

118
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:16,939
and his daughter was there.
- his daughter?
- Ariel, she is 14 years old too

119
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,253
- Meg, is not that great?
- Possibly.

120
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:24,202
Meg, do I look like  a peach?
Okay, bye.

121
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,953
I'll be back soon.

122
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,675
Hey?  Mom.

123
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:03,604
Why not let anyone listen to your music?
-Because.

124
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:06,582
Well, at least there a good reason.

125
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,426
since this night is a good night

126
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:12,495
every body finally going to meet.
Are not you excited?

127
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,064

128
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:20,413
Come on. Help me clean that
I wanted to prepare a chicken ...

129
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:23,730
I hope this Kozmo likes hot dogs ...
- He's a gourmet?

130
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,780
Megan, be nice.
- I'm always nice.

131
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,234
New people are not allways so bad
you know.

132
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,108
I mean, Sometimes change can  be a good thing,
if you welcome it.

133
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:34,167
He will not comming for  last Supper, I hope

134
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,740
Since when you have such a sharp  tongue?

135
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,036
you still think at the things you don't say

136
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,289
Dear, it mean a hole lot to me

00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,857
Probably mom is right.
- I will try

140
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:58,723
May be, I think that he and Ariel would be great

141
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,941
If you like them, they must be great, right

142
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:05,274
Of course, you like and modern dance,
but people go there.

143
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,779
It must be them.
Will you get the door, Meg?

144
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,814

145
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,266

150
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,611
It should be a quiz, Megan. I love Scrabble.

151
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:44,717
It was worse than  I could possibly imagine, Diary

152
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,840
Are you a good alien? Or a bad alien?

153
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:55,633
Good, mostly. But sometimes bad.

154
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,079
Like now, Hah

155
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:08,886
I love dogs. Tiny brains in such a large powerful bodies.

156
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,949
Kozmo!
- Kathy!

157
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm so happy to see you.
- Me too.

158
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:21,170
I have gas ... . I mean juice.
This is for you.

159
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:24,309
Thank you, Kozmo.
Where is Ariel?

160
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:27,456
she is out In the car.
she does not like the wind.

161
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:32,501
She does not like the wind?

162
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:36,832
actually, wind can be very frightening.
If you do not understand it.

163
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,098
And you're an alien, the wind would blow you away.

164
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,171
Exactly, right

165
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,002
Of course, wind can also a wondurful way
of meeting people.

166
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,657
Will you go out and help her in, Meg?
- Mom!
Megan.

167
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,692
Okay

168
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,560
Hello?
Arial?

169
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:47,298
what are you doing under there?
- I fear the wind.

170
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,532
Dear Diary, I do not make sense of this
strange planet called Earth.

171
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,522
Every time I look at this terrible vehicle

172
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:15,145
The bubly flesh, the flatt face,

173
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,502
the gas with yellow hair that grow out of that tedious scalp.

174
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:22,555
I can only think of it ... I am grotesque.

175
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:26,096
the same dream comes to me almost every night

176
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,006
I am back on my home planet of Zirkolan

177
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,854
and once again, I'm  in a beautiful pink ball of gas.

178
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,261
I'm floating next to my beloved Fanul

179
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,065
Oh, fine, handsome and intelligent Fanu.

180
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,287
How I miss floating with you.

181
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:49,655
I miss my true self. My essence.

182
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,886
I long to be  Zuizav Zirkalona once again

183
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,013
And there are mother and father as well.
They floating by my side

184
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:03,509
Oh, the joy, the rapture, the bless

185
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:07,110
I knew we'd have to leave Zirkalon, Diary

186
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,679
I knew  my dad's life was in danger
because he was a freedom fighter.

187
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,151
I knew as well, that Savad was repressive emperor

188
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,697
and that we are not completely free on Zirkalon.

189
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:26,358
But I  have never expected that
we will have to leave so suddenly, Diary.

190
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,543
It all happened so incredibly fast.

191
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,812
And in one peep moment, the mother was lost forever.

192
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,015
She became part of a great kosmik gas.

193
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:14,030
It's strange, Diary without
horror and the bad customs

194
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:18,960
it seems less than one four bond the one factor
that Zirkaloncim need to survive.

195
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,328
A element known as CO2.

196
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:24,854
?? of gas.

197
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,515
it just to be

198
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,791
I became desperate, Diary.

199
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,215
Desperate for any help in navigating
this strange and frightening  place.

200
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,598
Then I turned to our neighbor
the spiritual guide  Serena Su.

201
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,709
Get Gandhi, away Picasso.

202
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,910
- Ariel, I know what troubles you.
- you do?

203
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:55,617
In the month that you and
your charming father moved in,

204
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:58,320
I perceived that you're different.

205
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:01,927
yes
-you don't feel like you belong here.

206
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:04,975
No.
- And in this you are correct

207
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,798
You have lived
many, many times before, Ariel.

208
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,938
most recently, you were a cowgirl
on a large ranch in Montana.

209
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:18,837
you are crushed by cows
you are not yet psychically recovered from this

210
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,334
do you feel the truth of what I am telling you?
Do not speek.

211
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:29,275
I am a psychic.
I already know what you are thinking

212
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,838
I can see very Clearly  exactly ...

213
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,872
it sound like Serina Su
flying in her diary

214
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,797
but of course, she can't read my mind.

215
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,215
she is already go a pathetic person.

216
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,590
But she at least possess
somewhat a gaseous manners.

217
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,766
But what is  not even that matter now? , Dairy

218
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:54,941
Now the gloom and terror
so Utterly induct my life

219
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:02,897
- Well, what you think?
- I hate it, Dady.

220
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:07,534
You think here is so ugly and solid and heavy

221
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,971
I know it is hard, Ariel.

222
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,081
I miss our home too

223
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:19,404
There is truely nothing like  a  great day of floating.

224
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:22,500
expanding in the heat

225
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,535
Contracting when it is cool off

226
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:29,318
why simply we do not go back then
we will be near mamy

227
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,977
Mom has ... turn down, Ariel.

228
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,175
beside, I will be prison for ever in a frozen cube

229
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:42,504
- We escaped here to be free.
- Free to be idiot

230
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,504
Life on earth is full of wondrous possibilities.

231
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,703
one can do or be whatever he wants here

232
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,434
This is a dummy

233
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,039
an artificial tube, that one can speak through.

234
00:18:56,074 --> 00:19:00,137
Hello, Ariel.
How not to love the world in which so is not exist?

235
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:07,716
you  are completely unbalanced, Dad.

236
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,293
And those names that you gave us.
Ariel and Cosmo Cola.

237
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,322
where you get it? , Pathetic.

238
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:22,813
and those Earthlings pay me money for worthless stuff
that we brought with us.

239
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:24,848
This are quite valuable here

240
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:35,133
I miss Fanul so terribly dady.
please, Can I communicate with him ?

241
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,812
He would not  betraye me,
I know he would not.

242
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:41,614
Fanul is the son of the emperor SaVada

243
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,775
You're my daughter. It is not possible.

244
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,459
- but dady ...
- I am sorry, Ariel

245
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:01,430
Look how beautiful day, Ariel.

246
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,528
Being a solid  is'nt be great thing?

247
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,326
Life on earth is  fun, Ariel.

248
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,738
I only hope for some day ose be the same.

249
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:16,747
What can be less fun than this?
I want my boyfriend back.

250
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,619
I want to see Fanul and I want to go home

251
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,174
The Wind? The Wind!

252
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,012
it can't hurt you, Ariel!

253
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,661
I'm falling apart!
I am really falling apart!

254
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,343
we feel the wind!

255
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:51,821
Fanu, Fanu,why must you be the son of the emperor,
and I  be the free fighter daughter

256
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:58,167
it is just like a tragic story…b and Grokni,
two star cross bubbles.

257
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,625
But we will meet again, Fanu,
for I will come home to you.

258
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:11,921
but Until I do, I must try to hold on to
the beauty and majesty of my Zirkalon inheritance

259
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:15,086
that will keep me going

260
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:18,188
Zirkalon, Zirkalon

261
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,721
?????

262
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:23,425
Zirkalon, Zirkalon

263
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,094
deliver us soon

264
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Wind was blowing bad, Ariel.

265
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:38,731
I knew I had to save her.
So I jumped in

266
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:42,087
When I reached her, she was not afraid at all

267
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:45,819
I saw you being blown up by the wind.
- I'm windsurfing.

268
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,759
she is the most remarkable creature

269
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,646
Kathy Larson?
- Let ...

270
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,273
... the most beautiful human  on the planet, Ariel

271
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,831
But this is unthinkable. Mom.

272
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,994
Your mother was an extraordinary bubble Ariel.

273
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:14,977
And I will never foget her

274
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,252
We had many memories together,
and I will always cherish those memories

275
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:23,268
just As I always cherish
seeing your mother in you.

276
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,177
But we live here now

277
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:31,370
and I think we need to make a life here

278
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,869
We are humans now, Ariel
and we need to  live with other humans

279
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:39,757
I think Mom would not want us
to be alone and unhappy.

280
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,792
Do you?

281
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,856
Tonight , Ariel.
We visit Kathy and her children at their home.

282
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,878
we  are goning to have a wondurful time,
I guarantee.

283
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,761
But I'm not a wonderful time, Dairy.

284
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:18,266
In fact, the evening was a hideous torture
from the very start

285
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,355
I feel the wind.

286
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,581
Okay

287
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,412
it is pretty much stopped
would you like to come out?

288
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,393
No, no, no!

289
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,939
Do not threaten me, monster!

290
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:48,890
- He is just barking
- then, beat it

291
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,846
Your voice is loud and vulgar.

292
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:55,192
And you're an alien too,
are not you?

293
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,916
I need water.

294
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:10,045
- Is she alright, Koz?
- she is Just nervous.

295
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,828
can you go and check on her , Megan?

296
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,863
Sure, why not?

297
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,013
Ariel, are you Okay?

298
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,373
You are all wet.

299
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,332
I fell into the sink.

300
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:39,845
in the sink?

301
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
do you want to dry off?

302
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:54,230
Your room seems pretty culture
- Thank you.

303
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:59,439
try to wear this.

304
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,498
They are far too large

305
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:09,668
you can wear hers, if you think
that will fit you better

306
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:16,254
I will do those

307
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,867
Did you just drink the whole bottle?

308
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,577
- I did not.
- Yes you did

309
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:31,054
Why your voice like that,
you try to be funny or somthing?

310
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,311
Yes, I am trying to be funny.

311
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:41,188
- I am funny.
- You are freaking me out

312
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,898
Here, use this.
- Stop the wind, stop it!

313
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:46,609
You are incredibly neurotic about your hair,
you know that?

314
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:50,158
Everything is ok back there?

315
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,663
It's all very fine, Kathy Larson, thank you.

316
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,925
Good. Dinner is ready.

317
00:25:56,435 --> 00:26:00,038
Looks like a nice, is not it?
- It is better to remain silent.

318
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:25,723
I love food

319
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:30,534
don't you like hot dogs, Ariel?
- I do not like food.

320
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:34,680
nothing? cheese?
Sandwich is Kikiriki Butera?

321
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:36,715
Noodles?

322
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:42,906
Food is messy.
Yes mother, Ariel is on a new diet of juice.

323
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,485
At that moment, diary, I knew that
the creature called Megan Larson

324
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:48,460
will be fearful and spite

325
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,972
But at least, I was ready for it Now

326
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,977
what happen next by okantno
shocking and Gazly surprise

327
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,422
Kids, Kathy and I have somthing
would like to tell you.

328
00:26:57,457 --> 00:27:00,219
Megan, Trev... Ariel.

329
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:03,849
Kozmo and I know that we  both
come from very different worlds.

330
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:06,099
And we have not known each other  for very long

331
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:14,703
and we also understand that
things has not gone exactly and smoothly as we were like

332
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:19,566
But when two human beings
-They feel  for each other the way we do

333
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:22,583
However, we just have to follow our hearts

334
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:25,917
And even though it may seem sudden

335
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:31,620
Congratulatio kids
we were engaged

336
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:38,636
Do you want to say anything, Megan?

337
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,857
I was left speechless when my mom asked

338
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:44,442
oh Diary, I guess, I was speechless later

339
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:46,852
Mother, he is  a freak about high

340
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:49,163
Oh, Megan.
- he is

341
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:51,598
he is loud and bizarre and dresses weird.

342
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,818
As a crazy clown or something

343
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:56,926
I  like her. And I think she is an alien.

344
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:59,863
But I think it's good. Mom
to be in my room if you will.

345
00:27:59,864 --> 00:28:02,964
He's not going to be a new play mate, Trev
he will be your new father.

346
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:06,259
Stepfather, Megan,
and Ariel will be your stepsister.

347
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:07,949
let us not even go there

348
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,545
- Ariel is nice.
- She is what mother!

349
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,212
- I fall into the sink!
- May be she meant a bath.

350
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:16,760
And the thing with the hair dryer.
- What was that?

351
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,736
I think she is pretty

352
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:20,922
Yes, you are seven, Trev
you don't know any thing

353
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,824
And that affects the way she talks

354
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:27,330
Oh, ho! Oh, misery!

355
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,208
As if in a bad piece ?? em.

356
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:32,982
I think you have been silly
- No, no, I think I'm smart.

357
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:35,312
Mama, you have been silly

358
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,215
Meg, I would never marry anyone
you absolutely hate

359
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,387
but I have to tell you,

360
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,682
Cozmo and I are very happy together,

361
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:46,023
and I think this may be the real thing,

362
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,474
so I wish you at least give him a Chance.

363
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:51,596
and try to get along with Ariel too

364
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:54,308
Mama, I tried, she is  scary

365
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:59,183
I heard that she likes to sing.
may be you can make music together.

366
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,613
Fine. Forget that

367
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:06,965
Ariel is in a new place, Megan.
she is long away from home

368
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:09,399
a million light-years, Probably

369
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:12,304
Trev! ah ah

370
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:20,061
She lost her mama   few years back, did you know that?
-she did?

371
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:26,209
So far from home, she has'nt had it easy.
give her a brake

372
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:31,288
Great

373
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,764
she start school with you tomorrow

374
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,483
Did not you have a bike in the Yukon?
- Of course. I'm just out of practice.

375
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:17,057
Dear diary you some more to find?

376
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,775
I just knew what everyone was thinking

377
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,628
what that weird with Megan?
Is that Magan's friend?

378
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,825
If so, then Magan is weird too

379
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,332
And then the weirdest thing happened

380
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,679
Do not you make youself invisible?

381
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:31,896
- Probably. Shall I try to
- Too late.

382
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,602
Hey guey
- Hi Megan, who's your friend?

383
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:38,001
This is Ariel.
She's not really my friend.

384
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,579
how you gueys  know each other

385
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,859
Over on their parents. Ariel is from the Yukon.

386
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:47,062
Yukon. cool

387
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,986
So,  Ariel, you like ski?

388
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:53,496
I like bubbles, I like gas and water calms me.

389
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:56,170
Cool. -can't argue with any of those

390
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,357
I do not get this.

391
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,316
Halo! she is perfect gorgeous

392
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:08,479
-she is not! That ,
- just because you don't want her to be,
does not mean she is not, Megan

393
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,260
I hate to have her for a step-sister.

394
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:14,299
You must feel so  inferior

395
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,502
Inferior? In relation to it?

396
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:18,179
she is a total  psycho!

397
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:21,931
she can't even ride a bike
with  training wheels

398
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:25,120
May be she does not want to.
May be she is subversive.

399
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:29,213
like, she fell on his face. How is this subversive?

400
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:33,129
The way she dresses. so original, so fresh

401
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,188
This is not original.
My aunt Ana is also dress like that for years.

402
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:39,774
I will tell you one thing
Kater think  she would not be cool.

403
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,809
Kater thinks I'm cool.

404
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:45,397
Megan, as your friend
that is really pathetic.

405
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:50,298
- I'm going to talk to her.
- why?

406
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,643
she is like, a visionary.

407
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:57,287
Ariel, why you put on many  layers?

408
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:59,158
I would like to protect my Assets

409
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,264
that intense

410
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,299
I can not believe it!

411
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:10,795
And what is the volume of swiming the pool?

412
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,173
Megan?
- Ha?

413
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:16,741
The volume of the pool?

414
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:21,992
Oh,...Midium

415
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,326
can any one else answer the question

416
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,592
Ariel.

417
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:32,969
I assume the issue visualize trapezoidal size of the swimming pools,
Mr. Sing?

418
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:37,738
And I assume also the depth of the pool measured in meters,
the volume of fluid measured in kiloliters ...

419
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:42,606
I asume,  if this is the case, and the water is not

420
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,440
higher than 32c, the answer is 13.34 kiloliters.

421
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:52,594
Ariel that is correct

422
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:58,264
I heard that her IQ, like, a 300

423
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:00,227
I heard that is dating, Prince wiliam

424
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,578
I heard she tutor Bill Gates.

425
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,959
They do not understand, Mishel.
Ariel is not any of those thngs

426
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,849
she is like ...  an alien from another planet.

427
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,506
Yes, the planet on which all great.
- No, Planet of weirds

428
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:16,597
She feers from wind, Mishel.

429
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:20,319
Well,  wind is scary. In a way.

430
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:22,354
I can not believe you said that.

431
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:27,261
Unbelievable, her first day,
and already sits on popular table

432
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,524
Megan! Megan!

433
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,336
Heather Hartman  called you

434
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:36,117
Go. Go!

435
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:40,764
I love how you  protect your essence , Ariel.

436
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,694
Definitely. And you're totally try to cover up
shatter the myth of in  current bike.

437
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,132
Ariel told us that you will be a Step-sister, Megan

438
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,086
That it is Not an issue

439
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:53,149
You are still Lucky

440
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,842
I think that Ariel is such a total package

441
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:59,661
she is wise, deep and mature.

442
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,039
Plus she will be great  down here

443
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:06,732
you  knows what Conditioner she used, Magen?

444
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:10,285
as far as I know, she just falls into the sink.

445
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,992
Falls into the sink.
We should try that

446
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:18,357
You can sit  to our table too, Megan.

447
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,384
if you ... ? Why?.

448
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:22,385
Thanks, your majesty

449
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,561
Wonder if there's a sink in here that could fall.

450
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:29,943
you are such a revolutionary!

451
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:33,928
I am nausea of this.

452
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:46,439
She is like totally Chaleging Albert Einstein.
- She is Albert.

453
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,565
chill Megan.

454
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,465
This is pathetic.

455
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,385
Oh, Fanu. How I miss you darling

456
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,224
Ariel, you talking to that bubble, Ariel?

457
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:38,655
The bubble, as it condescendingly call it,
is the love of my life ??.

458
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:45,127
How poetic she is

459
00:35:45,162 --> 00:35:48,024
she is not a poet, she is pathetic!

460
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:52,617
yes I know! Get to class

461
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:05,023
Diary, it is becoming nightmare
when  care of biblical proportions.

462
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:08,816
By the seventh period, Ariel could set her hair in fire
and run around

463
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,488
like a chicken, and people would
have thought that she was cool.

464
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:15,562
Actually, she would not do that all
But, you get the idea, Diary.

465
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,941
But the worst part was
that the worst is yet to come.

466
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:22,843
Mom, I do not want to teach Ariel how to windsurfing.

467
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,768
it is something about share

468
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,658
I do not want to share with her.
- Megan! -Mom!

469
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,086
Megan! -Mama!
- Megan! -Mama!

470
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,277
Megan!

471
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:30,936
this could go on for hours, you know

472
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,578
Do not you try a bit more, honey?

473
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:35,391
But, Mom, I can't be better.

474
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,836
and Ariel, she is terrified from the wind

475
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:39,871
How will you teach that to windsurfing?

476
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:42,886
she does seem to hop on that thing

477
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,035
I do not think you behave like a mature, Meg.
I am not?

478
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,464
Mom,  you are the one who is
marrying to a Complete stranger.

479
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,303
Koz is no stranger, Meg.

480
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:55,446
In fact, in some way, I feel I know him
Better than I have known anyone anywhere.

481
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:58,017
do you know, the term, sole mate, honey

482
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:59,980
Mom. OK, I will make you a deal

483
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,090
I promise that I will take Ariel out to the water,

484
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,125
and you  promise  that you will never
choose that word again.

485
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:06,132
Deal

486
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,280
I am just going  like a lot there
and you are going to come there afterward?

487
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,978
What?
- I feel the wind.

488
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:20,358
you are going have to pass that

489
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:39,168
And then it happened.

490
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:47,161
From that moment on, Diary, it was war.

491
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:02,200
Dear Diary, just when
I thought it could not get any worse

492
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:05,473
I learned the word high school means

493
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:10,560
Do not yiu become  such invisible?
- Probably. Shall I try

494
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:12,123
Too late.

495
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,927
Hey, Gueys.
- Hi Megan, who's your friend?

496
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:18,841
This is Ariel. She's not really my friend.

497
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:22,295
At feeding time, I was invited to chair

498
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:24,925
which seems that great importance for humans

499
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,177
At this table Conversation
was  patheticaly empty and meaningless

500
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:32,538
Everyone thinks she is like a Totally enigma, Ariel

501
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:35,364
But I know what you really are.

502
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,032
You do

503
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:41,394
You are a making a cosmetic representative,  Right?

504
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,528
Megan! Megan!

505
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,940
I love the way you put your essence, Ariel.

506
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:51,848
Definitely. And you're totally try to cover up
how like mundane by  ???.

507
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:55,245
since you  two are going to be step-sisters, Megan

508
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,368
-Well, That it  Not really a sure thing
- You're so lucky.

509
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,877
I bet that Megan so jealous of you.

510
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:05,070
that she must be just like you

511
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:07,171
why would anyone want that

512
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:16,193
Both are so empty.
- Horrible! -Monster!

513
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,506
Yukon is the law!

514
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,374
It was cool, man!

515
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,629
she is such a revolutionary!

516
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:36,935
you are going to have to pass that

517
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:52,675
When we arrived in the afternoon on the beach in ??,

518
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:54,253
I have had enough

519
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:58,941
I was afraid for myself, yes, but if can walk
Like Megan Larson.

520
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,976
would not the wind  destroye her?

521
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:03,226
watching her going back in the water,

522
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,461
I felt myself being fall apart again.

523
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:24,684
I was just about to go  rescueing Megan Larson ...

524
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,525
Hey! Ariel?

525
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,608
I am Kater.

526
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:42,735
you know,   your clothes  are wet?

527
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:45,734
I intended to rescue Megan Larson.

528
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:48,216
Oh, she is fine.

529
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:54,131
What's your interest in disgusting
when ?? na bag inhabited, Which?

530
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,423
Oh, Oh, Ariel. that a way harsh

531
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,743
I mean, I thik it is disgusting.

532
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:02,831
Actually I think it is very un-disguting.

533
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:05,600
because you are having bag you can do.

534
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:09,508
OK, yeah, I guess I do.  what is the alternative?

535
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:13,253
I wish I be gas.
pure gas.

536
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:17,718
you'r kind of weird ambition.

537
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:19,753
So, you like  ...

538
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,894
you want to be my girlfriend?

539
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:25,323
I found you are a pathos  and shallow,

540
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,085
Okay, may be I am all those things

541
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,730
Shallow definitely

542
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:33,704
pathos? ... I do not know what that means,

543
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:35,695
but surely I could be like that too,

544
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:40,085
Now listen ,  pathos and shallow people have feelings too.

545
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:45,977
check it out? it is a Party!
Hey, Megan, how is your life?

546
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:48,219
Fine. Come on Ariel.

547
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:50,219

548
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:53,082

550

See you, Ariel.

551
00:41:57,886 --> 00:41:59,626
I just want you to know that I am awsome, Ariel

552
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,952
Pardon me?

553
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:05,218
you may think you fool everybody else,
but you are not fooling me.

554
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:07,128
I think that what you are doing

555
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:08,755
I do not understand.

556
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:11,154
Do ?? la're here with their juice,

557
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:15,160
The way you are talking in your wack songs
and you think they hear you over

558
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:18,104
you miss apprehend me, Megan Larson.

559
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:21,803
No, I think I apprehend you very well, Ariel Cola.

560
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,522
you'r like a total bad seen

561
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:28,445
why you wish my distruction, evil Megan Larson, why?

562
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:34,830
Because  since you come in,
you have taken every thing I want.

563
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:36,920
Well, fine, have it.

564
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,920
you Leave Kater alone.

565
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:41,070
I do not want Kater

566
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:44,427
I do not want any of this .
I Only want to go home.

567
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,428
what?

568
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:51,353
I  just want to go home.
- you do?

569
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:54,369
I'd give anything to leave this horrible place

570
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:57,080
with its strange creatures and solid objects

571
00:42:57,115 --> 00:43:00,054
and Talents disregarding

572
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:02,961
You  like us because we are not good to bubbles?

573
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:05,391
Only  I wish to go home.

574
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:10,185
To see Fanula. The gases

575
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,345
So, you do not want  your dad to marry my mom?
- Of course not.

576
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,104
And in that moment, Diary,

577
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:21,192
strange and holy bond was born
between evil Megan Larson and I.

578
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:24,323
When Dad and Kathy Larson went out this evening,

579
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,881
evil Megan Larson and I
found her to watch her

580
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,545
OK, Trev, it's time for bed.

581
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:40,829
But Megan, it is not even six yet?
and I even had not dinner.

582
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:45,443
Enjoy!

583
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,383
Ok, take it with you

584
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:53,579
Ok, first all we have to do
is to convince parents that we are best friends.

585
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,822
I do not understand this, evil Megan Larson.

586
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:59,435
How the two creatures that dislike each other as we do
can possibly convince others that we are otherwise?

587
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,560
there is a thing we have in US
may be you have hear of it, Ariel

588
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:04,720
It's called acting.

589
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:13,803
That night, Megan Larson is revealed as the true evil architect

590
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:16,551
like "In love and war, she said

591
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:21,425
Sometimes the bubbel seem brightest
a sense of thought I respond it

592
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,337
Starring! - she did not understand the reference

593
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:28,554
Well it's all right

594
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:32,436
It is alright to be me

595
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:35,024
In a solid or gas

596
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:37,795
liquid or stone

597
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:43,026
Friendship my heart you never alone

598
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:48,945
this actualy was not bad
-I am surprise I like it as well

599
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:53,833
We had an Extremely bad time together, dady,
and now we are the best of friends.

600
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:55,800
We can not wait to be Step-sisters, mom.

601
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:57,790
He samples extreme cookies, Dad.

602
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:01,595
And now that we've become so close,
she told me the sweetest thing.

603
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,847
Koz thinks you're the funniest and the most refreshing
the simplest girl he ever met

604
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:10,847
and all he has talk about,
is how life privilege, bumbling, and intangible.

605
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,820
All this in the best sense, of course.

606
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:14,821
Is not that sweet?

607
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,466
And so our evil plan began.

608
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:25,142
without tell roasted toe
and one salad

609
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:27,177
Enjoy it!

610
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:37,203
And his flight from Hijavate and its wondureful migration
and the end of his adveture

611
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,699
Now chapter 16th

612
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:48,459
On the shore of GIEI gum,
on the Dune Nagov Woodoo,

613
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:01,838
Kozmo, What are you doing?

614
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,058
Just Spider on the wall there.

615
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:07,816
But I just in the middle of my poem
- But the beetle, Kathy, look!

616
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:11,093
It's time for karate

617
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,759
Pumba, I think you're on to something.

618
00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:15,832
I will say.

619
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,425
Being popularity is the best reason to do anything

620
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,634
If you become an elephant, everyone would love you

621
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:25,159
Are you making fun of me, Koz?

622
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,458
Of Course not, Kathy

623
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:31,414
If you think  I am such an air head
Why did you ask me to marry me?

624
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:34,187
How could you ask such a question, Kathy

625
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:39,279
I love how fun and free you are,
and I like the way you look

626
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:42,324
I am fun, free and cute?

627
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,698
what about my mind, Cosmo?

628
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,978
I have never seen your mind, Kathy.

629
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,201
It is very unkind thing to say ... Cosmo Cola

630
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:52,610
Why you acting like this, Kathy?

631
00:46:52,611 --> 00:46:56,896
- Like What?
- Like shrill stray gas in day time TV show.

632
00:46:56,931 --> 00:47:00,925
you behave
Like inconsiderate snob, Kozmo.

633
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,581
I had no idea that you can be such a termagant

634
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:05,714
term...what?

635
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,926
termagant-loud, obnoxious woman

636
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:11,347
This thing is over.

637
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:13,750
Kathy!

638
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:14,818
Kathy!

639
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,819
Kathy!

640
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:25,114
what you two are Doing?

641
00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:29,518
Nothing

642
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:32,310
Of course, as Megan said,

643
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:35,314
one fight was not enough to end their relationship
entirely

644
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:39,132
But, the next move was mine.

645
00:47:40,122 --> 00:47:43,864
As you know, dady, Megan and I , now, are best friends.

646
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:46,442
We so long to become stepsisters.

647
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:50,177
And in this spirit,
she has shared her confidence with me.

648
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,947
Gives?

649
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:58,319
you see dady, Kathy only acted the way she did,
because she was testing Cozmo.

650
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:02,466
She knows he can be fun, like a carefree child,

651
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,228
she need to know that he can be a real man, dady

652
00:48:05,263 --> 00:48:08,728
And on time she
wants him to be happy, right?

653
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:12,130
Perfect one. Let's see how it is working

654
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:15,418
You look great tonight, little lady

655
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:18,271
Keep calling me little lady, Coz

656
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:21,562
Don not you worry a bit about that, mam

657
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:23,271
I'll take care of everything.

658
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:26,693
Except on Sundays, when
I will be watching football on TV all day

659
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:29,080
what on earth, you are talking about?

660
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:34,010
are you looking to my woman, fellow ?
- Koz?
- No, sir.

661
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,555
well do not. And fix me a steak, son.

662
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,512
fix what you got . Raw

663
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,914
We do not have steak, sir.

664
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:46,600
You do not have steak
- This is a pizzeria, sir.

665
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:52,433
Bring me the mainly  pizza you got!

666
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:59,571
and put up gummy beans on it

667
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:02,331
What is up with mamy and Koz?

668
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:04,452
They have a grown up talk

669
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:07,046
How come you guys look so happy then?

670
00:49:07,081 --> 00:49:09,081
Go play, Trev.

671
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:17,732
am I very stron, dummy?

672
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,733
Yes, very.

673
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,681
Am I dependable, dummy?

674
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:25,887
Absolutely!

675
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,715
then let us take

676
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:46,238
Here in US we have an expression:
Mission accomplished

677
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:51,298
In the Yukon we say
Gaseous matter expanded

678
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,242
Well.  ... Gaseous matter expanded, then

679
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,388
Your plan is a wise, Megan.
- I could not have done it without you, Ariel

680
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:02,545
may be that I still wrong ?? well understood.

681
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,627
Now Kater will understand it

682
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:08,021
may be I misapprehended you as well

683
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:14,530
This was strange, diary
Megan and I were sharing a pleasant conversation.

684
00:50:14,565 --> 00:50:17,262
We just mamanage to make our parents hate each other,

685
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:21,140
and now we are starting to like,
or at least tolerate each other

686
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:24,987
I only acted that way because
I thought you want me to

687
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:28,540
You mean so much for me

688
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:31,716
And I thought that you want me
to act the way I did

689
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,751
Who said that?

690
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,358
oops! This is not good.

691
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:48,330
I thought if Cosmo like that, and you want him
like this ... we can all working somthing out

692
00:50:48,365 --> 00:50:51,225
This is the most rediculous answer I've ever heard, Megan

693
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,461
Give me a few minutes.
I'll make it more convincing.

694
00:50:55,027 --> 00:50:57,027
Ariel?

695
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:01,450
Oh, Shame on my name

696
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:05,814
I disgraced myself and my family
for their selfish reasons.

697
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,526
No, Ariel. Ariel, do not cry.

698
00:51:08,561 --> 00:51:10,452
We know this is not easy.

699
00:51:10,453 --> 00:51:13,285
- We understand, do not we, Koz?
- Of course we do

700
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:17,246
I guess it is not easy to be an alien.

701
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:28,301
I can not do this no longer

702
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:32,367
I am sorry father

703
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:39,118
My darling Fanu,
please come and save me from this horrible place

704
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:41,892
I feel expectedly

705
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:44,002
Yours, Soviza.

706
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:51,232
please whatever you do, Fanu, you must not tell your father
the address about where we are.

707
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,728
Plan A  was totally failure, Diary, but I definitly have a plan B.

708
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:11,418
Sometimes I wonder for a second
if I am doing the right thing here

709
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:14,628
I mean, Koz is a complete freak of nature,

710
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,692
but he can't gross on you

711
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:22,340
A Ariel? It is really not her fault
if everybody mistake her weirdness for coolness

712
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,432
And yet ...

713
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:27,675
all we have to do  is to make them
fall in love with somebody else.

714
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,575
Like, my mom, she was totaly in love with my dad.

715
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:33,005
Well, not quite  love exactly

716
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,348
actually, I think even they do not like each other much,
but they were married for 10 years.

717
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,659
And have me and Trev.
- since they ended their relationship?

718
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,737
horried -Jezivo. -grotesque  -Loser!

719
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:50,803
What about your dad?
Is anybody he met who is even like your mom?

720
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:57,103
Your mother, Kathy larson, nost and sweetness
that reminds me of my mother.

721
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:01,548
In this sense, my father enjoy the company

722
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:05,962
is that mater, my mother seems  get along
better with your dad, than she is ever with my.

723
00:53:05,997 --> 00:53:08,189
I think they  laugh a lot more

724
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:10,671
Yes, they do. And Trev loves your dad.

725
00:53:10,706 --> 00:53:12,529
And father loves Trev.

726
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,038
but anyway ...

727
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:17,610
there is one individual

728
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,873
Do you know the spiritual Serena Su?

729
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:22,676
Is she thinks,  she is like Napoleon or something?

730
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:26,261
Well, she is quit this guey, nevertheless

731
00:53:26,296 --> 00:53:28,279
but her manners were calm and harmonious

732
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,084
That is right. Here's the plan.

733
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,163
We'll tell our parents that we throw a party.

734
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,758
Do they make amends.

735
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:37,123
Parents obo ?? happen when they want ?? that they make up ??.

736
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:40,184
I'll call all and there. A chemistry will take over

737
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:43,443
My Father will meet Trev this weekend. it is Perfect

738
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:47,171
I do not know how to tell you this

739
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:50,905
You were right, Trev. Koz is an alien.

740
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,579
I know that.
- he is bad alien.

741
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,561
He is not.

742
00:53:56,562 --> 00:54:00,784
Trevor, when  have I ever lie to you?

743
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:03,035
Every day.

744
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,442
Well, this time, and I am not

745
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:08,710
Kozmo is one seriously scary alien.

746
00:54:11,572 --> 00:54:14,192
I did not wanna have to say this, but ...

747
00:54:14,227 --> 00:54:16,339
Look

748
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,416
- My plane ...
- My plan to take over the world. by Cosmo Cola

749
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:25,471
Chapter 1. Eat Trevor.

750
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:32,924
What I need to do?

751
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:40,130
Mom and Koz will be back
in a couple of minutes,

752
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:42,280
and my dad and Serena Su will be here too

753
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:51,698
What are you doing?

754
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,393
Ariel, what are you doing?

755
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:57,834
I am preparing food.

756
00:54:57,835 --> 00:55:01,996
We put the food in different bawls?
they are actually different parts of the meal

757
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:04,311
Do not they all end up in the intestinal tract?

758
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,882
Yes, yes, but ...

759
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:14,379
Soon I will get insane

760
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:22,377
I'm Serena Su. You must be Megan.

761
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:24,650
Hi. Come on in

762
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:30,041
Ariel!

763
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,023
My sweet! its been day

764
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,598
Where's your father?

765
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:40,685
Can I come out now?
- Go back to bed, Trevor

766
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:45,438
what is that lady?
- She is a bad alien too

767
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:47,935
Go back to your room, okay?

768
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:53,286
Borky, you were Mickey Mantle.
The famous baseball player.

769
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:55,972
if you two  could play a game together.

770
00:55:56,007 --> 00:56:00,609
Oh, my! It was wonderful! It's sick!

771
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:04,139
I rode underneath the boards.
- you really did

772
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:07,949
Wow, look at that! Great job girls.

773
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:10,962
dady, look who is joining us
our neighbor, Serena Su.

774
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:12,902
what is the news, Serena Su?

775
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:16,083
you possess such a savage molest, Mr. Cola

776
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:21,858
and yet there is in a child crying out
for tenderness and Compasion

777
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,991
actually, this is my stomach.
I must be hungry.

778
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,840
Hello! I'm Kathy Larson.

779
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:34,009
Kathy, you were a nimbus of mistrust.

780
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,699
That's right, I got it in the market ?? nom center.

781
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:40,584
Humor can be effective defense, can not you, Katie?

782
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:44,135
Only oblivion people who have no sense of humor.

783
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:50,399
would you like thing to drink , Serena?
- I will have a chay(Tea)

784
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:55,955
Megan. Ariel.

785
00:56:55,956 --> 00:56:58,182

786
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:00,299
I will get it

787
00:57:03,195 --> 00:57:05,200
- Dady!
-Hi

788
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,378
What are you doing here today?

789
00:57:07,413 --> 00:57:09,001
- Megan told me to come today
- she did?

790
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:12,379
I thought dady might want a drink before dinner

791
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:15,258
About that,Honey
I still have some work to do

792
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:18,707
Is it OK to pick you up, gueys
and bring you back to my place?

793
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:22,712
Can I bring my stuff home and work
while you watch TV.?  what you say?

794
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:26,082
But, we can not dady... because ... Trev ...is  sick.

795
00:57:26,117 --> 00:57:29,761
Really, he is. Come, I'll show you.

796
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,436
Elizabeth, I will come to join you

797
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:50,199
Elizabeth! - Fred Sanford! Excellent!

798
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:52,936
Elizabeth!
-Trevore?

799
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:02,446
If you and mom stay together,
can I still  play with Koz,sometimes?

800
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,561
Even he is bad?

801
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,454
Who is Koz?

802
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:10,287
Dad, are you sure you want stay here for dinner,
as long as you're already here?

803
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:20,311
Things were not going exactly as I planned,
and in the kitchen , Diary, it was even worst

804
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:28,856
I must tell you Serena Su, that many if not all of your ideas
are highly incredible, if not impossible.

805
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:31,520
you are Blocking the trauma, Kozmo.

806
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,555
You did die in civil war.

807
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,390
I promise you I did not

808
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,002
You realy did, and you were a raccoon in another life.

809
00:58:38,037 --> 00:58:40,505
Where did you come up with these things?

810
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:45,185
I am highly sensitive, and I am also passionate

811
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,464
I know what is going to happen.

812
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:50,103
- Really?
- Yes, it is a great ...

813
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:53,910
I do not know what you Kids are up to, Megan

814
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:56,795
but if you want to come to my house for dinner,
We better get going

815
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,830
I've already lost an hour.

816
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:00,804
Then you will now be 7.23?

817
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:02,609
Very funny

818
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,164
- Who are you?
-Kozmo Cola, Cathy's fiance.

819
00:59:08,923 --> 00:59:10,907
When did this happen?

820
00:59:10,908 --> 00:59:13,067
It was kind of sudden.

821
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:15,821
Kozmo and I met shortly after he and Ariel

822
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:18,010
his daughter, moved from the Yukon.

823
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:21,740
Yukon. Population: low (it always ??)

824
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:23,887
No one lives in the Yukon.

825
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:29,678
Anyway, we were very happy together
and we decided to get married.

826
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,573
I need an anti-acid

827
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:38,444
It is not an antiacid you need, but it is harmony.

828
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:42,230
- What?
- Your soul is that of a warriors.

829
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:44,238
at least to be calm and not excited.

830
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,106
You are very perceptive

831
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:50,691
I ... I'm Serena Su.

832
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:54,131
Fred Larson.

833
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:57,195
It time

834
00:59:59,507 --> 01:00:01,984
Mom, can you can sit next to dad.

835
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,681
And Koz and Serena can sit here,
right next to each other.

836
01:00:04,716 --> 01:00:07,862
You know, for a nice mix and all

837
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:10,616
Trevor, not there.

838
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:12,855
You give, and you give, and you give, Fred

839
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,457
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

840
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:19,728
And what you ask in turn?
A little respect, a little consideration

841
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,194
It's true.

842
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,390
Well, girls, this looks ...

843
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,425
Very inventive.

844
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:34,202
They used my recipe.

845
01:00:35,561 --> 01:00:37,624
Perhaps, I have to clean yous aura.

846
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:40,078
I have not anyone cleanes my aura before.

847
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:42,640
You must let do a psychic reading ...

848
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:44,242
This had to stop, Diary

849
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:46,860
That was right on the verge of falling in love with the Blair witch.

850
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:50,987
That was the first thing I could think of

851
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:54,152
I know, I know. It seems totally mean

852
01:00:54,187 --> 01:00:57,847
But in that moment all I think of is
to make these people mad to each other ...

853
01:00:57,882 --> 01:00:59,882
But even that did not work.

854
01:01:02,752 --> 01:01:05,353
at last! The Perfect moment!

855
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:12,564
Have I ever used the word "debacle", before, Diary?

856
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,819
But this was definitely one,
may be it was a fiasco.

857
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,227
Whatever it was, it was not good.

858
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,960
I looked over at Ariel, and she looked super strange

859
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:25,939
it was like she is falling apart, or something

860
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,369
And when I followed her,
the weirdest thing that ever happened.

861
01:01:30,404 --> 01:01:32,573
I'm not even sure how to describe it

862
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:59,981
She has no body! She has no body! It is a snowball!

863
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,982
What are you talking about, Megan?

864
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:06,257
- Get away from me!
- Megan, What is wrong with you?

865
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:09,095
What is wrong with you gueys?
Did not you hear me? she's an alien!

866
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,053
May be you feel like an alien sometimes, Megan?

867
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:22,341
I've seen this reaction.before.
it is highly uncommon

868
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:25,120
Many children fear changes of this magnitude.

869
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:28,722
Megan got to used to this current little arrangement

870
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:31,178
not sharing you, at least for another parent.

871
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:36,048
With your intending marriage,
that balance will be upset

872
01:02:37,442 --> 01:02:41,906
This alien's story is merely an attempt
to prevent that from happening

873
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,961
then you think it is allright
to get through with the wedding?

874
01:02:44,996 --> 01:02:49,792
As long as that is what you want,
I think it is imperative

875
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:52,127
for her sake

876
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:59,177
- How I look?
- Great.

877
01:03:00,534 --> 01:03:05,371
This all will work out, Meg. I promise.
- Mom, he's an alien

878
01:03:05,372 --> 01:03:08,809
I know, But after I marry him,
he will become a citizen.

879
01:03:08,844 --> 01:03:11,193
it is not what I meant.

880
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,170
I know.

881
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:20,901
Is there not anything I can do to stop you from marrying Koz?

882
01:03:20,936 --> 01:03:25,189
You promised that it would not marry him,
if I do not like him

883
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:29,440
Megan, I have thought about this long and hard

884
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:31,515
and I talked to the doctor about it.

885
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,652
If I for one second thought, that your fears are justified ...

886
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:41,792
I know he is different. But this makes him so wonderful

887
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:44,933
Kozmo makes me so happy, honey

888
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:48,718
I know that this marriage
is going to make this family happy too.

889
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:54,517
- do you think I'm going crazy?
- We're all a little crazy around here.

890
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:56,822
That's make us so special.

891
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,982
I love you, sweety
- I love you too, Mom.

892
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:05,144
Everything is going to work out just fine

893
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,078
Thank you.

894
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,281
Deadlines. Hi, du ?? o.

895
01:04:19,316 --> 01:04:22,738
Megan, you look beautiful.

896
01:04:22,773 --> 01:04:25,661
Yes, your beautiful daughters, you are more lovely
than you cornflakes in root beer

897
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:27,836
Thanks ... I guess.

898
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:30,442
Where is Ariel?

899
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:32,892
should be coming shortly.

900
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:36,595
She need a moment of meditation, to ... collect herself.

901
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,479
Or may be she get back to the sink.

902
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:45,938
Goodbye Zirkalone. Goodbye Fanu.

903
01:04:49,062 --> 01:04:51,062
Goodbye Soviza.

904
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,252
Hello Soviza.

905
01:04:56,103 --> 01:05:00,168
- Is it possible? You are...?
- It is I, Fanul.

906
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,627
Sleep well ?? I ?? grateful to see you!

907
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:05,988
Soviza, such physical proximity is repulsive me.

908
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,340
I am sorry, Fanu

909
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:13,714
We need to go quickly.

910
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:16,672
Dad or Cosmo Cola, as he called here

911
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:20,791
will that commits marriage with Earth woman, Kathy Larson,
in less than an hour.

912
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:24,041
Your father is very dangerous to me, Soviza.

913
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:26,656
He wants a change

914
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:28,916
What is that attitude about the changes, Fanul?

915
01:05:28,951 --> 01:05:32,158
Change is bad . Things must remain exactly as they are.

916
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,574
But change is not always bad, Emperor.

917
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:37,881
Soviza.

918
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,820
already, This planet has poisoned her mind.

919
01:05:42,082 --> 01:05:44,901
 He could be frozen solid, Soviza

920
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:48,770
It can be reversed ,
but only in my pleasure.

921
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:53,668
You would not want your father
to be frozen forever, would you Sovisa?

922
01:05:54,572 --> 01:05:58,777
- No.
- Good, then you will lead us to him.

923
01:05:58,812 --> 01:06:01,780
Would not you?

924
01:06:01,815 --> 01:06:05,601
Is toilet busy? Oh, sorry.

925
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:07,794
Wrong  room.

926
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,829
Hello, Serena Su.

927
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:15,821
Ariel, my sweet. Who are your charming friends ?

928
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:20,696
This is Mike. His father Doug.

929
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,748
They come from Jukon.

930
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:26,016
It's my pleasure.
- You will lead us to Kozmo Kola.

931
01:06:26,017 --> 01:06:28,210
There is no need to be so tense.

932
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:31,250
Would you like a nice relaxing gum?

933
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:33,285
Be silent!

934
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:38,491
What annoying creatures these Earthlings are

935
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:43,582
Perhaps you're right.
Perhaps that we are annoying creatures ...

936
01:06:43,617 --> 01:06:45,327
We?

937
01:06:45,328 --> 01:06:50,813
They ... But Emperor, there more to it than that.

938
01:06:50,848 --> 01:06:54,709
These are earth friendly and wrath,

939
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,563
and their bravery will surprise you,
if you gave them a chance.

940
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:05,471
Sometimes one must be cruel, in order to be kind, Soviza.

941
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:07,664
Fanu, guard the prisoner

942
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:10,370
I shall find Kozmo Cola.

943
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:21,289
- Fanul, please.
- He's my father, Sovisa. I have no choice.

944
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:25,092
I wish I did

945
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:30,968
The intruders, alert! Intruders!

946
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:34,680
Execuse me, Where you want me to put 
the case of the root beer?

947
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:37,233
I'll assist you with beverage.

948
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:40,025
Come on, young Trevor.  we will banish the villains Together.

949
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:44,215
Megan, can you find Ariel?
We are about to start

950
01:07:46,189 --> 01:07:51,227
In a minute.
- Megan, if you see Mrs Kola,tell her it's a lovely day for a wedding.

951
01:07:51,262 --> 01:07:53,910
Of course, I'd rather be windsurfing.

952
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:54,871
No doubt.

953
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:57,380
Megan, I'm serious. Go and find your sister.

954
01:07:57,415 --> 01:08:00,448
- She's not my sister.
- I'll go get her. Where is she?

955
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:02,949
Come on.

956
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:18,440
I that blackberry?

957
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:22,356
I mean, I've never seen such brown color before

958
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:28,613
Ah?

959
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:35,719
What is that?

960
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:39,002
This is Serena Su.

961
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:43,265
What are you talking about

962
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,404
Arijel, what is going on? who is he?

963
01:08:55,306 --> 01:08:59,093
He is Fanu.
- Your boyfriend, Fanu?

964
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:05,808
He and his father, Emperor SaVad 
have come for my father.

965
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:09,692
I knew this guy was not invited. 
But ?? this will put your father?

966
01:09:10,757 --> 01:09:13,457
My father was a freedom fighter in the Zirkalonu.

967
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:16,803
About...? - Zirkalon?
- a whole planet.

968
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,951
Your were entirely correct on all, Megan

969
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:25,161
My father and I are aliens.

970
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:33,024
Why did you come here? 
Just to make me feel inferior or what?

971
01:09:33,059 --> 01:09:36,540
We came to escape from political repression in Zirkalon

972
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:40,872
We stayed because my father fell in love with your mother.

973
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:44,388
Is that it?

974
01:09:44,462 --> 01:09:47,835
You got stuck in a whole new planet 
where you do not know anyone?

975
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:50,599
that is bogus

976
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,129
I changed my master, and I upset the nest 6 months.

977
01:09:57,945 --> 01:10:00,364
I guess I no much to help, right?

978
01:10:01,511 --> 01:10:05,691
- You can help me now, Megan 
- Well, I can try

979
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:11,773
- What? 
- I was quit Wrong about you.

980
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:14,697
You are not cruel, heartless being I was imagined 

981
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:18,023
You're actually incredibly brave and fearless 

982
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:23,075
- You have my feeligs 
- You are compare to me.

983
01:10:24,406 --> 01:10:27,241
I thought, and you proclaimed dictator, dude?

984
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:30,053
Watch out on this, Fanul.

985
01:10:30,088 --> 01:10:33,086
- Yes, father. 
- You are Extremely rude, you know that?

986
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:35,282
Silent, fear!

987
01:10:39,727 --> 01:10:42,593
Man, seriously, I should improve my vocabulary

988
01:10:42,628 --> 01:10:47,121
Check it out, it is a Party! 
Hey, Megan, Ariel.

989
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,514
Now, that is pretty unusual.

990
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:56,047
Thank you much, I love it.

991
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:04,414
Hi. Can I help you?

992
01:11:04,415 --> 01:11:07,368
I am looking for the one called Cosmo Cola.

993
01:11:07,403 --> 01:11:09,306
I think it is out.

994
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:13,876
If you see him, would you tell him 
that we will start in ... ... 15 minutes ...

995
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:21,546
you have taking me far from home.

996
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:23,714
Are you ready to pay for your crimes?

997
01:11:25,632 --> 01:11:28,398
- SaVada? 
- Emperor SaVada, to you

998
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,235
You will come with me, now.

999
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:40,097
Oh, I've never seen such grap before
you want to Trade?

1000
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:46,436
Trevor, this is my friend, Mr. Savada

1001
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:52,301
- He loves to play hide and seel 
- cool, me too.

1002
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:56,525
Let us count to a hundred,
and I will come find you

1003
01:11:56,747 --> 01:12:00,626
- Ok, but no cheating.
- I promise.

1004
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,700
after you

1005
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,240
Fanu, please

1006
01:12:12,592 --> 01:12:14,888
I can not, Soviza. I'm sorry.

1007
01:12:14,923 --> 01:12:17,034
not to weep, just Listen, I am here now.

1008
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:20,184
Okey! What?

1009
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:22,849
this full scan on you , Megan.

1010
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
Mint?

1011
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,241
- It is strong.
- Exactly.

1012
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:46,065
you know what, my father like Megan 
and Ariel the other head

1013
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,588
I hear you, brother.

1014
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,791
you see that Betty and Veronica. [Cartoons]

1015
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:53,577
that is free of choice. Do not, my brother, give 5!

1016
01:12:55,403 --> 01:12:57,403
never mind, man

1017
01:12:58,094 --> 01:13:01,119
how did you decide yet, to end this traitorous captivity

1018
01:13:01,154 --> 01:13:04,425
may be, but you got to work with me here

1019
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:12,537
So Fanul, you must have a lot of powerful
back in your home planet

1020
01:13:12,572 --> 01:13:15,080
You know, being the son of the emperor and all

1021
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:17,457
Well, it is a great honor to do my father speeding

1022
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:20,217
and time consuming.

1023
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:22,328
don't you have any time for fun?

1024
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:25,819
Well, my duty come first ,
but sometimes I was allowed to float.

1025
01:13:25,854 --> 01:13:29,271
It is most enjoyable.
- And how do you do that?

1026
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:33,236
First you need to be a bubble.
- I don't think I can do that.

1027
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:35,138
So it is kind of a  limitations?

1028
01:13:35,139 --> 01:13:37,994
around here we have a lot of free time,
- do not we kater?

1029
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:40,029
Oh yes!
-  a lot of choices.

1030
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,901
Like windsurfing, skateboarding ...

1031
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:47,825
O, o, Fanul, you like jump into the river
and floating down into the ?

1032
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,219
Now that's extreme! 
- It sounds like a good recreation.

1033
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,627
Definitely. We recreate constantly.

1034
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:56,480
That is the cool thing about earth.

1035
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,417
Like last year for instance, I totally glided down the mountain.

1036
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:06,513
I think mostly I was falling, but it was great.

1037
01:14:06,548 --> 01:14:08,385
I was all ... about that!

1038
01:14:08,386 --> 01:14:10,787
And  what other things we do, Kater ?

1039
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,469
Yes, what other choices do we have here?

1040
01:14:13,504 --> 01:14:20,510
Oh, yes, we have 18 different flavors potato chips, 
all of which are excellent.

1041
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:23,870
Except yogurt, it is kind of weird

1042
01:14:24,902 --> 01:14:28,733
You see, Fanul, on this planet is all about freedom of choice.

1043
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:32,072
Can you imagine, people here are free to fall down the mountain,

1044
01:14:32,107 --> 01:14:35,143
to eat chips of various flavors 
to be emptied and vegetables ?? not.

1045
01:14:35,178 --> 01:14:39,791
Exactly. And your dad like a tyrant, dude.

1046
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:45,658
I do not even know that I knew that word

1047
01:14:45,693 --> 01:14:48,276
He does not want any freedom at all.

1048
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,106
He was, like, frozen that lady

1049
01:14:51,107 --> 01:14:56,371
Ok, maybe she looks cool , but it is not

1050
01:14:56,406 --> 01:14:59,482
In fact, here it is the antithesis of cool

1051
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:01,594
it suppose to be uncool

1052
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:04,008
I think I understand. - Oh, that!

1053
01:15:04,043 --> 01:15:06,680
Well, May be  it's time to stand up to your father?

1054
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:08,715
For, like freedom and liberty

1055
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:14,719
For this is the only planet in the entire universe 
with 18 dif- ferent taste of potato chips.

1056
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:16,784
You got to think of that.

1057
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:19,175
Tell Fanul. I know it has ?? in itself.

1058
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:22,762
I know that goodness and justice 
make up the core of your being.

1059
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:34,807
Let's get out of here, folks.

1060
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:40,098
I can see why you like him. 
He is kind of cute

1061
01:15:40,558 --> 01:15:43,457
I found him more appeal

1062
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,673
Come in deportation grid, prisoner.

1063
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:00,344
- SaVada, listen!  
- Traitor!

1064
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:02,933
for the crime of questioning my authority ...

1065
01:16:02,968 --> 01:16:06,795
I hereby sentence you and your daughter

1066
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,877
to be eternally frozen 

1067
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:11,100
Please not Soviza, take me!

1068
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:21,093
Good, Fanu, Did you bring the girl?

1069
01:16:21,128 --> 01:16:23,128
Yes, Father

1070
01:16:23,983 --> 01:16:25,869
 What is this? This is not Soviza.

1071
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:29,714
No, but I'm her step-sister. 
And it happen to be my stepfather you have there

1072
01:16:29,749 --> 01:16:32,614
And you better let him go now. Okey?

1073
01:16:33,905 --> 01:16:35,905
stop it

1074
01:16:36,028 --> 01:16:39,180
- What is the meaning of this 
- It's time to make some change, Father.

1075
01:16:40,072 --> 01:16:43,196
Change? Clearly your mind has been whooped

1076
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:47,794
When we get back home, I will remind you
 that the price of changes, is eternal freezing.

1077
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:50,102
- Now enter the Grid 
- Not until you let them go

1078
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:53,921
- Put the prisoners in the grid! 
- No!

1079
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:55,956
you are not keeping Kozma!

1080
01:16:57,149 --> 01:16:59,149
Do mrdaj, naduvenko!

1081
01:17:00,627 --> 01:17:03,436
Do not Mess with my family, dude. Absolutely!

1082
01:17:19,312 --> 01:17:22,411
Stupid kids, do you challenge my authority!

1083
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,677
incredible

1084
01:17:35,712 --> 01:17:37,746
I'm sure he will be here any moment now

1085
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,272
Your vaccume machine has no effect on me

1086
01:17:51,302 --> 01:17:53,302
This is bad 

1087
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:57,459
Arijel! Hay!

1088
01:18:03,999 --> 01:18:06,578
Try this size, sucker!

1089
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:09,779
Not the wind! Not the wind!

1090
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,395
Trevor, rocks!

1091
01:18:21,308 --> 01:18:23,840
Do not you see that we have the wedding here?

1092
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:25,875
What kind of behavior 

1093
01:18:37,722 --> 01:18:39,620
allright

1094
01:18:39,621 --> 01:18:42,711
- Super! 
 - Unreal!

1095
01:18:42,746 --> 01:18:44,383
That was so cool, Trevor.

1096
01:18:44,384 --> 01:18:47,592
Does that mean that Koz again can be a good alien?

1097
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:52,662
- Dady!
- Ariel!

1098
01:18:53,706 --> 01:18:55,734
- Thanks Megan Larson.

01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:06,838

No, that is fine. ring me any time.
to love honor and cherish

1114
01:20:08,306 --> 01:20:10,167
Do you have  to go back to Zirkalon?

1115
01:20:10,168 --> 01:20:13,731
While my father was in this condition, 
It is up to me to govern our planet.

1116
01:20:13,766 --> 01:20:16,631
I'll come back. after I make a few changes.

1117
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:25,997
Life on this strange planet 
continue confuses and amuses me, Diary

1118
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,849
I thought my life was completely over,
When I came to Earth

1119
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:35,253
But now I see that it was only the beginning.

1120
01:20:36,038 --> 01:20:41,544
New boyfriend who, despite once 
and actually kind of cute

1121
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:43,224
and new stepmother

1122
01:20:43,225 --> 01:20:45,479
Even new best friend.

1123
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:50,134
Well, Diary, this is the part where I admit

1124
01:20:50,135 --> 01:20:52,456
I actually learned  something in the last couple months.

1125
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:55,355
I am. But I think I'll just keep it to myself

1126
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,494
I mean, who would  ever believe us any way

1127
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:01,445
Let's just say thanks to my new half-sister

1128
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,634
