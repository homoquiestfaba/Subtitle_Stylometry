00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,625
Zed: <i>Welcome back
to Seabrook,</i>

3
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,030
<i>where belonging
is everything.</i>

4
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,931
Addison:
<i>We're a strong, united</i>

5
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,268
<i>and tight-knit community.</i>

6
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,273
<i>And that's a good thing 'cause
it wasn't always this way.</i>

7
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,943
<i>There was a time when
we had to protect ourselves.</i>

8
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:04,312
<i>Legend has it that when the
first settlers came to Seabrook,</i>

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,649
<i>they found wild beasts
with sharp claws</i>

10
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,117
<i>lurking in the forest.</i>

11
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,385
(snarling)

12
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:10,987
Zed: <i>Which sparked
an epic battle.</i>

13
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,960
<i>Seabrook settlers bravely
fought off the monstrous attack.</i>

14
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,129
<i>And discovered a powerful
energy source.</i>

15
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,265
<i>Realizing they discovered
a precious resource,</i>

16
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,035
<i>they safeguarded it
from the beasts.</i>

17
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,536
Addison: <i>They weren't going to
let anyone steal their treasure.</i>

18
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>So they hid it.</i>

19
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,674
<i>And the town prospered
and grew rich</i>

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,477
<i>by harnessing the precious
energy source.</i>

21
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,280
<i>Seabrook benefited greatly
as it grew strong,</i>

22
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,380
<i>happy, and unified.</i>

23
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,482
Zed: <i>The beasts were
a distant memory.</i>

24
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,618
Addison: <i>Seabrook forgot
monsters could be real.</i>

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,553
Zed: <i>Until clearly,
they were.</i>

26
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:47,556
<i>A little lime soda mixed
with a dash</i>

27
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:49,625
<i>of industrial strength
Seabrook energy...</i>

28
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:52,594
- <i>And boom!</i>
- (explosion)

29
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,029
<i>Zombies were created.</i>

30
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,267
(growling and snarling)

31
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>In a lot of ways,
Seabrook's moved on since then.</i>

32
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,410
<i>But it's hard to bury
your past.</i>

33
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,547
(growling)

34
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,282
(terrified screaming)

35
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,919
(growling)

36
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,554
Kids:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

37
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,990
(playful growling)

38
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:22,725
Hey, I'm Zed.

39
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,994
And yup, still a zombie.

40
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:25,928
(grunts)

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,097
For zombies in Seabrook,
things are changing.

42
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,067
Every day is better
than the last.

43
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,535
Seabrook is getting rid of all
of its old anti-monster laws,

44
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,006
so now Zombietown is open
to everyone.

45
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,207
Come on!

46
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,509
Wait, wait, wait!
No, Zoey, wait for me!

47
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:41,646
Wait. Watch out!

48
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,950
And business is booming.

49
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,582
Hey, hey!

50
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,616
What's up, coach?

51
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,153
Oh, football off-season
has been good to me, Zed.

52
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,720
Invested in a Fro-Yo cart.

53
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,557
Little side hustle,
gonna go global,

54
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,693
gonna buy a car,
get some dress shirts,

55
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:00,028
go on vacation
without my great aunt Edna.

56
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,563
Though she loves
swimwear weather.

57
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,165
You know I might just
bring her along.

58
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,534
Cauliflower brains
mocha crunch, please.

59
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,638
You got it!

60
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,605
Seabrook has way more flavors
than just vanilla now.

61
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,240
I'll take a vanilla, coach.

62
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,741
What? I like vanilla.

63
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,176
In a couple days,

64
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,677
we're even tearing down
old Seabrook power

65
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,445
to build a new cheer pavilion.

66
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,782
And not to take too much credit
for all the positive changes,

67
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,283
but yeah, I did good.

68
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,718
It's hard to believe
there was a time

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,422
when people were afraid
of zombies.

70
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,762
Okay, let's triple check that.

71
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:33,295
Hey, Dad.

72
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,129
Hey, son.

73
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,464
First day as foreman
of the demo crew.

74
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,666
- Big day for zombie-kind.
- Yeah, you'll do great.

75
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,669
Just don't make any lame
zombie dad jokes.

76
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,637
But the workin' stiffs love 'em.

77
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,641
(laughs)

78
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:49,447
(cheering)

79
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,550
Boy: Go, Shrimpy! Go Shrimpy!

80
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:56,184
Cheer Camp!

81
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,153
Even more sparkly
than I dreamed.

82
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,021
(laughs)

83
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:01,756
Hi, I'm Addison, and this
is cheer camp,

84
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,624
a place where everyone belongs.

85
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:04,725
We're a unified squad and...

86
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,427
Bucky: Split up.

87
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,599
Usually unified.
(chuckles)

88
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,232
(whistle blows)

89
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,468
♪♪

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,604
- Woo!
- All: Yay, Bucky!

91
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,574
That's cheer captain Bucky,
my cousin.

92
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:20,210
(applause)

93
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,812
You've all heard the stories
of bloodthirsty monsters

94
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,514
- who roam these woods,
- (Shrimpy whimpering)

95
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,716
feasting on innocent
cheerleaders.

96
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,154
- Boo!
- (screams)

97
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,320
(Bucky laughs)

98
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,589
Well, those stories are just
silly make believe.

99
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,691
But you'd better believe
we're gonna break you down

100
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,729
and build you back up into peppy
little cheer machines like...

101
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,501
- Lacey!
- (applause)

102
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,638
- Stacey!
- (applause)

103
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,641
And our most recent Acey,
JC.

104
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,745
(applause)

105
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,147
I'm Kevin.

106
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,649
...Right.

107
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,753
We changed my name to JC,
which I love by the way.

108
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,322
Long live the Aceys!

109
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:08,493
(applause)

110
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,626
You three lead the veterans,
you're the A-team.

111
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,563
Addison, Bree, you take
the newbies.

112
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,800
You're the, uh, you're
the Z-team.

113
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,868
(yelling)
<i>Hey, hey! Ho, ho!</i>

114
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,171
<i>This demolition
has got to go!</i>

115
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:24,573
They can't tear it down, Zed.

116
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,340
Seabrook power hasn't worked
for years.

117
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,176
It's an important part of
zombie heritage.

118
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,745
This is progress, Eliza.

119
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,649
And now we can even
go to Prawn.

120
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,918
Prawn is like super-sized prom,
but Mighty Shrimp themed.

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,253
And, this is the first year
zombies can attend.

122
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,656
And it's gonna be epic.

123
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,358
<i>I'm loud and proud to be
a zombie.</i>

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,659
Sometimes too loud.

125
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,462
Soon, Z-band tech will get
so good

126
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,198
that zombies will blend
right in.

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,698
I dream of a day we ditch
our Z-bands

128
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,334
and let our
inner monsters roar.

129
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,838
(roars)

130
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,839
Zombies, this is obviously
your first cheer camp.

131
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,407
Now, I'm not anti-change,

132
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,642
I'm just pro keeping things
the way they are,

133
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,546
because you don't mess
with success.

134
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,681
(laughs)

135
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:07,849
This week, the veterans
and the newbies will compete

136
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,618
for the Cheer Camp Cup

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,686
to see who is more
cheertastic!

138
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,988
The veterans have always
won the Cheer Camp Cup,

139
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,257
right Aceys?

140
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,457
All: Right!

141
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,659
We'll see about that.

142
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,596
To the cheer course!

143
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,830
Watch and learn, snowball.

144
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,532
Ah yes, my hair.

145
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,500
Still white,
still well-conditioned,

146
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:27,803
and still drawing fire
from the Aceys.

147
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,972
Bucky: Addison,
get those pom-poms pumping.

148
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,974
Let's show 'em that we got this.

149
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,575
All: Yeah!

150
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,644

00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:43,423
- What wolves?
- Here wolves?

359
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,929
Aceys:
Were-wolves?

360
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,465
Nobody's gonna believe this.

361

<i>Werewolves are real!</i>

362
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,471
I always, always said
the stories of monsters

363
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:58,206
in the forest were real.

364
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,477
And no one believed me.

365
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,577
I thought werewolves
were just myths.

366
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,981
Yeah, like cavities.

367
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:07,548
Those are real too?

368
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,082
Werewolves, ew.

369
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,519
I really hope my allergies
don't act up.

370
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,420
Please can I have one?

371
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:15,222
I'm the only zombie
in my class.

372
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,024
A werewolf friend
would be great.

373
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,226
I'll feed him and walk him.

374
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,529
Yeah, werewolves
ain't class pets, Zoey.

375
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,868
And they certainly
ain't friendly.

376
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,068
I'm okay.

377
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,203
Aunt Missy, Uncle Dale.

378
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:33,207
The crash was horrible,
but I protected Addison.

379
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,445
Anyone as courageous as me
would've done the same.

380
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,513
Though not really,
I am super brave.

381
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,615
Mom, Dad,
everything is fine.

382
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:42,917
It's not fine. There are
werewolves circling us right now,

383
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,084
waiting to attack.

384
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,953
Yeah, and I'm way too tasty.

385
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,091
I'm always looking like
a snack.

386
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,191
Somebody has to do something.

387
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:51,959
And someone will.

388
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:53,429
Hold my purse.

389

(gavel slams)

390
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,967
By order of city council,
effective immediately,

391
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,636
all anti-monster laws
are reinstated.

392
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,571

394
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,813
Mom, that is unfair!

395
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,151
- Zed, we need to talk.
- We do.

396
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:16,918
Even though you didn't write,
or answer any of my letters.

397
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,919
No, I wrote.

398
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,323
A lot.

399
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,593
(sighs) The Aceys shredded
all of our letters.

400

401
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,333
Addison.

402
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,471
Will you make me
the luckiest zombie

403
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,607
and be my date to Prawn?

404
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,073
- No.
- Great! No?

405
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,576
Everyone's freaking out
about werewolves,

406
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:44,144
so the anti-monster laws are
in affect again, which means...

407
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,513
Zombies can't go to Prawn.

408
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:46,851
Ouch.

409
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,217
But we're going to fight this,
Zed.

410
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:50,584
Okay, so that's why
you said no?

411
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,421
Yeah.

412
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,522
Why are you smiling?

413
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,157
Because when you said no,

414
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,557
I thought you didn't
like me anymore.

415
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,493
But the only problem here

416
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,661
is a bunch of blood-thirsty
werewolves.

417
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,333
We can so fix that.

Look, I like zombies.
They like Fro-Yo.

Maybe with sprinkles.

find the girl,

get our moonstone and leave
this awful place.

565
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:17,905
I wouldn't call it awful.

566
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:19,910
They got something
called Fro-Yo.

567
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,847
Yeah, you're right.
This town's the worst.

568
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,919
Boy: Hey, I guess I
will see you after tryouts.

569
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,556
Girl:
Yeah, sure, awesome.

570
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,392
Boy:
Hey, man, how are you...

571
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,428
I really thought we'd all be
at the Prawn together.

572
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,463
- I thought Seabrook could change.
- It did.

573
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,532
Believe me, I will find a way
to get us to the Prawn.

574
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:45,669
Or we could miss it together.

575
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,101
I'm not letting you miss
the Prawn.

576
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,968
If you can't go,
I'm not going.

577
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,905
Well, I like you too much
not to let you go.

578
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,773
Well, I like you too much
to leave you behind.

579
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:53,740
I am so not going.

580
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,476
Ugh, you guys even fight
like a perfect couple.

581
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:57,544
How's it going, Eliza?

582
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,647
You know, fighting injustice
is keeping me busy.

583
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,582
And looking good doing it,
Zom-bae.

584
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,615
(laughs)

585
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,584
I'm thinking the student
president

586
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,585
should get his own
corner office.

587
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,354
Let's see if we can move out
the math department.

588
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:08,621
- Write that down.
- Done.

589
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:09,622
Addison!

590
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,926
Time to officially nominate me
as president.

591
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,729
Let's keep it understated,
yet extravagant and flashy.

592
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:16,697
Ooh, yeah.

593
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:17,497
Bucky:
Make sure...

594
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:18,631
Cheer could be so much
more than

595
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,534
just pom-pomming for Bucky.

596
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:22,405
Lacey:
Uh, Addison?

597
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,040
Once we're cheer captain,
you are so off the team.

598
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,043
And when I'm cheer captain,
you'll be welcome to stay,

599
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,711
because I'll be making cheer
about bringing people together.

600
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,581
(laughs)
That was awful trash talk.

601
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,849
I know, right?

602
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:37,384
You will never be
cheer captain, freak.

603
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,387
Stacey:
See ya.

604
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,523
I gotta find a way to get us
to the Prawn.

605
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:43,623
We can crash it.

606
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,592
I mean, we can't make the rules,
but we can break 'em.

607
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:46,593
(snaps fingers)

608
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:47,928
Well, we can make the rules!

609
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,766
We just need the right leader.

610
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:54,735
- (cheering)
- Okay, are there any more nominees for president?

611
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:57,438
Just a reminder that being part
of student council

612
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,042
means that we get to hang.

613
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:01,775
Anybody, anybody want
to hang?

614
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:04,847
Just... anyone want
to hang out?

615
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,781
Anyone?

616
00:26:06,783 --> 00:26:10,583
Oh, we could come up with our
very own complicated high five.

617
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,651
That'd be fun, huh?

618
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,888
Like...

619
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,688
Oooh...

620
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,756
(band plays fanfare)

621
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:21,027
Students: (chanting)
Go! Go! Go!

622
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,732
(cheering)

623
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,899
Hi!

624
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,402
(cheering)

625
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,007
(cheering and applause)

626
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,908
Good job!

627
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,508
Okay.

628
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,046
(cheering)

629
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:42,182
Great news, we have a brilliant
and cheer tested candidate

630
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,851
running for president
this year.

631
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,821
Me!

632
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,719
(cheering)

633
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,522
(chanting)
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!

634
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:51,992
Students: Bucky!
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!

635
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,527
I'm running against Bucky
for president,

636
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,530
but I need to one-up
his entrance.

637
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,666
The question is, how?

638
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,071
(chanting continues)

639
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,144
(grunts)

640
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,211
(grunting)

641
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,781
- Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!
- (chanting stops)

642
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:14,948
Woo!

643
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,149
Excuse me.

644
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:17,618
(laughs)

645
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,953
Zombie strong!

646
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:19,954
(cheering)

647
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,188
Zed:
Hello, everyone.

648
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,594
My name is Zed, and I am running
for president.

649
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:26,463
(cheering and laughing)

650
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,661
Zed can't steal my spotlight.

651
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,630
What about the whole
anti-monster thingy?

652
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:31,498
Shh...

653
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,801
Anyone can run
for president, Bucky.

654
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:35,768
She actually has a point,
Mr. Bucky.

655
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,705
- (furiously) What?!
- Yes.

656
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:39,005
A zombie president?

657
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,707
Aceys: Ew!

658
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,509
(cheering)

659
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,011
As the first ever
zombie president,

660
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,112
I will allow zombies to go
to the Prawn,

661
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,814
I will take Addison
as my date,

662
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:51,651
and we will get our photo
on the Prawn wall of fame.

663
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:54,088
Maybe they'll rename the school
after me one day.

664
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,826
Zed Necrodopolous High.

665
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,691
Preferably before I graduate.

666
00:27:58,693 --> 00:27:59,762
Okay.

667
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:05,299
If you vote for me, I will bring
you prosperity and awesomeness!

668
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:07,601
(cheering wildly)

669
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,606
Crowd: (chanting) Zed! Zed!
Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed!

670
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,744
- The Great Alpha's near.
- Focus.

671
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,678
Remember, we're fierce,
we're savage.

672
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,780
We're werewolves!

673
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:20,848
That's right, Wynter.

674
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,550
We're scared of nothing.

675
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,284
Except silver.

676
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,618
Yeah, silver.

677
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,319
And ticks.

678
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,387
And rabies.

679
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,555
Come on, if we're quiet,
we can be in and out of here

680
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:29,756
before they even know
we're here.

681
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:30,759
(yelps)

682
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,726
(yelps)

683
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,062
Ah, silver! Oh, pain!

684
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:37,665
- I can take it.
- (sizzling)

685
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,766
No, I can't!

686
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:40,801
Nice grab.

687
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,037
Come on.

688
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:48,242
Zed:
As your president,

689
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:52,111
I will make Seabrook a place
that embraces zombies and...

690
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:53,080
(fearfully)
Werewolves?

691
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,114
Uh, no. Why would we want...

692
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,350
(screams)
Werewolves!

693
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,622
(screaming)

694
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,292
There she is!

695
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,225
Football team!
Defense, Z 24.

696
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:07,229
- Boy 1: Right!
- Boy 2: Let's go Mighty Shrimp!

697
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:09,897
Where's the moonstone,
white hair?

698
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,698
I think you've got
the wrong person.

699
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,734
Uh, Eliza?
What are you doing?

700
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,134
Let's smash our Z-bands
and zombie out.

701
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,269
We can use our strength
to fend them off.

702
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,007
We can't lose control.
We are not monsters.

703
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:21,976
Our razor sharp claws will gut
'em and splatter their blood.

704
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:23,680
(screaming)

705
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:26,016
Too much?

706
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:29,850
Wolves! On my command!

707
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,787
(snarling)

708
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:33,553
Willa.

709
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,255
We can't go to war
with the whole town.

710
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:37,861
We'll never find the moonstone
if they're on high alert.

711
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:40,361
I hate it when you're right.

712
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,632
Wolves, stand down.

713
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:46,670
Okay.

714
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,669
Sorry.

715
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:52,206
We werewolves so admire
your town,

716
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,778
and we just came here
to join your school.

717
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,210
(murmurs of confusion)

718
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,248
What? They can't join
our school.

719
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,047
Technically the
Forbidden Forest

720
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,082
is within the school district.

721
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,321
So, welcome to Seabrook!

722
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:07,022
(awkward laugh)

723
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,061
Zed:
Zed for prez!

724
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:17,197
Vote Zed for prez,
because I'm a zombie,

725
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,365
not a zom-can't-be.

726
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:20,967
Okay, here's our platform.

727
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:23,203
We fight for zombie toppings
on pizza in the cafeteria.

728
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:23,203
-Right.

729
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:25,406
- Get Zombie tongue taught
as a second language.

730
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,342
- Good.
- And how to overthrow your oppressors after school club.

731
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:30,744
- Eliza.
- Sorry, right. Don't over promise.

732
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,246
But more importantly,
we allow zombies at Prawn.

733
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,849
Good luck, Mr. Future President.

734
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,784
Hey Zed, did you hear?

735
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,053
Addie's being tested
for captain,

736
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:40,787
and she gets to run
cheer practice tomorrow.

737
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,057
It's not a big deal.

738
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,390
Okay, it's huge.

739
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:46,796
A huge chance to fail!

740
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,864
If Addie aces this practice,
oh my gosh,

741
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,168
she's so going to be cheer
captain once Bucky wins.

742
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,136
He's so gonna win,
because you know, elections,

743
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:58,338
they're just like these
big old popularity contests.

744
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,239
And Bucky is super popular.

745
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,342
- (clears throat)
- So... what?

746
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,647
Thanks, Bree.

747
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,980
I know it's weird
I'll only be cheer captain

748
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:09,315
if Bucky's president, but...

749
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,084
No, that just means
neither of us can lose,

750
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,655
because one of us is going
to get what we want.

751
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:14,157
And I can live with that.

752
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,924
Me too.

753
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:19,029
You'll do great, Zed.

754
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,829
Zed for prez!

Bucky (on PA): <i>Shish, boom.

Baaaad idea.

Oh, this is me being nice.

00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,934
Now let's find that moonstone.

767
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,902
With cheer fans in Bucky's camp,

768
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,838
and zombies and the football
team in mine,

769
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,806
the school's split right down
the middle.

770
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:08,508
Werewolves are the swing vote.

771
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,479
Wolves are key to winning
this election.

772
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,514
But you know winning over
the wolves is going to be hard.

773
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:14,918
Zed:
Trust me, I got this.

774

We're going to win the wolves
votes, and more.

775

We just have to show them
how to fit in, like us.

- Easy.

These history books
claim werewolves

786
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,830
attacked Seabrook settlers.

787
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:05,098
But they struck first
and stole our moonstone.

I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

...Okay.

802
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,607
When zombies first came
to Seabrook,

803
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,374
we were outsiders, too.

804
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:51,111
Which is why you need a great
president like Zed

805
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,849
to represent you.

806
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,515

joined us.

Underneath all that fluffy hair,
I bet you're a real softie.

811
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:09,362
I am a mean, mean werewolf,
kid.

812
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,931
I am tough and rough.

Aww, you said "ruff."

we will never be tamed.

Oh boy.

00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,176
Oh wow, that's great.

You sort of are.

823
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,187
Your necklace is powered, right?

824
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:36,390
Kind of like an organic Z-band.

Thanks.

827

That necklace keeps you
from fully wolfing out?

828
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,301
The opposite.

829
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:48,938
Our moonstones make us
our true werewolf selves.

830
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:52,038
So without it you'd be human?

831
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,542
No, we'd die.

832
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,312
We'd be nothing.

833
00:34:57,413 --> 00:34:58,578
Imagine how alive you'd feel

834
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,547
if you didn't have to tamp
things down.

835
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:01,951
Hold back your true selves.

836
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,417
Actually, I've got this theory
that zombies might've evolved

837
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:06,585
- beyond their need for Z-bands.
- (laughs uncomfortably)

838
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:09,191
Z-bands are great.
They help you fit in.

And I think you guys would have
a much better time at Seabrook

you deliver

So the first step is...

905

More glossy publicity shots.

With werewolves on cheer,
this election is so in the bag.

Bucky, this is not
about politics.

948
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,529
I always just felt like cheer
could unite.

You are going to make
a great cheer captain.

(applause)

952
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,708
I was thinking the team
could move beyond trophies

953
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,308
and we could start
an outreach program.

954
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,645
Whoa. Cheer is what
I say cheer's about.

955
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,749
And it's about winning.

a lot greater than cheer.

Zed!

Zed!

963
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,681
What's wrong?

964
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,748
Werewolves. They're not
interested in fitting in.

965
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,783
They're into cheer.

966
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:39,551
No, they're into you,
and you're into him... them.

967
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:40,689
What?

968
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,790
Why are you acting like this?

969
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,525
Do you know how hard it was
for zombies?

970
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,594
Now everything is just being
handed to the werewolves

971
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:49,462
- on a silver platter.
- Actually, they hate silver.

972
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:52,299
I'm trying to win an election
for my people, for you.

973
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:55,000
So we can go to Prawn,
so we can be accepted.

974
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:56,872
That's not being accepted.

975
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,806
That's being afraid to show
who you really are.

Says the girl who wore a wig
her whole life.

977
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,717
Yeah. I did.

978
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,485
Because I always felt
like an outsider.

979
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,690
And even though I might be
cheer captain, I still do.

980

You know I don't have
a place here!

00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,228
because their moonstones
lose their power.

1065
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,831
All of our elders are too sick
to travel, which leaves...

1066
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:29,166
...which leaves taking care of
the pack to us.

1067
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:30,770
To me.

1068
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:36,009
You'll be fine, Wynter.
I promise.

1069
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,279
You'd better be right
about this.

1070
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,715
We need to find
the moonstone soon.

1071
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:45,717
Follow us, Addison.

1072
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,253
Please.

1073
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:00,030
You guys!

1074
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:02,800
I have to go apologize
to Addison right now.

1075
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,902
- <i>Gruzah!</i>
- Yeah I know, I want to see it too.

1076
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:05,869
You know, ever since
football ended,

1077
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:07,771
I've so missed watching you
get pummeled.

1078
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:09,674
Announcer:
<i>Attention citizens.</i>

1079
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:12,710
<i>All curfews will be
strictly enforced.</i>

1080
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:13,511
(speaks Zombie)

1081
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:14,746
Yeah, with the curfew
in effect,

1082
00:46:14,748 --> 00:46:18,049
it's gonna be nearly impossible
to get past the Z-patrol.

1083
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:19,717
Hey guys!

1084
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:20,851
And yet somehow
Bree just did.

1085
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:22,954
Have you, have you guys
seen Addison?

1086
00:46:22,956 --> 00:46:25,288
She texted me for help,
but she's not home,

1087
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,926
and she's not answering
her phone.

1088
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,027
...Oh.

1089
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,695
Hey, Bonzo.

1090
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:31,962
(speaks Zombie)

1091
00:46:31,964 --> 00:46:32,896
(laughs)

1092
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,364
You guys, focus!

1093
00:46:34,366 --> 00:46:35,201
Oh.

1094
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,235
Addison needs help.

1095
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:39,737
Okay, if her phone is on,
I can track her.

1096
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,773
(beeping)

1097
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:48,880
She's in the Forbidden Forest.

1098
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:50,815
The wolves.
They kidnapped her.

1099
00:46:50,817 --> 00:46:51,952
You guys, we have
to help Addison.

1100
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,827
The wolf den!

1101
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:01,795
Addison: Wow.

1102
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:05,063
It's okay to be impressed.

1103
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:06,264
Wyatt:
Our language.

1104
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:08,099
(howls)
Addison!

1105
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:10,201
- That means welcome.
- (howls)

1106
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,969
(laughing)

1107
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,270
Ostrich boots?

1108
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:14,404
No, I think Addison meant

1109
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:15,940
(howls)

1110
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,208
(howls)

1111
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,143
- (laughing)
- Polka dot unicorn?

1112
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:20,110
Cool, where?

1113
00:47:20,112 --> 00:47:22,713
Oh, no. Sorry, um.
Uh...

1114
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,815
(howls briefly)

1115
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:26,083
Whoa, whoa, language.

1116
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:27,085
There are were-pups around.

1117
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,454
She needs to put a pebble
in the swear-wolf jar.

1118
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:33,826
(wolves howling)

1119
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:37,427
I am so sorry.

1120
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:38,996
Enough.

1121
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:40,833
This is not why we brought
her here.

1122
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,236
Why am I here?

1123
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:54,848
(howling)

1124
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,420
I believe you will lead us
to the moonstone.

1125
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:03,320
I believe you're
the Great Alpha.

1126
00:48:03,322 --> 00:48:05,058
I believe you're
a werewolf.

1127
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:06,993

Addison!

Zed!

1193
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,020
Don't make me
take this off!

1194
00:50:50,022 --> 00:50:51,324
You don't want to see me
zombie out.

1195
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:52,993

(snarling)

1199
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:00,499
(distortedly)
Stay back!

1200
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:04,335
Addison:
No!

1201
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:05,636
(hissing and snarling)

1202
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:07,574
(growling)

1203
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:11,078
(hissing and snarling)

1204
00:51:12,377 --> 00:51:14,080
Addison:
No, stop!

1205
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,351
Zed! I want to be here!

1206
00:51:21,353 --> 00:51:22,954
What?

1207
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,355
But... but you texted
"Help!"

1208
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:26,357
I needed help on
the chemistry homework.

1209
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,228
Didn't you see
the beaker emoji?

1210
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:32,663
Oh... I do now.

1211
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:33,697
(laughs awkwardly)

1212
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:36,166
By the way, I love
this new look.

1213
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,400
New hairstylist?

1214
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:39,337
Werewolves, they know hair.

1215
00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:40,704
And manicures.

1216
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,405
All: Mmm-hmm.

1217
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,141
They think I may be
a werewolf too.

1218
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,710
What? How?

1219
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:46,677
Maybe a grandparent.

1220
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,047
My hair means something.
This could be my pack.

1221
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:54,288
For centuries, this has been
set aside for the Great Alpha.

1222
00:51:55,554 --> 00:51:58,422
A fully charged moonstone
is priceless to us, Addison.

1223
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:01,358
If you're truly one of us,
when you put it on,

1224
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,063
you'll be transformed
into a werewolf.

1225
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:06,333
Part of our pack, forever.

1226
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,498
What? No!

1227
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,402
Wait.

1228
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,004
Can I think about it?

1229
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,909
For a day.

1230
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:21,378
Once you've joined us, you can
lead us to the hidden moonstone.

1231
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,949
But she doesn't know
where it is.

1232
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:24,681
Zed:
What?

1233
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,553
(rumbling)

1234
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,530
(speaks Zombie)

1235
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,163
Yeah. The explosion came
from Seabrook Power.

1236
00:52:40,165 --> 00:52:42,632
They must be testing charges
for the demolition tomorrow.

1237
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:44,668
Seabrook Power is the birthplace
of zombies.

1238
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,170
Zed:
A little lime soda mixed

1239
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:48,672
with some mysterious energy,
and bang!

1240
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:49,540

Nice story, but it doesn't
concern us.

1243
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,514
But it does concern you,
Willa.

1244
00:52:56,516 --> 00:53:00,119
Seabrook Power was fueled
by a mysterious energy source.

1245
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,353
That could be your moonstone,
right?

1246
00:53:03,355 --> 00:53:05,556
She found the moonstone.

1247
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:06,560
She's amazing.

1248
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:11,397
Wyatt:
If she's right...

1249
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:13,100
Wow.

1250
00:53:17,302 --> 00:53:18,835
We'll see you at school
tomorrow, Addison.

1251
00:53:18,837 --> 00:53:20,637
Okay. Tomorrow.

1252
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,275
Big day.

1253
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:29,712
If they destroy that building,

1254
00:53:29,714 --> 00:53:31,514
it'll crush the moonstone
underneath.

1255
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:32,550
We can't let that happen.

1256
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:35,286
- Addison can help.
- Maybe once she's one of us.

1257
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:37,224
But until then,
I lead this pack.

1258
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,692
We need to stop them from
destroying the moonstone.

1259
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:42,860
Whatever it takes.

1263
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:05,648
So.

1264
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,884
New look?

1265
00:54:06,886 --> 00:54:07,817
I like it.

1266
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,488
My new friends like it.

1267
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:14,661
Did you join a, um,
rock band?

Boy 2:
That is a fresh look!

1274
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:36,212
Whoa! Bad hair day?

1275
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:37,614
Bad hair life?

1276
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:39,483
I think it looks great.

1277
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,583
- Yeah, not so much.
- (snaps fingers)

1278
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:43,186
Addison, if you ever expect
to be cheer captain...

1279
00:54:43,188 --> 00:54:44,755
Well, maybe I don't.

1280
00:54:44,757 --> 00:54:46,690
Maybe cheer team
isn't for me after all.

1282

Addison!

1283
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:53,697
I was up all night thinking.

1284
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:55,398
You're not a werewolf,
you can't be.

1285
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,933
But I love moonlight strolls.

1286
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:58,335
Yeah, you like sunsets too.

1287
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,369
That doesn't mean you're
a vampire.

1288
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:00,804
- Zed...
- Look.

1289
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:03,641
It's really hard being
considered a monster.

1290
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:04,509
Trust me.

1291
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:07,547
All I've ever wanted
is to find my pack.

1292
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,583
And now I finally have.

1293
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:18,424
When I see the wolves,
I'm going to put this on.

1294
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:21,759
And I'm really sorry I can't
make the debate,

1295
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,697
but I need to find the wolves.

1296
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,601
Good luck.

1297
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,610
Whoops, almost forgot.
You'll do great, Zed.

1298
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,244
Are you ready for the debate?

1299
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,581
Come on, we're going
to be late.

1300
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:47,951
You're going to prove
to everyone

1301
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:48,786
that we're more than just...

1302
00:55:48,788 --> 00:55:49,688
...Monsters.

1303
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:55,228

- ...Scary.

All right, we don't have
much time.

1309
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,853
This is how we sabotage
the demolition and stop them.

1310
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:25,956
It's my responsibility to make
sure we're all safe.

1311
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:27,690
We follow my lead.

1312
00:56:27,692 --> 00:56:29,460
It's a good plan, Willa.

1313
00:56:29,462 --> 00:56:30,797
Addison:
What plan?

1314
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,795
We're going after
the moonstone.

1315
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:33,764
Top secret.

1316
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,534
You can't tell anyone.

1317
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,772
Bad wolf, bad wolf!

1318
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:40,471
You're going after
the moonstone now?

1319
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:41,608
It won't survive
the detonation.

1320
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,940
Then let me join you.

1321
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:44,675
I'm ready to become
a wolf.

1322
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:46,346
If you really are one.

1323
00:56:48,681 --> 00:56:49,779
(gasps)

1324
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,681
It's gone.

1325
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:51,784
You lost it?

1326
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,552
Do you know how precious
a moonstone necklace is?

1327
00:56:55,554 --> 00:56:57,454
If she was serious
about being a wolf,

1328
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,456
if she was the Great Alpha,

1329
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,824
she wouldn't have been
so careless.

1330
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:02,492
No, I... I don't know how!
I...

1331
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:04,364
Stay out of our amazing hair.

1332
00:57:13,406 --> 00:57:14,641
You got your speech?

1333
00:57:19,011 --> 00:57:20,647
Addison's necklace?

1334
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,380
I took it.

1335
00:57:23,382 --> 00:57:24,882
I can't let her become
a werewolf.

1336
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:26,550
I have to protect her.

1337
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:28,384
All of this,
running for president,

1338
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:29,386
it's all for her.

1339
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:30,186
No, Zed.

1340
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,922
This is bigger than that,
okay?

1341
00:57:31,924 --> 00:57:34,757
This is for you, for me,
for all zombies everywhere.

1342
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:36,763
This is more important
than anything else.

1343
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:39,563
Look, we'll deal
with this later, okay?

1344
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:40,764
Just become president.

1345
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:42,601
That's what zombies need.

1346
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:47,741

Running for president,

1350
00:57:56,715 --> 00:57:59,750
wearing the sequined
Mighty Shrimp uniform...

lean, mean, cheering machine...

1353
00:58:04,556 --> 00:58:07,090

Why not?

1359
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,440
Introducing our soon-to-be
first green-haired president

1360
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:27,110
and repping a proud people,
Zed!

1362
00:58:32,817 --> 00:58:33,851

(growls)

1364
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,887
Um no, actually, we're not
going to roar.

1365
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:37,920
No roaring.

1366
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:38,822
Zed'll fight for you!

1367
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:40,858
You know what, um,
I'm not going to fight.

1368
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,692
'Cause, no, this isn't
a fight.

1369
00:58:42,694 --> 00:58:46,730
This is just a nice lil' cordial
debate we're having here today.

1370
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,632
Good to hear, Zed.
(laughs)

1371
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:49,800
Oh, did you see that?

1372
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,134
That was a high-five.

1373
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:52,168
No.

1374

I'm gonna lose the election,

1642
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:21,498

- What?
- I took it.

1649
01:09:48,094 --> 01:09:49,897
I stole it when
you weren't looking.

1650

- I questioned myself.
- Addison, I'm sorry.

1652
01:09:56,969 --> 01:09:59,136
I was afraid that if you turned
into a wolf, I'd lose you.

1653

You don't get to make
that choice for me!

1654

1655
01:10:01,441 --> 01:10:03,039
I finally find where
I belong,

1656
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,641
and you try to steal that
from me?

1657
01:10:04,643 --> 01:10:07,548
Why would I ever go to the Prawn
with you after what you did?

1658
01:10:26,398 --> 01:10:27,934
Am I?

1659
01:10:32,272 --> 01:10:33,874

We got a problem!

1663
01:10:51,357 --> 01:10:52,989

- The remote shorted out,

timer's running.

Quickly, while we still can.

1766
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:25,916
It's this way.

1767
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:27,051
I see the light.

1768
01:17:27,053 --> 01:17:29,256
It's coming
from Seabrook Power.

1769
01:17:44,603 --> 01:17:45,605
Here it is!

1770
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,015
(growling)

1771
01:17:59,117 --> 01:18:00,516
(screams)

1772
01:18:00,518 --> 01:18:01,618
We have to move it out of here.

1773
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,587
Legend says that together,
our pack can move the stone.

1774
01:18:04,589 --> 01:18:06,325
All of us, lift!

1775
01:18:06,925 --> 01:18:08,762
(grunting)

1776
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:10,964
It's too heavy.

1777
01:18:11,629 --> 01:18:12,665
There's not enough of us.

1778
01:18:13,531 --> 01:18:15,367
Then maybe you need to expand
your pack.

1779
01:18:15,934 --> 01:18:16,934
Addison?

1780
01:18:16,936 --> 01:18:18,802
(rumbling)

1781
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:19,903
We came here to help.

1782
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,105
Come on, everyone.
We got this!

1783
01:18:21,107 --> 01:18:22,575
Right.

1784
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:27,077
Hurry, before it's too late!
Together lift!

1785
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:31,084
(rumbling)

1786
01:18:32,617 --> 01:18:33,484
Chamber's collapsed.

1787
01:18:33,486 --> 01:18:34,418
We can't carry the moonstone
through.

1788
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,985
Eliza: Your Z-band,
it's still broken.

1789
01:18:35,987 --> 01:18:38,122
Zed, take it off.
Lift the slab.

1790
01:18:38,124 --> 01:18:39,023
Okay, Zed, you can
do this.

1791
01:18:39,025 --> 01:18:40,990
I'm not ready. What if
I can't control it?

1792
01:18:40,992 --> 01:18:41,995
All: Oh!

1793
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,564
Zed, you have to.

1794
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:58,609
(roar)

1795
01:18:58,611 --> 01:18:59,646
Yes!

1796
01:19:00,513 --> 01:19:01,948
Addison:
Come on, you can do this.

1797
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,525
(loud grunts)

1798
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:23,536
(roar)

1799
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:31,678
Oh, no!

1800
01:19:34,847 --> 01:19:36,448
Zed!

1801
01:19:44,756 --> 01:19:46,593
(rapid beeping)

1802
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,928
(cheering)

1803
01:19:50,562 --> 01:19:52,762
Zed! Are you okay?

1804
01:19:52,764 --> 01:19:53,830
Yeah.

1805
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:54,867
I'm me.

1806
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:57,834
We crushed it!
We nailed it!

1807
01:19:57,836 --> 01:20:00,673
We so rock! Yes!

1808
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,941
Too much?

1809
01:20:03,642 --> 01:20:04,740
Perfect.

1810
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:06,545
(laughs)
We did it.

1811
01:20:07,612 --> 01:20:08,479
Say "brains."

1812
01:20:08,481 --> 01:20:09,779
Both: Brains!

1813
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:10,916
(camera shutter snaps)

1814
01:20:12,117 --> 01:20:14,153
We're getting our first zombie
on the Prawn wall of fame.

1815

(all howling)

1816
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,829
Hey, you said that perfectly.

1817
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:26,629
Bonzo's got an ear
for languages.
