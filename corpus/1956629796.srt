1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
(tugboat whistles)

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
(seagulls screeching)

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
(seagulls screeching)

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
(puppies whimpering)

5
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Look at those feet.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Does that mean...

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, he's going
to be a big one.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wow.
What do you say?

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thanks, Sam.
You take good
care of him.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bring him back in a couple
of weeks for vaccinations, okay?

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hi, Lydia.
Hi.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Bye now.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bye-bye.
Thanks.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which one did she take?

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The floppy-eared one.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How're you doing?
I know.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good.
Almost finished.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Want to go see
the Taj Mahal?

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll go anywhere with you, baby.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, you picked
my favorite one.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If I might be so bold,
I called him Bentley.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get out of there.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right.
All right.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How am I supposed to know
when my next appointment is?

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, it's in
a half an hour,

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but it's Elmer.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If he's on time,
I'll do cartwheels.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'd like to see that.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, you wouldn't.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
(hammering)

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
(saw buzzing)

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought they'd be
further along.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We've had a lot of rain.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, Sam.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lyddie.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hi.
What's up?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Came to take a look.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What do you think?

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Nice hole.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, we've had
a lot of rain.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's what I said.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Can't dig in the rain.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You guys in a hurry?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You want to fill this house
up with some babies?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yup.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Someday.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We get some good weather,
we'll be fine.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sure.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've got
the Turleys' sheep,

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and then a checkup
on Joe's pregnant cow.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay. Call me when
you're headed home.
Bye.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hi, Sam.
Hi.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How's your dog doing, Brad?

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's looking good, Doc.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Dermatitis is
practically all gone.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, but he's got
a rash of his own. Show him.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He wants to use
the dog medicine.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I wouldn't do that.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I told him that.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why? Won't it work?

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not unless you want
to wake up one morning

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
barking like a dog.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That would be
an improvement.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wouldn't it?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
See ya.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, kid!

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Get over here and help me.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hurry!

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come here!

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on!

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Get up here! Ooh!

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
(playfully grunting)

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
(laughing)

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Tetracycline.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Campbell's hound
lacerated his paw.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you find it?

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Where is it?

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Tiny hairline fracture,
right above the joint.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hmm.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You don't need
reading glasses, do you?

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Just wondering.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hi.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey.
What's up?

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, just passing by.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I thought
I'd stop in.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Busy?

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't mean to interrupt.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I saw her.

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How come you
didn't tell me?

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was on a call.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I saw her, too.
Down at the gas station.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hi, Ross.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Need some help?

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Elmer just showed up

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and I've got
the Campbell dog.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Elmer's appointment
was yesterday.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's Elmer.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right.
You take him, would you?

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll take the Campbell dog.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What brings
you here?

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He needs a distemper shot.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She asked about you.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll catch up with her.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Trooper!

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Look what I found.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What is it?

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What do you mean,
"What is it?"

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A drum set, doofus.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Whose are they?

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They belonged to
an old friend of mine.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What was his name?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ben.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He asked me to
keep them for him,

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
because he didn't have room.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can I play them?

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Can I play them really loud?

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah...

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Just do me a favor

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and wait till
I get downstairs.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let 'er rip!

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So what'd you think?

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
About what?

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The movie.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, I liked it.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You did not.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why do you say that?

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You kept looking
at your watch.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I guess I did, didn't I.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sam, where are you?

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm right here.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That ought
to do it, Walter.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just give it
a week or so.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can't pay you
till next week, Sam.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't look at me.
We know where you live.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Your 3:30 cancelled.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I guess I'll run out to Joe's,
check on that cow.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Weren't you just there
yesterday?

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She's very close.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're acting like
an expectant father.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you going
to hand out cigars?

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
(ball bouncing)

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hi.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your mom around?
No.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
She went to the store.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My name's Sam.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I used to live next door.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This was my house, right here.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That was my room, right there.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see you're quite
the basketball player.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Mm.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
(grunts)

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How about that?

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well...

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll just...

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll come around
another time.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ROSEMARY:
Okay, Joe.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll tell him.

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay!

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Where's Sam?

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, I don't know.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He said he was going to
check on Joe Lieber's cow.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe she's already
had her calf.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, she did.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But Sam wasn't there.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Where'd you go?

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, I had to go
check on Joe's cow.

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Joe called.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The cow had her calf.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He said you
weren't there.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Ah, I didn't make it, so...

178
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How come?

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is Sam back?

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, Sam, someone
wants to see you.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think we've solved
the mystery.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That dog's cute.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hi, Sam.

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Kind of expected
a bigger hello.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm... surprised to see you.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Trooper, is this
the guy who stopped by?

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mm-hmm.

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, I-I heard that
you were in town.

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm just...

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
surprised.

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So, you already met
my son, Trooper.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, not officially.

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm Sam.
Hi.

195
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Dude, what do you do
when somebody

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
offers you
their hand?

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And what else?

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Nice to meet you.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Nice to meet
you, too.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I told Troop that
you were a veterinarian,

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and he wanted
to come by right away

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
'cause he loves animals.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that right?

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well...

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I might know a puppy
who needs a home.

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't suppose
you'd be interested?

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Please, Mom?

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mmm, well...
Come on.

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
you have to take care of him.

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I will. Come on.

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Just wait
right here.

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you even know how
to take care of a dog?

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What are you gonna do?

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Made a deal.

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
A gummy bear!

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You want another?

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm Rosemary.
Trooper.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ah.

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh...

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sam.
Oh.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey... oh...

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
(Rosemary and Trooper laugh)

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TROOPER:
What's his name?

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, it's up to you.

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thanks, Sam-- I think.
Just be good to him--
bring him back here

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
whenever he needs anything;
it'll be on the house.

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
(laughs):
I'll take good care of him. Hey!

230
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, come on. Oh...

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Good girl.

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
SAM:
Hi, Alice.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Go ahead and take her
on back to number two.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll be there
in a minute.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes, I...
Alice?

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's me, Dee Dee.

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Dee Dee Michaud?

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah. And this is
my son, Trooper.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, hello, Trooper.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why, my goodness,
I haven't seen you since...

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah. About 13 years.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you just visiting?

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No. I'm here to stay.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well... good for you.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sam, I-I can see
that you're busy--

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we'll catch up later?

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.
Okay.

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
(quietly):
Trooper!

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Thanks for the puppy.
You're welcome.

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Bye, Rosemary.
Good-bye.

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SAM:
Give him a good home.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I will.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
(crickets chirping)

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
LYDIA:
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth at the office?

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I didn't want
Rosemary gossiping.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
About what?

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
About Dee Dee.

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What about Dee Dee?

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
(groans):
Oh, just... nothing.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You were worried she'd
gossip about nothing?

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We were friends.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We grew up together--
I mean, I've known

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the girl since I was
three years old.

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She and Ross
and I hung out.

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I mean, she was fun.

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Fun?

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We were just
friends, okay?
(laughs)

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
People gossip
about friends here.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a small town, Lydia.

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What do you know
about small towns--

271
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you grew up in Boston.
Oh, I don't know, Sam,

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
why don't you tell me
what it's like to grow up

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
in a small town.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Tell me about your "friend."
What do you mean?

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know.
What's she like?

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
She was a free spirit.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
'Kay? Everybody in town
knew her.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Me, I was this shy little kid
afraid of his own shadow.

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Once there was
this kid who was...

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
sort of the neighborhood bully,
he stole my baseball cards.

281
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, I pretended
that it didn't matter,

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but it mattered to Dee Dee.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
She found him,
she beat him up,

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and she got 'em all back for me.
Oh, that was nice of her.

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But you know what,
she didn't even care

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
about what people thought
about her.

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In the ninth grade,

288
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
she gets caught smoking
in the school bathroom.

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The principal

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
takes her into his office.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Before he can even
get a word in,

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
she offers him a cigarette.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mm-hmm.

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Anyway...

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
on graduation day, she ran off

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with Bobby Langford.

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Could you pass me
the olive oil?

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Is she the one

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you were gonna give
your class ring to?

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Who told you that?

301
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ross.

302
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A long time ago.

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah. She was the one.

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Pass me the pepper?

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Not until you tell me.

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Nothing to tell.

307
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Try me.

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, I was planning on
giving her my class ring

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the night before
graduation.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We were standing
out on her porch,

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and I had it out,
I had it in my hand,

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and I'm about to give
it to her, but before
I could say anything,

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
she pops out with the
news that she's going.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Next day, gone.

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You never heard from her?

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Couple of postcards.

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Uh, one.

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
From some small
town in Kansas.

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Home of the world's
biggest ball of twine.

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
"Ain't life a hoot?"

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's what it said,
nothing more.

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
How come
you never mentioned her?

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I didn't think it
was that important.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's just that
she was your first crush.

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean, if my first
boyfriend came into town...

326
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Look, I...

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I got over it.

328
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I married this woman that
I am absolutely crazy about.

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Really? What's she like?

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Eh, you'd have to know her.

331
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Is she pretty?

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Pretty? No.

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Movie-star beautiful.

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Smart as a whip.

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And let's see...
terrific veterinarian.

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Did I mention that?

337
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Loved by people
and pets alike.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think we should
ask them to dinner.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Really?

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You got to know
the competition.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oops.

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hi!
Hey, Dee Dee,
Trooper.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Lydia.
Nice to meet you.

344
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
This is Trooper.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Hi, Trooper.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hi.

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
(tsks)

348
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hi. It is really nice

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
to meet you.

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, come on inside.

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This is for you.

352
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh. Thank you.
Should I open it now?

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Sure.
Okay.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
(Lydia chuckles)

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, they're lovely.

356
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
(laughs):
I'm glad you like them.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I made them.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Uh, they're beautiful.
(laughs)

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We can use them
tonight at dinner.

360
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm still working
in the kitchen.

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, good.
Let me help you.

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What are you making?
Nothing fancy.

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Some roasted chicken,
mash potatoes, carrots.

364
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Nut?

365
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
LYDIA:
Oh, I love candlelight dinners.

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Mmm, me, too.

368
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Maybe you'll be
a customer.

369
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A customer?

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm gonna open up
a candle shop.

371
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Here?
Is that a bad idea?

372
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, no...
it's not a bad idea.

373
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
(chuckles):
But...?

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He's such a terrible liar.

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He's learning.

376
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, I just...
wonder if it's, uh,

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
if the town is
large enough for a...

378
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
a candle store.
Yeah, I thought
of that, but...

379
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I figure if I offer
candle-making lessons,
you know.

380
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What do you think
Lydia?

381
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, I-I think you'll just
have to try it and see.

382
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, would you be interested?

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Me? I don't have
that much free time.

384
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So, how did you get interested

385
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
in candle-making?

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, you know, it started
as a hobby, but then

387
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I had to make a living.

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And, uh... I guess I just love
what candles symbolize.

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Which is what?

390
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Home.

391
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I guess hopes

392
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and dreams and wishes.

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
People light candles in church.

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They use them
for prayer.

395
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Dude,

396
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you can't just eat
before everybody starts.

397
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, it's okay. It's okay.

398
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Dig in.

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
(clears throat)

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So, Trooper...

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
how'd you get the
nickname "Trooper"?

402
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's not a nickname.

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's my real name.
We've traveled around

404
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
so much, we're like
a small theater troupe.

405
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So you spell it with a "U"?

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hmm?
T-R-O-U-P-E-R.

407
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No...

408
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
T-R-O-O-P-E-R.

409
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I gave him the name,

410
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
so I figure he can
spell it however he wants.

411
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, not really.

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh. Yeah, that's right, because
last year you wanted to spell it

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
with three O's.
(laughs)

414
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Troop, weren't you gonna
ask Sam something?

415
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, yeah.

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Uh...

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
do you have lots
of animals downstairs?

418
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We sure do.

419
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Can I see 'em?

420
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Sam, why don't you take Trooper
down and show him our zoo.

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Good.

422
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
All right,
come on, Troop.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Can I call you Troop?
If you want to.

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Everybody
calls me Sam.

425
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He's a nice boy.

426
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He reminds me
of Sam.

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Shy at first, but there's
a lot going on underneath.

429
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I understand you're living
in your childhood home.

430
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah. Lots of
memories there.

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
(chuckles)

432
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What brings you back
after all this time

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
My mom died, and the house

434
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
was just sitting there.

435
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But mostly for Trooper--
I keep boring him

436
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
with all my stories of how
great it was to grow up here.

437
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
How'd you and Sam meet?

438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, at Cornell, in vet school.

439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He always wanted
to be a vet.

440
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I guess you knew him
pretty well.

441
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah. Hard not to--
he lived next-door.

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We spent every
day together.

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Especially in
the summertime.

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So you moved back here
after vet school?

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I was a city girl
pining for country life.

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Slower pace,

447
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
nicer people.

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You must have a lot
of friends here.

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, I... I guess I do.

450
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But you married my best one.

451
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Well, this is where we operate.

452
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Is there a lot
of blood and stuff?

453
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Sometimes.

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
How's that puppy
doing, by the way?

455
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, he's fine.

456
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
What do you
call him?

457
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Chewbacca.

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Nice name.

459
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How did you come up with that?

460
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He tried to eat
my shoelaces.

461
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Are all these yours?

462
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
No. They all belong
to other people.

463
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Except this
little guy.

464
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Actually, this is
Chewbacca's brother.

465
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Want to see him?

466
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Sure.

467
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you get to
play with them?

468
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's kind of hard
to find the time.

469
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Thank you.
Dinner was so good.

470
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You're welcome.

471
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Do you want me to
walk you guys home?

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Nah. We know the way.
Don't bother.

473
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Go ahead, Sam.

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll be right back.

475
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Got it?
Yep.

476
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Remember that
bike I bought

477
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
with berry-picking
money?

478
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The one you sold
to Jimmy Farrington?

479
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I wish I had it back.

480
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'd give it to Troop.

481
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What's wrong
with the one he has?

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Nothing. Just
pure nostalgia.

483
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Nostalgia?

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Coming from the woman who could
not wait to get out of here.

485
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's funny,
isn't it?

486
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Guess it's true
you never appreciate

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
what you have
until it's gone.

488
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey, Trooper.

489
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
This is Cee Jay's--
that place I told you about.

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Same old place.

491
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Same old geezers.

492
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Except now I'm one of them.

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Where's his dad?

494
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Troop never knew his dad.

495
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He was less than
a year old when Bobby left.

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Bobby?

497
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

498
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Where did he go?

499
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Alaska.

500
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He never really
wanted kids.

501
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I can't say that
I'm surprised.

502
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sam, is that a polite way
of saying, "I told you so"?

503
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
How about
you and Lydia?

504
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Any plans for kids
in the future?

505
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Kids? Yeah. Someday.

506
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I just want
to be sure.

507
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Sure about what?

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We're financially
secure.

509
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That we're ready.

510
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Time to devote
to a family.

511
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You haven't
changed a bit, Sam.

512
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I guess not.

513
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I wish I were
more like you.

514
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Never thought I'd
hear you say that.

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, shut up.

516
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I have learned something
in the last 13 years.

517
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Last few nights, I can't sleep.

518
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I wake up, I go to my window
and look out at your window.

519
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It used to make me
so comfortable,

520
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
just knowing
you were there.

521
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm so sorry, Sam.

522
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry
I fell off the map.

523
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Bobby and I
married right away.

524
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Trooper came
a year later.

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not making excuses, but...

526
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I do really apologize.

527
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No need.

528
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's kind of hard for Troop,
you know,

529
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
moving again to a new place.

530
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He's got to make new friends.

531
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He seems
like a great kid.

532
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You know,
in the meantime,

533
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I could use some help
around the clinic.

534
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Someone to feed and
look after the animals.

535
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
He would love that.

536
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Thank you, Sam.

537
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I... I... I have
to make trips

538
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
back and forth
to Boston...

539
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
This is perfect.

540
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What are you doing in Boston?

541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, I have to pick up supplies.

542
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Umm... Lydia seems great.

543
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, she is great.

544
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I guess I got lucky.

545
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I hope you don't mind.

546
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No, it's fine.

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It'll be good for him.

548
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And good practice
for you.

549
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You okay
about tonight?

550
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah. It wasn't as awkward
as I had imagined.

551
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
She seems nice enough.

552
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So, you check the brand
of the food

553
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
with the amounts
on the card,

554
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and then you feed them
out of the right one.

555
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Okay.

556
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Which one is it?

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This one here.

558
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
When you're working
with a puppy,

559
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
sometimes they
can be tentative.

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You want to try to coax
them into a behavior

561
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
with a reward--
a treat--

562
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
like this,
so we want

563
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to have him come
down the stairs,

564
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but keep your hand here
so they don't fall.

565
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Come on, sweetness.

566
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Can I play with them
after I feed them?

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, I'd say that's
a big part of the job.

568
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Really?
Uh-huh.

569
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You got to feed
them first. Here.

570
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Wait, no. Hey. No.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Reach right in. They're
not going to come out.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There you go.

573
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Come on. Yeah!
Okay. There you go.

574
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you want to
give him the treat?

575
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah.
Okay.

576
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Reward him.

577
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Come on. Here you go.

578
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Good job.

579
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What's the dog's name?
Jesse.

580
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hi, Jesse.

581
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hey, girl.

582
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Perfect, except he's a boy.

583
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh. Sorry, Jesse.

584
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Here. Come here.

585
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, good.

586
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, I think
he likes you.

587
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He likes me.

588
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He does.

589
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Now, don't be
nervous now,

590
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Naomi.

591
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just the entire
fate of the game.

592
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh.

593
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This isn't over.

594
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Better luck next time,
sweetheart.

595
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Excuse me.

596
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Go. It's your turn.

597
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
How's the
house coming?

598
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's just a hole
at the moment.

599
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Rick's as slow
as molasses.

600
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Took him a year to do
my Uncle Ned's place.

601
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
He's careful.

602
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And Ned has a great house.

603
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh, and Sam
likes careful.

604
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Boy, does he ever.
Yeah, well, if you
don't push him,

605
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
it'll be your retirement home.

606
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Push who? Sam or Rick?

607
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Rick.

608
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Come to think
of it, Sam, too.

609
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You better push
them both, Lyddie.

610
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What's the hurry?

611
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Funny you should ask.

612
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Hey, Cee Jay,
you got anything

613
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
to read while
we're waiting?

614
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
(mock snoring)

615
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh! Tell me you weren't

616
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
sleeping through that,
were you?

617
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Sorry. I missed it.

618
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh. You weren't sleeping,
were you?

619
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Mom?
What?

620
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What are these?

621
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What?

622
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
These.

623
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Where did
you find them?

624
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
In the drawer
in the kitchen.

625
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That's Sam.

626
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
That's Sam?

627
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He's so serious.

628
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Grr!
He's kind of chubby.

629
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Who's this?

630
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Your dad.

631
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Can I keep it?

632
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Sure.

633
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Here. Put these back.

634
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This is 154 degrees in here.

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But don't worry.

636
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You can stick your finger
in here,

637
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and it kind of feels good.

638
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You won't get hurt.

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Umm... Okay.

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The key to making candles
is you can't hurry.

641
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You have to have patience.

642
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
When I use that word
with my son,

643
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
he rolls his eyes at me,

644
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
but I guess that's payback

645
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
for all the times
I did that to my mom.

646
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay. So each of us needs
to take a wick.

647
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Thank you.

648
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You want to hold it
in the middle and, uh...

649
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
just keep it apart

650
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
so that it doesn't
get stuck together.

651
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Dipping candles are made
a pair at a time.

652
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Now, dip the wick
into the heated wax.

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
How long do you leave it in?

654
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh, just trust your gut.

655
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's kind of like

656
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
cooking without
a recipe.

657
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
A recipe?

658
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What's that?
(laughter)

659
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So you want to put it in
for, like,

660
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't know, three seconds,

661
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and then keep it out
for about three seconds.

662
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then we're going
to cool them off

663
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
for about
three minutes.

664
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I know that they look
kind of skinny.

665
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Skinny? What's that?

666
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
(all laughing)

667
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
(all laughing)

668
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's what he said!
That's what he said.

669
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Lydia! Hi.

670
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Hi.
Hi, Lydia.

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I was just passing by.
I thought I' d...

672
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, come on in.
I'm so glad
that you came.

673
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Well...
Oh, come on, Lyddie.

674
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
This is fun.
I'm just not so crafty.

675
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, we all aren't.

676
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So...

677
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
when I sell my candles,

678
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I like to put a little message
in each box.

679
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
If you're going to be
using them as gifts,

680
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you might want to do the same.

681
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Like what?

682
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think

683
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
candles help us
explore the darkness.

684
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You know?

685
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
People used to sit
around campfires,

686
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
keep the predators away.

687
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I think

688
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
firelight...
makes us feel safe.

689
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You know? I do.

690
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Can you imagine?

691
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
There were, like,
a half dozen of us...

692
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
all women... gathered...

693
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
learning how
to make these candles.

694
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It was kind of magical.

695
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Sitting there
in that room,

696
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I really did feel
a sense of something.

697
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Fire hazard,
probably.

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm serious.

699
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
All right.
What did you feel?

700
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You know, for as long
as I've been in this town,

701
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I've never felt
a sense of that

702
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
so strongly as I did tonight.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What?

704
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
A sense of community.

705
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know, I really do like her,

706
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
much more
than I thought I would.

707
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Good.

708
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Tell you the truth,
I was a little jealous of her.

709
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No kidding.

710
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You knew?

711
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, please.

712
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I just can't seem to get
him to take his pills.

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, well, you just
hold him like this,

714
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
open his jaw, take the pill,
and put it back like that.

715
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Lyddie, the Frieden mare
is having trouble foaling.

716
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm going
to take Trooper along.

717
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He up to it?

718
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We'll find out.

719
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Your call, but if
he faints or heaves...

720
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Sorry.
We have a young helper.

721
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh.

722
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Hello, Doc.

723
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Hey, John.

724
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is my new helper.
Meet Trooper.

725
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey.
Hey.

726
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
(soft whinnies)

727
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The foal hasn't dropped
into the birth canal.

728
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
She could start to lose
blood supply soon.

729
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
All right,
hand me my kit.

730
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Put it right here.

731
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah.

732
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay, Sophie,
Be a good girl.

733
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
This is known as the
jugular groove, see?

734
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's easy to find.

735
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You just trace from the jaw
angle down the neck.

736
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I like to go in
towards the north.

737
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I press here.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
See that?

739
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It increases the blood
pressure in the vein.

740
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That'll take effect
in a few minutes,

741
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
be less
dangerous for her--

742
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and for us.

743
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay.

744
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The foal is in a good position.

745
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Have both forelegs
extended forward,

746
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
one a little less so
than the other,

747
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
with the chin resting
on the knees.

748
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Now, if the neck was
flexed to either side,

749
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the foal could get his head
caught on the way out,

750
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
which would be... trouble,

751
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but this one
looks fine so far.

752
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The only worry is
how long it's taking.

753
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
See the tiny
little hooves there?

754
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Bottom's downward,
towards the mother's feet.

755
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We'd better move
things along here

756
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and apply a little traction.

757
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
All right.

758
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
In my kit is a set of OB chains.

759
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They're shiny, narrow,
stainless steel.

760
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Do me a favor and
go get them. Go.

761
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
(chains rattling)

762
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Sit down.

763
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Since they're looped
just above the ankles,

764
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
it's not going to
hurt when we pull.

765
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
All right.

766
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
When she pushes, we pull.

767
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Ready?

768
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Pull.

769
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Okay. Stop. Stop.

770
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay. Wait

771
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
for the contraction.

772
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
This is the most difficult part.

773
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Pull!

774
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Good. Good and hard.

775
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh. Okay.

776
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
All right.

777
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Wow. Wow.

778
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Wow.

779
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
(laughing)

780
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Hey, thanks, Doc.

781
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
If he isn't up and
nursing in an hour,

782
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
give me a call.
Yeah, I'll
do that.

783
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'll do that.

784
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Hey, that's some
little helper you've got here.

785
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Sure is.

786
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah.

787
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Good job.

788
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Thanks. Oh.

789
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh. Thank you.
Your shirt.

790
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
See you, John!

791
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Take care, Doc.

792
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Trooper, right?

793
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah.

794
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'll see ya.

795
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You did a good job.

796
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I was a little scared.

797
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Nothing wrong
with being scared.

798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You hung in there.

799
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Come on.

800
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Sam?

801
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah?

802
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Did you know
my dad?

803
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Your dad?

804
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah.

805
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Oh, I didn't know
him really well.

806
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
He was only
in town for a year.

807
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
What was he like?

808
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, let's see.

809
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
He was a cool guy.

810
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I could say that.

811
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
My mom says he was a dreamer.

812
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You could say that.

813
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
He left us to go to Alaska.

814
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Dreamers have to
follow their hearts.

815
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
They sure do.

816
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Come on.

817
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The kid thinks he's
some sort of romantic hero.

818
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I couldn't even believe
what I was hearing.

819
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
A dreamer?

820
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on.

821
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The guy was a lowlife
who abandoned them.

822
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Maybe you were just a little
jealous of him, Sam.

823
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Lyddie,
the guy spent

824
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
half the year he was
here working on his car,

825
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
the other half dealing pot.

826
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
How do you
romanticize that?

827
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
What if she's just
protecting her son?

828
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
By lying to him?

829
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If he were your son,
what would you say?

830
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't know.

831
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Well, looky!

832
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Hey, Cee Jay.

833
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
How you doing?

834
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I heard you were
back in town.

835
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah. You want to check
my ID for old times' sake?

836
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Darling, you
never had an ID.

837
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That's how come I used
to throw you out of here.

838
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Nice to have you back.

839
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's nice to be
here-- legally.

840
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Hey.
Hey, we were
wondering

841
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
if you were
going to show up.

842
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, I know.
I had to drive to Boston

843
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
to pick up supplies
for the candle business.

844
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh! Candlemania
sweeps the town.

845
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I know.

846
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Even Rosemary joined the group.

847
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Oh, no. Where
will it end?

848
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Maybe it won't.

849
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Everything ends.

850
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Hey, Cee Jay,
can we get another glass?

851
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You know what?

852
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
We have three-fourths
of the band here.

853
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What band?

854
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Sam's band.
Oh, it wasn't

855
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
my band, it was Dee Dee's.

856
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I didn't know
you had a band.

857
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I didn't.

858
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I wouldn't have even
been in the band

859
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
if Dee Dee hadn't
of browbeaten

860
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the others
into taking me.

861
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
What did you play?

862
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Guitar.

863
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
If you call
that playing.

864
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't.

865
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Come on, Sam.

866
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
People liked you.
Because you did.

867
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If Ben and Ross
and I would have

868
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
started the
band on our own,

869
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
it would have lasted
five minutes.

870
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Hey, I was good.

871
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah.
You were
awful.

872
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Dee Dee, she
was, was good.

873
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
When did Ben move?

874
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Um... a couple
of years ago.

875
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I think he went
up to Dallas.
Yeah.

876
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Do you still sing, Dee Dee?

877
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

878
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It drives Trooper crazy.

879
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So. How about a song?

880
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah.
Oh, we don't have Ben.

881
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Unless you want
to do Ben's part.

882
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Are you kidding?

883
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
(Sam laughing)

884
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Sam, you never sang for me.

885
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000

Hey, kid!

896
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's too late for drums.

897
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Go to bed.

898
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Guess what I did today?

899
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What's that?

900
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I delivered a horse.

901
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
All by yourself?

902
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No, not by myself,
but I helped.

903
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah?

904
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It was so cool!

905
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And guess what else?

906
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Sam...

907
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
he said my dad was
a really cool guy.

908
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh.

909
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah.

910
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah, really cool.

911
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Just like you,

912
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Mr. Horse Doctor.

913
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Now go to sleep!

914
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
(smooching, giggling)

915
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I love you, Mom.

916
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I love you, too, baby.

917
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Here's your friend.

918
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
'Night.

919
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Good night, angel.

920
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
See you in the morning.

921
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Hey, let's go to sleep, okay?

922
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
(sobbing)

923
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Guys, give me a hand
with the wall?

924
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Let's get it up.

925
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Would you like some coffee, sir?

926
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Good. Okay, slide it.

927
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Looks good, Rick.

928
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
When do you
think the framing
will be finished?

929
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's hard to say.

930
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Can you give us a guess?

931
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Well... That's good.

932
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Not really.

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Well, by fall?

934
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Early fall or late fall?

935
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Any fall.

936
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Depends, really.

937
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, if we get
into the winter

938
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
and the house
isn't finished...

939
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah, it could happen.

940
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Wouldn't that hurt
the house?

941
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Not really. Why?

942
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'd just prefer it
if it didn't fall
down in a heap.

943
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Picky, picky.

944
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Hey, Doc.

945
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
How's that colt doing?

946
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh, fit and fine,
like last week.

947
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Not used to seeing
so much of you.

948
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Thank my assistant
for that.

949
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh...

950
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What's his name?

951
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't have one yet.

952
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Got any ideas?

953
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Solitaire.

954
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Huh. Pretty good.

955
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
How come you
picked that one?

956
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
(whinnies)

957
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
He doesn't have anyone
to play with.

958
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Well, then that's
what we'll call him.

959
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Solitaire.

960
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Quick, quick, quick!

961
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Mom, it's my fault.
Look at him!

962
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No, it's not,
sweetheart.

963
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I should have been there!

964
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Honey, it's okay.
Come on.

965
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Come on. They'll
fix him right up.

966
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
(sobbing)

967
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Cody got hit by a car.

968
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh, my. Here, bring
him on back. Sam!

969
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
What does it look like?

970
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Crushed lumbar vertebra.

971
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Spinal cord damage
looks irreversible.

972
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Abdomen's full of fluid,
probably a ruptured spleen.

973
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Maybe I'll take Amber outside
while you talk to Val.

974
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Okay.

975
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
(Amber sobbing)

976
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Do you want to go come
outside with me?

977
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Hi.
Hi.

978
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Want to go over
the X rays?

979
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
No, that's okay.

980
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It looks bad, Val.

981
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Is there anything we can do?

982
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Well... we could try to save
him, but it'll be painful

983
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and I can't give you
any guarantees.

984
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
What would you do
if he were yours, Sam?

985
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I think I'd let Cody go.

986
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay.

987
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm going
to talk to Amber.

988
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Sure.

989
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'll let her come
and say good-bye.

990
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You're just going
to let him die?

991
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, I'd do anything
if I could save him,

992
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
but he's been hurt
pretty badly

993
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and he's in a lot
of pain.

994
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I don't think we should
let him suffer like that.

995
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Troop, where are you going?

996
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
(doorbell chimes)

997
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Hi.
Hey.

998
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Is Troop home?

999
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah, he's upstairs.

1000
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Can I speak with him?

1001
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I want to explain
something to him.

1002
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I already talked to him.

1003
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
He's pretty upset.
Come on in.

1004
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It isn't just about
the puppy, Sam.

1005
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
What is it?

1006
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You know, I've been

1007
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
making trips back
and forth to Boston.

1008
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Hm-hmm.

1009
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's not to pick up supplies.

1010
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I've been going to a hospital.

1011
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
What for?

1012
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Cancer.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1013
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm dying, Sam.

1014
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It's widespread.

1015
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's in my lymph nodes,
bone marrow,

1016
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
liver.

1017
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You must have had
treatment.

1018
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah.

1019
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It's just
a matter of time.

1020
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
How much time?

1021
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I was hoping to make it
to Troop's 12th birthday,

1022
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
but it's moving too fast.

1023
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Does he know?

1024
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
More or less.

1025
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But he's hoping.

1026
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I haven't told him the latest.

1027
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Sorry. It's really why
I came home.

1028
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So you can die here?

1029
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
No, I want Trooper to live here.

1030
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I need to find him

1031
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
a place, a family.

1032
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I had this crazy idea.

1033
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I built this place up
in my mind, you know?

1034
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It seemed
so magical to me

1035
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and I thought all I had to do
was come home.

1036
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Clearly, I haven't
learned a thing

1037
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
'cause when I was 18
I thought everything outside

1038
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
of this town was magical,
and I just had to leave.

1039
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
How about his dad?

1040
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh, come on.
You've never liked him.

1041
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You were right.

1042
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He got into drugs
and dealing,

1043
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and it only got worse
as time went on.

1044
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
After Troop was born,
he took off for Alaska.

1045
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Said he had to get work.

1046
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
He, um, got busted
and did two years.

1047
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Then when he got out,
he went right back to it.

1048
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
He got himself killed,
and I never found out how.

1049
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I chose so badly, Sam,

1050
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
not just for myself,
but for Troop.

1051
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Aw, Dee Dee.

1052
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm so sorry.

1053
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I know.

1054
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I know you are.

1055
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I need your help, Sam.

1056
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I have no one else.

1057
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Anything.

1058
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I need you to help me find
a place for Troop.

1059
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Please?

1060
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I just sat there with this
stupid look on my face.

1061
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I felt like such an idiot.

1062
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But I didn't know what to say.

1063
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
What are you going
to do?

1064
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I don't know.

1065
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Look for somebody,
I guess.

1066
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But who?

1067
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I thought
of John Frieden.

1068
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
John Frieden?

1069
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah. He likes Trooper.
He's got horses...

1070
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
He's over 60 years old.

1071
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
50-something.
And Trooper would love
being on a farm.

1072
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What does he know about
raising boys these days?

1073
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
They raised two kids.

1074
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That was over ten years ago.

1075
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
His kids are married.

1076
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They have families
of their own.

1077
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
You think he's forgotten how?

1078
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
No, but raising kids
these days

1079
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
is a lot different
than it was then.

1080
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It was just a thought.

1081
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Sam?

1082
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Mm?

1083
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I was thinking last night.

1084
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah? So was I.

1085
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
About what?

1086
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Going over the names
of everyone I know.

1087
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We could take him.

1088
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No, we couldn't.

1089
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Why not?

1090
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It wouldn't work,
Lyddie.

1091
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Where we going
to put him?

1092
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We're building a house.

1093
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
She doesn't think she's
going to make it that long.

1094
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We have a spare room.
We can fix it up.

1095
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's not a practical idea.

1096
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Why not?

1097
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Because we're not set up for it.

1098
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We both work.
Who's going to look after him?

1099
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You have to make plans
for things like this.

1100
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It takes time.
Oh, come on, Sam.

1101
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't think this decision
is about being practical.

1102
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
We've thought about this
for one night, okay?

1103
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's a huge responsibility.

1104
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
We've thought about having
kids for a long time.

1105
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What about Val?
I think Val's a good idea.

1106
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Her husband's out of work.

1107
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I don't think she can.

1108
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Well, then there's
the Grubers.

1109
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There's, there's
lots of people.

1110
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Why don't we just see
how she does?

1111
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Maybe she's wrong.

1112
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
She could live
for another year.

1113
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
She could live
for two years.

1114
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
In the meantime,
I've got to go

1115
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
inoculate the Holden
pigs, okay?

1116
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We'll find somebody.

1117
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Hi, Trooper.

1118
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Hey. Is Sam here?

1119
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
He'll be back soon.

1120
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Lydia,

1121
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm sorry
I ran off like that.

1122
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It wasn't very
professional of me.

1123
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well, you know,

1124
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I could use some professional
help with this fellow.

1125
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You want to hold him?
Hold him by the collar.

1126
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Okay.

1127
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Give him some comfort.

1128
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Sunny's having
his operation, huh?

1129
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yup.

1130
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Is he going
to be okay?

1131
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
He'll be great.

1132
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That's good. I was worried.

1133
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You ever think
of having more kids?

1134
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Beyond the two
little hellions

1135
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
we're raising now,
you mean?

1136
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah.

1137
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Why do you ask?

1138
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Just wondering.

1139
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You been talking to Naomi?

1140
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
No. About what?

1141
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Lydia been talking
to Naomi?

1142
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Not that I know of. Why?

1143
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Naomi's pregnant.

1144
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Congratulations.

1145
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
(laughs)
Thanks,

1146
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
but I don't know how
we're going to do it.

1147
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We're barely making it
now on two teachers' salaries.

1148
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah, it's not easy.

1149
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You and Lydia
thinking of...?

1150
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
No. Not yet.

1151
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You still remember how?

1152
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It'll come back to me.

1153
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Sam, come on.
What'd you ask me for?

1154
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
For Dee Dee.

1155
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
(thunder crashes)

1156
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Sorry I'm late.

1157
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh, you're
never too late.

1158
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
We were just going to start
to read our messages

1159
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
we're putting
into our gift boxes, right?

1160
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Rosemary, do you want
to go first?

1161
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh, sure,
it's always me.

1162
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Oh, this is for
my brother-in-law Jack,

1163
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
who is a real... pill.

1164
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Well, he is.

1165
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
"Jack be nimble,

1166
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
"Jack be quick,

1167
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
"Jack jump over
the candlestick.

1168
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
"But don't burn
your rear

1169
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
"or you will see

1170
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
exactly the pain
you are to me."

1171
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
(laughing)

1172
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Not exactly what I had
in mind, but it works.

1173
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You don't know Jack.

1174
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
(siren wailing)

1175
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
(phone ringing)

1176
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Don't get excited.

1177
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Remember last week
when the cat, like,

1178
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
went through an alarm
and went all over the place.

1179
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It happens all the time.
Constantly.

1180
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Doc... it's
your new house.

1181
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Come on, Dennis,

1182
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I'll give you a ride...
ALL:
Oh no!

1183
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm so sorry, Lydia.

1184
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It's just the framing.

1185
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's not even a house, yet.

1186
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It's a dream.

1187
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Maybe we can dream it again.

1188
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
RICK:
I kept the generator
going to run the pump.

1189
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I was afraid it was
going to flood.

1190
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It must have been
an electrical short.

1191
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

1192
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
LYDIA:
It's not your fault, Rick.

1193
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It was an accident.

1194
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
When can we
start rebuilding?

1195
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
RICK:
I'll have to clean
this mess up.

1196
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Labor Day is coming soon.

1197
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I say we wait
until spring.

1198
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Once the bad
weather starts
we're just

1199
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
going to have to stop.

1200
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What do you think, Sam?

1201
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
(crashing)

1202
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Sam?

1203
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Talk to me.

1204
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I had Rick do the house because
he's so... meticulous.

1205
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Every nail, every joint,
every angle...

1206
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
just so.

1207
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I had him prepare
the house for a hurricane.

1208
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Did I tell you that?

1209
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
When was the last time there was

1210
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
a hurricane around here?

1211
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't know.

1212
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
A hundred years?

1213
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
He was going
to truss the gables,

1214
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
reinforce the garage door,

1215
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
put a special adhesive
on the shingles...

1216
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You can't protect
against everything.

1217
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Not everything.

1218
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But everything you
can think of.

1219
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But you can't think
of everything either.

1220
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It was a freak accident.

1221
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
My mother was so afraid
of hurricanes.

1222
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I don't blame her.

1223
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Nah, she was afraid
of pretty much everything.

1224
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Every time my dad would
leave on a sales trip,

1225
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
he'd make sure we had
everything we needed.

1226
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Check the tires,
check the house,

1227
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
the rain gutters,
the shutters,

1228
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
did we have enough firewood,

1229
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and on and on and on.

1230
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And still, this woman,

1231
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
she was afraid.

1232
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Of what?

1233
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Oh, you name it.

1234
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I used to hear her walking
around the house late at night,

1235
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
making sure all the windows
were locked.

1236
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And every time
I'd leave the house,

1237
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
my mother would ask me
if I had enough money?

1238
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Where are you going?

1239
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Are your socks warm enough?

1240
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I used to think I could
actually hear...

1241
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
her worrying.

1242
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It got to the point
where I didn't even
want to leave the house.

1243
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It was easier
just to stay at home.

1244
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
If it hadn't been for Dee Dee,

1245
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I probably would have never
left the yard.

1246
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
She sounds like she was
a good friend to have.

1247
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
She was more than that.

1248
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
She was my friend,

1249
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
my sister...

1250
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
(sobbing)

1251
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Do you...

1252
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
do you think I'd be
a good father?

1253
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Sam, yes.

1254
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yes, I do.

1255
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Then let's take him.

1256
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Are you sure?

1257
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
(doorbell ringing)

1258
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Hi.
Hi.

1259
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Hey.

1260
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Can we come in?

1261
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Sure.

1262
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
What's up?

1263
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Where's Troop?

1264
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
He's upstairs playing
with Chewbacca.

1265
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
We want to take him.

1266
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Are you sure?

1267
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah.

1268
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
When the time comes.

1269
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
We're still hoping it won't.

1270
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I don't know what to say.

1271
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You don't have
to say anything.

1272
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I couldn't have even
hoped for this.

1273
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, Sam, I'm so
proud of you.

1274
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, we're both crazy about him.

1275
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That's great, but that's not
why I'm proud of you.

1276
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Okay, why are
you proud of me?

1277
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Because you married well.

1278
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I want to have a party.

1279
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
A big one.

1280
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
A party?

1281
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Might be my last chance.

1282
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Hey, Trooper, can I come in?

1283
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Uh-huh.

1284
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Did you have fun

1285
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
with Rosemary today?

1286
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Mm-hmm.

1287
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Want to snuggle?

1288
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Remember how we always
said we'd hope

1289
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
for the best when
I got sick?

1290
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Yeah.

1291
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Well, sometimes the best
doesn't happen.

1292
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
And then, we have
to make other plans.

1293
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
We have to make the best
of things as they are.

1294
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So, it looks like the best
isn't going to happen.

1295
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And if I'm not going
to be around...

1296
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
...if I'm not
going to be around,

1297
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
we're going to have to find
a place for you, Troop.

1298
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I don't want to.

1299
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I know, baby.

1300
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But we got to make
the best of things, don't we?

1301
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Maybe... maybe
my dad will come back.

1302
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Oh, Troop.

1303
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
He, he could.

1304
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's been a
very long time.

1305
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But he still could, Mom.

1306
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But in the meantime,

1307
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
we have to find a place for you
where you'll be safe and happy.

1308
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Where people love you.

1309
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And they'll take
care of you.

1310
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You know, Sam and Lydia?

1311
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
They love you very much.

1312
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Do you know that?

1313
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I know it.

1314
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Do you know how I know it?

1315
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
'Cause they said that if
anything happened to me,

1316
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
if I didn't get
better,

1317
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
that they'd love to
have you live with them.

1318
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
How would you feel
about that?

1319
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't want to, Mom.

1320
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I know, baby.

1321
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But as long as
we're talking about

1322
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
making the best of things...

1323
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
can you think of a place
you'd rather be?

1324
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Do you like them, Troop?

1325
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I like them very much.

1326
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
In fact, I can't think of
anyone I'd rather you be with.

1327
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Can you?

1328
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Can we still hope?

1329
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Hope what?

1330
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That you'll get better.

1331
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Come here.

1332
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, we can still hope.

1333
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I'm still going
to hope then.

1334
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Me, too.

1335
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
(indistinct conversations)

1336
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Have you been
taken care of?

1337
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Did you get something?

1338
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Oh, you did get something.

1339
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Excellent.

1340
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Who else?
Who else needs their drinks?

1341
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
DEE DEE:
I'm going to sit down.

1342
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah, go sit down.
Go on.

1343
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I'll, I'll fix the table.

1344
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'll keep it going.
Go on.

1345
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
for one night only,

1346
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
we present the return

1347
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
of...Dee Dee and the Deadbeats.

1348
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
(cheering)

1349
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Dee Dee, would you do us
the great honor

1350
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
of leading us
through our theme song?

1351
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, Sam.

1352
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
ROSEMARY:
Come on.

1353
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm sorry.
I can't.

1354
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
(crowd shouting encouragement)

1355
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I want to watch you guys. Go.

1356
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
What's the name
of the song?

1357
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
"You've Got a Friend."

1358
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh, I know that one...

1359
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Well, get up here.

1360
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Go get them.

1361
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yay, for me.

1362
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And we do have a special guest
on the drums tonight...

1363
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Mr. Trooper Michaud!

1364
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yay, Trooper!

1365
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
What key do you guys play in?

1366
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
What key do you
sing it in?

1367
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1368
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000

Whoa!
What is that?

1393
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
A little welcome home present.

1394
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's huge!

1395
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Well, open it!

1396
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Open it, Dee Dee!
Come on.

1397
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Okay,

1398
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
okay.

1399
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You got it?
Give her help.

1400
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah, you got it,
you got it.

1401
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Rip that sucker open!

1402
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
There.
There you go.

1403
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
All right.

1404
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
All right.
(gasps)

1405
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Hey...

1406
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Look at that.

1407
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
My bike!

1408
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
(excited murmuring)

1409
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Where did you find it?

1410
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, I thought Jimmy
Farrington had it

1411
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
but he'd sold it to
Marty and Neil Halfon.

1412
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Neil thought
Marty had it.

1413
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Marty thought
Neil had it, but they

1414
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
both forgot that they gave
it to their little sister,

1415
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and it was in
her basement,

1416
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
collecting cobwebs.

1417
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But it looks brand new.

1418
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's just a new seat
and some fresh paint.

1419
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Troop, this is the bike I rode
when I was your age.

1420
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's... it's cool.

1421
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Well, sort of.

1422
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
(laughing)

1423
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Excuse me,
it's the coolest bike ever.

1424
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I'm going to take it on a ride.

1425
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Move it.
Let me help you.

1426
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Move it.

1427
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Okay, I got it,
I got it.

1428
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
All right now.

1429
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Don't go crazy all at once,
you know.

1430
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Shut up, you guys.

1431
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We'll find a place
over here.

1432
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I put it into first gear,
so, you know...

1433
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Okay, yeah, Ross.
I've ridden a bike before.

1434
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Okay, well, this is
just like that.

1435
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
All right.
Thank you.

1436
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Okay.

1437
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Whoa! Whoa!
Go, Dee Dee.

1438
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Sam, maybe
she shouldn't.

1439
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Well, you should
know her by now.

1440
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
(cheering)

1441
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Whoo!

1442
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
(cheering continues)

1443
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
(squealing)

1444
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Hey, Rick.

1445
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Hey.

1446
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
How's the
clean up coming?

1447
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Ah, it's coming.

1448
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I want to start
the new construction.

1449
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You mean now?

1450
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Right away.

1451
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Soon as you're finished
with the clean up.

1452
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I don't know if it
makes sense, Sam.

1453
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I mean, we'll be caught
right in the middle of winter.

1454
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Ah, let's take a chance.

1455
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
We might have
decent weather.

1456
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
What if we don't?

1457
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Then we'll shut it
down till spring.

1458
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But then we'll be left
with all this material

1459
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
just hanging around
all winter.

1460
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's not going
to hurt it, is it?

1461
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Well, I...
I suppose not.

1462
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
What's the hurry?

1463
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
We're going to fill
that house up with kids.

1464
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Thanks, Rick.

1465
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Is Lyddie pregnant?

1466
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
No. Not yet.

1467
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It takes nine months, you know.

1468
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Not always.

1469
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Amber's going to take
Chewbacca's brother.

1470
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh, great, Amber.
I'm glad.

1471
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Are you going to take him today?

1472
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Uh-huh.

1473
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Trooper, go bring him in.

1474
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
He'll need a shot.
Okay.

1475
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Are you going to do it now?

1476
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yep.

1477
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Right now.

1478
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I'll come back.

1479
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Oh, it'll just
take a minute.

1480
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I hate shots.

1481
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I'll... I'll come back tomorrow.

1482
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Trooper, put him up here
on the table.

1483
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Here.

1484
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Where's Amber?
She didn't
want to watch.

1485
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah, she's not
used to this stuff.

1486
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
This'll just pinch a little,

1487
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
okay, puppy?

1488
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Ouch.

1489
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
There we go.

1490
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You okay? Hmm?

1491
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You okay?
He's fine.

1492
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Here he is.

1493
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
There we are.

1494
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
What do you think?

1495
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Getting big.
Come on,
come on.

1496
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You want to feed him?
Sure.

1497
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, grab a hold
of that bucket there.

1498
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Here we go.
Come on around here.

1499
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Here we go.

1500
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Here we go.

1501
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Hey.
Here we go.

1502
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah, I'm going to have
to have somebody

1503
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
come out and ride him
this spring,

1504
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
so he don't get too frisky.

1505
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Don't suppose you know anyone
who'd be willing to do that?

1506
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I'd ride him

1507
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
if I knew how.

1508
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
You would?

1509
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah.

1510
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
If I knew how.

1511
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Well, now.

1512
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Here you go.

1513
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I never would have thought
that he would have done that.

1514
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Would you, Sam?
Never even
crossed my mind.

1515
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
He's awful busy,
though.

1516
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
What with being an assistant
veterinarian and all.

1517
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Oh, yeah, he probably
doesn't even have time.

1518
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Not much.

1519
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Well, I'd have time,

1520
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
it's just...
I don't really know how.

1521
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I forgot that.

1522
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Too bad.

1523
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Well, of course
there's always Sophie.

1524
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Yeah, lots of folks
learned to ride on Sophie.

1525
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Sophie's very gentle.
Very gentle.

1526
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Sort of like sitting
in an easy chair.

1527
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Well...

1528
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'll keep looking.

1529
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Hey, say, you know,

1530
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I just got an idea.

1531
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Now if you wanted
to come and learn

1532
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
on Sophie...

1533
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah, I would.

1534
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Well, how about that,
I think we got a deal.

1535
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, son of a gun, I wish
I'd thought of that before.

1536
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, you come on back
any time and we'll

1537
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
get started.
Okay.

1538
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Ain't that something?

1539
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Never even thought
about old Trooper.

Okay, ready?
All right.

1570
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
One, two....

1571
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Are you okay?

1572
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah.

1573
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
All in?
Uh-huh.

1574
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Everyone in?

1575
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Where are we going?

1576
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
You'll see.

1577
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I bet it's
the Labor Day picnic.

1578
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Maybe.

1579
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Maybe not.

1580
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
(whispering weakly):
What's the big surprise, Sam?

1581
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It wouldn't be a surprise
if I told you,

1582
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
now, would it?

1583
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
(electric saw whirring,
hammers pounding)

1584
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
How about that?

1585
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
(gasps softly)

1586
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Sam, I didn't think
that we could...

1587
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
We took a chance.

1588
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We've been working overtime.

1589
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I talked the guys into
coming in over the holidays.

1590
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Thanks, Rick.
Okay.

1591
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
All right, you,
walk the plank.

1592
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
(laughs):
Rick.

1593
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Thank you so much.

1594
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The guys wanted to help--
they're good guys.

1595
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Here we have
the living room...
(laughing)

1596
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
kitchen...

1597
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
bedrooms...

1598
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
family room.

1599
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I wanted you to see it.

1600
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
(whispering):
Thank you, Sam.

1601
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Well, in case
it burns down again.

1602
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
RICK:
We need 16 more
four-by-eight sheets

1603
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
to complete the outside
sheathings, so I'll call...

1604
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Will this be my room?

1605
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
It'll be all yours.

1606
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Do you want to put
a bunk bed in here?

1607
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Nah.

1608
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
A single?

1609
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Whatever you want.

1610
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I bet you'll be able

1611
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
to have a really nice
view of some stars.

1612
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yeah.

1613
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It's a pretty nice view.

1614
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Hey.

1615
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Hey, Chewie.

1616
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Where at?
Right there.

1617
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Why don't I see about
fixing us some supper.

1618
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
SAM:
That'd be great.

1619
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Aren't we gonna go
to the town picnic?

1620
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I don't feel
up to it.

1621
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Troop, I'm sorry.

1622
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Maybe you and I
can stop by later.

1623
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
That's a good idea.

1624
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Go into the kitchen
and help Lydia.

1625
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
There's some cold
spaghetti in the fridge.

1626
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Okay.
Okay, go help her.

1627
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
(groans)

1628
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
(exhales)

1629
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
How much of this
are you taking?

1630
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It's never enough.

1631
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You in a lot of pain?

1632
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I can manage.

1633
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Thank you for today, Sam.

1634
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I owe you so much.

1635
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Oh, I don't know about that.

1636
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'd say we're pretty even.

1637
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And I don't just mean
when we were kids.

1638
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I mean now, as well.

1639
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
You keep showing me
how to live my life.

1640
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
You're doing just
fine without me.

1641
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's different without you.

1642
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
You know...

1643
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I never told you this.

1644
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
But that night
before you left,

1645
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
we were sitting
out on your porch...

1646
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I know.

1647
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
(laughs)

1648
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
What?

1649
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You were gonna give
me your class ring.

1650
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
(both laugh)

1651
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
How did you know that?

1652
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I just knew.
(laughs weakly)

1653
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I didn't want to hurt you.

1654
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You mean so much to me.

1655
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I love you, Sam.

1656
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
You and Lydia both.

1657
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Now, listen.

1658
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
On that bookshelf, up...

1659
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
underneath the... basket,

1660
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
there's a letter--
will you get it for me?

1661
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Come here.

1662
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I want you to give
this to Trooper when
you think he's ready.

1663
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I wrote him a letter
about his dad.

1664
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I always thought he should have
a dad he could believe in.

1665
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
He has one now.

1666
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

1667
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
My gosh.

1668
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
What's that?

1669
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Dee Dee, Sam, you've got
to come check this out.

1670
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
(indistinct chatter continues)

1671
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
ROSS:
There she is!

1672
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
(all cheering, laughter)
Hey!

1673
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
ROSS:
We, uh,

1674
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
we figured you couldn't make
the picnic, uh, Dee Dee,

1675
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
so, uh, we decided
to bring the picnic to you.

(indistinct chatter)

1685

PASTOR:
And so, we turn to the Scripture
passages just read

1686
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
and we look to the memory
of Dee Dee Michaud's life

1687
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
for consolation in our sorrow

1688
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
and for inspiration
in our lives.

1689
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And now, Dee Dee's son, Trooper,
has requested a moment.

1690
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
When...

1691
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,000
When my mom said
we were gonna move here...

1692
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I didn't really want to...

1693
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
'cause...

1694
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
'cause I didn't really know
anybody then.

1695
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
She said...

1696
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
she said that
this town was special,

1697
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and she told me
lots of stories about it.

1698
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
But... she said every place
we lived was special.

1699
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So I didn't really believe her.

1700
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
But I liked the stories anyways.

1701
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Now...

1702
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Now I see what she meant.

1703
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Wherever I go...

1704
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
it reminds me of her.

1705
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It's like...

1706
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It's like she's still here.

1707
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
