Ever since I was a little girl,

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,129
I wanted more from people than they

9
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,343
were willing to give me.

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,869
My mother used to tell me I was selfish,

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,199
but what did she know?

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,393
She was stupid.

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,269
The way my father would disrespect her

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,270
with other women,

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,783
she would just laugh
and then beg him back.

16
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,319
I came to have a certain
hate for women like that.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,065
They were weak.

18
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:42,773
I'll be back.

19
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,138
- Hey, baby.
- Camille.

20
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,343
- I thought I...
- Yeah.

21
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:00,019
I thought I told you to
call before you come up here.

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,449
Now you know my wife could
show up at any damn time.

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,629
I am your wife,

24
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,683
and I did call.

25
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,511
When?

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,659
Maybe I didn't call,

27
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,573
but just tell your wife to
call before she comes up here.

28
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,163
Come here, I got something
I wanna show you.

29
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:40,079
What's this?

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,261
What you think?

31
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,012
I mean, yeah, all right, I guess.

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,333
Who you buy 'em for?

33
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,779
I'm pregnant, Vito.

34
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,230
Congratulations.

35
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,883
Oh, same to you.

36
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,459
The fuck is you talking about?

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,839
Just what I said, I'm
pregnant, it's yours,

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,083
and we're keeping it.

39
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,093
Camille, I got a whole
family at the crib, baby.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,799
How the fuck you let
something like this happen?

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,299
No, you don't be saying that shit

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,469
when we laid up together,

43
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,749
so do not bother playing me like no fool,

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,789
especially when you be
saying you love me and shit.

45
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,990
Not like that, though.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,299
Vito, stop.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,532
Look, I know you scared.

48
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,429
I mean, I am, too, but
you already got a baby,

49
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,349
so you know what to do.

50
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,259
You delusional as fuck!

51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,149
I don't love you.

52
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,529
I love my wife.

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,080
I don't know why the fuck
you acting all brand new.

54
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,491
Look at you,

55
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,603
looking all beautiful and shit.

56
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,675
How much is an abortion gonna cost.

57
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,509
What?

58
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,350
Look, I'll take you myself.

59
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,729
Baby, I'll hold your hand and everything.

60
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,073
It ain't no big deal.

61
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,849
I just don't need no drama right now.

62
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,850
You feel me?

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,759
I'm not getting rid of this baby,

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,889
so you can forget about all that shit.

65
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,119
Bitch, you is not about to put no baby

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,369
and don't even know if it's mine.

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,680
You hurting me!

68
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,383
Get the fuck out.

69
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,093
We'll finish this later.

70
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,139
Hey, bro, are you good,
am I interrupting something?

71
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,730
No, man.

72
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:39,881
Shorty's just tripping,

73
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,739
trying to be slick and shit.

74
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,549
She gonna learn, though.

75
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,269
No, nigga, you gonna learn.

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,909
Come on, bra, I told
you about messing around

77
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,309
with these raggedy ass hos, man.

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,149
And you got a good-ass wife at the crib.

79
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,690
Look, man, B gonna catch your ass

80
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:54,807
and she gonna leave you one day,

81
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:55,641
and you gonna be sick as hell.

82
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:56,679
What you want me to do?

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,273
I got a bigg-ass dick!

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,699
Too much for Brittany.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,309
Leave Camille alone.

86
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,310
All right, Pastor.

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,849
Damn.

88
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,219
The fuck you come here for anyway.

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,679
Listen, man, you got
a customer at the front.

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,239
They wanna talk to the owner.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,782
You can't take care of that?

92
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:13,670
Man, I got shit to do.

93
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,429
Come on, no, bro, you already know

94
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,899
I'm a silent investor, all right?

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,649
This your business.

96
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,659
My business is to invest in a whole lot

97
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,615
of other businesses, all right?

98
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,119
I still got a lot of
shit on the plate, man.

99
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,309
I gotta hire a new chef
down at the restaurant,

100
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,439
I gotta send a plumber over
there to the bookstore,

101
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,839
and I gotta get by the hair salon.

102
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,789
I gotta check on Kitty and the girls, man.

103
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,019
If you don't shut your
fake, important ass up.

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,509
Everybody know Kitty do all the work

105
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,049
over there at the shop, my nigga.

106
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,619
All you do is show up once a week

107
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,709
and collect the check.

108
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,079
Exactly, same shit I do here.

109
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,099
Look, man, I'm about to get up out.

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,879
Look, me and Tony are
going by the spot tonight,

111
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,379
we're gonna grab a drink.

112
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
Hit me up.

113
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,773
All right, bro.

114
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,773
All right, man.

115
00:05:57,135 --> 00:06:00,072
I hate this, man.

116
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,694
What's up, baby?

117
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,862
I just don't understand.

118
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:12,745
Nigga was saying all that shit.

119
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:13,773
What's wrong with you?

120
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,100
Let me guess.

121
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,763
So we're not going shopping?

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,669
Girl, no.

123
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,269
I'm just about to meet
Vito back in my place

124
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,929
cause you know how it is
when your man wants it.

125
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,979
Right, cause when Tony be wanting it,

126
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,319
he ain't trying to hit no bullshit.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,579
Let me tell you about this nigga.

128
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
He be tripping.

129
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,703
Hey, you okay, girl?

130
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,749
Yeah, I mean,

131
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,519
I'm about to go be with my man,

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,799
so you know how that go.

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,769
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

134
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,493
And what haven't you done?

135
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
We out.

136
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,494
So now you just
not even coming home?

137
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:54,592
- What the fuck is you doing?
- You keep trying to play me

138
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:55,982
like one of your dumb hos or something

139
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,809
but I'm not the one.

140
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,169
Brittany, what the fuck
is you talking about?

141
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,569
I told you I had to work late last night.

142
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,329
Your ass ain't
worked no all damn night.

143
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,049
It's a fucking car wash.

144
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,569
And I told you we had
construction up here.

145
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,406
I was waiting around for
the washers to come in.

146
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,543
Damn, why you always tripping?

147
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:14,973
I'm sick of your shit, man.

148
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,749
How the fuck you think
I paid for that Rover

149
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,419
that you driving in?

150
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,409
You won't be saying
shit when that note due.

151
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,792
I work just like you.

152
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,809
I don't need you to pay for that damn car

153
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,600
if I gotta deal with all of your lies.

154
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,434
I know you hear him

155
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:28,267
in the back.

156
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:29,699
Go take care of my son.

157
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,419
Chill the fuck out.

158
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,089
I'll be home for dinner.

159
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,099
You better get one of your hos

160
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,619
to cook for you.

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,719
What hos?

162
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,553
Damn!

163
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:39,999
You sound crazy, as usual.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,887
Whatever, since it's all good,

165
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,274
don't say shit to me when
I stay out all night.

166
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,117
- What?
- You ain't the only one

167
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:45,372
that can do it.
Man, just try that shit

168
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,140
and see what I do!

169
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:48,546
It's my motherfucking house.

170
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,379
You can get the fuck out!

171
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,513
Fuck you, Vito.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,776
Your boss is here.

173
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:11,993
That's your boss, too.

174
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:13,494
No, you my boss.

175
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,570
Hey, ladies, how y'all doing?

176
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,404
How ya doing?

177
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:18,237
How you doing?

178
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:21,489
What's up, beautiful, you all right?

179
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,879
You asking about me or about your money?

180
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,530
You know I'm asking about both.

181
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,189
Well, me and your business
had a real good day today.

182
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,113
Mm, that's what's up.

183
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,399
Now you know you're one of the
baddest chicks I know, right?

184
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,489
You know what, I have
some ideas for the business

185
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,419
I wanted to run past you.

186
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,669
You wanna come over for dinner tonight?

187
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,949
Mm, well as much I'd
love to come through

188
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,119
and eat, but I'm hanging
out with Tony and V

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,110
later on tonight.

190
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:47,699
Tony?

191
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,489
His wife was in here today.

192
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,689
She got a restraining order on him.

193
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,662
Listen, man, don't be hating on my mans.

194
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,079
I ain't hating on nobody.

195
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,020
Man, check this out.

196
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:57,709
I'm gonna run to the back
and go get that bread,

197
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,369
but I'm gonna take a rain
check on that dinner, okay?

198
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,819
Of course you can.

199
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,359
Your money's on my desk.

200
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,403
Okay.

201
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:16,535
Hey, I gotta go.

202
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:17,503
I'll see you later.

203
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,879
- All right.
- All right, bye.

204
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,739
You care about that nigga, don't you?

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,539
Look, Charles, you and me is real cool,

206
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,439
and I appreciate everything
that you doing around here,

207
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,369
but, please, stay outta my business.

208
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,829
I consider you a friend.

209
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,289
You gave me a job when I got out,

210
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,969
so I have your back.

211
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,993
Plus, I don't wanna see you get hurt.

212
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,409
And how would I get hurt?

213
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,729
I've learned a few things about people

214
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,159
from being locked up.

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,459
Them niggas, they don't move
in the same direction as you.

216
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,109
You a good person, they not.

217
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,099
Look, Seth is a good
man, trust me, I know him.

218
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,129
And Vito, Vito just a useless ho.

219
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,093
That Antony, Tony is bad news for Seth.

220
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,719
Well, just to let you know,

221
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,559
if you ever find yourself in a situation

222
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,660
where you need backup,

223
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,661
I got you.

224
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,829
Them niggas not crazy, put that up.

225
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,219
Come on, let's go to
Starters, dinner on me.

226
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh, I can't get no home cooking?

227
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,151
Not yet, homie.

228
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,392
Y'all want something from Starters?

229
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,899
Kitty told me Gloria came
by the salon today, man.

230
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,222
She said something about
a restraining order, man?

231
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,697
It's good, wife okay?

232
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,369
Man, she still tripping,

233
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,209
talking about not letting a
nigga come home and shit, man.

234
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,113
Talking about we need couples counseling.

235
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,167
This shit just dumb as hell, dog.

236
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,168
That bitch is crazy.

237
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,797
So what you gonna do?

238
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:54,578
I don't know, man.

239
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:57,189
Probably get my money up,
buy her something nice.

240
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,399
That's all she really care about anyway.

241
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,349
She ain't start tripping til a nigga

242
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,429
going through bankruptcy
to start talking about

243
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,679
working on the marriage.

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,919
So it ain't got nothing
to do with the fact

245
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,860
that you been fucking the shit

246
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,410
out of little Sasha now, right?

247
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,537
All right, nigga, it might
be a little bit of both.

248
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,359
That ain't the issue.

249
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,109
So, nigga, what you gonna do
about money in the meantime?

250
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,609
Cause I know your ass ain't waiting

251
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,466
on that Chrysler website to open back up.

252
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,587
Nigga, hell no.

253
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,838
I done got too used to
being an entrepreneur.

254
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,179

00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,048

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520

00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:37,140
Hey, man, here

260
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,400

262
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,404

267
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,017
You know we don't have
them type of problems.

268
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:54,768
- You know that.
- Okay.

269
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:56,903

Always got time for my

00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,189
Then you know what time it is.

274
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,249
Now see, Tony, that's the shit

275
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,679
I'm talking about right there.

276
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,849
Cause if that phone ring, you need

277
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,772
to be taking your ass home to your wife.

278
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,009
Man, what?

This nigga got somebody,

292
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,009
Nigga love falling in
love with the jump offs.

298

Trying to tell you.

299
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:50,830
Whatever, dog.

I'll be right in there, okay?

307
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,230
When did you get back?

308
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,069
I just drove down this afternoon.

309
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,749
I'm going back to school in the morning.

310
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,289
I just came to hang out
with my girls for a second.

311
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,123
Okay.

312
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,209
You remember my cousin Kitty, right?

313
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,679
Hey, girl, you still doing hair?

314
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,269

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,743
Okay, I will.

00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:20,769
- All right.
- Camille just text me.

318
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,720
She in the car, crying over some nigga.

319
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,439
Let me go check on this girl, all right?

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,519
I'll call you later, cuz, okay?

321
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,770
All right, be safe now.

322
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,289
We been trying to
cheer you up all night.

323
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,959
Right, I came home from school

324
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,589
just to do surf and turf with y'all.

325
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,759
Your college is only 30 minutes away.

326
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,559
You be home every day anyway.

327
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,260
Would you just tell us why
you been acting so funky?

328
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,969
Vito is trying to act
like he love his wife

329
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,839
and they baby more than me and mine.

330
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,719
That's because she got her arm wrapped

331
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,229
around that nigga's neck,
won't let his ass breathe.

332
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,580
You gotta tell her that
you're having his baby.

333
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,259
Do she even know about you?

334
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,299
She got to.

335
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,539
Can't nobody be that stupid.

336
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,139
Please, bitches be out dumb as fuck,

337
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,409
believing every dumb lie.

338
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,049
I think you should post a
picture of you and Vito,

339
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,943
tag her ass in it, and let the shit fall.

340
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,969
You know what, she would die.

341
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,019
Her corny ass don't post
shit but plates of food

342
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,549
and pictures of her baby.

343
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,089
She gotta be ugly as fuck

344
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,529
cause I ain't never seen her face.

345
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,919
She ugly, she fat,
and she got a fucked up

346
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,099
lake spread, wonder why that nigga

347
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,159
don't ever take her nowhere.

348
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,579
You know what, I got a picture of V

349
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,979
grabbing my ass on my birthday

350
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,269
that will fuck her up.

351
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,333
If you gonna do something, do it right.

352
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:02,705
What you mean?

353
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:04,909
You got better shit than pictures.

354
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
You got video?

355
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,029
As a matter of fact, I recorded him

356
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,249
giving me head on my phone

357
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,968
because he said she be going through his.

358
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,549
I dare you.

00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:21,439
She not gonna do shit.

361
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,249
Is your face in it?

362
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,249
Oh, nah, I was too busy enjoying it

363
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,759
to flip the camera.

364
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,409

your Dms doing the most.

You know what, I used to

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,173
So do it then.

368
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,923
What if she come looking

369
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,209

He is destroying our family.

394
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,389
Brittany, I know you love him,

395
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,619
but do you think he loves you?

396
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,809
What, of course he loves me.

397
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,399
Why would you say that?

398
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,409
Look, I'm sorry, I get it,

399
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,469
you wanna make sure it's over

400
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,439
before you really leave his trifling ass.

401
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,819
Let's just drink some wine and calm down.

402
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,131
I'll put the baby to bed, all right?

403
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:26,965
All right.

404
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:28,159
Come on, little baby.

405
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,111
What's up, baby?

406
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,611
Let's go to sleep.

407
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:51,388
I know you see this shit, bitch.

408
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:39,708
Oh my God.

409
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:40,908
What?

410
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,419
Girl, what's this, I ain't
fixing to watch porn with you.

411
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,354
- That's nasty.
- It's Vito.

412
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,521
No it's not.

413
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,260
What is this?

414
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,075
Baby, this some old shit.

415
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:56,908
Who is she?

416
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:58,319
Nobody!

417
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,619
It's just some bitch that me and Seth

418
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,683
met at the strip club a few years ago.

419
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,533
2011.

420
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,709
You don't look that
young in that video, though.

421
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,279
Shut up.

422
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,339
Don't bring Seth into this.

423
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,869
Seth would never do nothing like this.

424
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,193
Seth is who I should've married.

425
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,880
What the fuck you just say to me?

426
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,283
And that's how you feel?

427
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,210
Brittany, I'm your husband.

428
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:29,149
How I'm supposed to feel?

429
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,239
How I'm supposed to feel
when this girl done posted

430
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,713
a whole video of my husband,

431
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,733
my husband!

432
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,639
That's old shit.

433
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,113
She don't mean nothing to me.

434
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,489
But this shit about you
should've been with Seth?

435
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,683
Now that's fucked up.

436
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,073
That's fucked up!

437
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,129
Look, I'm sorry.

438
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,549
Wait, oh hold on.

439
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,849
You sorry?

440
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,343
How, for what?

441
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,819
I just don't know if you love me.

442
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,770
I pay the bills around here, don't I?

443
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,373
I take care of you, I gave you my name.

444
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,636
I come home and you packing your shit up.

445
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:11,919
Do you wanna leave me,

446
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,223
take my son from me?

447
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Nah, man.

448
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,490
You fucking Seth?

449
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:21,079
- What, no!
- Is that what the fuck

450
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
this is about?

451
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,170
I'm gonna kill this nigga.

452
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:26,219
No, I have not done anything with Seth.

453
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,080
Are you kidding?

454
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,109
I was just mad.

455
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,159
Look, I am sorry.

456
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
You really falling for this right now?

457
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,199
Angie, what the fuck
is you doing here anyway?

458
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,549
Trying to break up my family?

459
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,199
No, I'm here because your wife called me

460
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,219
and help pack her stuff up.

461
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,649
Trust me, I'd rather be at
home in my bed comfortable.

462
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,063
Look, if you wanna leave, you can go.

463
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Leave with Angie.

464
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,779
I don't wanna leave.

465
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,509
I want my family.

466
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,639
Bye, Angie.

467
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,659
Bye, dog.

468
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,510
Don't call me next time he get loose.

469
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
What?

470
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,579
When God blesses you with a
family as beautiful as mine,

471
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,783
you don't let nothing ratchet
and wicked destroy it.

472
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,769
Hashtag, he married me.

473
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,449
Hashtag, go back to the strip club?

474
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,053
Hashtag, wife versus trash?

475
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,899
Hello?

476
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,739
Why the fuck you
post that old ass video?

477
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,929
Oh, that was like a month ago.

478
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,419
Man, whatever,
that shit didn't work.

479
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,559
Well, she can't pretend
she don't know what's up.

480
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,489
She know what I tell her.

481
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,203
You ain't shit, Vito.

482
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:03,468
Just look, I been thinking.

483
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:04,859
You know, we need to
finish that conversation

484
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,979
from the other day, and I wanna see you.

485
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,279
Ooh, can't it be after
my hair appointment?

486
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,809
I mean, oh, and can we
go to my favorite spot?

487
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,919
You know, that one spot.

488
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,194
Wherever you wanna go.

489
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,747
Oh, but look, it gotta be today.

490
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:19,174
Okay.

491
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,202
All right, I'll see you in a minute.

492
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,033
Yeah, all right, my baby, later.

493
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,573
Why you keep playing, Vito?

494
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,749
Bae, you think I
can get a little something

495
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,319
on the light bill this week?

496
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,679
Why the fuck do you
keep asking me for shit?

497
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,830
You know I'm trying to
get back on my feet.

498
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,079
I fucking hate you hos, man.

499
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,963
Damn, bae, calm down.

500
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,853
I'll be fine.

501
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,733
I'm not trying to stress you out.

502
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,379
You want some more eggs, baby?

503
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,143
Nah, nah, nah, look, look,

504
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,046
I'm sorry for snapping on
you like that, all right?

505
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,393
It's just not a good
time for me right now.

506
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,893
It's just that bitch Gloria.

507
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,349
She fucking taking all my damn money,

508
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,043
and I just found out she
fucking another nigga, too.

509
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,450
So the last thing I need is another bitch.

510
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,363
My bad, I'm sorry.

511
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,873
It's just the last thing I need right now.

512
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,173
Sorry, Tony, I won't bring it up again.

513
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,523
Look, my money gonna
be good real soon, okay?

514
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,824
In fact, I gotta call my mans.

515
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,169
I gotta go.

516
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,330
You gotta go to work?

517
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,593
You sure you don't wanna
finish these eggs, bae?

518
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,963
Look at your greedy ass.

519
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,243
I mean, I am eating for two,

520
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,093
and we couldn't wait for you, babe.

521
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:25,186
Camille, Camille, Camille.

522
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,983
You know, you a piece of work, woman.

523
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,540
You got more than enough
time to have a baby.

524
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,140
You so young.

525
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,233
Ain't no need to rush.

526
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,964
Don't you want a family of your own,

527
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:46,100
a husband, you know, somebody
that's gonna love you

528
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,151
like I love Brittany.

529
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,063
Love like Brittany?

530
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
That's not love.

531
00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:57,313
Why would I want that?

532
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:02,003
Okay, so,

533
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,769
are you coming home with me after...

534
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,213
Get the fuck outta here, man!

535
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:12,621
I'm not about to play
these games with you.

536
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
It's over.

537
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,863
I don't give a fuck what
you do with that baby.

538
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,379
V, chill.

539
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,780
No, fuck that.

540
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:25,859
You out here running and
screaming saying you love me,

541
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,149
but if you loved me,
you wouldn't be trying

542
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,433
to fuck up my life, so guess what,

543
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,017
I don't give a fuck no more.

544
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,970
It's over.

545
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,199
Is this about your wife?

546
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,649
I mean, the video was old.

547
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,530
Is she okay?

548
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,630
Like you give a fuck about her feelings.

549
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,459
Whether you like it or
not, Brittany is my wife,

550
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,339
and we already got a kid.

551
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,839
So if you're smart, you'll
get rid of that baby

552
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,823
cause I'm not getting rid of my wife.

553
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,743
No man ever loved like I love Brittany.

554
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:14,633
There go $500.

555
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,909
I don't give a fuck what
you do with this money,

556
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,073
but you dead to me,

557
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,433
so you make sure you stay
the fuck out of my life.

558
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Bitch.

559
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,482
What's up, baby?

560
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:47,969
You need some help or something?

561
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,636
No, I got it, it's just
a couple bags anyway.

562
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:52,316
Oh, okay.

563
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,467
Where you been all day?

564
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,823
Oh, just out and about.

565
00:26:58,639 --> 00:26:59,472
You know, I
called you a few times

566
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:00,733
and you ain't picked up.

567
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,463
Yeah, I broke my phone.

568
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,479
How you manage to do that?

569
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,213
You know, I dropped it again.

570
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,299
Let me guess, it's mango, huh?

571
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,669
Actually, no.

572
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,520
I was in the mood for something else.

573
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,146
So you just gonna walk away from me

574
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:26,147
when I'm talking to you?

575
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:31,000
So you just gonna walk away from me

576
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,136
when I'm talking to you?

577
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,003
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were still talking.

578
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,039
You gonna watch TV?

579
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,873
Yep.

580
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,019
You know, this is what I do every night.

581
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,853
You ain't gotta stay, though.

582
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,659
I mean, I know you wanna
go be with your boys.

583
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,059
Nah, I wanna chill at
the crib with my wife,

584
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,423
order up some pizza, and watch a movie.

585
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,649
What?

586
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,483
Yeah.

587
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:54,539
So you staying?

588
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,373
I'm staying.

589
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,489
Like, all night?

590
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,490
All night.

591
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,432
Okay, well, I'm not
watching Street Dog Wars.

592
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:02,566
Housewives?

593
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,567
No.

594
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,503
All right, how about Wait?

595
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,639
Okay.

596
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,630
How about we get some
pineapples on that pizza?

597
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,158
All right, only on your
half, though.

598
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,279
Get the fuck out!

599
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,126
So, you mean to tell
me that you just let

600
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:23,349
the motherfucker just
leave the restaurant?

601
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,069
He got you fucked up.

602
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,512
That couldn't have been me.

603
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:27,500
Bitch, you stupid.

604
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,659
I would've clowned his
ass right then and there.

605
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,849
He threw the money?

606
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,339
He might as well have spit in your face.

607
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,429
I don't know what to do.

608
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,689
Girl, sitting here crying
ain't gonna get you nowhere.

609
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,219
And I don't know why you messing

610
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,839
with a married man anyway.

611
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,399
You know they never leave their wives.

612
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,232
Shut up, Karmisha, and stop acting

613
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:47,029
like you ain't never did it.

614
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,639
As I recall, you had to scrape up

615
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,859
your own abortion money.

616
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,059
Shit, don't you still owe me from that?

617
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,159
Oh my God, come on, y'all like,

618
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,063
help me, shit, what am I gonna do?

619
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,719
Well, Karmisha was part right.

620
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,499
They never leave their wives,

621
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,083
but their wives do leave them.

622
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,149
She saw the sex tape
and she still stayed.

623
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,229
She dumb as fuck.

624
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,748
Who said we was done with her?

625
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,969
Y'all dumb hos wanna hold on to niggas

626
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,736
that don't want you.

627
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:37,419
Now you crying in the
street, looking stupid.

628
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,449
Do you need a ride to work, boo boo,

629
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,299
cause that car ain't going nowhere.

630
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,874
Nowhere.

631
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,409
Girl, okay, come on, let's go

632
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,449
before he catch us out here.

633
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,299
You going back home?

634
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,809
Oh, no, that is the first place

635
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,239
that he is going to look and find me.

636
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,839
I'm gonna just go to my friend house.

637
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,179
Other friend?

638
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,249
Yeah, Vito ain't the only nigga I got.

639
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,149
I just know Vito is gonna tell Tony.

640
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,432
Whatever you do, I wasn't here.

641
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,239
That nigga will kill me if he find out

642
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,329
I tried some shit like this on him.

643
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,330
All right.

644
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,843
What's up, baby?

645
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:21,873
Ready?

646
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:23,680
You got bitches fucking up my car now?

647
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:25,629
- What?
- That's how you feel, nigga?

648
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,229
I'm sick of your shit.

649
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,789
I'm going to get my baby from your mama.

650
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,634
She better not say shit to
me about leaving your ass.

651
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:32,679
Well I don't know how the
fuck you're gonna get there.

652
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,553
You ain't taking my car.

653
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:35,579
I don't need your fucking car, nigga.

654
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,076
I'll take an Uber.

655
00:30:37,077 --> 00:30:38,077
Move!

656
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,942
Brittany!

657
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:41,943
Brittany!

658
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:47,701
Man!

659
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:51,484
What the fuck is she doing?

660
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,591
This dumb bitch, man.

661
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,509
Yeah, I'm staying over there tonight.

662
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,693
Yeah, I just came to grab a few stuff.

663
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,509
Girl, don't tell Karmisha shit.

664
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,129
She should've been with us.

665
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,527
Mm hmm, no, you should've seen the look

666
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:12,096
on that bitch face when
she see her car, though!

667
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:14,574
And it got like 5,000 views.

668
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:15,603
Niggas love drama.

669
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,635
All right, okay, all right, girl.

670
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,106
I'm just, yeah, I'm good, I'm just about

671
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:23,647
to grab some stuff and I'll be on,

672
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,715
my friend waiting on me.

673
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,966
All right, bye.

674
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:00,374
Wake up, bitch.

675
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,509
Fuck you, Vito.

676
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,668
So you wanna keep playing
these weak-ass games

677
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:06,752
with me, huh?

678
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:11,379
No, it was
Sasha, I didn't do it!

679
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,182
She had my phone last night!

680
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:17,393
And she did it, I promise,
I didn't have anything.

681
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,909
Oh, no.

682
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,755
I didn't do it, I'm...

683
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,746
Bitch, shut the fuck up!

684
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:25,451
All you do is lie.

685
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:30,452
Vito, I promise.

686
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,193
Fuck that weak-ass shit.

687
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,920
You didn't wanna go get
an abortion yourself,

688
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,163
so I'm gonna give you one for free.

689
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:47,498
I'm gonna kill you and
that motherfucking baby.

690
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,589
Vito, no, you'll
go to jail if you kill me.

691
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,665
Please, I'm not worth it!

692
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,096
You wanna beg?

693
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,733
You wanna beg?

694
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,645
I begged your ass to get an abortion!

695
00:32:57,646 --> 00:32:59,366
- Please...
- No!

696
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,215
It's time to go, shut the fuck up!

697
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,574
I told you, you dumb bitch!

698
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:11,523
I told you, I told you!

699
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:16,524
Dumb bitch!

700
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,972
Baby, what happened?

701
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,986
I called Vito over to tell him

702
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,904
that I was leaving him.

703
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,109
Take your time.

704
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,453
And he lost it.

705
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,093
I've never seen him act like that before.

706
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
He was crazy.

707
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,869
He attacked me.

708
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,870
What?

709
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,180
So what about the baby?

710
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,473
I told him that it was yours,

711
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,107
and that I wanted to be with you.

712
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:30,418
Then you killed our baby, Seth.

713
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,731
And now, the doctors are saying

714
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,260
I may not be able to have kids.

715
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:42,751
He killed our baby.

716
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,223
Okay, all right, listen.

717
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,750
Okay.

718
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,660
I'm gonna fill your whole room
up with flowers, all right?

719
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,073
Then when it's time for
you to get outta here,

720
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,515
I'm gonna take you back to my house,

721
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:04,863
and I'm gonna take care of you.

722
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:11,829
And Vito, I'm gonna make
sure that he don't never,

723
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,483
I'll make sure he don't
ever hurt you again, okay?

724
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,240
So what this scandalous bitch up to now?

725
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,823
She lost her baby.

726
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:53,583
What, how?

727
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,683
Vito beat her up real bad.

728
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,550
She lost the baby.

729
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,717
That nigga know she was knocked up?

730
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:07,202
Mm hmm, sure did.

731
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:09,303
This nigga put his hands on your family?

732
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,050
What you gonna do, dog?

733
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,693
I'm gonna kill him.

734
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
You in?

735
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,649
I ain't going to jail for you, man.

736
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,400
So you better have a good-ass plan.

737
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:31,776
I do.

738
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:34,822
That's good.

739
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:52,725
What, Vito?

740
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,733
Nigga, I don't know.

741
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,510
Okay, did you check with your mom?

742
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,743
Well, I guess that explains
why she not over there.

743
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,849
Did you try your cousin Philip?

744
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,863
She likes him.

745
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,749
No, she's not.

746
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,189
I mean, she was for a couple of days,

747
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,989
but she left when I was at work,

748
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,463
so I don't know where she is.

749
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,439
Brittany has A-1 credit, okay?

750
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,690
She could've got a
move-in special somewhere.

751
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,819
No, she didn't.

752
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,379
Look, she just needed
some time to cool off.

753
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,159
She not about to let her child starve.

754
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,660
You know her better than that.

755
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,719
Look, I got you, Vito, all right?

756
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,420
You know I care about your family.

757
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,629
Look, just give her
some time to calm down,

758
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,449
and she'll come around, all right?

759
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,100
And if I hear anything, I'll
let you know, all right?

760
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,220
It's cool.

761
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
All right.

762
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,359
Girl, you lucky little Vince
didn't wake up, all right?

763
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,851
He would've messed my cover up for real.

764
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:27,820
I don't know.

765
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:30,233
Ut seemed like he was so concerned.

766
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,263
I should probably call him.

767
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:32,559
- Just so he can know we okay.
- Girl, no.

768
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,569
Girl, let that nigga sweat.

769
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,257
He ain't gonna die!

770
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,529
Look, I miss our house,
I miss him, I miss us.

771
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,219
Look, I can't even listen to his messages

772
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,053
without crying.

773
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:45,169
Okay, why is it that every good female

774
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,332
is always crying over a weak-ass nigga?

775
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,009
I mean, I could see if he was good

776
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,419
and treating you right, but this nigga

777
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,869
made a sex tape!

778
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,809
- It was old.
- No, it wasn't!

779
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,649
Girl, you need to wake up.

780
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,999
Whenever you wanna
reminisce and dream about

781
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,069
all the good old times,
you need to remember

782
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,403
this ho shit instead.

783
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,783
Well that's easier said than done.

784
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,710
What you need to do is move on.

785
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,249
Like date?

786
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,083
Yes.

787
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:12,709
Girl, it's been three weeks.

788
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,329
Okay, and how much time do you need?

789
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,050
Girl, I bet he out there dating.

790
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:18,239
No, I can't, that's not right.

791
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,029
Listen, the best way
to get over one nigga

792
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,029
is to get up under another, okay?

793
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,059
Girl, in fact, Angie got the
perfect dude for you right now.

794
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,729
He sweet, he got a good-ass paying job.

795
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,019
Girl, the perfect rebound.

796
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,853
Rebound?

797
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:34,279
Yes, rebound.

798
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,812
I mean, look, I'm not
telling you to fall in love

799
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:38,999
with him or nothing, but
you can fall in lust.

800
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,879
Girl, it has remarkable healing powers.

801
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,359
Look, I'm just saying, you might end up

802
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,329
with Vito later on, who knows,

803
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,299
but, in the meantime, while you're getting

804
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,349
your life together and figuring that out,

805
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,919
you need something to do,

806
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,973
and by something, I mean someone.

807
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:54,748
I don't know, girl.

808
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,009
Just call him.

809
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,649
Talk, if you feeling him, go out.

810
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,050
If you're not, then hang up.

811
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,409
Okay.

812
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,449
So you gonna call him?

813
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,266
Yes, I'm gonna call him.

814
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,100
Good.

815
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,249
Girl, it's about time you
had a good man in your life.

816
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Shut up.

817
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,589
Oh, hey, you must be Brittany.

818
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,069
And you must be Tony.

819
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,513
You can tell by the outfit?

820
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,910
Yeah, that was it.

821
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,989
Um, you seem nervous.

822
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,009
You date a lot?

823
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,069
Actually, this is my first date

824
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,523
since my marriage ended.

825
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Damn.

826
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,819
You gonna need a drink.

827
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,843
Definitely.

828
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,023
So, um, tell me more about yourself.

829
00:41:55,253 --> 00:41:56,599
I mean, what can I say?

830
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,866
The business just didn't work out.

831
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:00,795
And the vultures smelled
blood in the water

832
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:05,093
and, before you know it,
my business in foreclosure,

833
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:10,219
and I was back to making
my living on the street.

834
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,553
Well, you seem to be handling it well.

835
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:15,528
You want a cheese stick?

836
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:17,126
Nah, I'm good.

837
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:18,459
I mean, I really ain't got no choice.

838
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean, I got two kids
looking at me to make good.

839
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,479
It's been a rough-ass year,

840
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,933
but I think I made enough money
to get from all this debt.

841
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,659
Hold on, you say you got two kids?

842
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,293
Let me see pictures, I love kids.

843
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,756
Should be in here somewhere.

844
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,470
There they go.

845
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,366
Oh my God, they're so cute.

846
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,563
They look just like you.

847
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,269
I get that a lot.

848
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,103
I only have one,

849
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:51,935
but I'd like to have 10 more if I could.

850
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,763
10?

851
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:55,596
Yeah.

852
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,726
I would just focus on this one you got.

853
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,179
Let me see a picture.

854
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,180
Let me see.

855
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,872
I gotta get some new pictures.

856
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:09,727
He look like such a baby
in all these pictures.

857
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,257
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

858
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,402
Oh, here we go.

859
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,142
Oh, his weak-ass daddy
is in this one, though.

860
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:16,993
Hey, come on now, don't
be baby daddy bashing.

861
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,550
What?

862
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,783
Um, nothing, nothing,

863
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:29,566
just little man looks so much like you.

864
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:30,400
You think so?

865
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,537
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

866
00:43:31,538 --> 00:43:33,009
That's so crazy because everybody

867
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,815
says he looks like Vito.

868
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:36,229
Who?

869
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,030
Oh, just my ex, nobody.

870
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:40,901
Oh.

871
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:46,139
Okay, so, what do you like to do for fun?

872
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,568
You know, a little bit of this,

873
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:49,319
a little bit of that.

874
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,289
Shit, nigga, you bullshitting.

875
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,699
You mean to tell me this nigga going crazy

876
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,639
looking for his wife and
you damn near fucking her?

877
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,040
Man, that's some funny shit.

878
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,169
Shit, I guess we got a way in now.

879
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,027
He ain't even gonna see it coming.

880
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:06,929
Shit, nigga, I ain't
trying to stand in your way

881
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,393
of getting that shit unless
you gonna give me a turn.

882
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,239
Yeah, nigga, whatever, real funny, ha ha.

883
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,249
Look, man, I'm at the crib, man.

884
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,989
I'm about to go in and kick it, all right.

885
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,429
I'll holler at you later, though.

886
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,163
All right, peace.

887
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,990
Nigga wild, boy, I tell you.

888
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,730
Hey.

889
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
What's wrong?

890
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,089
I was lonely.

891
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,283
You left me alone for hours.

892
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:42,005
I know, I know, I'm
sorry, but I'm here now,

893
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:42,839
I mean, unless you want me to run back out

894
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,999
and get you something.

895
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,409
I mean, did you eat?

896
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,660
Yeah, I'm
fine, it's just that...

897
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:49,761
It's just that what?

898
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,930
Listen, man, I know you're tired

899
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,259
of being cooped up in the house, I get it.

900
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,499
I don't really think Vito need to know

901
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,600
where you at just yet.

902
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,592
All right, but I'm gonna
take you shopping soon,

903
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,923
get you out of the house,
let you get some air.

904
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,779
I'm just tired of feeling like nothing

905
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,289
is ever going to happen to Vito

906
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:10,173
after everything he
did to me and our baby.

907
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:14,109
I'm just feeling like I'm
not ever gonna get justice.

908
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,899
Now why you gonna say
something like that, man?

909
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,509
Anyway, I got some real important intel

910
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,659
about that too, by the way.

911
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,093
Intel, what?

912
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,659
If you scared to do
something, just say so.

913
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,533
We can pay somebody to fuck him up.

914
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:31,064
There you go with
that scared shit again.

915
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:34,175
Ain't nobody scared of
that nigga but your ass.

916
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:35,372
You act like that nigga don't bleed

917
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:37,249
just like everybody else.

918
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,199
I'm trying to lay low and
let this shit die down

919
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,700
and let your ass lay low, too.

920
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:44,639
At the end of the day,
we got to be cerebral

921
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
about this shit.

922
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,400
I'm telling you, man, you
better learn some shit

923
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:50,059
about real beef, little girl.

924
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,189
What, why are you so mad?

925
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,259
I ain't really mad.

926
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
I don't give a fuck.

927
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:57,492
But you talking crazy.

928
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,653
Fine, okay.

929
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,837
So, the doctor cleared me for sex.

930
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,650
Wanna fuck?

931
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,410
Or not?

932
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:18,362
Shit, hell, yeah.

933
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:21,030

Vito!

956
00:48:07,244 --> 00:48:09,319
- What?
- Sit down!

957
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,629
You pacing back and forthing
is making me nervous.

958
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,193
Where the fuck can she be?

959
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,113
You and I had a deal.

960
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,369
I know, all right.

961
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,939
When me and you were together,

962
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,419
it's no talking about my husband

963
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,249
and damn sure no talking
about your wife, neither.

964
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,463
I know!

965
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,510
You're right.

966
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,469
- It's just...
- And it's just what?

967
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,059
She ain't never been
gone this damn long.

968
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,769
She may dip out to her
cousin house a few times,

969
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,913
but she been gone a whole month!

970
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,739
She finally sick of your ass, huh?

971
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,439
Yo, this shit ain't funny, Glo.

972
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,723
Yes the fuck it is.

973
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,309
Now, you been pacing back
and forth in this house

974
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,324
for the last two weeks
feeling sorry for yourself.

975
00:48:55,325 --> 00:48:57,549
You done had this girl mind for years,

976
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,579
and her heart.

977
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,816
What, she got your mind now,

978
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:01,769
and you can't handle the control?

979
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,979
I'm glad you think my pain is funny.

980
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,439
Boy, bye.

981
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,489
You deserve every bit of
what's happening to you.

982
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,839
I'm laughing at you,
and I hope somebody else

983
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,629
in this world is laughing
at my dumb-ass husband, too,

984
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,980
cause he can't handle
it, neither, the control.

985
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,313
So you think Brittany
fucking another nigga?

986
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,949
Well, when me and Tony
broke up for that month,

987
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,559
you have to think about how much sex

988
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,073
you and I were having before he even left.

989
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:41,139
Baby, y'all gonna be all right.

990
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,079
She gonna take you back,

991
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,669
but look, dummy, you just make sure

992
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,220
you don't fuck it up this time.

993
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,180
Yeah, you right.

994
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,310
She gonna take a nigga back for sure.

995
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,302
Vito, you a mess, but I gotta go,

996
00:49:57,303 --> 00:50:00,389
and, look, the boys about
to get home from school.

997
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,679
If you leave, please put the alarm on.

998
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,419
Nobody has time for
them coming up in here,

999
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,253
shooting us all.

1000
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,489
What?

1001
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,590
Ain't nobody think about no weak-ass Tony.

1002
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,723
Do what I asked you to do, okay?

1003
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:17,026
- All right.
- All right.

1004
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,210
I'll see you later, baby.

1005
00:50:28,822 --> 00:50:31,512
You know, I know it's
only been a few weeks,

1006
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:33,356
but this is going really well.

1007
00:50:33,357 --> 00:50:36,579
I know, I'm gonna have to
start listening to my cousin.

1008
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,519
Yeah, Angie knows best.

1009
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,699
She said I needed a rebound,

1010
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,180
but I don't know, you might be more.

1011
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:43,599
Oh really?

1012
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,229
Like what?

1013
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,263
Like a friend.

1014
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,313
That's cool for now,

1015
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,547
but once your divorce is final,

1016
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:55,598
and my bread back up,

1017
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,243
I might propose to you.

1018
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,990
Really?

1019
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,305
You propose?

1020
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:04,306
I'm sorry.

1021
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:09,458
The fuck?

1022
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:10,659
What's wrong?

1023
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,206
Angie, she was supposed to
watch Vince for me tomorrow

1024
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:16,157
but she says she can't now.

1025
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,799
Damn, can't you just leave
out early or something?

1026
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,829
No, I only just went back
to work after my leave,

1027
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,359
and I just asked for a transfer.

1028
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,053
Like, I gotta chill for a minute.

1029
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,940
Yeah, that's real.

1030
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:33,819
Look, how about this?

1031
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,570
How about I watch the little fella?

1032
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,019
We stay here til you come back.

1033
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,119
You would do that?

1034
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,439
Of course.

1035
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,957
We friends, ain't we?

1036
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:45,800
I don't know.

1037
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:47,159
I mean, yeah, it might be too soon

1038
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,459
to be asking them kind of favors.

1039
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,923
I am still married, and if
Vito knew you had his son,

1040
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,220
he would die.

1041
00:51:58,828 --> 00:52:01,289
You know, I can understand that.

1042
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,629
I'd be the same way if my wife

1043
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,619
had some nigga around my kids.

1044
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,029
See?

1045
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,363
But, at the same time,

1046
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,120
you gotta do what you gotta do,

1047
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,443
and quite frankly,

1048
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,820
I'm here for you.

1049
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,218
Where he at?

1050
00:52:18,425 --> 00:52:21,009
There ain't no dissing
baby daddies, remember?

1051
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,140
You're right, you're right.

1052
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:26,969
But you right,

1053
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,803
and I appreciate that.

1054
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:31,464
You can thank me tomorrow.

1055
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,672
You know exactly what I like.

1056
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:35,705
Nigga, I do not know.

1057
00:52:35,706 --> 00:52:37,004
Damn, I ain't even know what I like.

1058
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:39,338
Let me go get you a piece.

1059
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,973
Girl, bye.

1060
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:01,569
Well, hello, I wasn't
expecting to see you here,

1061
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,449
eating, again.

1062
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,949
Girl, let me
call you right back, okay?

1063
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,950
All right, bye.

1064
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,569
Hi, cousin.

1065
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,403
Hey.

1066
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:11,759
I know you
happy to see me, right?

1067
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,799
I'm always happy to see you,

1068
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,919
except why are you here

1069
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,623
instead of at school studying?

1070
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,210
I promise you I'm not going to waste

1071
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:22,319
you or my daddy's money, okay?

1072
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,020
I just came here to eat and
to use your free Internet.

1073
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,589
Look to me like you was
just talking on the phone.

1074
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,929
Yeah, that was my girl Camille.

1075
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,579
She is straight wilding
on these dudes, okay,

1076
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,883
playing them like spades, running Bostons.

1077
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,289
Who is crazy Camille
running like Bostons.

1078
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,849
This nigga named Seth.

1079
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,236
He got a whole lotta money,

1080
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:44,780
and she is running him like a chump.

1081
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:46,131
He cannot be that stupid.

1082
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,719
Okay, start from the top.

1083
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,123
Well, I mean, she met him
when she was still stripping.

1084
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,230
Hey, baby.

1085
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:07,722
Damn, girl, what happened to you?

1086
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:09,149
I just saw you a couple days ago.

1087
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,649
You was straight.

1088
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,319
Still straight, just tripped

1089
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,609
trying to chase the mailman.

1090
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,649
It's just a sprain, though.

1091
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,769
Nah, that got to be serious cause you

1092
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,669
ain't up in the salon getting no money,

1093
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,379
cause I ain't never known a little pain

1094
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,599
to stop you from getting it.

1095
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,109
Nah, the shop is good.

1096
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,890
I got Shanika and Charles
holding it down for me.

1097
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:25,724
Okay.

1098
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:26,889
Shanika will take care of my clients

1099
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,619
and Charles will lock up tonight,

1100
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,520
fix whatever need to be fixing.

1101
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,354
Okay.

1102
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,409
But, shit, if I'd
have knew this was what

1103
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,671
it was gonna take to get you over here,

1104
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:35,859
I'd have took this fall a long time ago.

1105
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,749
You better stop playing with me.

1106
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,809
Now you know I love you and all,

1107
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,410
plus can't nobody cook like you.

1108
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,949
I made you a plate in there.

1109
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,549
I'm gonna just go ahead and have a seat.

1110
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,954
All right, cool, I'm gonna go grab it.

1111
00:54:45,955 --> 00:54:46,969
Hey, you know what?

1112
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,039
I been meaning to get by here,

1113
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,619
but I just been really busy.

1114
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,829
You know how that go.

1115
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,950
Busy, with what, Camille?

1116
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:56,199
Man, goddamn, I swear your
ass be knowing everything.

1117
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,319
I do run a beauty shop, remember?

1118
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,363
Nah, nah, nah, go on and tell your girl

1119
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,197
how much in love you is.

1120
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,739
Now come on, bro, it ain't
anything like that, man.

1121
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,289
Kitty know me better than anybody, man.

1122
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,349
She know I just be trying
to look out for people.

1123
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,400
But what does she need looking out for?

1124
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,099
All right, look, man, I
got her pregnant, all right?

1125
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,533
And when V did what he did,

1126
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,369
he made her lose the baby.

1127
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,488
Vito, why was Vito with your girl?

1128
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,322
Now, see, I can answer that one.

1129
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:25,113
Man, I can talk for myself, man, damn!

1130
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,659
Look, man, me and V met
her at the same time.

1131
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,249
She was dancing up in the club.

1132
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,259
So, initially, we both was fucking her.

1133
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,939
She started liking me
a little more than him,

1134
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,469
he didn't like it,

1135
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,743
shit went left, here we are.

1136
00:55:37,744 --> 00:55:39,109
That don't even sound right.

1137
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,159
Vito is not the type of
nigga to get attached

1138
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,993
to a girl.

1139
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:43,349
Yeah, well he
got attached to her.

1140
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,038
You do know I know this chick, right?

1141
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:46,872
How?

1142
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:48,689
She be with my cousin sometimes.

1143
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,813
So what that mean?

1144
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:50,647
You know her better than I do?

1145
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:53,189
Nah, but I definitely know her type,

1146
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,639
and that ho, that ho ain't right.

1147
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,219
Shit, that baby probably
wasn't even yours.

1148
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,049
Probably told Vito the same shit,

1149
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,729
and that's probably why he was tripping.

1150
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,949
I mean, that nigga got a wife.

1151
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:03,850
Think about that shit.

1152
00:56:03,851 --> 00:56:06,199
He got a lot to lose.

1153
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,839
Nah, mm mm, Vito ain't shit,

1154
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,999
but y'all been friends a long time.

1155
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,893
Would he really fall out
with you behind some pussy?

1156
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,520
Now you got one thing right,

1157
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,622
that nigga ain't shit.

1158
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:22,199
And regardless of what him
and Camille had going on,

1159
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,842
that ain't his wife,

1160
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:26,209
so he ain't had no business
putting his hands on her.

1161
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,679
Right, cause if it was his wife,

1162
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,038
then it would've been all right.

1163
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:31,129
You know, you really
need to stop listening

1164
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,649
to everything you hear at
the beauty shop, little mama.

1165
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,650
I'm just saying,

1166
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,739
Seth has let that nigga know,

1167
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,299
it ain't cool to come
between a man and what's his.

1168
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,386
Wait a minute, we talking about him

1169
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:43,469
or we talking about you?

1170
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,470
What you think?

1171
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,799
Look, man, we gotta shoot some moves,

1172
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,429
we gotta get up outta here.

1173
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,149
Listen, I'm gonna take a
rain check on the dinner,

1174
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,080
but I'm gonna go grab that
plate out the kitchen.

1175
00:56:51,081 --> 00:56:52,539
All right, baby, well
you know you welcome

1176
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,459
anytime, handsome.

1177
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,469
Think about what I said, though.

1178
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,470
Watch yourself.

1179
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,230
All right, thanks.

1180
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,159
Damn, man, you got
this bitch laying live

1181
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,633
like a motherfucker.

1182
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:09,430
Where the fuck is you going, nigga?

1183
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,263
The door right here.

1184
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,090

my fucking plate, man.

Tony!

1194
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:56,970
Look, shut up, I need you
to watch this little nigga

1195
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,803
and I'll be right back.

1196
00:57:57,804 --> 00:57:59,219
- Don't tell nobody.
- Whose baby is this?

1197
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,569
Don't worry about who baby it is.

1198
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,716
Just watch the little nigga!

1199
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:03,379
Do you got another bitch?

1200
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,213
Is this her baby?

1201
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,319
Tony, don't bring me another...

1202
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,409
Sasha, shut the fuck up!

1203
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,099
Just watch the little nigga!

1204
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,593
And how long is that going to be?

1205
00:58:09,594 --> 00:58:10,957
As long as it is?

1206
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:11,791
What, you want me to pay you?

1207
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:12,848
Okay, fine, I'll pay you.

1208
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:13,810
That's all you hos want anyway.

1209
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:15,470
I mean, why should I babysit for free?

1210
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:17,359
How about you concentrate

1211
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,133
on staying the fuck outta my business?

1212
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:22,548
Watch that little nigga!

1213
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:24,799
What about
food, diapers, the fuck?

1214
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,749
Good morning, big boy.

1215
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,023
Hey, Vince.

1216
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,749
Vince, where are you?

1217
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,923
Where you at, Vince?

1218
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:08,409
Vince?

1219
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,410
What the?

1220
00:59:10,783 --> 00:59:11,783
Vince!

1221
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:17,162
Vince.

1222
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:19,785
Vince!

1223
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:21,299
No!

1224
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,300
Oh my God.

1225
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,750
Vito, somebody took our baby.

1226
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:33,179
I don't know, somebody took him.

1227
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,172
He's not here.

1228
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:37,106
I've looked everywhere.

1229
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:41,674
He's not here!

1230
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,793
Y'all so fucking cute.

1231
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,051
Goddamn, T, man, what's up?

1232
01:00:03,052 --> 01:00:05,349
I'm gonna put it to you like this, bro.

1233
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,463
I knew you was going be on some bullshit,

1234
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,563
so I took her baby.

1235
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,487
You took her baby?

1236
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:14,919
You took her baby where?

1237
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,409
Chill, man.

1238
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,063
He at my little jump off house.

1239
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,789
Like a kidnap?

1240
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,633
You wild as hell, Tony.

1241
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,999
Dog, I know she ain't
let you just take the baby.

1242
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,727
You put your hands on her?

1243
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:28,984
Man, no.

1244
01:00:28,985 --> 01:00:31,119
Now look, she gave me a spare key.

1245
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,679
I went in last night
while she was sleeping.

1246
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,925
Ain't nobody gonna do nothing
to that little nigga, dog.

1247
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,339
Man, look, I'm a father,
you think I just hurt kids?

1248
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,999
And besides, man, now we got leverage.

1249
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,833
Leverage?

1250
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,399
What the fuck we need leverage for?

1251
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,599
Money!

1252
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,779
Why not?

1253
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,780
We plotting, right?

1254
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:50,129
We may as well get some bread.

1255
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,483
Dog, he ain't got no
money, not no ransom money.

1256
01:00:54,439 --> 01:00:57,492
What you want from him,
like $500, some yays?

1257
01:00:57,493 --> 01:00:59,419
Want you want, his car?

1258
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,029
That's what he got.

1259
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,549
I mean, he used to break me off.

1260
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,299
Why you think I was the
one paying all your bills

1261
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,300
and not him?

1262
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,599
Man, y'all dumb as fuck, man.

1263
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Hey, man,

1264
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,819
I ain't doing shit for free.

1265
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,820
For free?

1266
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,229
15 racks, remember?

1267
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,603
I told you, I got you.

1268
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:23,299
And when the fuck this
become a ransom anyway?

1269
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,549
We was just supposed to catch
him and just fuck him up, man.

1270
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,389
We just gonna break his
legs or some shit like that?

1271
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,422
Yeah!

1272
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:31,499
Man, no the fuck you didn't, man!

1273
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,933
Stop lying to yourself.

1274
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,959
You knew what the fuck this was from jump.

1275
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,233
Now you just too damn
scared to pull the trigger.

1276
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,639
Seth, you getting soft.

1277
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,739
This man killed our baby

1278
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,753
and put me in the hospital.

1279
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:52,853
You said you loved me, right?

1280
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,953
Then stop acting scared
and do something about it.

1281
01:01:58,346 --> 01:02:01,089
See there you go with
that scared shit again.

1282
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,253
Ain't nobody scared.

1283
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,539
What y'all seem to forget,
this is my best friend.

1284
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,119
Like, I grew up with him.

1285
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,699
I know his mama.

1286
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,289
How I supposed to look her in the face

1287
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,609
we done kidnapped her grandson?

1288
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,259
Come on, dog.

1289
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,269
Well, your best friend didn't care

1290
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,083
when he stuck that hanger inside of me.

1291
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:31,610
Man, whatever, man,
what's the plan, man?

1292
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,063
Well if you sure we can't
get no money out of him,

1293
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,653
why don't we just use
the baby to lure him in?

1294
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,210
Yeah, whatever, long as my
nephew safe, I don't care.

1295
01:02:45,853 --> 01:02:47,767
That little
nigga will be all right.

1296
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,780
Goodness, man,
this thing outta hand.

1297
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:56,639
Do you have any idea of
who would've done this?

1298
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,119
No, no!

1299
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,533
And he is such a sweet baby.

1300
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,599
And I don't have him around anybody,

1301
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,019
just my cousin and Vito's mother.

1302
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,729
Who would do this?

1303
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,729
Look, we're gonna do everything
we can to get him back.

1304
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,239
Officers are here right
now, dusting to see

1305
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,383
if the perp left prints.

1306
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:20,581
It's a long shot.

1307
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,809
This seemed planned.

1308
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:23,810
What?

1309
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,479
But maybe somebody made a mistake.

1310
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,593
- Oh my God.
- Okay?

1311
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,329
We'll keep in touch.

1312
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,689
Sarge.

1313
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:33,840
Oh my God.

1314
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:44,959
Here, sweetie, I made you some tea.

1315
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,659
I put a little something in
it to help you relax, okay?

1316
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,493
Thanks, Ma.

1317
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:50,263
All right, baby, you need anything?

1318
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,195
No, Ma, I'm all right, thank you.

1319
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:55,196
Okay.

1320
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,780
Vito.

1321
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,240
Yes, baby?

1322
01:04:08,271 --> 01:04:11,839
Do you know who did this?

1323
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,713
Of course not, Britt.

1324
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:15,029
Did that girl do this?

1325
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,890
Nobody even knew where you were.

1326
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,683
It's just some crazy shit.

1327
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:24,486
I don't get it.

1328
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,462
I don't bother anybody.

1329
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,840
I know, baby, I know.

1330
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,470
I don't do anything to anybody.

1331
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,243
- But you...
- Baby, come on, Britt.

1332
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,469
Come on now, we can't be
at each other like that,

1333
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,593
not right now.

1334
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,029
Look, I gotta be strong for you

1335
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,143
just like you gotta be strong for me.

1336
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,020
Baby, we're gonna get our son back.

1337
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,453
On my life.

1338
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,763
Come on, you need to go lay down.

1339
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,499
Hello.

1340
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,139
Baby, are you okay?

1341
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,509
What's going on?

1342
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,332
Man, it's all bad.

1343
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,193
Somebody done came in
and took my little man.

1344
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,470
Walked right in?

1345
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,039
I don't know, you think
it could be Camille?

1346
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,749
You know, she was fucked up the last time

1347
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,769
I broke up with her dumb ass.

1348
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,439
Do you think
she crazy like that?

1349
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,739
Hand That Rocks The Cradle crazy?

1350
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,653
I don't even know what to think.

1351
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,789
I ain't beefing with nobody.

1352
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,289
Who coulda did this shit?

1353
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,863
Maybe it's just
some random unstable person.

1354
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,829
Look, I'm gonna call you back.

1355
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,280
Phillip just walked up on me.

1356
01:05:58,352 --> 01:06:00,189
- Man, what's up, man?
- What's up, dog?

1357
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,440
What the fuck happened?

1358
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,530
I don't know, man, I think it's Camille.

1359
01:06:05,617 --> 01:06:06,767
Want some payback shit.

1360
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,349
Camille, man?

1361
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,389
- Yeah.
- I didn't think she had

1362
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,859
this shit in her, bro.

1363
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,313
Wait, where Seth at?

1364
01:06:14,292 --> 01:06:16,699
I don't know, man, I
been calling him all day.

1365
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,269
Wouldn't return my phone call now.

1366
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,519
So you telling me your
best friend not here

1367
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,563

1368
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,099
Come on, V, you gotta see this shit, man.

01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,100
See what?

1370
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,439
Seth is my mans,

1371
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,583
and he wouldn't do a damn
thing to hurt me or Brittany.

1372
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,529
He like family.

1373
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,530
Family?

1374
01:06:37,531 --> 01:06:39,239
Nigga, your family right here.

1375
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,219
Phillip, you got something to say?

1376
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,986
Then spit that shit out.

1377
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:45,313
Dog, I already told you,

1378
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,299

1379
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,633
last week, twice.

1380
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,149
Man, if that nigga wanted that broad,

1381
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,009
all he had to do was open up his mouth.

1382
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,883
I don't give a fuck about these hos.

1383
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,389
Plus I asked this nigga and that bitch,

1384
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,019
and they both told me it wasn't true.

1385
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,329
So wait, you got a lying-ass bitch

1386
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,509
and a lying-ass nigga,

1387
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,610
and you just gonna believe them both, huh?

1388
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,579
Listen to me, man, you

1389
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,869
and then yours come up missing?

1390
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:16,429
And now this nigga not even here?

1391
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:18,563
Come on, man, you gotta see this shit.

1392
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,777
Look, man, I done left
him a million voicemails,

1393
01:07:22,778 --> 01:07:23,989
all right?

1394
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:25,633
He probably just busy right now.

1395
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,653
He gonna be here.

1396
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,650
Are you sure?

1397
01:07:53,927 --> 01:07:56,655
Yo, Seth, man, where

1398
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,456
I been blowing your shit up all day.

1399
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,760
Yo, Seth!

1400
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:08,578
Seth!

1401
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,890
Vito?

1402
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,059
Vito.

1403
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,900
Yeah, nigga, you got what you owe me?

1404
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,983
Yeah, man, that's enough, you on your way.

1405
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,080
Nigga, I wasn't asking you.

1406
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,819
Girl, ain't nobody
about to do this with you.

1407
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:51,099
You are literally crying over a lame.

1408
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,700
All right, that's petty as fuck.

1409
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,873
I don't cry over niggas.

1410
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,979
The last one I had wanted to fuck me up

1411
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,619
because I left him, and Seth, shit,

1412

Hello, Karmisha?

1414
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,670
Did you hear what I said?

1415
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,269
If I tell you what went down,

1416
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,933
you gotta promise not to tell anybody.

1417
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,053
All right, look,

1418
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,853
Seth is paying back Vito
for what he did to me.

1419
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:33,767
Mm hmm.

1420
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,709
I don't gotta hide from him.

1421
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,834
Seth boy got that nigga
tied up on the west side.

1422
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:42,689
Hey, look, we gotta go, like right now.

01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,769

01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:45,667

got business to take care of.

1426
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:50,850
All right, let me call
you back, all right.

1427
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:52,385
Hey, yo, who you
just talking to anyway?

1428
01:10:52,386 --> 01:10:54,279
Karmisha, she having nigga problems.

1429
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,319
Look, whatever, man, we
gotta go, like right now.

1430
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,852
All right, well,
can we get this jacket?

1431
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,884
Listen, I told you,
I'll get it when we come back.

1432
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:00,914
- Let's go.
- All right.

1433
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:21,855
Yeah, yeah, little man.

1434
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,599
You wanna say something
to your punk-ass daddy

1435
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,869
one last time?

1436
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:26,703
Fuck you, Tone!

1437
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:28,829
- No, nigga, fuck you!
- Let me go, nigga.

1438
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,852
Watch what the fuck I do to you!

1439
01:11:36,122 --> 01:11:38,009
It's all right, little man.

1440
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,260
It's gonna be okay, baby.

1441
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,484
Daddy got you, all right?

1442
01:11:42,485 --> 01:11:43,996
I got you.

1443
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:46,529
Now, Tone, man, let me
go long enough, man,

1444
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,673
to hold my son.

1445
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Please!

1446
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:53,479
You know, as I think about it,

1447
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,480
it's actually the wives that got fucked.

1448
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:01,019
Oh yeah, I like Brittany.

1449
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,988
Man, stay the fuck away from my family!

1450
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:06,113
I'll kill your ass if
you hurt them, nigga.

1451
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,790
Nigga, hurt your family?

1452
01:12:10,101 --> 01:12:15,029
Nah, nah, V, this is what I'm gonna do.

1453
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,559
I'm gonna continue to fuck your wife.

1454
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,560
Fuck you.

1455
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:22,139
Then I'm gonna be a father to that boy.

1456
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,342
You know, kinda how you did mines?

1457
01:12:24,343 --> 01:12:26,729
What the fuck is you talking about?

1458
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,430
Nigga, she cheated on you, dog.

1459
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,129
Not me!

1460
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,299
Now you got me tied up and shit

1461
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,423

1462
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,565
Take one last look at him.

1463
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:39,566
Fuck you!

1464
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:41,533
Nigga, fuck you!

1465
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,080
What the fuck you do, man?

1466
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:53,022
Chill out, man.

1467
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:55,716
- Man, what'd you do?
- Get the fuck off me, man!

1468
01:12:55,717 --> 01:12:57,619
Calm your ass down!

1469
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,625
So you just gonna kill him

1470
01:12:58,626 --> 01:12:59,459
right in front of his son?

1471
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,784
Nigga not gonna remember
none of this shit!

1472
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:02,785
You got that bag?

1473
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,287
- Where the fuck is you going?
- Let go of me, man!

1474
01:13:05,288 --> 01:13:06,859
I'm taking him back home to his mama.

1475
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,773
You must wanna go to jail.

1476
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,087
I don't give a fuck about that!

1477
01:13:09,088 --> 01:13:10,255
Nigga, I do!

1478
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,683
Now run that bag,

1479
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,543
unless you wanna die, too.

1480
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,402
Now get the fuck up outta here.

1481
01:13:24,403 --> 01:13:26,553
I'm gonna make sure that
little nigga get home safe.

1482
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,993
Besides, you trust me, right?

1483
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:33,299
Man, you fucking tripping.

1484
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,480
You fucking tripping!

1485
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,840
Brittany.

1486
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:14,209
Brittany.

1487
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:15,210
Brittany, wake up.

1488
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:18,659
Tony, what are you doing here?

1489
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,935
Where's Vito?

1490
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:21,319
Man, I don't know.

1491
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,529
I ain't heard from you,
I came to check on you.

1492
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,089
Your door's wide open so I came in.

1493
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,933
Oh my God, somebody took my baby.

1494
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:30,135
What?

1495
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,208
But he in there.

1496
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:34,469
What?

1497
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,449
Yeah, he in there.

1498
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:37,450
In where?

1499
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:45,194
Look, look, that's what
I was trying to tell you.

1500
01:14:45,195 --> 01:14:47,479
I ain't heard from you in so long.

1501
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,829
I came to check on you.

1502
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,926
Your door was wide open so I came in.

1503
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:52,749
But I noticed there's
blood on the baby's face,

1504
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,329
but it's not his, I already checked.

1505
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,567
He ain't hurt.

1506
01:14:55,568 --> 01:14:57,979
What is happening?

1507
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:58,980
Where is Vito?

1508
01:15:00,358 --> 01:15:02,249
Man, why was he even here anyway?

1509
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,704
I thought you said you was done with dude.

1510
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:06,385
Is that why I ain't been hearing from you?

1511
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,179
Look, somebody took my baby, okay?

1512
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,409
He was kidnapped.

1513
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:13,649
When I went to sleep,
Vito, he was here with me.

1514
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:17,449
Now today baby Vince is
here and Vito is gone.

1515
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:18,950
Wait, wait, wait, kidnapped?

1516
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,083
Oh my God, man, who would do such a thing?

1517
01:15:24,782 --> 01:15:26,629
Look, I'm sorry you
had to go through this.

1518
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:27,979
I mean, we should clean him up.

1519
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,849
No, no, look, I work at the hospital.

1520
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,223
I know the police, they're gonna
want samples of this blood.

1521
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,080
You already got the police involved.

1522
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,400
Good.

1523
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,629
You don't think that's
Vito's blood, do you?

1524
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:45,220
What, no, do not say that.

1525
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,130
Wait a minute.

1526
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,493
No, I know this chain.

1527
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:59,034
This is Seth's chain.

1528
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:01,163
Wait, wait, Seth, who is Seth?

1529
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:06,829
Vito's best friend.

1530
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,319
Why, why would baby Vince have his chain?

1531
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,083
Do you think this is his blood?

1532
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,637
You don't think Seth hurt Vito, do you?

1533
01:16:15,823 --> 01:16:19,396
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know what to think!

1534
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:20,409
Calm down.

1535
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,623
Now call the detective, and
let the police do they job.

1536
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,309
But when they get here, I can't be here.

1537
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,099
What, no, where are you going?

1538
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,177
Don't leave me, don't leave me.

1539
01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:31,283
No, listen, listen, listen,

1540
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,369
you know I'm a street nigga.

1541
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:35,970
I can't be fucking with no cops.

1542
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,399
I understand.

1543
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,869
Look, I don't want you
to get in no trouble,

1544
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:42,239
but what if they wanna
talk to you about the door

1545
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,923
or about anything?

1546
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,170
Look, if you want me to stay, I'll stay,

1547
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:55,423
but I'm your boyfriend, in your apartment,

1548
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,269
with blood on my shirt
that's either your husband's

1549
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,149
or his best friend's.

1550
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,629
I don't see how me
getting caught up in this

1551
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,719
is going to help anything.

1552
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,369
I came over here because I care about you,

1553
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,820
but the police, they may
not look at it that way.

1554
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:15,143
Yeah, you should probably
get rid of that shirt, too.

1555
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,330
Thanks for understanding.

1556
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,897
I really hope you find Vito
and everything is all right.

1557
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,050
I truly do.

1558
01:17:27,905 --> 01:17:28,905
I'll call you.

1559
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,030
Okay.

1560
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,310
You been taking this?

1561
01:17:35,214 --> 01:17:37,214
Don't have to.

1562
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:56,073
It's a little early for
that, don't you think?

1563
01:17:57,355 --> 01:17:59,903
After what happened,
it's the right time.

1564
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,949
Look, man, yesterday
was hard on me and you.

1565
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,149
The best thing we can do right now

1566
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,929
is to move on, act like nothing happened.

1567
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,930
Be normal.

1568
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,509
- Normal?
- Yeah.

1569
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:13,159
I mean, his number ain't been
on your records in forever.

1570
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,899
I mean, he called me
a few times yesterday,

1571
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,929
but shit, I run three businesses,

1572
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,799
so I didn't have a chance
to give him a call back,

1573
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,750
so I don't know what the fuck going on.

1574
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:25,949
But he's gone, Seth?

1575
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,443
Like, how do we pretend,
like, that he's not?

1576
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,859
So tell us right now about the feelings

1577
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,899
you obviously still got for him.

1578
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,850
But just understand one thing, Camille,

1579
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,553
Vito dead right now cause you wanted it.

1580
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:47,181
Don't do nothing stupid today, man.

1581
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:48,889
It got to be business as usual.

1582
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,919
I'm gonna go to work, you
go sit at home and watch TV.

1583
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,309
And if you need absolutely
anything whatsoever,

1584
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,269
do not fucking text my phone.

1585
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,673
You call me, all right?

1586
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,100
Get yourself together, man.

1587
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:05,170
I'll see you later.

1588
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:17,359
I can't be playing with
you today, little girl.

1589
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,589
I got stuff to do.

1590
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:21,239
Come on, me and Sasha
about to go to lunch,

1591
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,559
and I'm about to call Camille and see

1592
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,689
if she wanna come, too.

1593
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,999
She got all the details.

1594
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,639
I really don't even
feel like being bothered

1595
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,129
with you and your little friends today.

1596
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,759
Y'all be doing too much.

1597
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,043
Stop being old.

1598
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,749
Hello.

1599
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,013
I thought you was gonna
call me back yesterday.

1600
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:44,980
What's up, you wanna go to lunch with us?

1601
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,259
Huh?

1602
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,260
You okay, girl?

1603
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:57,713
What blood, what are you talking about?

1604
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,053
Are you talking about Vito?

1605
01:20:07,754 --> 01:20:09,077
What are you gonna do?

1606
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,210
Okay, well, I'm about to come over.

1607
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,353
Okay, just don't do nothing crazy.

1608
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,700
Hello?

1609
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,149
She just hung up on me, what the fuck?

1610
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,687
Stay out of this, Karmisha.

1611
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,120
I don't want you to get hurt.

1612
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,739
It's gonna be more than one

1613
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:37,979
before it's all said and done.

1614
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,513
It'll be two or three more.

1615
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:43,129
Look, I been living in
this city my whole life.

1616
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,030
Just promise me you'll stay out of it.

1617
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,360
Promise me!

1618
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,220
I promise.

1619
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,829
Take me home.

1620
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,259
I gotta go to work.

1621
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,510
And keep your mouth shut.

1622
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:00,690
Yo, Seth!

1623
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:07,285
Where you at, nigga?

1624
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:08,413
Seth!

1625
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:10,773
Hey, who that?

1626
01:21:10,774 --> 01:21:12,191
It's me, nigga.

1627
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:21,519
What's popping, man?

1628
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,839
Shit busy as hell around this bitch

1629
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,021
since we down a man now.

1630
01:21:26,022 --> 01:21:28,072
You funny as a motherfucker today, huh?

1631
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,820
It's all good, though.

1632
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:33,519
I ain't want shit.

1633
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,837
I just came by to make sure
your soft-ass is all right.

1634
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:41,835
Man.

1635
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:44,439
Yo, what's up, Kitty,
let me call you back.

1636
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,107
Hold on, wait, what?

1637
01:21:48,262 --> 01:21:49,262
Nah, you all right?

1638
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,159
Okay, all right, look, look, listen,

1639
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,537
calm down, I'm gonna be
there in a minute, all right?

1640
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:57,538
Just sit tight.

1641
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,353
Yeah, all right.

1642
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:05,524
Fuck, man!

1643
01:22:05,525 --> 01:22:07,596
Man, it's good, nigga, we straight?

1644
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:09,149
I sure hope so.

1645
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:09,983
Listen, man, I don't know how much more

1646
01:22:09,984 --> 01:22:11,160
of this shit I can take, man.

1647
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:14,087
I gotta go.

1648
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:16,088
All right, come on, I'm
coming too, nigga, come on.

1649
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,898
Nigga, come the fuck on!

1650
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:22,982
You just crying and shit.

1651
01:22:26,205 --> 01:22:27,372
Right.

1652
01:22:31,288 --> 01:22:33,526
- Hi.
- Hey, what's going on?

1653
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:35,369
You should've came by yourself.

1654
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:36,579
This is serious.

1655
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,029
By hisself?

1656
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:38,870
I'm family.

1657
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,789
Nah, you ain't my family.

1658
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,339
Look, Seth, I need to talk to you, alone.

1659
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:44,757
Man, hold the fuck up.

1660
01:22:44,758 --> 01:22:45,591
What the fuck is your problem?

1661
01:22:45,592 --> 01:22:47,999
Why the fuck you hate me so much?

1662
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,039
I ain't never did shit to you.

1663
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,429
You barely even fucking know me.

1664
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:53,269
Nah, but I know your type,

1665
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:54,220
and it's trouble.

1666
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,160
Hey, yo, you got something to eat?

1667
01:22:55,161 --> 01:22:56,237
Cause I'm hungry.

1668
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:57,071
Nah, I ain't got nothing to eat!

1669
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,533
I didn't call you over here to kick it!

1670
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:01,639
Okay, I get it.

1671
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,019
You just wanted some emergency dick, huh?

1672
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:04,930
Yo, why you ain't tell me, dog?

1673
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:06,089
Go ahead, smash her,
I can wait in the car.

1674
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,149
Would you shut your stupid ass up?

1675
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,969
Kitty, what's the big emergency?

1676
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:11,770
Why you call me over here like that?

1677
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,230
Is it true?

1678
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,110
Is Vito dead?

1679
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,670
Why you asking me that?

1680
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,869
Man, I told you that
girl wasn't worth it.

1681
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,809
Now she about to get you locked up.

1682
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,299
Man, that crazy bitch is lying.

1683
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,378
Ain't nobody even seen that nigga.

1684
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,559
Man, Seth, this not like you.

1685
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,109
But you keeping really bad company,

1686
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:35,669
and if somebody did do something to Vito,

1687
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,603
they need to turn theyself in.

1688
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,523
Look, man, I'm gonna holler at her

1689
01:23:40,524 --> 01:23:42,039
and see what the fuck she talking about,

1690
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,729
but I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1691
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:46,839
Man, you know Camille love
a lot of attention, man.

1692
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,720
I just pray my man all right

1693
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:49,609
cause I know Brittany going crazy.

1694
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:50,610
Yeah, me too.

1695
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,633
But if Vito is dead,

1696
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:56,659
then his wife deserves
to bury him properly.

1697
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,859
Listen, like I said,
man, Vito a wild boy.

1698
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,169
You know how he do.

1699
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,719
He probably just laid up
with a bitch or something.

1700
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,933
Listen, man, I gotta get
back to work, all right?

1701
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:07,242
I'll see you around.

1702
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:18,519
You know, next he come through,

1703
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,609
you should have some food.

1704
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,560
That's the only reason he come through.

1705
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:26,549
You ain't got shit else.

1706
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,000
Would you get the fuck out?

1707
01:24:33,992 --> 01:24:34,883
Man, I told you from jump, nigga,

1708
01:24:34,884 --> 01:24:35,983
I ain't going to jail.

1709
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,029
Nigga, I done already told you, man,

1710
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,289
Camille just as deep
in this shit as we is.

1711
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:43,379
And Kitty, that's my girl, nigga.

1712
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,130
She ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

1713
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:49,669
Yeah, I hope so, cause
if she go to the cops,

1714
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:52,823
she ain't safe, your
businesses ain't safe.

1715
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,429
Oh yeah, Vito got a wife
that's still breathing.

1716
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,493
She ain't safe.

1717
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,449
And that crazy bitch you fucking,

1718
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:02,559
oh yeah, she for sure ain't safe.

1719
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,069
You know, you might as
well just move out of state

1720
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,949
cause, nigga, you ain't safe.

1721
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,099
Nigga, is that a fucking threat?

1722
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,199
No, it's the fucking truth.

1723
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,700
You think this shit is a game.

1724
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,300
Ain't nobody playing but you.

1725
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,379
Look, I done already told you, bro,

1726
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,839
ain't nobody going to the fucking police.

1727
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,490
You over-thinking this shit, man.

1728
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:24,110
Yeah, we'll see about that.

1729
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,900
Bitch.

1730
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,769
The driver's license has him identified

1731
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:49,093
as a Mr. Vincent Tate.

1732
01:25:49,094 --> 01:25:50,619
Is this the guy?

1733
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,099
Yep, that's him.

1734
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:52,933
So what do you think the odds are

1735
01:25:52,934 --> 01:25:55,423
that this is the same blood
that was on that baby?

1736
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,449
Good question.

1737
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,309
But what I can't understand is

1738
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,476
his small footprints around
the body and a lot of fluid.

1739
01:26:03,477 --> 01:26:05,895
We have to test that fluid
to see if it match the boy.

1740
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:07,429
Okay, good, so now we gotta figure out

1741
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:10,260
how that baby got here
and how Vito knew to come.

1742
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,169
Right.

1743
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:15,689
We got four different
footprints from adult men.

1744
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:18,769
We got one form the
vagrant who found the body,

1745
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:21,099
one from Mr. Tate himself,

1746
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,100
and two unknown.

1747
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,779
Well, that's interesting
because the wife

1748
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,830
did mention a friend.

1749
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,499
Let's go find out what size shoe he wears.

1750
01:26:41,513 --> 01:26:42,846
What the fuck?

1751
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,539
Do you like to do shit to piss me off?

1752
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,529
Or are you just that dumb?

1753
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:49,980
What are you talking about?

1754
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,379
You drunk?

1755
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:56,400
Is that what happened, you dumb bitch?

1756
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,313
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1757
01:26:57,314 --> 01:26:59,309
You done told Karmisha everything!

1758
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,213
The one thing I told you not to do.

1759
01:27:03,627 --> 01:27:05,089
No, I didn't.

1760
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,929
- Maybe Tony told Sasha.
- Fat Tony ain't told

1761
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:08,763
nobody shit!
Okay, okay.

1762
01:27:08,764 --> 01:27:10,482
And as a matter of
fact, that nigga told me

1763
01:27:10,483 --> 01:27:13,463
if I don't fix this shit, we all dead!

1764
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,863
Oh, jail looking real good
right now, though, ain't it?

1765
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,076
I didn't do anything,
I promise, I didn't.

1766
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:25,389
You know what, when I get back,

1767
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:26,779
- I want you gone.
- What?

1768
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,679
I don't care where you go.

1769
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,621
I don't have many oney.

1770
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:32,942
Understand this,

1771
01:27:32,943 --> 01:27:34,732
you better take some of
that motherfucking shit back

1772
01:27:34,733 --> 01:27:37,449
that I bought you, stop at the pawn shop

1773
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,979
on the way out of town,
and when I get back,

1774
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,339
if I see your face again,

1775
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,180
I'll kill your ass myself.

1776
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:05,779
Seth Matthews?

1777
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,159
Yeah.

1778
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,191
Does this belong to you?

1779
01:28:09,192 --> 01:28:10,519
Yeah, how'd y'all get it?

1780
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,979
It was evidence from a crime scene.

1781
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,793
Do you know a Mr. Vincent Tate?

1782
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:17,350
Vito dead?

1783
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,906
Yeah, he is.

1784
01:28:20,907 --> 01:28:23,579
But I believe that you already knew that.

1785
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,530
Are those the shoes you wore yesterday?

1786
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,393
Yeah.

1787
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:28,839
Good, we need 'em.

1788
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,409
- What?
- Come on, book him.

1789
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,017
Sir, you under arrest.

1790
01:28:32,018 --> 01:28:34,098
You have the right to remain silent.

1791
01:28:34,099 --> 01:28:35,086
This is some
fucking bullshit, man.

1792
01:28:35,086 --> 01:28:36,086
Anything you say.

1793
01:28:38,884 --> 01:28:39,884
Oh my God.

1794
01:28:48,821 --> 01:28:50,488
That bitch Karmisha!

1795
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,883
You dumb ass ho!

1796
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:12,219
What?

1797
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:18,243
Bitch, when I fucking see
you, it's on sight, flat!

1798
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:20,955
What?

1799
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Mrs. Tate?

1800
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:44,653
We found your husband.

1801
01:29:46,203 --> 01:29:47,253
- I regret...
- No, no!

1802
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:53,307
- No, no, no, no!
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

1803
01:30:02,345 --> 01:30:03,512
Why, why, why?

1804
01:30:13,086 --> 01:30:18,086
I knew this bitch was lying.

1805
01:30:24,013 --> 01:30:25,263
Wake up, bitch.

1806
01:30:26,157 --> 01:30:30,733
The fuck?

1807
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:32,309
Yeah, you want it, right?

1808
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:35,483
No, fuck, didn't I tell you to leave it?

1809
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:38,790
Bitch!

1810
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:52,095
Oh God, oh
God, oh God, no, no, no!

1811
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,096
Oh God!

1812
01:31:00,262 --> 01:31:01,929
I told you.

1813
01:31:03,034 --> 01:31:03,867
Get off of me!

1814
01:31:03,868 --> 01:31:06,100
I told you to keep
your fucking mouth shut.

1815
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:07,759
Get off me!

1816
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,443
I told you to
keep your mouth shut!

1817
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,720
Let go, let go.

1818
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,789
Well, well, well.

1819
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:39,148
Look what we have here.

1820
01:31:39,149 --> 01:31:40,617
Guess you like him, after all.

1821
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:54,768
Hey.

1822
01:31:54,769 --> 01:31:55,873
How are you?

1823
01:31:55,874 --> 01:31:56,874
I'm good.

1824
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:02,563
Appreciate it.

1825
01:32:04,133 --> 01:32:05,431
Thank you.

1826
01:32:05,432 --> 01:32:06,432
- Hey.
- Hey.

1827
01:32:07,282 --> 01:32:08,782
- Hey.
- It's good.

1828
01:32:10,201 --> 01:32:11,292
What's going on?

1829
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:12,573
Seth, what can we say?

1830
01:32:14,213 --> 01:32:15,253
It is what it is.

1831
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,480
How are you?

1832
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:19,772
I mean, I'm good.

1833
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:21,393
They believe me about that bitch, so.

1834
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:25,879
We know you were locked up,

1835
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,269
so we took up a collection
to pay for the funeral.

1836
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:30,103
Yeah.

1837
01:32:30,104 --> 01:32:31,239
Oh, that's what's up.

1838
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,949
V family gonna really appreciate that.

1839
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,229
V?

1840
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,230
Kitty.

1841
01:32:37,622 --> 01:32:39,279
- What you mean Kitty?
- We just glad you got out

1842
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,923
in time to make it to the funeral.

1843
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,740
You mean Kitty gone?

1844
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,094
We thought you knew.

1845
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:50,680
No, I didn't know, man, come
on, man, don't tell me that.

1846
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:51,650
Come on.

1847
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,650
Fuck!

1848
01:32:54,086 --> 01:32:55,952
I'm so sorry.

1849
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:57,614
Don't tell me that, man.

1850
01:32:57,615 --> 01:32:58,948
- God!
- I'm sorry.

1851
01:33:04,224 --> 01:33:05,057
He didn't know.

1852
01:33:05,058 --> 01:33:06,599
He taking it pretty hard.

1853
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,829
Kitty was in love
with him and he knew it.

1854
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:11,809
He used her to run his
business and feed him.

1855
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:14,069
I don't feel sorry for his ho ass.

1856
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:15,070
Damn, Charles!

1857
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,939
He might not have been in love with her

1858
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,989
but he did care about her.

1859
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:22,769
And we all feel bad about
what happened to her.

1860
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,179
But not everybody feel guilty.

1861
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,230
You know something.

1862
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,720
Oh, shit!

1863
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:42,375
Bitch, man!

1864
01:33:47,533 --> 01:33:49,359
I hope your ass left town

1865
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,099
cause when I see you, I'm gonna finish

1866
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,310
what Vito started.

1867
01:33:53,643 --> 01:33:54,643
Fuck!

1868
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:07,790
What's good, my nigga?

1869
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,169
What up, dog?

1870
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,670
Shit, chilling, man.

1871
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:14,659
You heard they let your boy out?

1872
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,960
They let that nigga out?

1873
01:34:17,072 --> 01:34:18,878
You know what I mean.

1874
01:34:18,879 --> 01:34:20,379
What you gonna do?

1875
01:34:21,672 --> 01:34:23,041
Man, don't worry about
all that shit, man.

1876
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,992
You got my money?

1877
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,990
I ain't shorted you yet.

1878
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:29,869
You need to let me go on
ahead and handle that.

1879
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,420
Man, let me think on that
shit for a minute, man.

1880
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:35,687
All that shit better be here.

1881
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:41,333
All right.

1882
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,343
These hos so dumb.

1883
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:44,499
Who?

1884
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,709
Camille.

1885
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:46,899
Ever since she got down on Seth,

1886
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,350
she can't even lay low right.

1887
01:35:49,515 --> 01:35:51,265
Karmisha about to jump out the bar.

1888
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:54,513
I swear y'all females crazy as hell.

1889
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:57,289
Look, I gotta make this quick run.

1890
01:35:57,290 --> 01:36:00,669
When I get back, the rest
of this shit better be off.

1891
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:03,378
We gotta wait til you get back?

1892
01:36:03,379 --> 01:36:06,115

- Girl, get your ass up.

1905
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,839
I'm sorry, look, I just been so tired.

Don't even try it.

1907
01:36:40,443 --> 01:36:42,806
I been around, I know
exactly what this is.

1908
01:36:42,807 --> 01:36:45,529
You're a grieving widow
who'd rather be numb

1909
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,663
than feel the pain.

1910
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:49,770
Listen,

1911
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:54,883
and I'm a grieving mother who understands.

1912
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,239
We're all that little boy back there has.

1913
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,963
We have to fight for him.

1914
01:37:04,162 --> 01:37:05,329
I know.

1915
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:09,059
It's just I can't eat, I can't sleep.

1916
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:11,083
The pills, they help me.

1917
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:15,319
I been going to
counseling at the church.

1918
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,653
Phillip's been taking me.

1919
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,493
They also have counseling
for substance abuse.

1920
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:24,819
Go get the word, baby.

1921
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,263
Talk to somebody.

1922
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,650
But we not doing this.

1923
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:34,773
Okay, I'm a-go.

1924
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,047
Ain't got none of your
niggas with you now, bitch!

1925
01:37:40,048 --> 01:37:42,041
I told you not to fuck with me, bitch!

1926
01:37:42,042 --> 01:37:43,459
Help!

1927
01:37:44,438 --> 01:37:45,803
Man, get her outta here, man.

1928
01:37:46,636 --> 01:37:48,535
Fuck you, bitch!

1929
01:37:48,536 --> 01:37:49,710
Sweetheart, are you good?

1930
01:37:50,543 --> 01:37:51,845
Get her going, man.

1931
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:23,189
I'm surprised you
didn't bring that one girl

1932
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,740
you always running around with.

1933
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,319
Nah, I ain't seen her
ass in like three weeks.

1934
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,399
She wasn't really real, though.

1935
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,039
It's just fucked up I had
to lose a couple homies

1936
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,333
to even see that shit.

1937
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,300
You know, Seth,

1938
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,906
it's times like these we
really need to come together,

1939
01:38:41,907 --> 01:38:43,883
and we really gotta support each other.

1940
01:38:46,048 --> 01:38:48,279
I feel you, man, it's just,

1941
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,709
she was just such a good girl,
you know what I'm saying?

1942
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:53,699
And whatever that bullshit
was that she was caught up in,

1943
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,089
I know it didn't have
nothing to do with her.

1944
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:58,429
I think Charles saw something.

1945
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:59,430
Our Charles?

1946
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:03,472
- Yeah.
- What you think he saw?

1947
01:39:03,473 --> 01:39:05,513
I don't know, he adored Kitty.

1948
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,129
And when he got out of jail,
she looked out for him.

1949
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:12,444
He used to ride past her house
to make sure she was good.

1950
01:39:12,445 --> 01:39:13,766
Really?

1951
01:39:13,767 --> 01:39:16,119
And I know this because Kitty told me.

1952
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,484
She thought it was so cute that he

1953
01:39:17,485 --> 01:39:18,318
was trying to protect her.

1954
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:19,740
I just feel like he saw something.

1955
01:39:22,839 --> 01:39:24,769
You know, wait, I'm gonna holler at him.

1956
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:26,843
He should be
pulling up in a minute.

1957
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,180
Coming to you live

1958
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:43,119
from Detroit's west side.

1959
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,939
32-year-old male Seth Matthews

1960
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,199
was gunned down this afternoon

1961
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,079
outside of a local business.

1962
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,249
Police are still speaking with witnesses

1963
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:55,250
as the investigation continues
for any possible suspects.

1964
01:39:55,341 --> 01:39:57,191
This story will update tonight at 10.

1965
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,877
Good morning, saints.

1966
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:04,997
Good morning, Pastor.

1967
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:07,859
This morning, I want
to touch you on the term

1968
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:12,860
deceitful, guilty, or involving deceit,

1969
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,453
misleading or being deceitful,

1970
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:23,220
untrustworthy, two-faced, and dishonest.

1971
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:26,910
Now I know,

1972
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:30,110
people out there in my congregation,

1973
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,669
it's probably there were individuals

1974
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:35,743
that's been deceitful or misleading.

1975
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,123
I know before I became a pastor,

1976
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,203
I was the one being deceitful.

1977
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:47,873
I was the one misleading
and running amuck.

1978
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:52,889
But, Lord, Lord delivered me.

1979
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:54,183
He turned my life around.

1980
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,453
He changed me to the guy I am today.

1981
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,943
But understand this,

1982
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:07,489
before you turn your life around,

1983
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:09,223
you have to give yourself to God,

1984
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:14,207
you have to be willing
to turn your life around.

1985
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:16,370
If you don't,

1986
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,913
they'll be burying you six feet deep,

1987
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,109
or you might get someone else killed

1988
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:27,393
for misleading them to an unknown past.

1989
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:31,083
But, you know, last night,

1990
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,669
as I'm contemplating what
I want to talk about today

1991
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:38,639
to my beautiful people out there,

1992
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,480
I ran across a scripture, Psalms 43:1.

1993
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,853
It says,

1994
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,053
vindicate me, my God,

1995
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:54,373
and plead my cause against
an unfaithful nation,

1996
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:59,883
rescue me from those who
are deceitful and wicked.

1997
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:04,159
Now, everybody, you look at your person

1998
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,373
next to you right now.

1999
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:07,533
Grab they hand.

2000
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,253
You feel that warm hand?

2001
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,613
That body, that body of God.

2002
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:23,373
Right now, before I let you guys go,

2003
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:26,043
I want you all to bow your heads.

2004
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:38,239
Looks like you could use a friend.

2005
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,130
What's wrong?

2006
01:42:39,131 --> 01:42:40,393
Everything okay?

2007
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:43,853
I don't belong here.

2008
01:42:46,253 --> 01:42:47,429
What's going on?

2009
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:50,459
I've done too much.

2010
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:53,434
I feel like God hates me.

2011
01:42:53,435 --> 01:42:55,709
Listen, God loves us.

2012
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:58,269
He loves us so much more
than we could love ourselves,

2013
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:00,169
more than we could love one another.

2014
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:02,139
Come on, let's go back upstairs.

2015
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,540
It's gonna be okay, come on.

2016
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,489
Look, I came here at my lowest.

2017
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,213
My husband had just died.

2018
01:43:16,334 --> 01:43:18,609
I didn't feel like God loved me, either.

2019
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:19,879
But I been going to counseling here,

2020
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,563
and the pastor, he is so nice.

2021
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,513
I been doing a lot better.

2022
01:43:25,514 --> 01:43:27,443
You just gotta take it one day at a time.

2023
01:43:28,937 --> 01:43:29,796
Okay.

2024
01:43:29,796 --> 01:43:30,796
Okay, come on.

2025
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:53,920
Tony.

2026
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:56,033
Why are my kids not here?

2027
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:59,838
Every time I come to see
them, you got them hiding.

2028
01:43:59,839 --> 01:44:01,519
I'm not hiding them.

2029
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,209
They just staying with
my mother for a while.

2030
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,210
Why?

2031
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:09,009
Look, after you killed Vito,

2032
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:10,139
I knew it was only a matter of time

2033
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,290
before you come for me.

2034
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,709
Gloria, you're my wife.

2035
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,259
I'd rather be your widow.

2036
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,093
You know you'd have to kill me, right?

2037
01:44:16,094 --> 01:44:17,523
You came to kill me.

2038
01:44:22,283 --> 01:44:25,369
I came to make this right.

2039
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:28,399
Nah, you came to silence me.

2040
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,493
You done got yourself in way too deep,

2041
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,039
and now you trying to get yourself out.

2042
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,279
First, it was just
scamming and some money,

2043
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,619
but I know you would do whatever it takes

2044
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,620
to get out.

2045
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:40,550
Remember how we met?

2046
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,973
Yeah, I remember.

2047
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:49,209
I was 16, and I was sneaking out the house

2048
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:51,429
to go see a Dru Hill concert,

2049
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:52,923
and when I got off the bus,

2050
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:55,529
you was beating up a little boy

2051
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:57,739
for his shoes and for some tickets.

2052
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:59,603
I really wanted to go to that concert.

2053
01:44:59,604 --> 01:45:00,947
Yeah, and
everybody know when you

2054
01:45:00,948 --> 01:45:03,099
really want something, you take it.

2055
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,100
You liked me.

2056
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,983
No, I just thought you was exciting.

2057
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,279
I ain't changed.

2058
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,280
I have.

2059
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,433
Gloria, you know what's
about to happen, right?

2060
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,140
Yeah, I do.

2061
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,699
You violating your restraining orders,

2062
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,123
and it's within my
rights to protect myself.

2063
01:45:49,932 --> 01:45:53,599
♪ I couldn't seem to follow ♪

2064
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:02,640
Hey.

2065
01:46:03,993 --> 01:46:07,099
Look, today, you need a friend, huh?

2066
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:10,908
Look, whatever it is,
whatever you're going through,

2067
01:46:10,909 --> 01:46:14,229
we can get through it together, okay?

2068
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:15,483
I'm not gonna leave you.

2069
01:46:17,903 --> 01:46:21,459
Look, the pastor said
it would be good days

2070
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,079
and it would be bad days,

2071
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,669
so today is a bad day,

2072
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:29,789
but tomorrow will be better.

2073
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,083
One day at a time, right?

2074
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,659
Do you stay far or close?

2075
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:38,849
Like, my car is right here.

2076
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:39,900
I will take you home.

2077
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,927
I just stay round the street.

2078
01:46:43,928 --> 01:46:45,261
Okay, come on.

2079
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,549
The first day I came to church

2080
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:09,133
was the worst day of my life.

2081
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:14,853
I wasn't sure that I even wanted to live.

2082
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:23,229
My whole life, I had been
searching for something.

2083
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:26,823
I don't know, maybe love.

2084
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:34,563
If you hadn't have stopped
and talked to me that day,

2085
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,650
I don't think I would've made it.

2086
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:42,349
You just seemed like a really nice person,

2087
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:44,163
and you understood me.

2088
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:53,703
I was sleeping with two men,

2089
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:58,033
and I got pregnant,

2090
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,823
and I told them they were both the father,

2091
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:08,363
when, truth is,

2092
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,223
I had no idea.

2093
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,840
And you were just so nice to me

2094
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:23,723
when I know I brought you pain.

2095
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:25,830
So you know who I am.

2096
01:48:29,108 --> 01:48:31,593
Yep, I knew it the first time I saw you,

2097
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:37,459
and then you shared your Bible with me,

2098
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:40,903
and you talked me into
counseling with the pastor.

2099
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,720
You were just so nice to me,

2100
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:51,413
like you cared about me and my salvation.

2101
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:54,320
I've never had a friend like that,

2102
01:48:55,828 --> 01:48:56,828
someone that cared.

2103
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,056
It's right up here.

2104
01:49:01,057 --> 01:49:02,807
Oh, okay.

2105
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:13,313
Look, thanks for bringing me home.

2106
01:49:15,038 --> 01:49:17,273
I was kind of crazy back there.

2107
01:49:19,065 --> 01:49:21,613
I just can't stop seeing
my husband's face.

2108
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,363
But you should come in, we should talk.

2109
01:49:31,354 --> 01:49:33,055
You can just make yourself comfortable.

2110
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,056
Okay.

2111
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,668
I'm gonna go get
something from the back.

2112
01:49:36,669 --> 01:49:38,086
Okay.

2113
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,600
So do you know what
happened to my husband?

2114
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:26,191
I don't know.

2115
01:50:29,137 --> 01:50:31,087
Did Seth have anything to do with it?

2116
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,709
He didn't seem like the type,

2117
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:38,733
but, I mean, then again, who does?

2118
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:46,813
I was so selfish then.

2119
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:51,429
I just, I never stopped to think

2120
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:53,419
about what kind of men they were

2121
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:55,763
or what I was becoming.

2122
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:03,273
I am so sorry, Brittany, that
I slept with your husband,

2123
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:09,543
and all of the pain that I've brought you.

2124
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:15,663
I wanna be better.

2125
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,750
I wanna be,

2126
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:26,593
I wanna be forgiven for
all that I have done.

2127
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:36,609
I'm trying to do like
you said and just take

2128
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:38,267
it one day at a time.

2129
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:43,173
I am so sorry, Brittany.

2130
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:46,660
Me, too.

2131
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:19,979
Hey, Ma.

2132
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,119
Yeah, I'm fine.

2133
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:22,683
I just got home from church.

2134
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,950
I was thinking we could
take Vince to the park.

2135
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:29,097
Okay, see you in a sec.

2136
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:28,069
You know, I wonder how
many glasses of wine

2137
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:29,493
you shared with my husband.

2138
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,750
I'm gonna make a phone call real quick.

2139
01:53:40,751 --> 01:53:41,851
I hope you don't mind.

2140
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:46,789
Police, how can I help you?

2141
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:51,014
Hi, yeah, I just shot
and killed someone.

2142
01:53:51,015 --> 01:53:52,503
I'm sorry?

2143
01:53:52,504 --> 01:53:53,669
What address are you at?

2144
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:55,973
8506 Fielding.

2145
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,193
It's apartment 302.

2146
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:01,310
Okay.

2147
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,369
Look at my boo looking
all good on her birthday.

2148
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:18,369
Girl, this party is lit.

2149
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:21,489
I know, except the fact
that Camille isn't here yet.

2150
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:24,319
If she know what best
for her, she won't show up.

2151
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,809
Stop tripping.

2152
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:28,289
Y'all had y'all little
fight, now let it go.

2153
01:54:28,290 --> 01:54:29,663
It's my birthday.

2154
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:33,353
That bitch can die for all I care.

2155
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,359
But you're right, it's your birthday.

2156
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,860
Let me go get your cake, okay?

2157
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:53,099
Camille, I know you got my message.

2158
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,400
You better be on your way.

2159
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:00,959
When can we cut into this?

2160
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,309
Not yet.

2161
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:03,310
Go get my baby.

2162
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,559
What is going on with him anyway?

2163
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,749
Why is he limping around?

2164
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:10,129
Girl, he had went to give
his kids some presents,

2165
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,999
and his crazy wife shot him.

2166
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,209
Ain't that some shit?

2167
01:55:13,210 --> 01:55:14,223
Is she in jail?

2168
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:17,799
Nope, she lied and said he hit her,

2169
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,699
so she had got a PBO,

2170
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:21,689
so technically, you know,
when he got to the house,

2171
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:23,979
she could call it self-defense.

2172
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:26,682
Some bitches really know
how to work the system.

2173
01:55:26,683 --> 01:55:28,803
Man, what y'all doing back here?

2174
01:55:28,804 --> 01:55:30,999
Didn't I tell you not to life a finger?

2175
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,169
I'm doing everything for my baby tonight.

2176
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:34,670
Aw, thank you, baby.

2177
01:55:36,548 --> 01:55:38,376
Now, look, get your
sexy ass back out there.

2178
01:55:38,377 --> 01:55:39,463
I'm gonna get this cake.

2179
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:43,709
You sure you don't need no help?

2180
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:45,441
Cause you barely walking.

2181
01:55:45,442 --> 01:55:47,775
Now, look, I got this, go ahead.

2182
01:55:47,776 --> 01:55:49,693
All right.

2183
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:54,139
Let me get this ice cream, too.

2184
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:55,140
Shit.

2185
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,350
This for Kitty, nigga.

2186
01:56:15,088 --> 01:56:17,451
Baby, you can't carry this cake.

2187
01:56:17,452 --> 01:56:18,452
Tony?

2188
01:56:21,357 --> 01:56:22,357
Tony!

2189
01:56:23,124 --> 01:56:24,874
Tony, wake up, honey!

2190
01:56:25,725 --> 01:56:26,725
Tony!

2191
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:28,510
Tony!

2192
01:57:25,249 --> 01:57:27,829
Now the district attorney,
she'll be in in a minute,

2193
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:30,030
but I'm gonna go over
a few things with you.

2194
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:35,853
We've been investigating and I
kind of learned a few things.

2195
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:38,360
Such as?

2196
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:42,609
Well, we know that the blood
that was found on your son

2197
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:45,179
was your husband's blood.

2198
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:48,199
That means he was at
the scene of the crime.

2199
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,912
We think Vito know who took your baby.

2200
01:57:50,913 --> 01:57:53,163
That's what got him killed.

2201
01:57:56,562 --> 01:57:57,901
