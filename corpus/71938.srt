00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,611
( strings play eerie melody )

00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,352

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,377
WOMAN :
Wake up, my beauties.

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,509
Rise and shine.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,714
It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

10
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,654
is at peace.

11
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,180
But not for Iong.

12
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,321
Just Iook at them.

13
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,297
I pull one tiny thread,

14
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,789
and their whole world unravels
into chaos.

15
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,828
GIorious chaos.

16
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:18,469
And what could be more
perfect than this?

17
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,445
A noble prince,

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,448
a priceless treasure,

19
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,179
and a black-hearted thief.

20
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,882
Oh, this is going to be fun.

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,187
-( rumbling purr)
-Cetus?

22
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,250
You know what to do.

23
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,320
Let the games begin.

24

25
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,572

( barks )

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,978
The world's most valuable object

28
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,983
is on its way to Syracuse.

29
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,417
It's a shame
it'II never get there.

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,977
-( crew laughing )
-( barking )

31
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,047
After today, we retire to Fiji.

32

( cheering )

33
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,616

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,088
Kale!

36
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,152
Aye, Captain.

37
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,663
-Spike!
-( barks )

38
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,894

( grunts )

47
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,231
Did you catch
that Iast move?

48
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,071
Pretty cool, huh?

49
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,576
I thought you
overworked it.

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,770
Just a bit.

51
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,545
Aw, y...

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,774
Overworked it?

53
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,781
( guard yelling )

54
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,509

( guard yelling )

57
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,483
Oh, and I was overworking it?

58
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,580
( chuckles )

59
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,284
( grunting )

60
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,156
Proteus.

61
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,353
Whoa.

62
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,329
This just got interesting.

63
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,058
How Iong has it been?

64
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,929
About a Iifetime ago.

65
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,999
( swords clashing )

66
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,698
( grunting )

67
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,801
You still fight
Iike an old Iady.

68
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,830
Sinbad?

69
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,571
-( grunting )
-Oh. Ooh.

70
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,873
Sinbad.

71
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,005
What...?
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,743
I'm working.

73
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,877
You?

74
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,112
What happened to you?

75
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,347
Where have you been?

76
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,412
Hey, Iove to stop and catch up,

77
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,119
but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

78
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,453
( scattered chuckles )

79
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,464
( whistles )

80
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,403
Oh... yeah.

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,203
Sinbad,
we need to talk.

82
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,211
Heard about it,
read about it,

83
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,778
never actually seen it.

84
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,842
The Book of Peace.

85
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,981
It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

86
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,356
Really? Now, see, now,
I-I just feel bad,

87
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,486
because you're going
to get fired.

88
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,018
You can't be serious.

89
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,623
You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

90
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,792
I wish it wasn't you.

91
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,926
I do.

92
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,992
( chuckling ):
Really.

93
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,800
-But...
-But it is me, Sinbad.

94
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,331
Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

95
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,570
a secret hideout.

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,444
It was fun, big fun,
but, uh, we were kids.

97
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,778
We were friends!

98
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,407
You're not going
to steal this.

99
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,008
Not from me.

100
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,384
And what would you
do with it anyway?

101
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,254
The Book of Peace protects
all of us in the Twelve Cities.

102
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,258
SINBAD:
Exactly.

103
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,919
So, just imagine
how much all of us

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
will pay to get it back.

105
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,355
Let me say it again.

106
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,660
A Iong time ago,
you and I were friends.

107
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,657
If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

108
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,101
You're right.

109
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,867
That was a Iong time ago.

110
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,241
( both grunting )

111
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,936

112
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,479
( pants )

113
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,277
Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

114
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,884
If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

115
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,019
( rumbling and grunting )

116
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,557
What the...?

117
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,962
( both panting )

118
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,300
( yelling )

119
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,463
Dear gods.

120
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,537
( yelling )

121
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,116
( barking )

122
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,823
( chuckles ):
Go, Spike.

123
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,961
-I gotcha! I gotcha!
-( yelps )

124
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,963
Well, I see you're busy.

125
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,526
So, uh, stay in touch.

126
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,697
Wait! Wait!

127
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,206
You're just going
to run away?

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,208
Uh, yeah.

129
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,605
Wh-whoa!

130
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,045
Sinbad!

131
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,350
You! My...!

132
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,650
My ship!

133
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,947

134
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,252

137
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,568
SINBAD:
Heads up!

138
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,175
( yelling )

139
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,175
Now...
stand by for sushi.

140

141
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,116

( screaming )

144
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,724
Give that guy a raise.

145
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,863
Come on!
Come on, Sinbad!

146
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,963
Let's go!

147
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,064
Wait.
Stand your ground.

148
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,404
-( whistling )
-W-What are you doing?

149
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,636
SINBAD:
Hey!

150
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,643
Hey, hey!

151
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,804
Lobster Boy, over here!

152
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,885
( roaring )

153
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,113
Run!

154
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,780
Fall back!

155
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,224
Grab hold!

156
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,320

( grunting )

160
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,836
And the plan?

161
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,136
How about try not to get killed?

162
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,766
Hold on!

163
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,109
( grunting )

164
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,339
Here, you'II need this.

Where are you going?

166
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,441

Yeah.

180
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,094
Thanks for sticking around.

181
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,620
Ah, just Iike old times.

WOMAN:
The day began with such promise.

190
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,732
And now Iook.

191
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,538
My sea monster is dead,

192
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,942
and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,414
AII because of you, Sinbad.

194
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,474
( panting ):
Uh-huh.

195
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,145
And you are?

196
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,155
Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

197
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,451
No doubt you've seen
my Iikeness

198
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,288
on the temple walls.

199
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,453
( chuckles nervously)

200
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,724
You know,
they don't do you justice.

201
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,731
Uh-huh. Now...

202
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,494
about my sea monster.

203
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,001
Right, right.

204
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,764
Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

205
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,705
I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

206
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,764
( chuckles wryly)

207
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,038
Heartfelt? From you?

208
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,274
Sinbad, you don't have a heart.

209
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,247
( sighs )

210
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,410
That's what I Iike about you.

211
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,683
So, I'm going
to Iet you Iive.

212
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,384
But there's
just one Iittle thing

213
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,016
you have to do.

214
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,426
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

215
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,487
Right. Hmm.

216
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,758
Now, see, that's
a problem for me

217
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,595
because I had
my own plans for it.

218
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,601
Uh, ransom, get rich.

219
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,600
You know, "me" stuff.

220
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,601
( startled cry)

221
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,436
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

222
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,873
Steal the Book for ransom,

223
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,375
and you'II be
rich enough

224
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,173
to Iounge
on an island beach.

225
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:50,615
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

226
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,245
and the island and the world.

227
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,344
Hmm.

228
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,356
You Iet me Iive,
you make me rich,

229
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,551
I retire to paradise.

230
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,390
So far, I don't see a downside.

231
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,362
If you keep your word.

232
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,332
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

233
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,630
she's bound for all eternity.

234
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,602
AII right, you're on.

235
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,730
I knew you'd
see it my way.

236
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,368
So, when you've
stolen the Book,

237
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,868
follow that star
beyond the horizon.

238
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,505
You'II find yourself

239
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,314
in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

240
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,512
Tartarus.

241
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,180
I'II see you there.

242
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,813
It's a date then.

243
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,387
So, where were we?

244
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,985
( chuckling ):
Oh, yes.

245
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,225
You were holding your breath.

246
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,799
He's so cute.

247
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,004
And so gullible.

248
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,945
Cetus, well done.

249
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,607
( rumbling purr)

250
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,248
( gasps, coughs )

251
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,880
( Kale grunts )

252
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,289
-( men cheering, Spike barking )
-Sinbad, you're alive!

253
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,088
GIad you made it.

254
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,822
Pay up.
He Iived.

255
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,056
( groans )

256
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,291
What happened down there?

257
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,525
( gasping ):
You wouldn't...

258
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,692
believe me if I told you.

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,062
Try me.

260
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,865
AII right, here goes.

261
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,701
So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

262
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,296
She's got
a major crush on me,

263
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,309
and she invited me
back to her place.

264
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,708
Ha! That's a good one!

265
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,510
-Goddess of Chaos?
-( crew chuckling )

266
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,015
Oh, I'm writing that down.

267
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,984
So, that's it then?
No Book.

268
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,542
Now what do we do?

269
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,884
A Iittle patience, Rat.

270
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,684
It's not Iike we don't know
where it's going.

271
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,852
Men, all sails to Syracuse!

272
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,760
Right away, sir!

273
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,042
( cheering )

274
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,210
* *

275
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,256
* *

276
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,433
For as Iong
as I can remember,

277
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,167
I've dreamed of this moment.

278
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,266
The sacred treasure

279
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,869
that's protected us
for a thousand years

280
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,005
is now in Syracuse.

281
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,776
-A toast!
-To Dymas!

282
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,541
Hear, hear!

283
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,914
To the Book of Peace!

284
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,215
And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

285
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,313
-Make way!
-( crowd gasping )

286
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,420
( swords unsheathe )

287
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,323
You see?

288
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,885
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

289
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,192
Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,789
What is he doing here?

291
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,197
At Ieast he's not out
robbing someone.

292
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,398
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

293
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,303
( panting )

294
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,432
I'II bet you ten crowns

295
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,272
you're about to put
those swords down.

296
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,778
I'II take that bet.

297
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,801
PROTEUS:
Guards...

298
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
put away your swords.

299
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't see you for ten years,

300
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,346
and now twice in one day...
( scoffs )

301
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,785
You're smothering me.

302
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,118
( chuckles )

303
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,455
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your Iife... again.

304
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,823
( chuckles )

305
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,658
You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

306
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,664
You hear that, guys?

307
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,928
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

308
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,127
Come on.

309
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,863
There's someone
I want you to meet.

310
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,397
( softly):
Get to work.

311
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,696
Weapons?

312
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,935
-( growls )
-( gasps )

313
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,673
( chuckling )

314
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,945
PROTEUS:
Here she is.

315
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,251
I've told her
all about you.

316
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,257
( gasps )

317
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,280
( clears throat )

318
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,520
Sinbad, I would
Iike to introduce you

319
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,858
to my fiancee,

320
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,490
the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

321
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,332
So, this is the infamous Sinbad.

322
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,397
I heard all about this morning.

323
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,342
First you tried to rob Proteus,
and then you save his Iife.

324
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,535
So, which are you...

325
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,878
a thief or a hero?

326
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,008
PROTEUS:
Sinbad wanted

327
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,144
to give me an opportunity
to thank...

328
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,177
-( indistinct conversation )
-( music plays )

329
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,122
...him.

330
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,786
( gobbling noisily )

331
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,658
RAT:
Eight months on the sea

332
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,221
with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

333
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,029
you don't know what
that can do to a man.

334
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,536
Oh, it's almost too easy.

335
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,561
There's only
a handful of guards.

336
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,573
Forget it.

337
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,869
Let's get back to the ship.

338
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,034
Just Iike that?

339
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,941
But the Book is almost ours.

340
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,274
( sighs )

341
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,282
Oh.

342
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,045
Wh-What?
Who is she?

343
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,608
An old girlfriend?

344
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,483
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

345
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,352
Let's go.

346
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,857
Jed, pack it up.

347
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,156
What? I-I... I just put the...

348
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,320
( groans in disgust)

349
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,697
( chuckles wickedly)

350
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,364
Oh, this is just too easy.

351
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,406
Look at it this way:

352
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,602
Now that Sinbad's gone,

353
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,043
your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

354
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,046
( Proteus chuckles )

355
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,707
Well, you're right about that.

356
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,113
He's trying not to show it,

357
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,085
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

358
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,487
He's been planning this day
his whole Iife.

359
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,186
And soon it will be
your responsibility.

360
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,286
Our responsibility.

361
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,726
( sighing ):
It's beautiful.

362
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,964
It is.

363
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,735
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

364
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,503
There are guards
on every Ievel,

365
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,169
and if you Iook
up to the...

366
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,143
Ah... ( chuckles softly)

367
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,615
You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

368
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,882
I only wish I'd
seen more of it.

369
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,449
I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

370
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,154
discovering the world.

371
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,253
( chuckles softly)

372
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,991
Oh, Iook at it, Proteus.

373
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,796
There's so much wonder.

374
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,301
Marina...

375
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,165
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

376
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,301
It's always been expected of us.

377
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,711
But politics is not a reason
to get married.

378
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,715
Uh, and I don't want you
to do this

379
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,376
just because it's your duty.

380
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,118
I'm asking you
for myself now.

381
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,783
Marina...

382
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,384
will you marry me?

383
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,453
Proteus, I...

384
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,827
DYMAS:
There you are!

385
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,024
I think the delegates
from Manoli

386
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,157
are trying to give a toast.

387
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,565
AIthough, I'm not sure.

388
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,899
They're doing something
with their knees.

389
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,529
Marina, I need
an ambassador.

390
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,267
( exhales )

391
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,436
Of course, Sire.

392
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,503
( people laughing and chatting
in distance )

393
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,480
( wind whistling )

394
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,225
( whooshing )

395
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,228
-( candle wick sizzles )
-Huh?

396
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,263
* *

397
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,707
( wind howling softly )

398
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,222
-( sizzling )
-Who's there?

399
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,595
( hissing )

400
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,131
Huh?

401
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,239
Sinbad!

402
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,674
( grunting )

403
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,910
( groans )

404
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,178
I Iove playing pretend.

405
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,251
( chuckles wickedly )

406
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,622
AII the pieces
are coming together.

407
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,354
( loud rumbling )

408
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,129
Proteus, the Book!

409
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,161
( loud rumbling )

410
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,699
( gasps )

411
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,912
( loud rumbling )

412
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,938
( debris clattering )

413
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,983
( grunts and groans )

414
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,461
PROTEUS :
Sinbad.

415
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,724
Proteus!

416
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,561
It's about time.

417
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,624
Do you realize
how serious this is?

418
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,896
Do you realize

419
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,767
how many times
I've heard that today?

420
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,736
You've betrayed Syracuse!

421
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,933
Oh... not you, too.

422
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,032
Stealing the Book of Peace,

423
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,667
when you knew how much
it meant to us!

424
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,610
Proteus, here's
the way this works.

425
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,374
First, I actually
commit a crime,

426
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,405
and then you get
to blame me for it!

427
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,418
Then how do
you explain this?

428
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,278
Eris.

429
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,153
What?

430
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,488
Eris... she framed me.

431
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,391
-Sinbad, Iisten to yourself.
-Trust me, Proteus,

432
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,862
the Book is in Tartarus.

433
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,797
Talk to your father.
Tell him I'm...

434
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,129
This is beyond my father.

435
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,692
The ambassadors are convening
now for your trial.

436
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,067
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

437
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,162
Trial? I didn't do it!

438
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,797
Look, I Ieft the Book
on your ship,

439
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,330
and that's the
Iast I saw of it.

440
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,467
You were there.

441
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,409
You know the truth.

442
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,503
You know me.

443
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,070
Do I?

444
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,207
I knew a kid.

445
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,013
Who are you now, Sinbad?

446
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,644
( sighs )

447
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,646
Look me in the eye
and tell me.

448
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,784
Did you steal the Book?

449
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,890
No.

450
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,060
DYMAS:
We've heard enough of your Iies.

451
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,127
Sinbad,

452
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,638
for the Iast time,
give us the Book.

453
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,608
How many times
do I have to say it?

454
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,008
I don't have it!

455
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,341
AMBASSADOR:
Very well, then.

456
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,778
The Delegation

457
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,577
of the Twelve Cities finds you
guilty of treason,

458
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,174
and we sentence you to die.

459
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,185
Take him away.

460
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,686
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

461
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,551
Are you...
are you people blind?

462
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,556
I didn't do it!

463
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,682
PROTEUS:
Stop!

464
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,691
( gasps )

465
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,694
I demand the right
of substitution.

466
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,559
Take me in his place.

467
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,529
No!

468
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,561
Sinbad says

469
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,659
that Eris took the Book...

470
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,226
and I believe him.

471
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,261
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.

472
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,271
What?

473
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,568
( murmuring )

474
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,632
What are you doing?

475
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,610
You claim that Eris
stole the Book--

476
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,633
steal it back.

477
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,010
You're good at that.

478
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,413
Hey, Iook, I will not be
responsible for your Iife.

479
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,677
You would do
the same for me.

480
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,945
No, I wouldn't.

481
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,850
DYMAS:
If Sinbad is allowed to Ieave

482
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,412
the city, he'II
never come back!

483
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,287
Son, Iisten to reason.

484
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,952
No, Father, you Iisten.

485
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,589
Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

486
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,996
and it's in Tartarus.

487
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,592
Either way,
he's our only hope.

488
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,227
But you can't...

489
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,570
Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

490
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,735
you will be put to death
in his place.

491
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,573
I understand.

492
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,808
( sighs )

493
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,111
So be it.

494
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,947
Sinbad has ten days

495
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,044
to return the Book.

496
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,079
( sighs )

497
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,215
Release him.

498
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,249
( crowd murmuring )

499
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,801
( sighs )

500
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,843
Oh, and, Sinbad...

501
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,380
don't be Iate.

502
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,821
( groans )

503
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,268
* *

504
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,606
( creaking )

505
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,949
Hmm.

506
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,149
So, any idea

507
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,987
how we actually
get to Tartarus?

508
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,049
Tartarus?

509
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,253
( chuckling ):
Oh, no, no, no, no.

510
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,353
People get killed in Tartarus.

511
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,330
So where are we going?

512
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,325
Fiji.

513
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,394
Fiji? This time of year?

514
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,769
Think of the beaches.

515
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,400
Oh, beautiful,
if you Iike mosquitoes.

516
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,497
Think of the sun.

517
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,408
It's monsoon season.

518
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,276
Oh, then the women.

519
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,678
They're cannibals, Sinbad.

520
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,773
Exactly.

521
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,216
( groans )

522
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,218
Come on, Kale.

523
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,742
He's your friend.

524
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,221
Listen to you.
You sound Iike my mother.

525
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,553
Proteus will be fine.

526
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,819
You're sure of that?

527
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,053
You and I both know

528
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,152
Dymas is not going to Iet them
execute his only son.

529
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,424
So we're running away?

530
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,795
We're retiring.

531
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,096
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

532
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,659
Now, set a course for Fiji.

533
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,968
Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

534
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,633
-( cheering )
-Fiji! Fiji!

535
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,972
( Spike barking )

536
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,679
( grumbling ):
Kale... Book.

537
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,078
( grunting ):
Proteus.

538
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,509
Look at all this.

539
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,719
I can't believe it.

540
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,746
Oh, but this can't be real.

541
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,122
It'd be far too deli...

542
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,751
-( clattering )
-Uh-oh.

543
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,793
This is more Iike it.

544
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,322
Stolen from Venezia.

545
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,800
( exhales )

546
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,302
From Pompeii...

547
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,465
And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

548
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,733
Good guess.

549
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,173
( gasps )

550
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,608
What do you think
you're doing here?

551
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,044
I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.

552
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,173
Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

553
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,477
Really?

554
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,041
And how are you going
to pull that off?

555
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,609
By whatever means necessary.

556
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,018
Did you bring a crew?

557
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,214
No.

558
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,348
You know how to
get to Tartarus?

559
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,357
Um... no.

560
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,380
Can you navigate
on your own?

561
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,050
Yes!

562
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,424
Well, good!

563
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,190
Then I'II dump your butt
in a rowboat,

564
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,493
and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

565
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,399
'Cause we're going to Fiji.

566
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,036
Fiji?

567
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,094
Yup.

568
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,130
Just as I thought.

569
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,505
What?

570
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,668
Sinbad,

571
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,702
you're not
a very complicated guy.

572
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,805
AII someone has to do

573
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,941
is imagine the most
gutless course of action,

574
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,348
and you're bound to take it.

575
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,717
Hey, this is not my problem.

576
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,847
I did not steal the Book.

577
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,188
You're really not going to Iose
any sleep over this, are you?

578
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,193
Not a wink.

579
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,525
Because me,
I'd be tossing and turning,

580
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,693
knowing I'm alive...
because I Iet my friend die.

581
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,030
( groans in disgust)

582
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,797
I'm not responsible
for this mess.

583
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:12,928
And I didn't ask Proteus

584
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,199
to put his neck
on the Iine for me.

585
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,470
Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your honor.

586
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,376
But I have other ways
of convincing you.

587
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,243
Really?

588
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,215
Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?

589
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,343
By speaking your Ianguage.

590
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,146
Keep talking.

591
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,316
(jewels clink )

592
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,997
Yup, this'II do!

593
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,829
But not for first class.

594
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,204
As you can see, we're
well equipped to accommodate

595
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,798
the most discerning
of royal tastes.

596
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,241
We have excellent ocean views...

597
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,108
( Marina grunting )

598
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,443
...Iuxurious Iiving quarters,

599
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,574
with three
gourmet meals a day--

600
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,709
pickles, eggs, and pickles.

601
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,845
( barks )

602
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,115
Oh, hey, Spike,
there you are.

603
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,520
I'd Iike to introduce you

604
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,581
to your new bunkmate--
well, actually,

605
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,988
you're his new bunkmate,

606
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,584
as it's actually his bunk.

607
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,719
-( Sinbad chuckles )
-( groans in disgust )

608
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,752
We do hope

609
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,197
you have a pleasant stay
aboard the Chimera.

610
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,428
Oh, if he starts
hugging your Ieg,

611
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,027
it means he Iikes you.

612
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,900
( grunts )

613
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,470
If you think...

614
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,240
( Spike barks )

615
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,570
How did she even get
on the ship?

616
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,876
( startled grunts )

617
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,610
( exaggerated yawn )

618
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,142
Gentlemen, we have a new course.

619
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,381
We're going to Tartarus.

620
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,151
Huh? What
happened to Fiji?

621
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,179
What? No fun?

622
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,214
No beaches?

623
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,056
Rat.

624
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,618
Sorry, Captain.

625
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,926
But did you
say Tartarus?

626
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,932
That's right.

627
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,763
Will that be
the same Tartarus

628
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,860
from which no sailor
ever returns?

629
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,837
The Tartarus
of Iost souls,

630
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,134
where they
grind your bones

631
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,606
and pickle your
spleen, and...

632
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,336
No, Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus,

633
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,866
with Iots of beaches and drinks.

634
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,141
You know,
with Iittle umbrellas?

635
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,842
( muttering in Italian ):
Non ci posso credere,

636
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,375
non ci posso credere,
mi hanno fregato ancora.

637
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,481
I'm only doing this
for the money.

638
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,287
Right.

639
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,088
So how do we get there?

640
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,392
That star's our point.

641
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,028
( clicking )

642
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:23,762
( grunting )

643
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,673
Wow.

644
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,011
Our Iittle thief
isn't going to run away.

645
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,108
( hisses )

646
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,847
He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.

647
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,979
( hissing and clicking )

648
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:48,356
Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.

649
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,056
( Sirens singing sweetly )

650
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,425
( scraping )

651
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,498
( Marina grunts )

652
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,707
Oh, come on. You Iook great.

653
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,609
( whimpering )

654
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,718
Look Iively!
Jed, get the Iong poles!

655
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,412
Oh, pardon me, milady.

656
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,013
Hey, we need
a pole over here.

657
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,115
Jin, one over here.

658
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,854
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

659
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,265
The Dragon's Teeth?

660
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,392
( Rat clears throat)

661
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,130
( grunts )

662
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,062
Indeed, signorina.

663
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,698
Only the most
foolish of captains

664
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,709
would dare to sail
a ship through this!

665
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,540
SINBAD:
Rat, reef the fores'Ie.

666
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,376
Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.

667
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,904
( grunts )

668
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,142
Are you sure
you know what...?

669
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,676
Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

670
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,052
-No, there is no other way.
-Look...

671
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,181
-And, yes,
-But...

672
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,521
you have my permission
to stand there quietly

673
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,220
and get a free Iesson
in sailing.

674
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,228
You know...

675
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,752
Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

676
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,762
( gasps )

677
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:00,763
Jin!

678
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,764
Easy on the main!

679
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,765
JIN:
Aye!

680
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,926
( grunts with disgust)

681
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,973
( wind whistling )

682
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,984
( clattering )

683
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,120
Steady as she goes.

684
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,923
Rocks off the starboard bow!

685
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:46,168
( Sirens singing softly )

686
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,382
( clattering )

687
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,088
Steady.

688
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,586
( Sirens singing softly )

689
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,597
( dripping )

690
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,262
What is that sound?

691
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,894
Shh.

692
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,265
( tinkling )

693
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:21,267
( Sirens singing )

694
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,940
Sinbad, I...

695
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,574
( barking )

696
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,710
Sirens.

697
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:32,155
( Sirens humming )

698
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,358
Sinbad.

699
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,095
( water roaring )

700
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,632
( gasps ):
Sinbad!

701
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,640
Jin?

702
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,268
-Li?
-( kissing )

703
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,608
Come and get it, Iadies!

704
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,977
Kale?

705
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,345
Come with me.

706
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,475
We'II speak of Iove.

707
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,610
Oh... ( kissing )

708
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,553
Who's bad?

709
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,112
Sin-bad.

710
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,215
Ah... men.

711
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,783
( Sirens singing )

712
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,260

( groans )

717
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,066
I saw her first!

718
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,133
( grunts )

719
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,877
Round the deck! Now!

720
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,413
Yeah...

721
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,315
( gasps )

722
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,650
RAT:
Amore!

723
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,349
Amore! Amore!

724
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,356
My darling.

725
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,254
Rat!

726
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,280
I Iove you.

727
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,258
( grunting and groaning )

728
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,196
II mare e Ie onde andiamo via.

( Siren humming )

730
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,397

00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,503
( groaning )

732
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,905
( Siren shrieking )

733
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,813
Spike!

734
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,817
Get Sinbad!

735
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,840
( barking )

736
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,511
Ow!

737
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,282
( Sirens singing )

738
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,953

00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,520
Spike, the blades!

744
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,581
( barks )

745
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,421
( grunts )

746
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,769
( Sirens screaming )

747
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,410
( fluttering )

748
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,817
( sighs )

749
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,877
( coughing )

750
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,402
( groans and sighs )

751
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,464
Oh, my precious.

752
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,997
Wake up, you idiot!

753
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,373
( groans )

754
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,604
What happened?

755
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,044
Sinbad saved us.

756
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,308
RAT:
No, Marina.

757
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,872
CREWMEMBERS:
Marina saved us? Marina!

758
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,043
Marina saved us.

759
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,519
KALE:
AII right, men, snap out of it.

760
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,919
Let's get back to reality.

761
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,149
We got a ship to sail.

762
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,055
Here's my Iittle hero.

763
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,592
You were so brave.

764
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,958
Yeah. What a good dog.

765
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,826
Uh...

766
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,263
Uh... ( clears throat)

767
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,426
Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

768
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:05,991
( huffs )

769
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,368
Absolutely!

770
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,804
( whines )

771
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,398
I mean, Iook at my ship!

772
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,932
This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

773
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,069
And here!

774
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,444
These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

775
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,675
Do you have any idea

776
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,842
what I went through
to steal these?

777
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,873
( scoffs )

778
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,615
That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

779
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,387
Are you crazy?

780
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,290
I saved your Iife!

781
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,761
Oh, I would've been fine.

782
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,730
I always am.

783
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,322
Right.

784
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,266
( muttering ):
So ungrateful.

785
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,734
It's just typical.

786
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,467
And you chipped the paint!

787
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,736
Right here--
Iook at it.

788
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,367
That's more than
a Iittle scratch.

789
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,741
( grunts angrily)

790
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,652
( Spike barks )

791
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,182
( snorts and whines )

792
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,592
( grunts angrily )

793
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,998
The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!

794
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,309
What?!

795
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,140
-Thank you!
-You're welcome!

796
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,839
-No problem!
-Don't worry about it!

797
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,006
-I won't!
-Good!

798
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,413
-Good-bye!
-Bye to you!

799
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,145
( huffs )

800
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,220
( crew murmuring )

801
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,424
( panting )

802
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,824
You happy now?

803
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,159
( panting )

804
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,823
( scoffs )

805
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,266
( barks and whines )

806
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,475
( keys jingling )

807
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,777
( door opening )

808
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,307
Proteus, come quickly.

809
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,319
What? Wh...?

810
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,820
There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.

811
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,185
A crew of my most
trusted officers

812
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,518
will take you
far from Syracuse.

813
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,422
But the ambassadors' guards?

814
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,359
Are asleep or well-bribed.

815
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,827
But we must go now.

816
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,955
Go where?

817
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,398
To Iive the rest of my Iife
in exile?

818
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,662
To Iive, son.

819
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,603
I won't Iet them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.

820
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,866
Neither will Sinbad.

821
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,533
Proteus, don't be foolish!

822
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,940
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

823
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,911
The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

824
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,209
Is still in him as a man.

825
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,045
I've seen it.

826
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,244
Proteus... ( sighs )

827
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,447
Go, Father.

828
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,151
I know what I'm doing.

829
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,470
( door creaks shut)

830
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,994
( lock clicks )

831
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,132
( sighs )

832
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,202
KALE:
AII right, Iisten up.

833
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,506
We're here for ten minutes.

834
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,308
You get Iost, you get Ieft.

835
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,409
( groans )

836
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,350
How did one woman
do so much damage?

837
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,876
( wood breaking )

838
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,821
AII right, I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

839
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,848
the jack plane,
and about a cord of cut wood.

840
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,651
AII right, men, you
heard the captain.

841
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,026
Find some Iogs
and be quick about it.

842
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,031
-( groans )
-Oh, for heaven's sake!

843
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,623
You only need
a Iittle tree sap,

844
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,100
and she'II be
as good as new.

845
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,864
When I want
your advice, I'II...

846
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:26,995
Hey, hey, hey!

847
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,165
Where do you think
you're going?

848
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,037
Well, fine!
At Ieast take someone with y...

849
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,269
LI:
May I assist you, Iady?

850
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,900
-( men speaking at once )
-Why, thank you.

851
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,208
-Right this way, signorina.
-How nice to see

852
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,977
some men haven't forgotten
a Iittle common courtesy.

853
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,608
( muttering ):
...common courtesy.

854
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,879
Not so fast.

855
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,011
But you know she's right.

856
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,715
The tree sap would
be perfect for...

857
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,017
Just...

858
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,524
stay with the ship.

859
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,684
( grunts )

860
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,287
( birds chirping,
Spike barking )

861
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,193
I already said thank you.

862
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,563
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

863
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,295
It's about repairing the ship.

864
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,302
If I break something,
I fix it.

865
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,065
Um, knife, please.

866
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,974
Oh, yeah,
Iike I'd give you a weapon?

867
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,001
Thank you, Rat.

868
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,240
You know, you really
ought to be

869
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,010
a Iittle more courteous.

870
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,573
( chuckles )

871
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,879
Oh, great.

872
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,682
Now I'm getting
etiquette Iessons

873
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,313
from a bilge rat.

874
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,289
Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

875
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,848
Why, thank you, Luca.

876
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,792
RAT:
And now she's helping to fix it.

877
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,090
JIN:
Very handy, I say.

878
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,426
And brave!

879
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,433
This... girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

880
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,332
Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

881
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,530
pig-headed man
I've ever met.

882
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,540
Hey, Iady, I've seen
the highborn boys

883
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,508
your type hangs out with...
( chuckles )

884
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,635
...and I'm the only man
you've ever met.

885
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,610
( Marina grunts )

886
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,342
-( groans )
-Whoa.

887
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,353
-Mmm.
-( Spike whimpering )

888
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,115
( Marina chuckles softly )

889
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,488
Oh, no. No. No.

890
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,958
No...

891
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,722
Five on Marina.

892
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,924
( groans )

893
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,457
You... you...

894
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,197
egotistical...

895
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,761
-You spoiled...
-disrespectful,

896
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,636
-deluded,
-pretentious, pompous,

897
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,107
-high-and-mighty...
-self-centered, untrustworthy,

898
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,044
ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

899
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,546
At Ieast I'm not repressed!

900
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,774
Repressed?!

901
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,646
I'II show you
repressed!

902
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,685
( grunts )

903
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,712
-( rumbling )
-( gasps )

904
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,183
( birds screeching )

905
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,318
What the...?

906
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,455
( low whooshing )

907
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,998
( quietly ):
Put it back.

908
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,663
( chuckles nervously )

909
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:45,908
-( rumbling )
-( gasping and yelling )

910
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,275
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Whoa, whoa...

911
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,780
-( rumbling stops )
-Ew...

912
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,806
( barking )

913
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,249
Ew!

914
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,846
( all yelling )

915
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,353
( raspy growling )

916
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,620
Run!

917
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,628
-It's a fish!
-It's a fish!

918
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,721
SINBAD:
Kale!

919
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,026
Kale!

920
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,692
-( loud thud )
-Whoa!

921
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,135
( deep roaring )

922
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,539
( yells )

923
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,940
-Jump!
-( Marina screams )

924
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,541
-( men yelling )
-( Spike barking )

925
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,109
( Sinbad yelling )

926
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,280
Kale!

927
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,289
Got it!

928
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,884
-( all yelling )
-( Spike barking )

929
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,158
Veer off, Kale!

930
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,460
The star!

931
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,863
Hold your heading!

932
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,336
SINBAD:
Rat, tie it off!

933
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,998
( stammering ) :
Wha... wha...

934
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,529
( Sinbad grunts )

935
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,071
Ha-ha!

936
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,168
RAT:
Wait!

937
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,405
( yells )

938
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,347
( Marina laughs )

939
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,253
SINBAD:
Yee-ha!

940
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,427
* *

941
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,013
* *

942
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,445
( groans )

943
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,819
KALE:
Sinbad!

944
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,949
The men can't take much more.

945
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,618
( groans ):
I can't...

946
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,150
take much more, either.

947
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,923
Cut the Iine!

948
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,496
( groaning, gagging
and moaning )

949
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,332
( belches )

950
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,776
-( Spike hiccups )
-Oh, no, Spike!

951
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,712
-Whoa, hold on, no...
-No, no, no, please...

952
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,739
-Oh, Spike!
-( Spike vomits )

953
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,776
JED:
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

954
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,152
( groans )

955
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,421
Whose idea was that again?

956
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,291
I don't know.

957
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,728
( chuckles )

958
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,061
But he owes me Iunch.

959
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,038
The Granite Gates.

960
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,337
Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

961
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,570
( chuckling ):
No, I didn't.

962
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,874
But Proteus did.

963
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,177
For some reason,
he trusts you.

964
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,580
( chuckles softly)

965
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,246
Well, what could
he have been thinking?

966
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,755
How did you
two ever meet?

967
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,384
( chuckles )

968
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,983
Running for my
Iife, as usual.

969
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,188
A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

970
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,753
outside the palace walls.

971
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,061
I was trapped.

972
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,692
A sword at my throat,

973
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,464
at my chest, at my...

974
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,132
-Pickles and eggs!
-( men groaning )

975
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,606
( clears throat )

976
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,437
Well, you get the idea.

977
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,412
And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

978
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,606
It was Proteus.

979
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,114
You see, he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

980
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,276
He actually climbed down

981
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,445
the castle wall
to fight at my side,

982
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,079
and, boy, did we fight.

983
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,784
It was Iike we'd rehearsed it.

984
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,816
We were best friends
from that day forward.

985
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,853
What happened with you two?

986
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,534
( chuckles softly ):
What is it?

987
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,564
We... took different paths.

988
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,044
( liquid bubbling )

989
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,314
Enough talking.

990
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,621
Time for some screaming.

991
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,820
-( blowing )
-( ice crackling )

992
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,801
( loud rumbling )

993
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,670
( whimpering )

994
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:17,611
For crying out Ioud,
what next?

995
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,343
Oh, get a shirt on

996
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,715
before you poke
someone's eye out.

997
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,321
Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

998
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,051
We've got to keep moving!

999
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,121
( grunting )

1000
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,094
Steal the Book of Peace.

1001
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,597
( shivering and grunting )

1002
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,360
We will retire in the tropics.

1003
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,062
( grunting and shivering )

1004
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,631
-( distant whooshing )
-( barking )

1005
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,876
-( whooshing continues )
-( barking )

1006
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,344
( loud whoosh )

1007
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,108
( gasps )

1008
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,414
( barks )

1009
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:57,681
( whimpers )

1010
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,253
( loud boom )

1011
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,224
( loud screeching )

1012
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,625
( Marina gasps )

1013
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,456
( loud screeching )

1014
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,694
Everyone, back on the ship!

1015
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:11,928
MARINA:
Hurry!

1016
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,665
KALE:
Come on! Come on! Move faster!

1017
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,741
( grunting and panting )

1018
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,177
-( screeching )
-( gasping and grunting )

1019
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,543

( loud rumbling )

1021
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,619
( screeches )

1022
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,517
Jed!

1023
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,983
Grab the rope!

1024
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,330
KALE:
Rat, your hand!

1025
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,659
Marina!

1026
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,704
-( Sinbad grunts )
-( Marina shrieks )

1027
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,511
( Marina cries )

( pounding steps
and screeching )

1032
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,795
( fierce growling )

1033
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,233
( gasping )

1034

1035
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,411
( growls and screeches )

1036
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,248
( low squawking )

( loud screeching )

1038
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,452
SINBAD:
Rat! Don't let

1039
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,081
-the blocks freeze!
-Aye, aye, Captain.

1040
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,819
-And, Kale!
-Aye!

1041
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,689
Give me a hug?

1042
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,956
( grunts ) :
Excuse me?

1043
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,225
Hmph.

1044
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,072
( whistles )

1045
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,007
( barking )

1046
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,144

1047
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,417
( grunts )

1048
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,719
( groans )

1049
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,687
( grunts and sighs )

1050
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,787
( grunting )

1051
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,796
Oh, she couldn't see the bird?

1052
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,359
Everyone else saw it.

1053
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,700
( grunting )

1054
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,138
It's as big as a freakin' ship.

1055
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:34,371
Marina?
Marina's Iooking the other way.

1056
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,037
( screeching )

1057
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,809

00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,279
-Shh, shh, shh.
-( muffled shouting )

1060
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,654
( screeching, loud boom )

1061
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,420
You're rescuing me!

1062
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,451
Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

1063
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,987
But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

1064
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,524
Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

1065
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,167
( gasping )

1066
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,535
( whispers ):
So...

1067
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,096
how are we going
to get down?

1068
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,506
I... I don't know.

1069
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,737
-What?!
-I don't know yet.

1070
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,609
I'm thinking about it,
all right?

1071
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,910
You scaled a thousand-
foot tower of ice,

1072
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,847
and you don't know
how to get down?

1073
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,476
Of all the ungrateful...
( grunts )

1074
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,749
Look, if you'd rather
take your chances on your own,

1075
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,914
that can be arranged.

1076
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,513
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
AII right.

1077
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:21,888
AII right.

1078
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,018
( loud rumbling )

1079
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,392
So,

1080
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,056
what do we have
to work with?

1081
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,564
Um... ropes?

1082
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,395
Uh... no.

1083
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,560
Uh, grappling hooks?

1084
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,159
Yeah... no.

1085
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,363
Your swords?

1086
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,564
( grunts softly)

1087
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,368
Hey, I've got this.

1088
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,704
Oh, great.

1089
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,607
He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

1090
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah.

1091
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,746
Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

1092
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,543
a good knife has 1,001 uses.

1093
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,607
-Ooh!
-( knife clangs )

1094
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,949
( ice crackling )

1095
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,544
( screeches )

1096
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,386
-( grunts )
-( chuckles ): Uh...

1097
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,888
( screeching )

1098
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,325
Run!

1099
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,819
( Marina gasping )

1100
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,798
Come on! Faster!

1101
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,496
MARINA:
W-Wait, wait. What?

1102
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,767
Let's go!

1103
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,775
MARINA:
No...!

1104
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,705
Oh! Oh!

1105
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:24,586
( both grunting and yelling )

1106
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,815
-Oh!
-Ah!

1107
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,823
I think we Iost him!

1108
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,830
-I don't think so!
-Heads down!

1109
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,261
( beak snapping shut)

1110
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,597
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa!

1111
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,933
-Whoa!
-( Marina yelling )

1112
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,469
-( yells )
-Oh, no!

1113
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,974
( Marina yells )

1114
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:56,850
Lean right!

1115
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,821
( screeching )

1116
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,788
-Whew.
-( screeching )

1117
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,663
-( Marina screams )
-Come on!

1118
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,861
( yelling )

1119
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,034
( Marina gasping )

1120
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,076
-( screeching )
-Hang on!

1121
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,955
( explosion )

1122
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,019
( both yelling )

1123
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:43,863
Yep, there they are.

1124
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,899
( both grunt )

1125
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,737
( panting )

1126
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,834
There... ( clicks tongue )

1127
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,072
just as I... planned.

1128
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,170
( laughs softly )

1129
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,742
CREW:
It's Marina!

1130
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,085
( talking excitedly )

1131
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:10,319
( sobbing ):
We thought you
were gone forever!

1132
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,452
( clears throat )

1133
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,962
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

1134
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,396
But I'm touched by your concern.

1135
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,922
( bones cracking )

1136
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,128
( loud rumbling )

1137
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,608
( all cheering )

1138
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,980
Yee-ha!

1139
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,076
( laughter and cheering )

1140
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,818
* *

1141
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,467
* *

1142
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,144
( inhales )

1143
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,480
Sinbad?

1144
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,486
( exhales )

1145
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,114
Thank you for coming after me.

1146
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:16,148
Well, y...

1147
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,124
you're welcome.

1148
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,263
This Iife suits you.

1149
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,494
( chuckles ):
Yeah.

1150
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,468
I wasn't made for dry Iand.

1151
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,164
( chuckles )

1152
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,832
And you?

1153
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,637
Is it the shore... or the sea?

1154
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,973
I've always Ioved the sea.

1155
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,744
I even dreamed
of a Iife on it.

1156
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,752
But it wasn't meant to be.

1157
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,119
I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

1158
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,989
You really have to give it up?

1159
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,353
Yes.

1160
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,091
( sighs quietly )

1161
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,330
( gasps softly )

1162
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,835
* *

1163
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,583
* *

1164
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,622
You know, I've
traveled the world,

1165
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,388
seen things no other
man has seen...

1166
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,622
but nothing...

1167
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:30,827
nothing compares
to the open sea.

1168
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,859
And is this what
you always wanted?

1169
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,337
( chuckles ):
Not really.

1170
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,068
When we were young,
Proteus and I

1171
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,235
used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

1172
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,244
and serving Syracuse
side by side.

1173
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,680
But as we got older,
our Iives began to change.

1174
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:52,416
He's a prince,
and I'm... well.

1175
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,719
( chuckles )

1176
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,192
I was never jealous
of him, though...

1177
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,162
until one morning,
a ship came into harbor...

1178
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,155
a ship with his
future on it.

1179
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,465
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

1180
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,234
( whispering ):
What was on the ship?

1181
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,801
You.

1182
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,712
Proteus met you
at the dock.

1183
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,648
I jumped on the
first outbound ship

1184
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,584
and never Iooked back.

1185
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,545
Until now.

1186
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,385
* *

1187
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,660
( distant whooshing )

1188
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,402
( loud whooshing )

1189
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,981
( explosion )

1190
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,246
The gates of T artarus.

1191
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:02,040
( crew chattering indistinctly )

1192
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,385
Rat! Give me a Iookout!

1193
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:18,856
( grunts )

1194
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,304
We're dead.

1195
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,635
SINBAD:
What is it?!

1196
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,368
I-I-It just ends, Captain!

1197
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:28,273
It's the edge of the world!

1198
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,846
Pay up. It's flat.

1199
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:34,178
( coins clinking )

1200
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:36,184
Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

1201
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,185
Nuh-uh-uh.

1202
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,380
The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

1203
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:40,649
( sighs )

1204
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:44,785
( quietly):
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

1205
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:47,556
Beyond the horizon.

1206
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:49,826
( wind whipping )

1207
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:56,233
( fluttering )

1208
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,465
Sinbad?

1209
00:56:58,507 --> 00:57:00,236
Men! AII hands to your posts!

1210
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:02,436
Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

1211
00:57:02,477 --> 00:57:03,774
What?

1212
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:05,803
Now! Go! Go! Go!

1213
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,712
Eh, Sinbad, how-how are
we gonna pull this off?

1214
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:09,046
Just trust me.

1215
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:11,552
Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'Ie!

1216
00:57:11,586 --> 00:57:13,076
But that would stop us dead!

1217
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:13,780
Just do it!

1218
00:57:13,822 --> 00:57:15,380
Aye, aye, Captain.

1219
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:16,788
( grunts )

1220
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,091

01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,928
( crew gasping, Spike barking )

1290
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:14,833
( thunder crashing )

1291
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:24,573
( electrical crackling )

1292
01:00:28,683 --> 01:00:31,447
( rope whips )

1293
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,546
( wind whistling )

1294
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:39,952
( creatures chittering )

1295
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,430
( grunts )

1296
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:45,728
Huh?

1297
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,758
( wind whistling )

1298
01:00:49,304 --> 01:00:51,932
( both grunting and panting )

1299
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:56,837
( wood creaking )

1300
01:00:59,914 --> 01:01:00,881
( Marina pants )

1301
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:01,904
( Sinbad grunts )

1302
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,215
* *

1303
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:17,665
( grunting )

1304
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:24,767
( pounding footstep )

1305
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,296
-Huh?
-Huh?

1306
01:01:26,341 --> 01:01:29,367
( chittering )

1307
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:31,879
( growling )

1308
01:01:31,913 --> 01:01:33,881
( bellowing )

1309
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:36,145
( grunts )

1310
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:39,620
ERIS :
Now, now, my pets.

1311
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:44,284
Is this any way
to treat a guest?

1312
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,529
Okay, I'm severely creeped out.

1313
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:58,037
Bravo.

1314
01:01:58,073 --> 01:02:01,338
No mortal has ever made it
to T artarus before.

1315
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:02,673
( chuckling )

1316
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,178
AIive, that is... ( chuckles )

1317
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:07,403
Make yourself at home.

1318
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:09,007
( chuckles nervously )

1319
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,449
Thank you. Uh...

1320
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:11,816
nice place you got here.

1321
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,218
Like it?

1322
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:16,485
I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

1323
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,889
Wow, that's a good plan.

1324
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:23,762
Well, I see you're busy,
so Iisten, we'II just take

1325
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:25,925
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

1326
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:26,899
( chuckles )

1327
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:28,562
What makes you think I have it?

1328
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,002
Uh, well, you framed me
for the theft,

1329
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,563
so they would execute me.

1330
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:33,869
You?

1331
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:34,897
Yeah.

1332
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:39,209
No.

1333
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:40,509
Proteus!

1334
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,573
You knew he would take my place.

1335
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,947
( chuckles )

1336
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:45,748
What a clever Iittle man
you are.

1337
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:47,379
You thought I'd run.

1338
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:51,188
Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

1339
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,592
Left without
the next rightful king,

1340
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,688
and tumble into glorious chaos.

1341
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,099
You humans are so predictable.

1342
01:03:01,136 --> 01:03:03,798
Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

1343
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,136
and you couldn't help
betraying him.

1344
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:09,302
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

1345
01:03:09,344 --> 01:03:11,312
Oh, but you did betray him.

1346
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:13,871
You stole his only Iove.

1347
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,109
Look at her, Sinbad.

1348
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,117
( grunts )

1349
01:03:16,151 --> 01:03:18,551
He's not even
in his grave yet,

1350
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,180
and you're moving in
on his girl.

1351
01:03:21,222 --> 01:03:26,626
Face it: your heart
is as black as mine.

1352
01:03:26,694 --> 01:03:28,457
You're wrong about him!

1353
01:03:28,496 --> 01:03:29,793
He knows I'm not!

1354
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:31,264
You don't know
what's in his heart.

1355
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:32,994
Oh, yes, I do.

1356
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:35,969
And more importantly,
so does he.

1357
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:37,471
In your heart,
you know that

1358
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:39,405
Proteus is
going to die

1359
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,840
because he saw
something in you

1360
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:43,935
that just isn't there.

1361
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:45,275
No.

1362
01:03:45,313 --> 01:03:46,610
You want to bet?

1363
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:49,412
I'II tell you what.
Let's play a game.

1364
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,509
And if you win,
I'II give you

1365
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:52,918
the Book of Peace.

1366
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,252
( rumbling )

1367
01:03:58,092 --> 01:04:00,185
There it is, noble hero.

1368
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:01,855
-( rumbling )
-( grunts )

1369
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:05,024
ERIS:
Not so fast.

1370
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:07,193
My game has rules,
Sinbad.

1371
01:04:07,235 --> 01:04:09,203
I'II ask you a question.

1372
01:04:09,237 --> 01:04:11,228
One simple question.

1373
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,833
If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

1374
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,901
-Give me your word.
-( exasperated sigh )

1375
01:04:16,945 --> 01:04:19,072
You still don't trust me?

1376
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:21,411
Uh... no.

1377
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:25,545
( exhaling ):
Isn't it a pity
we Iive in such skeptical times?

1378
01:04:25,587 --> 01:04:27,077
Oh, all right.

1379
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:30,682
You have my word, as a goddess.

1380
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:33,558
Fair enough?

1381
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,265
Ask your question.

1382
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:39,357
Excellent.

1383
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,630
Now, we all know what happens

1384
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,899
if you get the Book of Peace.

1385
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:47,203
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

1386
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,472
But if you don't get the Book,

1387
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,478
you have
a choice to make.

1388
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,377
Either sail to paradise

1389
01:04:53,414 --> 01:04:55,143
with the woman
of your dreams,

1390
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:58,880
or return to Syracuse to die.

1391
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,684
You're either a thief or a hero.

1392
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:04,385
So, here's my question, Sinbad.

1393
01:05:04,425 --> 01:05:07,121
If you don't get the Book,

1394
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:10,153
will you go back to die?

1395
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,631
( wind whistles )

1396
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:26,169
I will go back.

1397
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,588
( rumbling )

1398
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:39,991
You're Iying.

1399
01:05:42,263 --> 01:05:43,457
( grunts )

1400
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:51,267
( chuckles wickedly )

1401
01:05:57,145 --> 01:05:58,169
( grunts )

1402
01:05:58,212 --> 01:05:59,543
( grunts )

1403
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,053
( inhales )

1404
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,087
( sighs )

1405
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,230
I'm sorry, Marina.

1406
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:27,002
Eris is right about me.

1407
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,373
No, she's not.
You answered her question.

1408
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,536
You told the truth.

1409
01:06:30,578 --> 01:06:33,240
It wasn't the truth.

1410
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,648
It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

1411
01:06:36,684 --> 01:06:38,481
Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

1412
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:40,146
You don't need to pretend!

1413
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,416
Eris trapped you!

1414
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:45,085
Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!

1415
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:45,820
Marina...

1416
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,919
No! You need to escape.

1417
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,192
Get as far away as you can.

1418
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:52,290
I'II go back.
I'II explain everything.

1419
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,197
No, Marina.

1420
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:54,724
( sobs )

1421
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:58,830
I can't watch you die!

1422
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:02,000
I Iove you.

1423
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,211
* *

1424
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,431
But could you Iove a man
who would run away?

1425
01:07:40,648 --> 01:07:43,014
* *

1426
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:04,500
* *

1427
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:20,711
( ax scrapes ground)

1428
01:08:26,427 --> 01:08:27,394
( whirring )

1429
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:28,395
-( clang )
-( crowd exclaims )

1430
01:08:28,429 --> 01:08:29,396
( gasps, pants )

1431
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:32,422
( crowd murmuring )

1432
01:08:38,172 --> 01:08:40,936
I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

1433
01:08:40,975 --> 01:08:41,942
( exhales )

1434
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:43,466
I was... ( gulps )

1435
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:46,207
...beginning to wonder.

1436
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:51,944
The Book?

1437
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:55,285
I did my best.

1438
01:08:55,323 --> 01:08:57,223
It wasn't enough.

1439
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,793
No.

1440
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:04,059
You came back anyway.

1441
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:09,331
How could I do anything else...
my friend?

1442
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,700
( whimpering )

1443
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:25,075
* *

1444
01:09:37,698 --> 01:09:40,633
( Spike barking )

1445
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:42,966
( whimpering )

1446
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:45,768
( crowd murmuring )

1447
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,041
* *

1448
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,491
( tinkling )

1449
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:15,127
( crowd gasping, exclaiming )

1450
01:10:20,575 --> 01:10:21,667
Get back!

1451
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:29,511
( wind whipping )

1452
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,380
( gasping )

1453
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:40,292
How dare you?!

1454
01:10:40,328 --> 01:10:44,196
Everything
was going perfectly,

1455
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:47,064
and now you do this!

1456
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:49,602
( panicked cries )

1457
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:53,903
Eris, I don't understand.

1458
01:10:53,941 --> 01:10:56,068
Don't play coy with me.

1459
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:59,806
Maybe you can fool these people,

1460
01:10:59,847 --> 01:11:01,610
but I know who you are.

1461
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:05,881
You're a selfish,
unprincipled Iiar!

1462
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,547
Wait a minute.

1463
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:09,613
I didn't Iie.

1464
01:11:09,657 --> 01:11:11,318
I came back.

1465
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,758
That's why you're here.

1466
01:11:12,793 --> 01:11:14,920
This was all part
of your test.

1467
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:16,190
I told the truth.

1468
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,925
And wasn't there something

1469
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:20,331
about being
"bound for all eternity"?

1470
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:24,328
( gasps )

1471
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,139
( grunts )

1472
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:33,946
( sighs )

1473
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,351
( crowd exclaims )

1474
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,120
Well, well, well.

1475
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:48,060
This has got to be a Iittle
embarrassing for you, Eris.

1476
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,119
( chuckles softly )

1477
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:51,630
Don't push your Iuck, Sinbad.

1478
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:55,534
You're cute,
but not that cute.

1479
01:11:57,204 --> 01:12:00,640
And Iucky for you,
I've got places to go,

1480
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:05,408
things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

1481
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,970
Ta.

1482
01:12:10,384 --> 01:12:12,215
( sighs )

1483
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,259
* *

1484
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:31,561
( wind blows )

1485
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:45,280
* *

1486
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:53,953
( crowd cheering )

1487
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:57,488
( panting )

1488
01:12:57,531 --> 01:12:59,761
You know,
for what it's worth,

1489
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,667
I think the council
believes you now.

1490
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:08,402
You think?

1491
01:13:08,442 --> 01:13:11,775
( cheering )

1492
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:13,302
( chuckling )

1493
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:17,649
King Dymas.

1494
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,152
Uh, whoa, hey.

1495
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,414
How much you got on you?

1496
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:24,618
I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

1497
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:27,593
and the apology of a king.

1498
01:13:27,628 --> 01:13:28,560
( chuckles )

1499
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:30,063
No, really. How much?

1500
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:32,224
Sinbad.

1501
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,267
( chuckles softly )

1502
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,834
( applauding )

1503
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:39,931
Come on.

1504
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:41,942
This is going to be
a heck of a party.

1505
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:44,570
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

1506
01:13:44,612 --> 01:13:46,239
Fair winds, calm seas.

1507
01:13:46,347 --> 01:13:48,474
Nothing much to tell.

1508
01:13:48,516 --> 01:13:50,074
( chuckles )

1509
01:13:50,117 --> 01:13:51,175
What's the matter?

1510
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,448
No fun if you're
actually invited?

1511
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,652
No, it's just, uh...

1512
01:14:00,694 --> 01:14:03,185
there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

1513
01:14:09,003 --> 01:14:11,733
Good sailing, Sinbad.

1514
01:14:11,772 --> 01:14:13,137
( distant cheers )

1515
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:14,573
Get a haircut.

1516
01:14:14,608 --> 01:14:17,372
You're going to be king someday.

1517
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,346
( applauding )

1518
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:26,445
( whimpering )

1519
01:14:26,487 --> 01:14:30,423
( whimpering )

1520
01:14:36,797 --> 01:14:41,063
( crowd cheering )

1521
01:14:45,005 --> 01:14:47,701
( distant seagulls screeching )

1522
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:54,578
Just another

1523
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,913
uneventful day in Syracuse.

1524
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,578
( chuckles softly )

1525
01:15:02,756 --> 01:15:05,657
You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

1526
01:15:05,693 --> 01:15:07,627
She Iooked over the ocean

1527
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,323
and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

1528
01:15:10,364 --> 01:15:13,800
She saw... such wonder.

1529
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:17,668
And what happened
to this woman?

1530
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:19,764
She got her chance.

1531
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:24,267
She sailed the seas,
and she fell in Iove.

1532
01:15:26,547 --> 01:15:28,344
( sighs )

1533
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:29,575
Proteus, I...

1534
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:33,348
Marina, follow your heart.

1535
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,252
Mine is here in Syracuse.

1536
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,882
Yours...

1537
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:42,123
yours is sailing
with the next tide.

1538
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,724
( sighing ):
Oh, Proteus.

1539
01:16:00,648 --> 01:16:04,709
( seagulls screeching )

1540
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:06,913
Captain?

1541
01:16:06,954 --> 01:16:08,148
Hmm?

1542
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:10,247
We're ready to sail.

1543
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,384
AII right, Kale.

1544
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:14,620
Take us out.

1545
01:16:14,662 --> 01:16:16,129
Aye, aye, Captain.

1546
01:16:16,163 --> 01:16:17,755
Cast off!

1547
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:20,699
( crew shouting )

1548
01:16:28,275 --> 01:16:30,004
( whimpering )

1549
01:16:40,688 --> 01:16:42,212
Oh... Rat!

1550
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:43,245
RAT:
What?

1551
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:46,422
( chuckling )

1552
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,587
MARINA:
Excuse me, Captain.

1553
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:51,427
You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

1554
01:16:51,498 --> 01:16:53,466
The mizzen ropes
need the support.

1555
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:58,596
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

1556
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:00,971
That's halfway around the world.

1557
01:17:01,008 --> 01:17:03,135
Then we'd better get started.

1558
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,442
Well, you know,

1559
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:11,347
that means going through
the Hydra's Iair.

1560
01:17:11,385 --> 01:17:13,250
-Mm-hmm.
-The Minotaur's haven.

1561
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:14,447
-Mm-hmm.
-The Cyclops' den.

1562
01:17:14,521 --> 01:17:16,113
-Mm-hmm.
-Under the Swansea Bridge.

1563
01:17:16,156 --> 01:17:18,124
-Mm-hmm.
-Through the China Seas.

1564
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:19,955
That's a very Iong voyage.

1565
01:17:19,994 --> 01:17:24,397
And it's very, very dangerous.

1566
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,728
Don't worry.

1567
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,064
I'II protect you.

1568
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,638
( barking )

1569
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,081
( barks )

1570
01:17:43,017 --> 01:17:44,450
( grunting )

1571
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:45,816
SINBAD:
Oh, Spike.

1572
01:17:45,853 --> 01:17:47,650
MARINA ( chuckling ):
Spike.

1573
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:50,452
SINBAD:
Spike... down.

1574
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,959
( orchestra plays
swashbuckling theme )

1575
01:18:11,578 --> 01:18:16,538
* *

1576
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:46,535
* *

1577
01:19:11,672 --> 01:19:16,632
* *

1578
01:19:41,635 --> 01:19:46,595
* *

1579
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:16,726
* *

1580
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:46,689
* *

1581
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:16,786
* *

1582
01:21:41,788 --> 01:21:46,782
* *

1583
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:16,879
* *

1584
01:22:41,848 --> 01:22:46,808
* *

1585
01:23:11,912 --> 01:23:16,906
* *

1586
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:46,869
* *

1587
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:16,999
* *

1588
01:24:41,968 --> 01:24:46,962
* *

1589
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:08,551
( music ends )
