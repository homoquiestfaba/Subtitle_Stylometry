1
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,565
Well, finally she's up!

2
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,238
You're late, Natsuki.

3
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,909
You could've woken me up, Mom!

4
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,078
You said you could get up on your own.

5
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,922
It's starting.

6
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,929
Good morning, Amane.

7
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,097
I win.

8
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,016
Huh? In what?

9
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,436
You said we'd see which of
us could get up earlier.

10
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,440
Come on, focus on the exercise!

11
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,526
You forgot, didn't you?

12
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,445
No, it's not that...

13
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,114
I simply didn't remember.

14
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,532
Same thing!

15
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,286
I'm... so... sorry!

16
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,299
Good morning, Tama! How's it going?

17
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,970
Oops... I'm sorry.

18
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,596
Mom, look at this.

19
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,557
See? Buy me a new one, please!

20
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,602
Fix it yourself.

21
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,480
What? That's impossible!

22
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,821
Reading while you eat is bad manners.

23
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,326
A businessman can't even take
time to enjoy his breakfast?

24
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,662
I can't shake off the habit just yet.

25
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,667
How was the field today?

26
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,502
It got attacked.

27
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,962
It's all messed up.

28
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,797
Why don't you report it to the police?

29
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,506
Yeah.

30
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,135
I'll just catch them myself.

31
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,013
<i>It's because grandpa's wasabi is too tasty.</i>

32
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,686
"Miss Summer Vacation" will come to
the rescue in the worst-case scenario.

33
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,313
Who is that?

34
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,690
My alter ego.

35
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,027
A mysterious superhero!

36
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,945
Wasn't it supposed to be...

37
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,363
- "Miss Summer Lady"?
- Thank you for the food!

38
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,324
She must've transformed again.

39
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,950
She's not a heroine anymore?

40
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,870
Ah! It's so yummy!

41
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,999
<i>It's now nine o'clock. Today's first game
of the Summer Baseball Championship...</i>

42
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,298
You've got everything?

43
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,049
Yup!

44
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,633
Here!

45
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,303
Thanks!

46
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,897
Why?

47
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,232
'Cause you'll be late.

48
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,401
Go on, Natsuki. Thanks.

49
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,903
Leave it to me!

50
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,072
Hold on tight. I'll go fast!

51
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,657
Hold on tighter!

52
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,701
This is good enough.

53
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,750
See you later!

54
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,877
- Bye! - Be careful!

55
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,027
I'm home!

56
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,112
Welcome back!

57
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,572
I'll have your lunch packed soon!

58
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,409
Don't worry about it, Mom.
You worked the night shift.

59
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,914
I won't be able to see you for a
week. This is the least I can do.

60
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,625
Let me help you, then. I'll make rice balls.

61
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,712
Kiyoshi, you've grown taller?

62
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,297
No, I'm the same.

63
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,718
- Bye! See you later! - Bye! See you later!

64
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,719
Later!

65
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,805
Give it your best!

66
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,306
Bye-bye!

67
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,114
COSMOS STORE

68
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,577
Koji, what are those books for?

69
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,662
I'm going to read them to my friends,

70
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,250
'cause it gets boring there.

71
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,419
Do you want to take my PlayStation?

72
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,465
The goal is to cultivate friendship among us.

73
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,468
We used to just camp out on a riverbed.

74
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,845
I'd be worried about the little ones.

75
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,847
There are only four in the entire school.

76
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,098
Five.

77
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,851
Amane's cousin, Natsuki,
has transferred to our school.

78
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,187
Oh, yeah... What's she like?

79
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,814
Well, she gets carried away easily.

80
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,358
She let Pyon-Kichi out, after all.

81
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,116
Mom's saying she's glad you're leaving!

82
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,036
Here, Noriko. It's freshly squeezed.

83
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,956
Hiroto, I've told you to wear pants outside.

84
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,708
But the gate is over there!

85
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,337
Well, I'm off.

86
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,881
Shall I bring you something later?

87
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,886
No. I'll send you an e-mail
if I need something. Besides,
Kiyoshi will look after us.

88
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,483
Hey, Kiyoshi, what about tents?

89
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,902
No, it's OK. We'll sleep in a classroom.

90
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,986
Roger.

91
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,078
Good morning.

92
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,664
- Morning! - Morning!

93
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,082
Morning.

94
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,416
You're late!

95
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,503
What? We're the last?

96
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,754
- Yup. - Bingo!

97
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,674
Gosh, I don't like it.

98
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,093
It's not a race, you know.

99
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,427
I know, but...

100
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,763
Noriko, put this in the fridge, too.

101
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,931
- Sure thing! - There!

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,019
Let's see...

103
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,272
PYON-KICHI'S HOUSE

104
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,231
Huh?

105
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,446
He's not back?

106
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Not yet.

107
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,380
Are you still mad about Pyon-Kichi?

108
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,592
I'm not mad, but...

109
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,261
Well, I never dreamed that he'd run away.

110
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,974
I'll buy you a new bunny. OK?

111
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,475
No, thanks.

112
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,310
What?

113
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,477
Just... never mind!

114
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,655
I'll be back a week from today at 6 PM.

115
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,408
Oh, OK. Thank you.

116
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,909
Take care.

117
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,287
- Thanks. - Don't come to check on us!

118
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,580
All right.

119
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,167
We never came... last year
or the year before that.

120
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,919
Because we trust Kiyoshi, after all.

121
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,433
SUMMER CAMP

122
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,186
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE

123
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,192
What are we gonna do now?

124
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,445
Hey, wanna play a cell phone game?

125
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,696
Some other time.

126
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,699
We need to do our homework.

127
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,337
But, it's still Day One.

128
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,216
Why don't we go to the woods
and look for Pyon-Kichi?

129
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,221
He may be homesick by now.

130
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:33,692
Pyon-Kichi!

131
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,735
Don't go so fast.

132
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,987
You guys are slow.

133
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:45,245
Pyon-Kichi!

134
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,583
Be more serious!

135
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,585
I am!

136
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,927
How come Pyon-Kichi ran away to begin with?

137
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,096
He was nice and calm.

138
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,936
It was the last day of
school... right here...

139
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,776
It's wide open and refreshing
out here, isn't it?

140
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,447
You can play a little
before your crash course.

141
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,950
I want you to learn to shake hands.

142
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,952
The final goal is a back flip.

143
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,621
Amane will be really impressed.

144
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,749
Huh?

145
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,420
What is it?

146
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,715
You know. A hero needs a mascot.

147
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,051
I was hoping I could train him to be one.

148
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,971
You are an idiot.

149
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,725
I hope he'll come back soon.

150
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,103
Wanna drink?

151
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,247
Koji, what's the matter?

152
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,916
I fell down!

153
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,419
Are you all right?

154
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,254
I'm OK.

155
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,340
I'm coming down!

156
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:43,029
Mystery circles are created by a UFO
landing! This is a great discovery!

157
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,113
UFO...

158
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:44,864
Awesome!

159
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:51,538
Aren't they supposed to be a
hoax? That's what I heard on TV.

160
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,541
Who would play such a trick in our village?

161
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,543
Hiroto might.

162
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,212
He couldn't do anything this complicated.

163
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,296
A locust!

164
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,297
What? Where?

165
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,717
I wonder if someone spilled
pesticide or something.

166
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,556
Noriko, take a picture.
I'll put it up on our homepage.

167
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,723
All right.

168
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,561
Take a good one. This will change
the history of mankind.

169
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,148
Don't pressure me.
I don't do well under pressure.

170
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,075
Pyon-Kichi.

171
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,244
Pyon-Kichi?

172
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,581
Let's see...

173
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,915
Pyon-Kichi?

174
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,003
It's not him...

175
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,344
Are you all right?

176
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,019
Hey, is it a dog?

177
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,854
What do we do?

178
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,355
He's hurt.

179
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,275
Noriko, give me your handkerchief.

180
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,537
Koji, hit big!

181
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,123
Kiyoshi, big bro! Clobber them!

182
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,466
- Run! - Catch it! Catch it!

183
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,470
Throw it at him!

184
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,638
There!

185
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,557
- OUT! - Good job!

186
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,143
One more to go!

187
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,478
That was close...

188
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,151
Sorry, but I'm gonna hit a big one!

189
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,987
Kiyoshi, big bro! Take her out!

190
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,656
Take her out!

191
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,993
All right!

192
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,510
My home run...

193
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,762
Look! He's all better!

194
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,185
What a smart guy!

195
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,856
First of all, let me say...

196
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,360
Thank you. You saved my life.

197
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,537
My name is Pochi. I'm from Planet
BOW in the Animal Stellar Region.

198
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,715
You're a dog no matter how we look at you.

199
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,052
I can't believe I'm being
lumped in with dogs!

200
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,389
This is my ID.

201
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,307
You really are an alien.

202
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,351
Yes. Nice to meet you.

203
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,064
Were they space alphabet letters?

204
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,858
Yeah.

205
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,027
How can you speak Japanese so well?

206
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,240
I studied. I'm totally fine
with everyday conversation.

207
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,830
His butt looks normal.

208
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,877
Wh... Wh... What are you doing? How rude!

209
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,926
So, Pochi, what have you
come to the Earth for?

210
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,680
To study plants.

211
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,348
Study plants?

212
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,936
Yes, because I found a species that
went extinct 5 billion years ago.

213
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,231
- Five billion years?
- Such an amazing thing exists?

214
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,026
- Much older than the
Earth. - I have no clue.

215
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,239
The flowers are called Zughaan,
and they are beautiful like you.

216
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,622
18 years ago, microparticles believed to be
from Zughaan circulated in the underworld.

217
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,210
I looked all throughout space.

218
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,296
And, finally, I found them on this planet.

219
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,971
Nothing from this undeveloped
planet can be taken out.

220
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,433
So, I was doing my research
here, when they came.

221
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,062
I fought back and kept the poachers away!

222
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,397
But I got hurt.

223
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,277
Are you all right?

224
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,655
Yes!

225
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,327
I've recovered, thanks to you.

226
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm glad.

227
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,504
Breaking news!

228
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,342
We're in the middle of experiencing
Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

229
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,969
This is a major scoop!

230
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:58,970
Yeah...

231
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,014
Pochi, can I write an article on this?

232
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,309
No. It's banned by an agreement.

233
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,811
That sucks!

234
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,482
Ah! She's come to.

235
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,155
I scared you, didn't I? I apologize.

236
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:43,848
Here.

237
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,559
Do you think the poachers are coming back?

238
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,685
Leave it to me.

239
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,521
I'll have surveillance
beefed up once I get home.

240
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,733
When are you coming back?

241
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,196
I don't think we'll see each other again.

242
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,072
What?

243
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,658
We've only just met...

244
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,164
Technically, I'm supposed to
avoid contact with you guys.

245
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,335
I wanted to hear a lot more about space.

246
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,045
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,927
Well, I'd like to personally thank you.

248
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,098
Do you have any wishes?

249
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,268
Oh, yes! Pyon-Kichi!

250
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,772
Find Pyon-Kichi for us!

251
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,107
Is he one of you?

252
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,734
- Yes! - No!

253
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,739
He's a pet. A rabbit. He has ears this long.

254
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,035
Sorry, but I can't.

255
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,411
I see...

256
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,626
Well, we can all look for
Pyon-Kichi together. Anything else?

257
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:00,132
Oh! Please take Kiyoshi on a school trip!

258
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,593
What? Me?

259
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,806
Yeah, because they canceled
the trip starting this year!

260
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,308
Three nights, four days to Kyoto and Nara.

261
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,645
But there's no point if it's
just me and my teacher.

262
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,397
Then, why don't we all go?

263
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,066
I vote for that!

264
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,279
Yeah! Let's go, Kiyoshi!

265
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,656
Uh... sure.

266
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,907
To where?

267
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,493
As far as possible, then.

268
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,829
All right. Got it.

269
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,667
Then, I'll take you to the Moon,
the farthest mankind has traveled.

270
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,502
The Moon?

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,010
- We're floating! Floating!
- It's zero gravity.

272
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,513
<i>Hold on a sec. It doesn't
have to be that far.</i>

273
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,433
Don't worry. I'll pay for the expense.

274
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,602
Whoa! Look!

275
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,216
It's so blue...

276
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,052
Yeah...

277
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,389
Wow! Wow! It's the Hubble!

278
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,688
No one would believe us...

279
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,997
Whoa! Inside an UFO?

280
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,415
We'll take a cab now.

281
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,751
- How can you walk? - There are taxi
cabs in space, too.

282
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,920
Thanks to space science.

283
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,755
Whoa...

284
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,507
$@#&#@%...

285
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,175

00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,426
<i>$#@%ˆ&*</i>

287
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,220
What did you say?

288
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,097
I said, "To the Moon."

289
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,067
It's the Moon.

290
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,861
We're here for real.

291
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,239
Kiyoshi! Say cheese! Cheese!

292
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,451
- Me, too. Me, too! - Me, too!

293
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,912
<i>Hey, Noriko. Take a picture of that.</i>

294
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,126
Come on. Don't get too excited.

295
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,919
You haven't seen the real Moon yet.

296
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,680
The Moon is... awesome...

297
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,723
Yeah.

298
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,560
Pick up your jungle gym on the way home.

299
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,728
All right.

300
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,692
This is fun!

301
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,154
I'm wobbly.

302
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,740
We're here!

303
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,744
<i>$#@%ˆ&*%&#@$%! &</i>

304
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,870
It's a robot.

305
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,580
<i>- $#@%ˆ&*$#%&# - What?</i>

306
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,750
<i>- @%ˆ&*$#... - He's telling
you to go through Immigration.</i>

307
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,501
What?

308
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,171
You guys will be fine. Let's go.

309
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,763
<i>$@#&#@%@ $%! &&%* #@%ˆ&*$%%&#</i>

310
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,396
Your data will be stored at
the Space Control Center.

311
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,105
What?

312
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,359
Please declare your personal name,
residence planet and life activity time.

313
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:11,944
What?

314
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,113
State your name.

315
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,866
S... Suzuki... Amane. Seven years old.

316
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,288
Lovely Amane, welcome to the Moon!

317
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,747
Thanks.

318
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,419
Did you know that Earth has not
joined the Space Federation yet?

319
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,965
So, you're not allowed to travel in space.

320
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,592
What? That's not good...

321
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,430
But, if you pass the test I'm about to give
you, I'll grant you a special passport.

322
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,223
That's good.

323
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,935
But, if you fail, you'll be sent
to the Space Lost Child Center.

324
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,769
What?

325
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,272
You'll stay there until
Earth joins the Federation.

326
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,107
Here's the question.

327
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,944
One day a space alien comes to you...

328
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,615
and says, "People of the Earth,
we will make you smart so that...

329
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:03,120
there will be no wars or poverty,
and that everyone will get along."

330
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,458
Now, will you accept this alien's offer?

331
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,470
No, thanks.

332
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,305
Why is that?

333
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:28,771
It'll be nice to become smart and
get along with everyone and all...

334
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,943
But, I think it'll make me happier
if I work at it on my own.

335
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,279
That's what I learned in school...

336
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,532
That I should look after myself.

337
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,332
Correct answer!

338
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,167
Really?

339
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,461
Yes. Good job!

340
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,843
<i>$@#&#@%@ $%! &&%*</i>

341
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,144
Yeah.

342
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,065
Mine is this. Same as Kiyoshi's.

343
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,234
Mine is this.

344
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,735
Snazzy!

345
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,698
Now, we're waiting for Natsuki...

346
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,083
She'll be fine. Amane,
why don't you put on your passport?

347
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,710
You'll be surprised.

348
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,839
I'll do it.

349
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,924
Look up and watch.

I'm so sorry.

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,977
So many aliens here.

365
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,146
Yeah...

366
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,861
Welcome to space!

367
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,330
Go ahead and order whatever you like.

368
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,167
- Now we're talking!
- Let's see... what do I want?

369
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,339
Welcome to Space Burger!

370
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,550
Have you decided what to order?

371
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,721
We'll have Andro Burgers and Crystal
Potatoes with colas, six each.

372
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,849
Thank you for your order.

373
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,732
One cola costs one pod.

374
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,819
How much is one pod in dollars?

375
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,404
Who knows...

376
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,364
Let's see...

377
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,868
How much is a ticket to a movie?

378
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,704
It's six pods with a child discount.

379
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,373
How much is it on Earth?

380
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,375
It's about 11 dollars.

381
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,713
In other words, divide 11 by 6 and
you'll know how many dollars one pod is.

382
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,172
That makes sense.

383
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,757
Let's do it.

384
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,259
What?

385
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,514
One... Two... Three...

386
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,392
Amane, you're excluded.

387
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,520
Why? I'll do it.

388
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,113
Got it! The answer is1.833333...

389
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,116
So, one pod is about a dollar and 83 cents.

390
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,284
Very good.

391
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,203
Thank you for waiting!

392
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,958
A dollar and 83 cents for this?

393
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,752
What a rip off!

394
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,216
- It tastes the same.
- Cola is cola anywhere.

395
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,970
Ah! The Space Show!

396
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,523
Ladies and Aliens!

397
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:09,653
Presenting the best space
entertainment for you tonight...

398
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,197
The Space Show!

399
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:17,619
We're live from the
Magellan Antique Book Fair!

400
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,622
<i>The first program is...</i>

401
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,710
What's the Space Show?

402
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,837
Pochi?

403
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,881
What's the Space Show?

404
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,635
It's the most popular TV program.

405
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,515
You have that kind of stuff in space, too?

406
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,641
Yes.

407
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,853
It's a pirate program broadcast
live all throughout space.

408
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,856
Live broadcast? To all of space?

409
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,732
Yes.

410
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,151
You can do that without a time lag?

411
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,028
It'd be a problem if we couldn't.

412
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,863
I guess so.

413
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,239
She's so pretty!

414
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,828
What a pretty dog!

415
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,582
She's not a dog. She's from
the same planet as I.

416
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,750
What? She can't be!

417
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,209
What do you mean?

418
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,753
Is she your friend then?

419
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,214
Well... sort of...

420
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,095
You couldn't get a hold of it?

421
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,097
Tell me why you went there?

422
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,266
<i>Our enemy was there.</i>

423
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,061
<i>We barely escaped!</i>

424
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,565
<i>In my case, my whole life flashed before me.</i>

425
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,860
<i>But, we have a souvenir for you.</i>

426
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,696
You coward! Idiot!

427
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,783
I want Zughaan! Go get some for me!

428
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,950
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

429
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,619
Unbelievable...

430
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,790
Our enemy?

431
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,795
I'm starving.

432
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,422
Let's grab a bite first.

433
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,298
Yeah.

434
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,300
- We should finish our
business first. - Shut up!

435
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,970
A robot like you wouldn't know
how painful it is to be hungry!

436
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,434
<i>Fate brought the two together...</i>

437
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,771
The Space Show was interesting.

438
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,605
Yeah.

439
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,942
I wanna be like Marie.

440
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,735
You've always wanted to be an idol.

441
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm Iron Mask.

442
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,827
I wanna be a hero like him.

443
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,787
But you're a girl.

444
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,164
Those are your dreams, huh?

445
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,626
Miss Amane, what would you like to be?

446
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,795
Yes! President!

447
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,172
Good for you! A grand dream!

448
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,841
I wanna be a space expert.

449
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,969
<i>Kiyoshi, what's your dream?</i>

450
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,803
What?

451
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,640
As long as I can help others...

452
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,016
A medical doctor, right?

453
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,353
We'll see...

454
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,605
How about you?

455
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,483
What did you wanna be?

456
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,655
I wanted to travel through space,
doing all sorts of research.

457
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,448
Then, your dream has come true.

458
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,034
- That's great! - Yeah!

459
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,122
I guess...

460
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,376
I'll turn in my report and make
arrangements for the return flight.

461
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,546
Go shopping while you wait for me.

462
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,382
10 pods!

463
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,550
But...

464
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,718
Don't worry about it.

465
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,889
You saved my life. Let me take care
of you while you are here.

466
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,726
- OK, then. - All right!

467
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,060
Thank you, Pochi.

468
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,729
Thank you.

469
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,063
Thank you!

470
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,732
Don't waste it on junk!

471
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
We won't!

472
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,402
- Off to a toy store! - Good idea!

473
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,904
Let's look at some clothes.

474
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,411
Cut it out!

475
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,269
Hey, look! They're aquatic aliens!

476
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:20,111
"To protect vegetation, enhanced security
of the geosphere is necessary and...

477
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,781
strongly recommended.
Reported by Pochi Rickman."

478
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,282
<i>Submit your I.D.</i>

479
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,953
<i>Verified.</i>

480
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:40,966
Here we go...

481
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,134
Three tickets to Earth.

482
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,135
You can't go.

483
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:45,720
How come?

484
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,809
The Earth-bound pathways
were closed a while ago.

485
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,143
Too bad!

486
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,482
The Space Show!

487
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,817
Show!

488
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,821
Thank you very much!

489
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,990
- Have a safe trip! - Thanks!

490
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,500
Things have changed.

491
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,167
What?

492
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,670
You can't go back to Earth.

493
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:19,754
What?

494
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,505
Why?

495
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,843
Well, I guess my report was quite effective.

496
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,013
What have you done?

497
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,681
Stop it!

498
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,851
It's not Pochi's fault.

499
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,854
<i>Actually, it is Pochi's fault.</i>

500
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,188
Ah, yes.

501
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,025
And, when do you think we can return?

502
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,359
No clue...

503
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,029
There is a way, though.

504
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,365
You can go to another planet
and then fly back from there.

505
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,867
Another planet?

506
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,537
My home, Planet BOW.

507
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,872
Planet BOW?

508
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,206
The planet of dogs?

509
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,207
We're not dogs!

510
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,376
How long will it take?

511
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,546
Let's see... 20 years.

512
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,048
20 years?!

513
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,468
The summer break will be over.

514
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,887
More than the summer break.

515
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,725
Um... we're supposed to be
back by 6 PM on the 7th.

516
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,560
Can we expedite the trip?

517
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,397
It'd be so much easier if we
took the Galaxy Super Express.

518
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,565
Really?

519
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,068
Yeah, it's expensive though.

520
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,737
Oh... money...

521
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,406
Leave it to me! I'll work it out.

522
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:41,753
"Look... forward... to the souvenir..."

523
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,254
What are you doing?

524
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,590
Sending an e-mail to Hiroto.

525
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,095
Not out of the area?

526
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,597
It said "within the area".

527
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,769
"Transmission complete."

528
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,271
She's sleeping like a log.

529
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,441
It's already 11 PM on Earth, you know.

530
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,289
I'm... very... sorry.

531
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,292
You mean about Pyon-Kichi?

532
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,133
Say it when she's up.

533
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,804
I did! But she hasn't forgiven me.

534
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,976
Besides, it's not cool to apologize
too many times. I'm older than her.

535
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,818
So much has happened today...

536
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,830
<i>Bow-wow?</i>

537
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,498
Ah, father, this is Pochi.

538
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,002
I'd like you to lend me about
100,000 pods in a prompt manner.

539
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,338
Father?!

540
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,677
1... 2... 3... 4...

541
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,346
5... 6... 7... 8...

542
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,683
1... 2... 3... 4...

543
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,686
5... 6... 7... 8...

544
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,522
1... 2... 3... 4...

545
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,192
5... 6... 7... 8...

546
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,196
The situation has changed.
I couldn't get financial aid.

547
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,197
What?

548
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,198
Which means...

549
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,033
We're stranded here forever?

550
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,704
Don't worry. I'll manage to come
up with the travel expenses!

551
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,206
RACE INFO

552
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,707
First off... pick a solid pick.

553
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,626
And more safe bets...

554
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,544
And this last horse is... make or break...

555
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,379
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

556
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,053
I'll get a job.

557
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:55,720
What?

558
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,723
That way, we'll get to go home sooner, right?

559
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,809
You guys should all wait for me in one place.

560
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,894
Don't move around.

561
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,896
- I'll work too. - What?

562
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,732
- Me, too. - Me, too.

563
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,400
Me, too.

564
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,237
Otherwise, it's not fair, is it?

565
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,076
Ah! I'll try this out!

566
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,081
Wanna come with me?

567
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,251
No, I've made up my mind.

568
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,418
I see.

569
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,420
Wanna join me?

570
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,424
What shall I do?

571
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:37,595
There!

572
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,598
HELP WANTED!

573
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,783
I want you to start today.

574
00:42:59,118 --> 00:42:59,617
Yes, sir!

575
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,454
Here you go.

576
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,791
Have you taken care of babies?

577
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,295
Yes. I took care of Pyon-Kichi.

578
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,630
JOIN THE TEAM! YOU WLL BE THE STAR!

579
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,300
All right.

580
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,971
I can't do it...

581
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,558
Take that to the Andromeda Line.

582
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,475
Yes, sir!

583
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,980
Keep it up!

584
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:29,647
Yes!

585
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,487
Um... excuse me.

586
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,655
Yes!

587
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,993
Welcome to the Ink Shop where you can get
anything from baby bottles to rockets.

588
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,162
I'm... interested in a part-time job...

589
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,496
You!

590
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,833
You're an earthling?

591
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,667
Yes!

592
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,254
<i>Moon Crestar is in the lead in this race!</i>

593
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,674
<i>What speed! But Hammer King,
a strong rival, is right behind him, too!</i>

594
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,677
<i>It's a dead heat! Who will charm
the goddess of victory?</i>

595
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,849
I was told the flight to Earth was cancelled.
I'm lucky to meet you on the Moon!

596
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,352
Autograph, please!

597
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,854
As a token of our meeting!

598
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,274
Are you sure? My autograph?

599
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,692
Yes, please!

600
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,195
All right then...

601
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,369
So, there are books about
the wonders in space, too?

602
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,037
Sure. We have lots of them.

603
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,541
Thank you for using our services!

604
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,723
I wonder if I should join Kiyoshi...

605
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,558
Hey, Noriko!

606
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,228
Hello, there!

607
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,732
Do I look cool?

608
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,072
Ladies and Aliens, it's show...

609
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,073
Run! Run!

610
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,076
<i>The goal is near! 300 yards!</i>

611
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,078
<i>Hammer King, ready to finish!</i>

612
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,581
<i>Oh, no! They're neck and neck!
It's so close! Hammer made it!</i>

613
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,082
What?

614
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,252
<i>It's a major upset!</i>

615
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,263
Let's see...

616
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,276
There... there...

617
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,613
That's an animal caretaker for you!

618
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,951
What are you doing there?

619
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,619
I'm just watching.

620
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,787
What about your job?

621
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,456
I'm still thinking.

622
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,793
And... what about you?

623
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,133
I got fired.

624
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:02,800
What?

625
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,635
That's not all, is it?

626
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,307
I got into debt.

627
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,642
You idiot!

628
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,481
Maybe I should babysit, too.

629
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,315
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,484
I'm an animal caretaker, too, after all.

631
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,322
Don't!

632
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,661
Don't be scared.

633
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,999
What a bad girl she is!

634
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,673
I wonder if I am looked down.

635
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,846
So, Ink, which wonder do you like?

636
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,183
Let's see... this one!

637
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,351
Wow.

638
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,019
Pet Star?

639
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,854
Are you interested?

640
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:57,688
Sure!

641
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,024
Well, it really is full of wonders.

642
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,360
Hey, help me out!

643
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,694
Darn...

644
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,531
Well, you should go.

645
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,532
Yeah...

646
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,868
You should ask Dad about Pet Star.

647
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,703
He knows a lot more about it.

648
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,538
Thanks!

649
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,709
Pet Star is like a treasure box.

650
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,880
It's full of so much treasure that
you could buy a galaxy with it.

651
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,549
What kind of treasures?

652
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,384
That's the mystery.

653
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:31,222
Explorers and researchers have been
searching unsuccessfully for ages.

654
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,892
Some say it has vanished
to another dimension,

655
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,562
but I believe it's still in this universe.

656
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,570
Hold it up for a sec.

657
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:46,737
Sure!

658
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,742
Really... if I find Pet Star,
I can fix up this piece of junk.

659
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,416
Are you all right?

660
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,084
Yeah. I'm fine.

661
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,954
Zughaa-aaan!

662
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,129
Excuse me! Would you sell me those?

663
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,465
I'll give you this much. OK?

664
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,299
Huh?

665
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,384
Not enough? I'll pay more.

666
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,636
- Me, too! - Me, too.

667
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,143
Well, we can't make it to
Earth. What shall we do?

668
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,813
I must be hearing things. I heard, "Zughaan!"

669
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,482
So did I.

670
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,816
Ah, it's Zughaan!

671
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,485
Over there!

672
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,321
Where?

673
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,407
Here.

674
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,825
Thanks for your purchase!

675
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,161
- You're right. - Way to go!

676
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,002
Cool...

677
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,338
Isn't it? That's good enough.

678
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,339
OK.

679
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,846
I'm going to sell rockets
with this engine installed.

680
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,516
I'll get rich if it's a big hit.

681
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,852
Hold it up for me.

682
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,187
Sure.

683
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,193
Hang on. I'll let you ride
it once it's complete.

684
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,695
O... K...

685
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:58,369
I'm the first elementary student
from Earth who is building a rocket.

686
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,872
OK. You can let go.

687
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,211
I'm sorry.

688
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,714
My dad tends to push others too hard.

689
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,717
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

690
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,888
You'll feel better once you
finish this special Ink Juice.

691
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:18,889
Here.

692
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,566
Ink.

693
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,571
Is this shop a spacecraft?

694
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,906
Yes, it's my dad's.

695
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,084
We're traveling through space
with the map as a guide.

696
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,419
Wow.

697
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:49,920
What's this?

698
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,422
Big events like...

699
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,758
festivals and races.

700
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,594
Tens of billions of people
gather all at once.

701
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:02,767
My dream is to buy a spacecraft
and go to those events some day.

702
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:14,153
Close Encounters of the Third Kind isn't bad.

703
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,616
Good job today, everyone.

704
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,621
Anyway, let's count the money we've made.

705
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,128
113 pods. Pretty good earnings.

706
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,298
We worked really hard.

707
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,634
Well...

708
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,137
I made this much...

709
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,641
They're kind of small.

710
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,142
I'll do better tomorrow.

711
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:48,979
These coins!

712
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,148
Something wrong with them?

713
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,152
These are commemorative coins from a
space festival. They're 20,000 pods each.

714
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,321
These are 10,000 and 5,000.

715
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,990
It's 110,000 pods altogether.

716
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,159
<i>Amazing. I only sold wasabi...</i>

717
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,829
<i>- Wasabi? - You sold them?</i>

718
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,997
<i>- Yeah! - Wasabi is awesome...</i>

719
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,667
I kept enough for us. See?

720
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,002
Zughaan!

721
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,340
Natsuki, that's Zughaan!

722
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,508
What?

723
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,010
Zughaan?

724
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,347
Am... am... I going to a space jail?

725
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,183
You should be fine, because you
are a native there.

726
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,022
But, it's better to stop selling them.

727
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,192
We don't want anyone to take notice of you.

728
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,362
Now, this is a lot of money.

729
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,365
No wonder there are so
many poachers out there.

730
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,200
Pochi, does this mean?

731
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,703
Yes. You can take the Super Express.

732
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,705
- Good! - Awesome!

733
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,373
What a relief.

734
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,543
So, no more work, huh?

735
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,213
I guess...

736
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,678
<i>Your Highness! Good news!</i>

737
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,971
What is it?

738
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,015
<i>We found someone with Zughaan!</i>

739
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,516
Are you positive?

740
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,351
<i>We'll send you the data right now.</i>

741
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,855
<i>It's an earthling who had it.</i>

742
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,148
<i>See?</i>

743
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,525
<i>We will snatch it when we get the chance.</i>

744
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,825
We have to say goodbye so soon.

745
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,371
I feel bad, because your
rocket isn't finished yet.

746
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:35,211
Well, things happen in
space. Have a safe trip.

747
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,379
Thanks.

748
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,381
Hey, Ink.

749
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:50,726
Here.

750
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,357
For me?

751
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,402
We're traveling to all those spots. So...

752
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,405
Maybe we'll meet again, if it works out.

753
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,373
<i>Wonders of Space</i>

754
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,707
This book is for you.

755
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,713
It was fun visiting the Moon.

756
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,423
Yeah.

757
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,183
Wow! What is it?

758
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,355
It has to be this way.

759
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,148
Now it's like a real trip.

760
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,734
Isn't it? It's supposed to be a school trip.

761
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,404
Don't worry about it.

762
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:53,742
We have Sliced Meteor,
Space Water and other items.

763
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,993
Specialty items are...

764
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,746
- Over here, please! - We'll buy them all!

765
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,249
- Of course. - Hold on a sec!

766
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,417
How come?

767
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,544
We have money, don't we?

768
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,045
We paid off the debt!

769
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,425
We have nothing left?

770
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,429
Um... we have a little left.

771
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,097
Really?

772
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,936
<i>This train will reach super speed level soon.</i>

773
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,896
What's "super speed"?

774
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,273
Above light speed.

775
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,943
Faster than light speed?

776
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,120
It's another star system.

777
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,456
Meaning where?

778
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,632
M45... the Pleiades star cluster.

779
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,511
We've already traveled 400 light years.

780
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,307
<i>Planet Picha-Picha.
You've arrived at Picha-Picha.</i>

781
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:03,812
<i>The train bound for Milla is scheduled
to depart from #15 in half a year.</i>

782
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,481
So, you guys are earthlings.

783
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,315
Yes.

784
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,817
We'll do it at the next station.

785
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,152
Understood.

786
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,446
Is that so?

787
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,328
It says that this is the 5th
most delicious food in space!

788
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,663
Exclusive item at the next station!

789
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,998
Exclusive item?

790
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:23,832
Right.

791
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,834
Pretty please, Pochi.

792
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,129
This is it, OK?

793
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,185
Three per person is the quota.

794
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,187
Whoever gets back first wins!

795
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,688
Alright!

796
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:52,819
Go!

797
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,617
It feels heavy...

798
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,869
N... Natsuki...

799
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,540
Don't be lying around here.

800
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,548
Um... thanks.

801
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:13,840
Thank you.

802
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:17,052
Don't mention it. Showing a spirit
of cooperation, so to speak.

803
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,853
The Duke of Mahal is quite eccentric.

804
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,398
- He doesn't install gravity
control antennas. - My lunch...

805
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,066
Too bad.

806
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:36,196
Well, space is very wide. You'll find many
other kinds of delicious food.

807
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,076
The Space Show!

808
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,745
Right. I've been following them.

809
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,415
But, can't you watch it anywhere?

810
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:54,923
I want to get as close as possible to
them to find out how the show is created.

811
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,717
What about your work?

812
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,428
<i>That is my work.</i>

813
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,930
I can sell the show info to maniac fans.

814
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,767
The Duke of Mahal is a maniac fan, too.

815
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,274
The Space Show travels
at an incredible speed.

816
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,776
So, I anticipate its path and wait.

817
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,613
Where's the next location?

818
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,407
It's a corporate secret.

819
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,617
What?

820
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,410
Gotta make money, you know.

821
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,956
Our Pochi is a friend of Marie's.

822
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,458
Is that true?

823
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,795
We're from the same planet. That's all.

824
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,298
Are you sure?

825
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,968
That's too bad. Here's my card if
you wanna sell me some good info.

826
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,970
Call me at Goba's Shop.

827
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,324
I never dreamed you were like that!

828
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:03,825
You coward!

829
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:05,661
You're mistaken.

830
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,497
I'm disappointed.

831
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:09,998
Pochi...

832
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,958
You've got it wrong.

833
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:18,840
Let me explain...

834
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,184
Good! I love it.

835
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,853
But, let's make it more dynamic.

836
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,691
Good. Let's do it from the top again.

837
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,363
You're in a good mood.

838
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:47,035
You know why. This will
be the biggest show ever.

839
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,668
Can't we just live happily
ever after like this?

840
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,879
I have unfinished business with him.

841
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,012
<i>The train has stopped and will
remain so, due to a red light.</i>

842
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,389
What happened?

843
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,892
It's traffic...

844
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,395
That tunnel is always congested.

845
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,566
It's glowing.

846
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,570
How come there's a tunnel?

847
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,656
Yeah, why, Pochi?

848
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,907
Gotta go use the restroom!

849
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,409
Oh, come on!

850
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,745
This is a hazardous zone.

851
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,581
Beyond this point is called Dark Trange.

852
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,543
You can only get through
there by using that tunnel.

853
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,254
What's the Dark Trange?

854
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,424
It's a nebula that consists of anti-matter.

855
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,260
That flash is an annihilation explosion.

856
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,934
Wow! Amazing.

857
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,938
It doesn't look like we're
gonna move any time soon.

858
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,276
Will we get home in time?

859
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,945
There are too many unscheduled delays.

860
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,449
That's how it is in space. Don't sweat it.

861
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,117
But...

862
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,124
Don't tense up. Relax.

863
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,794
I'll see to it that everything works out.

864
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:30,931
Are you all right?

865
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,150
I wonder if we'll get home safely.

866
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,111
Our plan keeps changing.

867
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:53,787
I'm responsible for us ending up here.

868
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,497
Don't think that.

869
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,168
We're having a blast and no
one thinks it's your fault.

870
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,004
I can't help it.

871
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,863
<i>You have arrived at Space Control Center.</i>

872
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,950
<i>For transfer information, please refer to...</i>

873
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,703
Can we find out about the
origin of the universe here?

874
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,873
Sure. I'd imagine that someone recorded it.

875
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,708
I wish I could get off here.

876
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,377
You don't want the train to
leave without you though.

877
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,461
That's true.

878
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,631
I've waited a long time!
What a waste of time!

879
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,050
Pochi! A tadpole spoke!

880
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,886
Be quiet! I'm unavailable.

881
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,554
Pochi?

882
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,224
Pochi! It's you, isn't it?

883
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,392
Sorry. Wrong guy.

884
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,228
Don't play dumb! Give me back my money!

885
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,065
Did I scare you guys?

886
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,194
I'm Tony. I work here at
the Space Control Center.

887
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,530
And, this is my pet, Johnny.

888
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,574
Nice to meet you.

889
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:16,912
You're the first earthlings
who've come this far.

890
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,372
Did Pochi kidnap you?

891
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,374
That's absurd!

892
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,545
No. No.

893
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,258
He's always getting others in trouble.

894
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,217
Right.

895
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,721
I sent your records to the Center.

896
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,099
We're keeping records of everyone
and everything in space.

897
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:41,561
Could you tell me about the
origin of the universe?

898
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:46,399
You should inquire with the Center.
I'm only in charge of records.

899
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,112
What are you investigating this time?

900
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,447
It's confidential.

901
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,116
What do you do that's confidential?

902
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,452
I'll make an exception and tell you.

903
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:03,416
There are rumors that a plant called
Zughaan is circulating on the black market.

904
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,963
It should've been extinct according to our
records. So, I need to investigate it.

905
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,301
Well... keep up the good work...

906
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,140
- We'll take a bus from here. - See ya!

907
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,101
Thank you very much.

908
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,811
Give me back my money!

909
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,356
Wow, awesome!

910
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:15,030
Royal Kenbritte University,
the center of education.

911
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,032
What are we doing here?

912
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,867
Filling out forms to go to Earth.

913
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,869
So, you're a university student.

914
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,037
Well...

915
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,039
Welcome back, Professor.

916
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,541
- Hey, Shiro. How's it going? - Professor?

917
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,718
He's a professor...

918
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:38,887
Right.

919
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,726
He did mention some "research".

920
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,533
So, Amane...

921
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,534
What is it?

922
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,578
Wanna go to town when we get home?

923
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,579
Why?

924
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,707
Well, the thing is...

925
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,089
Stop that thief!

926
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,426
We got it!

927
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,430
Over there!

928
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,765
Hold it!

929
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,112
It's Zughaan!

930
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,241
They're coming!

931
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,118
Give it to me!

932
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,285
Take this!

933
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:48,957
Let's go!

934
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,967
What's the matter, Professor?

935
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,430
Hey, out of the way!

936
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,432
There they are!

937
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:07,809
They're behind us!

938
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,477
- Faster! Faster! - Leave us alone!

939
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,565
Can you ram into them?

940
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,941
Of course!

941
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,125
Cool...

942
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,505
We saw him on Earth.

943
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,174
It's you guys again.

944
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,508
That's our line!

945
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,969
It's no use. Surrender!

946
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,848
Watch out! Oh, no! Why you...

947
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,025
That way! That way!

948
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,721
Professor. The suspects had this.
Does it look familiar to you?

949
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,515
It's in the ancient Sombrero alphabet.

950
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,227
It means "god".

951
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:35,897
Can I borrow this?

952
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:40,360
The flight leaves the day
after tomorrow in the morning.

953
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,237
So, rest at my house until then.

954
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,753
Please... come on in.

955
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,096
You live alone?

956
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,431
No, I live with my parents.

957
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:13,935
It's Neppo!

958
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,436
And, Marie, too.

959
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,107
So, you guys are friends, after all.

960
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,069
Yeah, we worked at the same lab.

961
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,616
Ah, welcome home.

962
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:29,617
Good to be home.

963
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,619
Hey, good to see you.

964
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,288
Friends of yours?

965
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,622
Thank you for having us.

966
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:35,957
How do you do?

967
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:41,421
Thank you. You saved our son's life.

968
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,631
We only did what was right.

969
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:48,136
I heard that Earth was a remote frontier.
But, you sound quite sophisticated.

970
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,474
Let's just forget about
formality and have some tea.

971
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,476
Thank you!

972
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,812
My mother's cake is out of this world!

973
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,650
Delicious!

974
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:04,986
I'm glad you like it.

975
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,322
How do you make it?

976
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,657
I'll show you later then.

977
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,493
- Yes, please! - I'd like to know, too.

978
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,786
Me, too.

979
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:21,002
I have to see my patients.
So, if you'll excuse me...

980
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,839
You have a clinic?

981
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:26,674
Yes.

982
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,510
Can I have a tour?

983
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,806
There are many rare diseases in space.

984
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:38,728
My father treats his patients with the
knowledge he acquired from archaeology.

985
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:41,731
Ancient bio-therapeutics.

986
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,735
It utilizes the vitality of plants
to rejuvenate one's life force.

987
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:50,823
Her whole body used to be
petrified. She's doing much better.

988
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,577
You've been a good sport. Way to go, Clara.

989
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,663
Your voice will come back soon.

990
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,084
Good job. You're so brave.

991
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,502
Yup.

992
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,005
Now, I'll plant a seed right here.

993
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,174
Sit up.

994
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,679
I'll help!

995
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,682
Yes. That's very good.

996
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,019
That's not good.

997
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,109
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

998
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,288
If this is the real thing,
it's a great discovery.

999
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:46,462
I wonder if this is real Zughaan
or a plant that's similar.

1000
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,555
We'll have the result tomorrow.

1001
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:58,558
The rumors about Zughaan are spreading.

1002
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,727
I fought some poachers on Earth.

1003
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,730
The same gang attacked us in town.

1004
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:05,815
What's this?

1005
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,567
The suspects had it.

1006
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,070
Ancient Sombrero alphabet, huh?

1007
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,406
It was your research topic, wasn't it?

1008
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,912
So, the Earth is somewhere around there.

1009
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,749
We've come a long way.

1010
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:26,586
21 million light years, you know.

1011
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,843
That's hard to grasp.

1012
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,431
I wonder what everyone's doing back home.

1013
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:40,600
Are you homesick?

1014
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,436
No, I'm not!

1015
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,444
We'll be back on Earth
the day after tomorrow.

1016
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,644
I'm so sorry!

1017
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,420
We're soaking wet!

1018
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,840
It started pouring out of the blue!

1019
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,676
<i>This is today's forecast.</i>

1020
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,513
<i>It will be a nice day in the inland
empires with lots of sunshine.</i>

1021
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:05,101
<i>But a small, leftover low pressure
system may create gusts of wind.</i>

1022
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,853
<i>Please watch out for unexpected windstorms.</i>

1023
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,030
I'm so fed up with you, Natsuki!

1024
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,743
Amane!

1025
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:27,873
Are you guys fighting?

1026
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,378
Not exactly.

1027
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,882
I think I'll buy another rabbit anyway.

1028
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,221
Otherwise Amane will never forgive me.

1029
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,724
What do you mean?

1030
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,321
Natsuki...

1031
01:16:59,197 --> 01:16:59,905
What?

1032
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,075
Let's pretend for a moment
that Amane went missing.

1033
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,748
And, what if someone said,
"I'll go find you another kid."

1034
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:09,749
How would you feel?

1035
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,500
What in the world?

1036
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,503
What do you think Amane is?

1037
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,006
There can't be a replacement for her!

1038
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,424
What about Pyon-Kichi then?

1039
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,428
But...

1040
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,932
I just don't know what to do...

1041
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,934
You need to apologize.

1042
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,104
I did, many times!

1043
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:37,443
But you weren't aware of
why you were in the wrong.

1044
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:48,704
A hero is great because he has courage.

1045
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:53,959
To acknowledge a wrongdoing
like that takes courage.

1046
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,045
It's far from being embarrassing.

1047
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,634
Why don't you make up with her?

1048
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,804
We're not fighting.

1049
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,558
But the thing about Pyon-Kichi
is bothering you, isn't it?

1050
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,979
What do you want Natsuki to do?

1051
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,489
I want her to be like she used to be.

1052
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,158
She didn't used to be like that?

1053
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,660
Totally different.

1054
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,746
When she used to come over,
she was more normal...

1055
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,833
sloppy and she didn't try to act big.

1056
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:39,422
But when she started living with
us, she became really bossy.

1057
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:43,342
She acted like playing with me was
a favor instead of just having fun.

1058
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:47,847
About Pyon-Kichi...

1059
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,100
I miss him and all,

1060
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:54,270
but she doesn't have to
buy me another rabbit,

1061
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,692
because Pyon-Kichi is Pyon-Kichi,
and he belongs to no one!

1062
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,697
Tell her that straight from your heart.

1063
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,032
What? But...

1064
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,454
Don't worry. I think that's the
quickest way to make up with Natsuki.

1065
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,373
Don't you think so?

1066
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:16,208
Yes.

1067
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,379
Apologize. Apologize sincerely...

1068
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,382
Yell. Get mad and tell
her exactly how I feel...

1069
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,220
Apologize sincerely...

1070
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,725
Apologize. Apologize sincerely...

1071
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,566
- Amane. - Natsuki.

1072
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,403
- Listen... - Listen...

1073
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:53,662
What?

1074
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,418
It's about Pyon-Kichi.

1075
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,090
Yes. Me, too.

1076
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,762
Amane.

1077
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,348
I'm...

1078
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:27,446
What's going on?

1079
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,365
<i>Iron Mask has been attacked!</i>

1080
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:33,285
<i>He has overcome countless
crises. But now he'd badly hurt.</i>

1081
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,787
Natsuki!

1082
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:40,960
<i>... his shield is destroyed.
The only weapon he has left is his courage!</i>

1083
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:42,962
<i>He affirms his determination.</i>

1084
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:46,966
<i>He says, "I will protect my
loved one at all costs!"</i>

1085
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:52,471
<i>But, truth be told, the evil squad
was after Princess Crystal.</i>

1086
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:32,177
How come crime lab staff aren't here?

1087
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:37,516
There was a major kidnapping
case on Choo-Choo Planet.

1088
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,271
On top of that, those three
guys are nowhere to be found.

1089
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:43,522
Why?

1090
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,190
We don't know.

1091
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,359
They were already gone when we realized it.

1092
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:57,536
Kiyoshi.

1093
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,207
The flight to Earth leaves tomorrow morning.

1094
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,380
I'll take you to the airport.

1095
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,051
All right.

1096
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:20,809
Excuse me.

1097
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,565
Find out anything new?

1098
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:27,733
No.

1099
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,402
Is that so...

1100
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,405
Where are the kids?

1101
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,741
They're still outside.

1102
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,248
I'll make something warm.

1103
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,667
That would be nice.

1104
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:13,612
Tomorrow...

1105
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,950
We'll leave in the morning.

1106
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:19,618
What?

1107
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:25,290
We'll go back to the village.

1108
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,717
They were after Zughaan.

1109
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,803
Amane got caught up in this by accident.

1110
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,475
The trio vanished...

1111
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:49,398
They followed me from Earth.
They can't be after money.

1112
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:54,987
Whoever is behind this knows
the true value of Zughaan.

1113
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,410
Is this your doing, after all?

1114
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:02,828
Neppo...

1115
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,668
At last, it's mine.

1116
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,503
It's Zughaan!

1117
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,532
What are we going to tell Amane's parents?

1118
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,454
We'll tell them the truth. We have no choice.

1119
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,876
It's all my fault!

1120
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:56,215
I got carried away and brought
you guys all the way here.

1121
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,552
We never should've left the village.

1122
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:21,490
Let's go home.

1123
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:26,245
Are you sure? Are we doing the right thing?

1124
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,837
There's nothing we can do.

1125
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,174
We don't know what will happen.

1126
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,931
If I were Amane,

1127
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:51,103
I think I'd wait for you
guys to come to my rescue.

1128
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:59,027
I'd be happier if it were you guys,
not others, who came to rescue me.

1129
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,614
You don't need to tell me that.

1130
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:06,368
But...

1131
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,287
What should we do?

1132
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,623
We're just elementary school students.

1133
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:16,461
What can we do against those aliens and UFOs?

1134
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:21,967
I don't know what we can do,
but there must be something!

1135
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:23,635
Don't be a know-it-all!

1136
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:28,807
Stop it!

1137
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,561
Please stop...

1138
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,329
I...

1139
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:58,503
I've been a big fan of
heroes since I was little.

1140
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:03,175
I've thought about this type
of situation over and over.

1141
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:06,178
A princess gets kidnapped and...

1142
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:10,015
the hero risks his life to
rescue her from the enemy.

1143
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,685
I always thought that was so cool.

1144
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:21,193
But, now we're in a real
crisis, and I'm so scared.

1145
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:27,366
Like Kiyoshi said, we don't know
what we're up against.

1146
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,953
I don't know what I can do.

1147
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:40,212
But, Amane must be a lot more scared!

1148
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:47,552
She must be even more
scared, lonely and helpless!

1149
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:50,138
So...

1150
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,808
We must go rescue her.

1151
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,562
Amane is in a scarier situation than I am.

1152
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,233
I must go...

1153
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,319
to rescue her!

1154
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:07,990
I'm not a hero, but...

1155
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,827
I know it's wrong to go home without her!

1156
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,417
Let's go, Kiyoshi.

1157
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:26,341
I'll come with you, Kiyoshi!

1158
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:35,100
Where do we go?

1159
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,769
I don't know.

1160
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:39,604
Let's find her anyway.

1161
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:42,441
How do we get her back?

1162
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:46,611
I don't know.

1163
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,948
Let's do our best for now.

1164
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,204
Listen. If we get in trouble,
we'll all get in trouble together.

1165
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:57,289
Yeah.

1166
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,125
That includes Amane, of course.

1167
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,294
Yeah!

1168
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,547
"One for all!"

1169
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,300
"All for one!"

1170
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,304
Professor, stop!

1171
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,473
Sorry. I'll return it later.

1172
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:17,142
You'll be reprimanded.

1173
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,144
I will readily accept that.

1174
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:28,820
Thank you, Pochi.

1175
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,662
The Space Show is the suspect for sure?

1176
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,498
Yes.

1177
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,167
Why don't you contact the police, then?

1178
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,002
I have no proof.

1179
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:47,839
Besides, if this becomes public,
Neppo will probably flee.

1180
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,177
I want to keep it private
until we rescue Amane.

1181
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:54,679
Can we?

1182
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:56,681
We will!

1183
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:57,849
Yeah!

1184
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,187
It's a reply from Goba.

1185
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,191
Where is the Space Show's location?

1186
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:11,279
The Great Wall... at the Space Festival!

1187
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,133
It's so crowded.

1188
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:33,718
It's a major event.

1189
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,564
Mr. Goba!

1190
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,316
Hey, you guys made it!

1191
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,154
Farewell performance?

1192
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:55,240
Yeah. The Space Show made an announcement.

1193
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,410
It's the hottest talk of the town now.

1194
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,912
Use these communication cameras.

1195
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:09,754
The Space Show has already arrived
and must be preparing somewhere.

1196
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:12,591
Let's split up and search.

1197
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:15,343
Use these to talk to one another.

1198
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,596
Refrain from taking risks.

1199
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:18,847
Roger!

1200
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:30,317
Neppo, I love you!

1201
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,486
I wanna see the Space Show now!

1202
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,574
So, this is... Zughaan...

1203
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,161
You're lucky! That's the very last one!

1204
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,331
I'll sell it to you for
10,000 pods. What a deal!

1205
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:49,044
OK. No problem. I'll get a receipt
from the Space Control Center and...

1206
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:50,170
Don't be duped!

1207
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:53,840
That's just refuse from Zughaan!

1208
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:57,844
What do you want? I'm busy.

1209
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,346
Let's make some deals.

1210
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:02,557
I have accurate and secure data on Zughaan.

1211
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,367
Excuse me.

1212
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:23,537
Ink!

1213
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,040
Koji!

1214
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,544
Hello, anyone here?

1215
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:33,380
<i>Pochi, can you hear me?</i>

1216
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:36,550
Tony. Were you able to connect to the Center?

1217
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,761
<i>Yeah. What a surprise that
what's called wasabi and...</i>

1218
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:42,389
Zughaan are different
species in the same family.

1219
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:45,058
You deserve the Executive Director's
Award for this new discovery.

1220
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,726
<i>Go ahead and take the award.</i>

1221
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:49,938
By the way, get me the data I requested.

1222
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,943
Have you found anything?

1223
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:56,236
No.

1224
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:57,445
I'm sorry.

1225
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,239
This is bad.

1226
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,074
There's no clue.

1227
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,077
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

1228
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:04,911
Not at all.

1229
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:08,415
Oh, it's finished!

1230
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:11,918
Ask Dad to give you a ride when
he returns from his meeting.

1231
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:14,921
That would be great.

1232
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,593
The Super Nova is gonna start!

1233
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,299
Beautiful!

1234
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:07,307
I've just witnessed the birth of a star.

1235
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:18,985
Marie!

1236
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:26,826
There they come!

1237
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:51,893
Over there... how sneaky!

1238
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:55,522
<i>Everyone, let's get together!</i>

1239
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:56,690
<i>Where?</i>

1240
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:58,358
<i>At Goba's.</i>

1241
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:03,738
<i>Hold it! I'm too far away from your
locations. Koji is the closest.</i>

1242
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:09,369
<i>Ladies and Aliens!</i>

1243
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:13,373
<i>Tonight is a very memorable night.</i>

1244
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:18,378
This is, believe it or not,
the last episode of the Space Show!

1245
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,048
<i>But, there is no sadness.</i>

1246
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:23,425
<i>The Space Show will be reborn...</i>

1247
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:25,885
- Kiyoshi! - Noriko!

1248
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:29,222
<i>From this birthplace of the Super Nova...</i>

1249
01:35:30,349 --> 01:35:33,893
<i>we first present the Space
Iron Mask at its best!</i>

1250
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:46,239
<i>Princess Crystal is held
hostage at the Black Castle.</i>

1251
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:50,118
<i>Iron Mask slips in all by
himself to rescue her!</i>

1252
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,579
<i>But, getting in the way is...</i>

1253
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:53,788
Amane!

1254
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,040
That's not Marie.

1255
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,668
<i>It's an ancient peculiar animal, Behemoth!</i>

1256
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:08,970
Is that Behemoth?

1257
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:12,599
<i>Will Iron Mask successfully
defeat Behemoth and...</i>

1258
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:15,101
Did they use Zughaan?

1259
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:19,606
Who is the real Iron Mask?

1260
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,650
Now, it's time for a commercial.

1261
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:31,117
The time has come for me to become God.

1262
01:36:46,091 --> 01:36:47,967
We must rescue her quickly!

1263
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:50,678
<i>Isn't there any way to get there?</i>

1264
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:52,180
Tell me, Pochi?

1265
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:00,647
The rocket!

1266
01:37:11,116 --> 01:37:13,326
3... 2... 1...

1267
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:14,661
Go!

1268
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:31,678
<i>Princess Crystal is unable to sing.</i>

1269
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,848
<i>The only one who can save
her is the bravest man!</i>

1270
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:50,530
Amane!

1271
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:01,708
All right!

1272
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:03,251
We did it!

1273
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:04,210
Just in time!

1274
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:08,089
Hey, that was an unexpected special guest.

1275
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,720
How much...

1276
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:17,765
How much more are you going to get in my way?

1277
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,405
Ladies and Aliens!

1278
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:39,746
Kiyoshi! Natsuki did it!

1279
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:40,413
Yeah!

1280
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:45,251
Yahoo!

1281
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,420
Are you all right?

1282
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,089
Natsuki?

1283
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:52,091
Pochi?

1284
01:38:52,384 --> 01:38:54,260
We'll let you out right now!

1285
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,638
Natsuki! Pochi!

1286
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,098
We'll be right there!

1287
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:03,811
You're done for!

1288
01:39:07,232 --> 01:39:08,608
It's show time!

1289
01:39:17,576 --> 01:39:19,452
<i>Long time no see, Pochi.</i>

1290
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,454
<i>Ever since that time...</i>

1291
01:39:22,247 --> 01:39:23,456
Neppo...

1292
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:25,667
What are you up to?

1293
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:31,965
Shall I take you to the new world with us?

1294
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,299
New world?

1295
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,180
Pet Star.

1296
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:45,311
It was I who found it!

1297
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:16,050
Pet Star?

1298
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,595
The Space Show is Pet Star?

1299
01:40:19,638 --> 01:40:21,514
Wow... Amazing...

1300
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:23,850
It really existed...

1301
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,691
Welcome to Pet Star!

1302
01:40:32,317 --> 01:40:33,776
<i>The whole universe is a family.</i>

1303
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,862
<i>All the aliens are brothers and sisters.</i>

1304
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,532
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Pet Star.</i>

1305
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:43,411
<i>We are working hard day and night.</i>

1306
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:46,873
<i>We truly appreciate your cooperation!</i>

1307
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,543
Kiyoshi, look!

1308
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:53,379
Yeah. It's the same stuff
that kidnapped Amane!

1309
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,927
Are you guys all right?

1310
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:06,893
<i>The whole universe is a family.
All the aliens are brothers and sisters.</i>

1311
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:10,146
<i>Everyone, remember Pet
Star! We're here for you!</i>

1312
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:12,398
So, you plotted the kidnapping?

1313
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,777
It was the will of Pet Star.

1314
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:17,904
<i>... appreciate your cooperation!</i>

1315
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,415
So, you don't say it's phony.

1316
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,085
Because I saw the Behemoth.

1317
01:41:34,379 --> 01:41:35,797
Where do you think it was?

1318
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,258
Bitterly disappointed?

1319
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:47,475
It was in Dark Trange.

1320
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:11,791
It was asleep for 5 billion
years in the sea of anti-matter.

1321
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:16,462
We've finally arrived at the
truth in the midst of despair.

1322
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:18,005
Marie!

1323
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:23,302
Well, it's about time you left the stage.

1324
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:24,679
Give us back Amane!

1325
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,640
<i>Is this girl that important?</i>

1326
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:31,811
Don't touch her!

1327
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:35,982
Amane!

1328
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:37,900
It's flying!

1329
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:39,318
Natsuki! Pochi!

1330
01:42:39,444 --> 01:42:40,528
Amane!

1331
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:42,655
Pochi!

1332
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:44,031
Natsuki!

1333
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,498
You'll deal with me!

1334
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:14,854
Natsuki!

1335
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,022
Time to give up!

1336
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:18,524
Let go of Amane!

1337
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:19,692
Good-bye.

1338
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:29,368
Give up already.

1339
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:54,727
I'm not hurt.

1340
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,562
<i>Natsuki, are you all right?</i>

1341
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:57,897
Kiyoshi!

1342
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,565
<i>I got through to you!</i>

1343
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:01,901
<i>- Natsuki! - Are you OK?</i>

1344
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:04,904
<i>Yes, but what shall I do? Amane is still...</i>

1345
01:44:05,697 --> 01:44:07,240
Let's meet up and rescue her.

1346
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:08,741
<i>OK.</i>

1347
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:10,910
Mr. Goba, can you tell her location?

1348
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,412
<i>Natsuki, find a landmark.</i>

1349
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:14,413
<i>Roger.</i>

1350
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,251
What will you do to Amane?

1351
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,586
She will become Perfect Life Form Number 2.

1352
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:24,257
No such thing exists!

1353
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,759
It's possible...

1354
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:31,931
when the powers of Zughaan and the
Great King Pet are accessible.

1355
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:37,436
Great King Pet? Tony?

1356
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:39,772
Great King Pet?

1357
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,786
Great King Pet. He is the true
ruler of the planet.

1358
01:44:54,746 --> 01:44:55,788
Where is he?

1359
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,456
<i>The Central Tower.</i>

1360
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59,834
<i>It's the tallest building.</i>

1361
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:06,507
<i>Pet Star is a rescue craft that dates
back hundreds of millions of generations.</i>

1362
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:09,343
<i>It sheltered animals that
were near extinction.</i>

1363
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:11,721
<i>But, one day, it vanished without a trace.</i>

1364
01:45:11,763 --> 01:45:14,307
And it became a legend...

1365
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:16,976
But Neppo found it, right?

1366
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,979
And the show opened its curtain.

1367
01:45:59,227 --> 01:46:01,854
Surrender! You have no chance of winning.

1368
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,023
That's what you think.

1369
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:27,546
Now it's reversed.

1370
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,927
You guys, get rid of that pesky fly!

1371
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:34,053
Roger!

1372
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:37,765
Hey!

1373
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,226
- Natsuki! - Natsuki!

1374
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:42,436
Jump in when we're close enough!

1375
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,729
All right!

1376
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:47,566
Hurry! Hurry!

1377
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:48,401
Jump in!

1378
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:49,235
There!

1379
01:46:58,286 --> 01:46:59,078
Kiyoshi!

1380
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,913
Natsuki! Are you unharmed?

1381
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:02,248
Yeah. I'm fine.

1382
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:06,293
Sorry, we need to get away for now.

1383
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:10,423
Kiyoshi!

1384
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,257
All right.

1385
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:13,259
Let's go.

1386
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,429
To rescue Amane.

1387
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:26,105
We'll be fine. We are superheroes here.

1388
01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:29,483
<i>Natsuki, I'll lead the way.</i>

1389
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:30,443
Thank you!

1390
01:47:38,743 --> 01:47:39,785
This is bad, Ink.

1391
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:41,328
Let's get away for now!

1392
01:47:57,596 --> 01:48:00,639
These people... Were they all kidnapped?

1393
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:04,310
What is this place?

1394
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:06,395
It's a fun workplace!

1395
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,856
<i>More like forced labor!</i>

1396
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:11,567
<i>You're supposed to earn your own keep.</i>

1397
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:13,777
<i>Didn't you learn that in school?</i>

1398
01:48:14,362 --> 01:48:15,488
<i>Give me a break!</i>

1399
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:19,825
Is this the right direction?

1400
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:23,496
<i>Good job, Natsuki. Head for the jungle ahead.</i>

1401
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:36,342
Your Highness, Great King Pet.
I've brought you a weakling.

1402
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:54,193
<i>What? What is this?</i>

1403
01:48:57,322 --> 01:48:59,532
<i>She's so cute! Fantastic!</i>

1404
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:03,577
<i>But, there's only one?
I can't synthesize with just one!</i>

1405
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:05,204
This way, please.

1406
01:49:09,167 --> 01:49:10,209
Pyon-Kichi!

1407
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,266
This isn't good...

1408
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:27,601
Ink, can't we counterattack?

1409
01:49:28,186 --> 01:49:28,894
Just a sec!

1410
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:34,567
Is he all right?

1411
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:38,237
No problem. We are perfect life form!

1412
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:42,908
There is no future for
synthesized life forms!

1413
01:49:43,034 --> 01:49:46,287
The future of the universe
lies in saving weaklings!

1414
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:51,083
No!

1415
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:53,919
The real future lies in
being self-sustainable!

1416
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:56,630
To get in the way is evil!

1417
01:50:05,223 --> 01:50:08,601
It's evil to not use that power to save.

1418
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:12,104
Why did this planet fall?

1419
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:22,823
Ink, which one?

1420
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:24,908
<i>The blue one is the watercraft!</i>

1421
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:37,296
Fire!

1422
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:43,802
Feels good!

1423
01:50:47,265 --> 01:50:48,557
The water isn't working!

1424
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,977
This is all we have. Keep shooting anyway!

1425
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,668
Body temperature down.

1426
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:17,670
It'll go up with spit fire.

1427
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,676
Why isn't it coming out?

1428
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:25,344
It's working!

1429
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:29,348
Ink, fly alongside!

1430
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:30,683
Leave it to me!

1431
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:44,863
The heart will stop.

1432
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:18,897
Behemoth!

1433
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:42,588
Why?

1434
01:52:44,048 --> 01:52:45,966
<i>It's the difference between
Zughaan and wasabi.</i>

1435
01:52:48,219 --> 01:52:51,138
I feel bad for him, but this was meant to be.

1436
01:52:55,226 --> 01:52:58,103
The margin of error was
within an acceptable range.

1437
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:00,939
Just face reality!

1438
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:07,446
We have no right to play
god with anyone's life!

1439
01:53:09,657 --> 01:53:10,991
Here we go again.

1440
01:53:12,243 --> 01:53:15,120
You always contradict me.

1441
01:53:15,914 --> 01:53:17,122
I've had it!

1442
01:53:18,082 --> 01:53:19,792
Get out of my sight!

1443
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:24,129
No, I won't!

1444
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:28,967
If you are in the wrong, I'll follow you
wherever you go and stop you.

1445
01:53:30,845 --> 01:53:32,471
Come back, Neppo.

1446
01:53:33,431 --> 01:53:34,807
It's still not too late.

1447
01:53:40,438 --> 01:53:41,814
It's not yet too...

1448
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,981
Shut up!

1449
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:27,860
I want to go back to those
happy days with you and Marie.

1450
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:36,869
I always looked up to you,
and you were my friend.

1451
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:51,049
Pochi!

1452
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,898
<i>Kiyoshi. We're done over here.</i>

1453
01:55:07,525 --> 01:55:09,902
All right. Let's meet up.

1454
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:23,081
We'll be fine. They'll come rescue us soon.

1455
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:25,250
Who? Pochi?

1456
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,087
<i>It's done!</i>

1457
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,093
<i>See? It's cool and cute!</i>

1458
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:36,970
<i>Isn't it hip? Very hip!</i>

1459
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:42,768
<i>When you wake up next time,
you'll be in paradise!</i>

1460
01:55:45,146 --> 01:55:46,772
Help me!

1461
01:56:06,334 --> 01:56:08,794
Let me out!

1462
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,137
Natsuki...

1463
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:25,811
Amane!

1464
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:36,488
Take this!

1465
01:56:36,531 --> 01:56:37,322
<i>What?</i>

1466
01:56:39,283 --> 01:56:40,158
You!

1467
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:41,535
Take this!

1468
01:56:47,959 --> 01:56:49,001
Natsuki!

1469
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:50,544
Amane!

1470
01:56:58,636 --> 01:57:00,012
I'll let you out soon.

1471
01:57:00,638 --> 01:57:01,346
Yeah!

1472
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:15,193
<i>Who in the world are you?</i>

1473
01:57:15,653 --> 01:57:16,528
People call me...

1474
01:57:17,155 --> 01:57:19,865
Summer Sister!

1475
01:57:20,324 --> 01:57:21,408
I'm Natsuki Koyama!

1476
01:57:22,076 --> 01:57:26,079
<i>Who the heck is that? Don't get in my way!</i>

1477
01:57:33,671 --> 01:57:37,549
<i>That's my line! Don't ruin our summer break!</i>

1478
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:40,052
Give Amane back to us!

1479
01:57:42,513 --> 01:57:43,555
<i>No chance!</i>

1480
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:47,267
<i>She can't survive in space
unless I modify her.</i>

1481
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:50,520
<i>She's still too small and weak!</i>

1482
01:57:53,191 --> 01:57:57,736
That's not true! Amane is strong!

1483
01:57:57,862 --> 01:57:58,737
<i>Wh... What the?</i>

1484
01:57:59,363 --> 01:58:01,782
She's mature and decent.

1485
01:58:02,366 --> 01:58:04,409
But that's what bothered me a bit!

1486
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:07,621
I wanted her to rely on me like before.

1487
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:12,084
It made me sad that she acted
like she didn't need me anymore!

1488
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:17,422
I knew Amane was strong, but...

1489
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:22,260
I wanted her to stay weak and
depend on me a little longer...

1490
01:58:24,722 --> 01:58:28,100
so that I could still be her hero!

1491
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:35,440
But that's totally wrong!
I've finally realized that!

1492
01:58:35,566 --> 01:58:37,609
<i>What the heck you are talking about?</i>

1493
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:38,944
I understand!

1494
01:58:39,987 --> 01:58:41,947
I understand, Natsuki!

1495
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:45,617
Thank you!

1496
01:58:59,423 --> 01:59:00,465
Out of the way.

1497
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:02,801
I'll get you next time.

1498
01:59:04,095 --> 01:59:05,345
<i>Hurry up and do it!</i>

1499
01:59:07,932 --> 01:59:09,641
NO!

1500
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:17,190
Hey, stop it!

1501
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:24,197
I, too, am...

1502
01:59:25,116 --> 01:59:26,992
strong!

1503
01:59:28,452 --> 01:59:29,494
Noriko!

1504
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,830
Way to go, Noriko!

1505
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:50,909
I'm sorry!

1506
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:56,581
I'm sorry we didn't come sooner!
I'm sorry we put you through that all alone!

1507
02:01:00,544 --> 02:01:02,921
I'm sorry I let Pyon-Kichi run away!

1508
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:13,265
I'll forgive you because Natsuki is my hero.

1509
02:01:22,566 --> 02:01:24,276
I'll fix your hair for you.

1510
02:01:24,902 --> 02:01:26,945
Yes, please!

1511
02:01:37,081 --> 02:01:37,831
Pyon-Kichi!

1512
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:39,332
Pyon-Kichi?

1513
02:01:43,421 --> 02:01:44,796
It's Pyon-Kichi, isn't it?

1514
02:01:46,924 --> 02:01:49,134
Why are you here?

1515
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:54,139
Lucky you! Pyon-Kichi, let's go home!

1516
02:02:09,363 --> 02:02:15,702
Hey!

1517
02:02:26,797 --> 02:02:28,173
Amane!

1518
02:02:28,632 --> 02:02:29,674
Bravo!

1519
02:02:29,967 --> 02:02:31,051
Natsuki!

1520
02:02:31,218 --> 02:02:32,010
Kiyoshi!

1521
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:33,178
Koji!

1522
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:34,179
Noriko!

1523
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:36,681
Amazing...

1524
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:37,682
Yeah.

1525
02:02:38,893 --> 02:02:41,019
Hey!

1526
02:02:41,979 --> 02:02:43,855
This feels good.

1527
02:02:46,817 --> 02:02:49,402
A new star is born.

1528
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:51,696
I'll put it in the record.

1529
02:02:54,992 --> 02:02:57,702
Ah! The police are here.

1530
02:02:59,163 --> 02:03:01,039
What will happen to Neppo and his gang?

1531
02:03:01,999 --> 02:03:06,044
He committed a crime.
They will be punished accordingly.

1532
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:12,050
Now, let's go back to Earth.

1533
02:03:12,843 --> 02:03:14,219
Yeah, let's go home.

1534
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:16,054
Yeah.

1535
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,888
Let's go home.

1536
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:21,643
We won't make it back in time,
but we'll all get in trouble together.

1537
02:03:21,685 --> 02:03:22,602
Yeah!

1538
02:03:23,604 --> 02:03:24,562
We'll make it.

1539
02:03:24,605 --> 02:03:25,397
What?

1540
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:27,732
But we only have half an hour...

1541
02:03:28,692 --> 02:03:29,901
We'll be fine.

1542
02:03:30,694 --> 02:03:32,404
Everyone will cooperate.

1543
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,073
What? Are we gonna give up?

1544
02:03:35,866 --> 02:03:37,075
No!

1545
02:03:37,868 --> 02:03:39,244
<i>Please clear the orbit.</i>

1546
02:03:39,703 --> 02:03:43,081
<i>The group from Murakawa Village Grade
School will be passing through.</i>

1547
02:03:43,874 --> 02:03:46,251
<i>We are stopping for our new star.</i>

1548
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:51,756
That's right! Open up the super speed space!

1549
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:09,107
That's a big help, Duke of Mahal.

1550
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:12,777
Mr. Goba! Tony!

1551
02:04:12,903 --> 02:04:14,821
Thank you!

1552
02:04:14,905 --> 02:04:16,448
Thank you for everything.

1553
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:21,119
No problem. I had fun, too!

1554
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:24,456
Take care!

1555
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:27,167
You, too!

1556
02:04:27,251 --> 02:04:28,626
Have a safe trip!

1557
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:31,463
Thank you so much!

1558
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:37,969
Let's see... what do we do now?

1559
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:41,806
You would be welcomed at the Center.
We're always short on staff.

1560
02:04:41,932 --> 02:04:42,640
I can't!

1561
02:04:43,767 --> 02:04:45,310
Thank you, Ink.

1562
02:04:45,936 --> 02:04:49,314
<i>Thank you. We got great exposure.</i>

1563
02:05:04,371 --> 02:05:05,330
See you again.

1564
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:07,832
Yeah.

1565
02:05:09,627 --> 02:05:10,502
See you again.

1566
02:05:18,802 --> 02:05:22,514
See you again! Take care!

1567
02:05:28,312 --> 02:05:29,354
Amane.

1568
02:05:31,482 --> 02:05:36,361
Someday, when I am a big
enough man to accept myself,

1569
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:41,241
will you allow me to come see you again?

1570
02:05:44,662 --> 02:05:46,579
Can you come to Earth?

1571
02:05:47,164 --> 02:05:48,540
I'll come secretly.

1572
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:51,709
I'll be waiting!

1573
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:01,719
Amane!

1574
02:06:04,181 --> 02:06:06,891
Hey, you! What are you doing to Amane?

1575
02:06:07,184 --> 02:06:08,226
<i>I'm not doing anything!</i>

1576
02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:10,436
Then, how come you're blushing?

1577
02:06:12,523 --> 02:06:13,898
You're the one blushing.

1578
02:06:15,442 --> 02:06:17,068
I'm innocent!

1579
02:06:24,034 --> 02:06:25,785
Thank you, Pochi.

1580
02:06:27,955 --> 02:06:34,252
Pochi...

1581
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:43,595
Stop! Please stop. It makes me...

1582
02:06:45,222 --> 02:06:47,432
Pochi!

1583
02:06:51,228 --> 02:06:53,938
Natsuki! Don't check out my butt!

1584
02:07:14,084 --> 02:07:16,628
We totally left them
alone. I hope they're OK.

1585
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,963
They should be fine. Kiyoshi is with them

1586
02:07:19,089 --> 02:07:22,133
Noriko gets mad if we stick
our nose in too much.

1587
02:07:22,176 --> 02:07:25,136
Oh, dear. Is that how she is?

1588
02:07:26,263 --> 02:07:29,641
Noriko is a perv! Perv!

1589
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:46,199
What are you doing over there?

1590
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:48,660
Nothing.

1591
02:07:53,123 --> 02:07:54,540
Did something happen?

1592
02:07:57,795 --> 02:07:59,045
No. Nothing.

1593
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:04,008
But... it was fun, wasn't it?

1594
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:05,510
Yeah!

1595
02:08:17,731 --> 02:08:19,232
Sis, look!

1596
02:08:20,567 --> 02:08:23,069
Ah. It's just a UFO.

1597
02:08:32,413 --> 02:08:36,749
Dad, do you have any books about astronauts?

1598
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:39,836
I believe we have one in the shed.

1599
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:42,255
Can I see it when we get home?

1600
02:08:42,923 --> 02:08:43,840
Mom.

1601
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:47,593
I wanna become a doctor.

1602
02:08:51,974 --> 02:08:53,599
I knew that.

1603
02:09:51,492 --> 02:09:53,409
What a beautiful day!

1604
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:03,169
We're going to the school.

1605
02:10:03,378 --> 02:10:05,004
What's going on?

1606
02:10:05,339 --> 02:10:07,340
We're gonna play together.

1607
02:10:07,674 --> 02:10:09,842
They are all so close.

1608
02:10:10,344 --> 02:10:12,094
Here we go!

1609
02:10:12,179 --> 02:10:13,346
Go!

1610
02:10:17,518 --> 02:10:18,768
I'll go fast!

1611
02:10:19,353 --> 02:10:21,854
GO!

o
