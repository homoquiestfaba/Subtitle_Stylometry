4
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,315
We are back.

5
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:44,155
Forward.

6
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,540
Damn.

7
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,931
Give me the Black Beauty.

8
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:55,104
Alvin, do it quietly.
You are not alone there.

9
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,328
You got it, Dave.

10
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:02,124
Dave.
- This is a charity performance.

11
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,602
It's not just about you.
- Sorry, I hear you ...

12
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,787
by the thousands of people
calling my name.

13
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,084
I'm back, guys.

14
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,378
Alvin, please come down.

15
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,811
I hear you.

16
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,135
I'm not kidding.
- What?

17
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:51,162
Dave, look out.

18
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:02,979
Oh no, Dave.

19
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:08,059
This will remedy the pain.

20
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,444
I want my boys to speak.

21
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,786
I just gave you a sedative
that works within minutes.

22
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,313
Let them quickly inside.

23
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:23,668
Dave.
- You are alive.

24
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,074
It was an accident. I swear.
- Are you OK?

25
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:29,009
I'm sorry, Dave.
- It is in order.

26
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,221
I should just stay here a while.

27
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:35,880
And until I'm back, my aunt
Jackie stays with you.

28
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,057
Who is Aunt Jackie?

29
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:40,717
Whoever our jammie much popcorn
at Christmas gave.

30
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:43,839
Popcorn Jackie.
- Not much time left.

31
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,549
Go home and enjoy a
normal childhood.

32
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:53,785
I made that you can
go to school.

33
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,623
School?
- Yes.

34
00:03:56,624 --> 00:04:00,003
Simon, you get the lead.

35
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:04,893
Really?
- I'm counting on you.

36
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:08,076
Hold on. Why does he charge?

37
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:11,714
He is counting on me.
- Dave, please do not die.

38
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,669
He just sleeps.
He was a sedative.

39
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,193
A sleeping.

40
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:19,091
Excuse me, I'm the type
squirrels carry home.

41
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,626
We do not have Dave back.
As I set my jaw to drop.

42
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,929
Come here.

43
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:30,577
I will solve it. No, it's worse.

44
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,762
Beware, please.
- Of this button.

45
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:36,653
The more stressful it gets, the
longer before he recovers.

46
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,546
Too slow, nurse.

47
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,975
I go nowhere without Dave ...

48
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:55,339
Hopefully he remains quiet
throughout the flight.

49
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,048
Maybe he should get half.
For security.

50
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,799
Any idea how to find Aunt Jacky?

51
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:13,961
Follow me.

52
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:16,824
Excuse me. Sorry.

53
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,128
Excuse me, I'll get along.

54
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,021
Look, Aunt Jacky!
- Popcorn Jacky.

55
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,468
Come here.
- We have found you.

56
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,532
Popcorn!
- What is Theodore?

57
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:31,897
There is plenty for everyone.
Give me a hug first.

58
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,436
Come here, old teddy bear.

59
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:37,017
I'm not really a knuffelaar.

60
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,972
I would propose you
my grandson Toby.

61
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,735
Hi, I'm Theodore.

62
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:46,238
What?
- The boys.

63
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,580
H, how are you?
I'm Toby, pleasant.

64
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:52,919
Toby staying with me until he knows
what he wants with his life.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,232
So far, every day he "Beep
Beep" with his thumbs.

66
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:01,585
By that squeak with my thumbs
now I keep my first place.

67
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,543
Toby, take the backpacks.
- Which backpacks?

68
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:08,145
The baggage.
- Yeah, let me take it.

69
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,867
Toby.
- Press the brake!

70
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,317
I'm fine.

71
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,541
I am so sorry.
Come right with her?

72
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,410
That is so right again.

73
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,540
I would not be so sure.

74
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:39,148
It was an accident, I swear.

75
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,927
I have all experienced.
For as often.

76
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,240
Does he care for us?

77
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,822
In order to do us a favor?

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,791
No problem. I can.

79
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,581
I've made for my cat
before he left.

80
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:57,306
He walked away.
He wanted some space down.

81
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,638
I see him sometimes.

82
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,156
He blows and klauwt to me.
So he shows me he can.

83
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,640
No worries.
I will not be as Dave,
Dave is gone.

84
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,778
Gone?

85
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,168
Away.
He is not dead. Very even alive.

86
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,318
He comes back.
I just love his warm bed.

87
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,164
I do my thing, you
do your thing.

88
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:26,214
We need it, that's
the whole idea.

89
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:29,852
Yes, absolutely.

90
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:35,134
I'm not going to pretend I know everything
and you do this and that.

91
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,508
Or that.

92
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,393
Let's do this.

93
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:44,029
Jeez.

94
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,329
Theodore, it is fine.

95
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:58,546
It is important that
we all still live.

96
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:02,023
Maybe Dave is better faster with our "Become better"
- Card.

97
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,844
It does need a little
more glitter.

98
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:12,206
So it must be good.
Who is hungry?

99
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,195
I.
- Let's eat.

100
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,091
Nothing. Anything?

101
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,773
Like a Ghost Town here. Alvin?

102
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:24,089
Hi, the Cheese Balls
have arrived.

103
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,647
Bingo. The food is served.

104
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,063
What are you doing here?

105
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,572
A Cheese Ball?

106
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,243
Tumble, one moment.

107
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:09,156
I have to concentrate, because I'm
a fight away from the title.

108
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,637
Can we play?

109
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:18,016
I will not hurt your feelings, but I want
to see anyone hurt by all this violence.

110
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,617
We can play Monopoly.

111
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,899
That we did with Dave
continuously.

112
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,410
Sounds great.
That we should ever play.

113
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:27,245
But now I return to
my boxing game.

114
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,881
Who needs Toby, you got us.

115
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:37,838
Yeah, who? Guys, this way.

116
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,021
I surrender.

117
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:02,732
You know what Dave would
say if he would be here?

118
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,402
It is more from the belly.

119
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:14,453
That's him.

120
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,859
Hello?
- Guys, I am.

121
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,267
Dave?

122
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,777
The house is apparently
not burned.

123
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,918
Some confidence, Dave.
- Yes.

124
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,115
Ready!

125
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,394
What was that?
- Do not upset him.

126
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:38,798
That was Aunt Jackie.
She makes a five-course
meal for us.

127
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,907
Really? Can I talk to her?

128
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,641
She exercises her pole dancing.

129
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:48,158
Pole Dancing?
She did it eat? What's Going On?

130
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,679
I must go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.

131
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,375
Until later.
- Alvin.

132
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:56,645
Nobody does it better than he.

133
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,521
Toby, wake up.

134
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:36,398
Sorry.
- No, that's okay. What?

135
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,174
I had a nightmare.
- I hate nightmares.

136
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,179
What was it?

137
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,254
I dreamed that we had no family.

138
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,411
That can not happen.
You are so like each other.

139
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,934
Nothing can separate you.

140
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:58,680
Unless there is an eagle in
the air and comes down ...

141
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,817
What can never happen.
Why do you believe?

142
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,515
Eagles are in Philadelphia.

143
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,423
Sleep tight.

144
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:22,345
Toby, let it stop.
- What do you do?

145
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:25,288
There is something wrong with the clock.
He will not stop.

146
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,594
I can not sleep.

147
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:32,024
That's just the idea.
It is an alarm.

148
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,510
That is to get up early.

149
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,676
Why would anyone
get up so early?

150
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,518
To get to school, you should
be at eight hours.

151
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,626
morning?
- I like not to.

152
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:48,606
But we are there together for.
You go to school me and
I go back to sleep.

153
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:52,853
You mean your not still with us?
- No.

154
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,872
I've already served
my time, thanks.

155
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:59,771
But school is fun, right?
- Fun? Maybe nice.

156
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,157
It's my cat! That I sold.

157
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,044
I am, remember?

158
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,280
I thought so.

159
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,361
And we are there.

160
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,826
Have fun on your first day.
I see you around three hours.

161
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:50,346
We can. Just a park walk.

162
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,863
Or just frightening.

163
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:58,004
Hi, I'm Theodore.

164
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:01,714
Hi, I'm Theodore.

165
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,730
Eagle.
- Hup, eagle.

166
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,815
That was not very nice.

167
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:26,690
You must be our new students.

168
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,865
And we are the kind squirrels.

169
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,661
Yeah, that explains the
fur and fluff cakes.

170
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:35,225
Follow me, gentlemen.
- Men?

171
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:37,691
Oh, we. Exactly.

172
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,142
There was about a minute and
we were two behind ...

173
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:43,594
and I wanted to take the field,
though my leg was broken.

174
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,067
I can win.
- I never get tired
of that story.

175
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,346
So I hoppel on the field,
while I can barely stand.

176
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,634
Had I already mentioned
my broken leg?

177
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,844
Mrs. Ortega?
- Yeah?

178
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,264
Success.
- Thanks.

179
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:59,845
Hi guys, welcome to the staff room.
- Good to be here, I hope.

180
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,620
So this is a classroom?

181
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,259
I love the smell of 'cream
is' in the morning.

182
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,949
Hello ladies.

183
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,257
Hi, I'm Theodore.

184
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:20,262
Yes, he is Theodore.
If you do not know.

185
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,949
And I'm Simone.

186
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,080
The name Seville, Alvin Seville.

187
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,265
Enchant, ma'am.

188
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,571
Someone should make those
guys a head shorter.

189
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:37,705
That can not be difficult.
They are only 10 centimeters.

190
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:07,915
I have 15 cards.
Five more cards than necessary.

191
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:13,495
I had seven dates.
The best seats at the Lakers.

192
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,518
Even my friends had
the best seats.

193
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,419
Look at me now.

194
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,115
Look at me now.
I have lost everything.

195
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,593
Outside my dignity, that
they can not deprive me.

196
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:30,908
And all thanks to them.

197
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,599
A muffin.

198
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,690
Turn it to, hoping and begging
that I think other animals ...

199
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,021
to dance or sing.

200
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:45,301
Wait, you sing, are you?

201
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,332
That's my muffin.
Give it back! Dirty rat.

202
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,019
I get you to graze,
nature squirrels.

203
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,354
Girls, we have here.

204
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,112
I see nothing.

205
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,520
On my nose.
- Sorry.

206
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,355
Move your ass.
- Ok. Push me.

207
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,560
We made it.

208
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:29,627
My god, it's him. Ian Hawke.

209
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,874
Mr. Hawke?

210
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:35,640
I do not get that voice
out of my head.

211
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:38,671
Hello, Mr. Hawke?

212
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:41,824
That is not in my
head, but really.

213
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:45,101
What do you want?
- Our proposals.

214
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:49,349
That's right.
I'm Brittany.
And this is my sister Eleanor.

215
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,196
Hello, sir. Very pleasant.

216
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,338
And I'm Jeanette.
But I feel a Olivia.

217
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,355
If ...
- We are the chipmunk girls.

218
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:03,128
And we want you to represent us.

219
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,037
You made Alvin and the
chipmunk stars.

220
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:06,760
We do too.
- Yes.

221
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:09,524
And the nature squirrels around.

222
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:13,874
Before we are all excited
about this, tell me ...

223
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,912
You can sing, right?

224
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,869
Wait ...

225
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,393
let's continue this meeting
in my dakwoning.

226
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:30,928
This is so exciting.

227
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,563
Jeez, do you believe this?

228
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:38,671
A real office in a dakwoning.

229
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,503
The Hollywood sign.

230
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,360
Do you view it?

231
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,477
Ladies, tell me about
yourselves.

232
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,137
Raised in a small town,
population 300 and ...

233
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:55,827
Really? That is fascinating.

234
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,120
Well, get me impressed bowl.

235
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,103
And, two, three.

236
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,209
Girls, girls.

237
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,558
Guess who just the number n of
the fan chipmunk girls become?

238
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,057
Ian Hawke.

239
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,481
Joepie.
When can we meet the chipmunk?

240
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:52,942
An excellent question and the
answer is excellent ...

241
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:56,786
I represent Alvin and the
chipmunk not really.

242
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:59,966
What happened?
- Classic story.

243
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,666
Sweet and innocent at first,
they had nothing ...

244
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,547
and I make them rock stars ...

245
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:11,207
they change.
They were like bad cheese.

246
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,574
No.
- That is terrible.

247
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:17,643
I know. Alvin was a son to me.

248
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,641
And then he just spits at me.

249
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:25,194
Literally.
He filled his cheeks with mucus
and spit a few skulls.

250
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,279
Not to mention Simon.
- But not Theodore, right?

251
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,187
These cuddly creatures,
one must watch out for.

252
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:36,994
But why talk about them?
They are over, old-fashioned.

253
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,398
Squirrels are nature boring.

254
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,088
But ...

255
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,189
female chipmunk ...
but you keep on!

256
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:54,151
So I look at him, and
ask: where is Beyonc?

257
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,748
And he says, "she keeps a bowl
of cheese balls down ...

258
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:58,722
turn around. And what do you ...

259
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:02,628
she lives.
- Yeah, I was the
boss said Dave.

260
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,141
I stayed up to ten
hours on any day.

261
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,738
Look what I can.

262
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:12,283
You're really cute.
- Thank you.

263
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:19,366
I am so sorry.
- Not really.

264
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:23,125
Not yet.
Girls, please call a priv.

265
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,171
Thank you.

266
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:32,520
Listen Rock stars.

267
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,387
If you talk to them
again, go get it.

268
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:38,265
If you're looking at
them, go get it.

269
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:41,876
If you even just thinking
of them ...

270
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:45,318
Think of them?
- Now, yes.

271
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:48,370
Enough.
- Move!

272
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,796
Take them, come back,
you dirty rat!

273
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:57,910
Split!

274
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,005
That way.

275
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:06,164
H Dumbo, catch me if you can.

276
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,852
Gotcha!
- Surely not.

277
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,609
The underpants time!

278
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,021
Jeez.

279
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,960
Eagle.

280
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,400
Eagle.
- Get him.

281
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,014
Fast.
- This way.

282
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,928
Gotcha.
- Wait, guys.

283
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,170
The flushing time.
- This is not cool, guys.

284
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,719
Please.

285
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,328
If you look good.
- Thank you.

286
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:53,333
I can not swim. Help.
- Hang on, Simon.

287
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,299
Okay?

288
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,900
If you think you've just saved
me from a toilet ...

289
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:07,183
it is pretty good.

290
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,208
I'll be back.

291
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,612
Alvin, we solve anything
with violence.

292
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,630
This is a really fatty.
- Stop it.

293
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,456
This is really too much fat.

294
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,472
Seems my ass so less?

295
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,842
Your ass looks fine.
These guys are just glands.

296
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:44,062
You threatened him to crawl
into, and to build a nest.

297
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:48,247
That was outside the line and
physically impossible.

298
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:53,736
I would have to suspend the three of you.
- If you do, please.

299
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:04,133
Instead I know something better.

300
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,807
Because of declining budgets,
we lose our beloved music.

301
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:11,608
That's terrible.
- Yes.

302
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,072
N There is glimmer of hope.

303
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:17,395
Every year the League
sponsors an ...

304
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:20,916
and the winning school will
receive 25,000 euros.

305
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,135
If we win, we save our program.

306
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:25,733
And you want us to act?

307
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,637
I thought you were not a fan?

308
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:32,383
Why do not you sleep over night.

309
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:35,734
Wait.
- Great.

310
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,808
Promise me that you say nothing.

311
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,299
The president has an image to uphold.
If the department finds out.

312
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:49,290
That you really are.
I have all your CDs.

313
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,957
I got you last year in Denver even seen.
I have to put this.

314
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:56,016
It was my birthday.

315
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:02,830
Will you represent our school?

316
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:07,190
Frankly a suspension
seems ok to me.

317
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:11,462
What do you think, Alvin?
And to all, and three for n.

318
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:14,534
Well said, Theodore.
We participate.

319
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:17,450
Go ahead, Eagles.

320
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,349
Eagles? Where?

321
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:25,343
The penthouse.

322
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:27,569
Very exclusive.

323
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:34,260
Is not that Chihuahua?
Of that movie?

324
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:39,650
Yes, of course.
Many big names live here.

325
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,448
How you doing?
- I want his signature.

326
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:45,693
If you want to be a star, then
you behave like this.

327
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:49,606
You get no signatures, you
move them yourself.

328
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:54,598
Look there, a part of
the Jonas Brothers.

329
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,209
Where? I do not see them.
- We are there.

330
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:02,091
Let us enter my apartment ...

331
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:05,805
Hell, no!

332
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:08,154
What?
- Sorry, but ...

333
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:11,458
I left my keys in my office are.

334
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,971
Can someone who scored
and so open the door?

335
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:18,319
I do it.

336
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:23,109
I am stuck.

337
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,574
Let me help you.

338
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,671
Not so fast.

339
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:34,985
You should eat less nuts.

340
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,784
And you? You are slimmer.

341
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:41,313
Here I am not so good.

342
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,222
Impressive.

343
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,252
Must see.

344
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:58,864
Great. The best tree house ever.

345
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,163
A red piano.

346
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,652
Is this a dream?
- Look over there.

347
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:09,215
Much better than a tree house.

348
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:12,083
Nicely done, Hawke.

349
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:14,658
Do you like it?
- Sure.

350
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,649
I live here.
- It is so beautiful.

351
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,959
The last time we visited
had Meerkat Manor ...

352
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,171
The group was called the
Command's rivals ...

353
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:28,754
the area of the whiskers inside.

354
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:39,419
Toby, I knew it was a mess, but
this is really disgusting.

355
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,355
It's like I live in a dustbin.

356
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,253
Meerkat Manor is on. Watch.

357
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:50,545
You're right.
I should calm down.

358
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,409
What is this?

359
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,234
Are you serious? A taco.

360
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,799
Under your blanket? Toby.

361
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,999
Ladies and gentlemen, for his third strike
in a row, here is the Toobster.

362
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,753
Come on.

363
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,840
No problem.
Watch and learn, my friends.

364
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:26,222
This is the n following
best game.

365
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:28,957
Hide the broken TV from Dave.
Want to play?

366
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:32,115
No.
- Quiet with him, Taco Boy.

367
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,333
This day is bad enough.

368
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:40,349
I see what is going on.

369
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,663
You have problems at school.
- Not really ...

370
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:47,014
Unless you hang your head in
a toilet is a problem ...

371
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:52,642
Squirrels are the worst kind.

372
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,634
That is what I heard.

373
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:58,813
Personally, I absolutely
do not know.

374
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:02,143
How did you school?

375
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:41,164
Toby?
- What?

376
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,763
How was school? In a word?

377
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:48,773
Great.
But that was because I ...

378
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:52,091
very popular.

379
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:55,911
Why you still live with your grandma?
- Why call yourself
"the Toobster?

380
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,656
And all day gaming?

381
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,350
Time for bed.

382
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:12,664
Alvin, wake up and turn
the alarm off.

383
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:21,980
Alvin, I'm not kidding.
Turn it off.

384
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,403
Boys ...

385
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,779
This is not funny.

386
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,946
I know. I need help.

387
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:39,001
I must go.
He wants us to take deal.

388
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:42,251
School.
- Hello, have mercy.

389
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:45,452
Dave wants you to school,
and there you go then go.

390
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:49,151
Do not worry about us Driene, Toby.
We 'do.

391
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:52,353
If it hurt?
- Guys, come on.

392
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:55,641
Trust me, the second day is
never as bad as first.

393
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:03,815
Blocks!

394
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:07,543
Right in the pancreas.

395
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:15,182
Sister?

396
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:21,466
Think of your reflexes.
Diving, side, standing up.

397
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,222
You're next, hairball.

398
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,780
Are you talking to me?

399
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:30,501
I am the only one here, so
then you have against me.

400
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,438
Did you know?

401
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,109
Incredibly, he has caught him.
You're out.

402
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:46,958
And the thick got it made.

403
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,609
He has hands.
- I think actually claws.

404
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,268
That we can use in the team.

405
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:56,862
Kitten, will you come
to the football team?

406
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,754
Football? I?
- I must say you're good.

407
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:02,091
At lunch you can sit
down with us.

408
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:05,520
If the team you least
want to come?

409
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,827
Interesting proposal.
- Alvin?

410
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,069
That brings me back.
- This is a one-time offer.

411
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,839
Do not think too long about it.

412
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,565
Then my brothers in the lurch.

413
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:20,571
Only the first chipmunk to a football
team that ever played.

414
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,266
No way.

415
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:26,672
It is a chaos in the stadium.

416
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:31,683
The ball flies through the
air, and he catches it.

417
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,909
The crowd is crazy.

418
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,220
I?

419
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:47,942
I think that those super
cool jogger your calls.

420
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,167
Why should I go there?

421
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,849
If I am to worry whether
I'm popular.

422
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,640
Hi, talking chipmunk.
World-famous rock star ...

423
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,460
who has his own doll.
Guys, I'm in pajamas.

424
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:03,967
And I can play on
my own trumpet.

425
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:08,614
Come on, it is retecool.

426
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,351
Now go, Alvin.
- Really? Are you serious?

427
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:14,313
Yeah.
- Thank you. I'll be back.

428
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,501
All right, guys?

429
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,415
Give it to me.

430
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:33,508
I got it.

431
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,251
I'm not.

432
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:38,839
I think it is fun.
- I.

433
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,089
Throw up.

434
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,580
Call me.

435
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:53,921
This is old news.
I have the next big thing.

436
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:57,267
Singing female chipmunk.

437
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:05,296
What proportion of female singing chipmunk
people do not understand ...

438
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,368
West Eastman give the squirrels
in nature "Music Mania."

439
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,863
Girls, we go to school.

440
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:15,539
He jumps up, and he scores.

441
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:22,059
What is it? No "high five?"

442
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:24,940
Yes, "high five."

443
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:29,499
I know you are busy with
your things sport ...

444
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,187
but I may well use your help at home.
- That does not work.

445
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:36,268
Ryan will teach me how pretty
girls can do my homework.

446
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,854
You promised to be there.

447
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:44,115
We look at 'Meerkat Manor' tonight.
No beautiful girls.

448
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:48,110
Tonight will not succeed.
- You say that every day.

449
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,451
It is your day to do laundry.

450
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:54,346
Listen to your dad, Alvin.
You do not want to get grounded?

451
00:34:56,508 --> 00:35:00,913
Will you still pick up?
- Since you force me so far?

452
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:05,695
Instead, I will show you
just how that is done.

453
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:13,717
So it goes, and you call
yourself a jogger.

454
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:22,238
My brother, he is a real laugher.
Always have been.

455
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,146
I see you later.

456
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:29,085
This is mine.
- No, mine.

457
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,719
Why do you embarrass
me with my friends?

458
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:35,704
Are you kidding?
They are the ones which you
feel should be ashamed.

459
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:38,546
Good luck with the show, guys.
- Seats on the first row.

460
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,711
What song are we singing?

461
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:43,566
No pressure, but the school
is counting on us.

462
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:47,457
Calm down, it is like Ryan says,
"Who beat now singing chipmunk?"

463
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,984
Finally. It's like a dream.

464
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:18,916
I saw that he only watched me.
- I know.

465
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:22,474
Do you remember what Ian said?
We can not trust them.

466
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:46,071
What happened?
- I never thought
I would say ...

467
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:50,538
Peach is my new color.
- Her glasses were
very fashionable.

468
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:53,566
She is beautiful as dandruff.

469
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,494
If you want to do this
you must watch.

470
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:00,989
This is a good time for a break.
- Take only five minutes break.

471
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:05,073
She is right. We need to focus.

472
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:07,754
This is for my screensaver.

473
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:12,229
Are you ready?

474
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,175
I have a lot of important
things at home.

475
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:19,018
You must be their babysitter?
- I am indeed.

476
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:23,148
How are you, Dr.
Rubin?
I know because I've
been at school.

477
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:27,829
I do not know if you
know me, Toby ...

478
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:34,025
That can not? Hello. No bracket.

479
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:38,514
You still had a brace?
- I did ...

480
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:42,063
I have no more bracket.

481
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,966
I know a guy who makes drum skins.
I'm in the car, guys.

482
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:03,324
Someone is in love.

483
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:07,018
We will replace everything.
Parole nature of the squirrels.

484
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,643
The old fake mucus routine.

485
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:14,493
I thought I smelled a rat.
- Can I help you, Mr. Hawke?

486
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:18,123
I was wondering if I could help, I
heard about your music contest ...

487
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:21,175
and I'm as fast as I could, my
girls to offer as a volunteer.

488
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:25,082
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already decided.

489
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,878
Perhaps this will change
their minds.

490
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,725
Girls.

491
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:35,144
Do they listen to Ian?

492
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,418
And, two, three, four ...

493
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:10,331
They are great.

494
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,671
Good people of West Eastman, you have
just witnessed the debut ...

495
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:49,474
the chipmunk girls.

496
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,417
Thank you

497
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:56,800
Well?
- They were great.
But as I said ...

498
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:00,443
I've already made my decision.

499
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:04,732
I understand.
You have made your decision.

500
00:40:06,175 --> 00:40:10,955
I do not want to be rude, but in
the true spirit of democracy ...

501
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:15,337
where our great country at
large established ...

502
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,408
I say, let the people vote.

503
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:23,776
Let them choose.
And person, my voice,
I say, "let us vote."

504
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:26,959
Let us vote.

505
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,878
Let us vote.

506
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:33,202
Please be no game breaker ...

507
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,456
let them sing it.

508
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:37,958
Let us vote.

509
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,157
You're very convincing, Mr.
Hawke.

510
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,199
This I do.

511
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,598
Friday, each group n sing
song for the students.

512
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:55,324
The person with the most applause
will represent the school.

513
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,937
What?

514
00:40:57,653 --> 00:41:01,380
Thank you We have it made.

515
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:03,986
Now it happen, like Donkey Kong.

516
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,660
The monkeys crept together, at
the end of a dramatic day ...

517
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,290
to strengthen their family
relationship again.

518
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:16,197
The whiskers are now more
than ever on each count.

519
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:20,259
I am so glad that Mrs.
Ortega every day after school
with us, practice.

520
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,397
Every day?
- Stop right now on ...

521
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:27,509
We are a team, we need you.

522
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,320
Take it easy. We are not losing.

523
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,856
Tomorrow we talk about.

524
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,245
There is not much to talk.
I see you at the rehearsal.

525
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:40,745
Hide your not.
- I am not hiding.

526
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:46,089
You might as well take root in the countryside
because you feel blocked.

527
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,224
I do not.
- But you have.

528
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:52,750
I think tonight I sleep
in my own bed.

529
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:55,521
As for me, I'm so glad
I'm not a monkey.

530
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,711
And why is that?

531
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:16,056
Toby, can I sleep with you?

532
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:22,019
What?
- You heard me.

533
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,746
My brothers are fighting.

534
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:29,875
What? Ok.

535
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:42,797
Man, they beat me.

536
00:42:42,798 --> 00:42:47,241
They hit me all.
I'm afraid. Why do they do?

537
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,591
It hurts.

538
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:17,042
Let's see. What more do I feel?

539
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:20,473
How about an hors d'oeuvre?
With the compliments of me.

540
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,582
No, thank you.

541
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,622
Grapes, please.

542
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:31,395
Sorry.
- I wanted to warn you ...

543
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:33,867
Ian.
- What?

544
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:38,754
You should be grateful to Ian.
He has done everything for you
and you have his heart broken.

545
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,862
Really, what do you here?

546
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:44,409
He is the devil,
he has no heart.

547
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,970
And what he has done for
us, had us in a cage.

548
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:52,843
Alvin, that he would never do.
- Yeah, you were there too.

549
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:55,651
Brittany, but watch out.
- I have no opinion from you.

550
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:58,872
Expect nothing.
Ian leads us straight
to the top.

551
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:05,573
Exactly.
Right to the top.
I find that amazing.

552
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,707
Yes, funny.

553
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,325
I will destroy that
nature squirrels.

554
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:19,699
I would not destroy them.
- Me neither.
I want them to go out.

555
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,489
If you think so ...

556
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,849
perhaps we should then withdraw
from the race.

557
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:30,221
I stop you in one package and send you
back to the tree where you came from.

558
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:33,775
Sound good? About New then.

559
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,898
Stop.
That little green
dress in that ...

560
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:42,625
what's your name?
- Eleanor.

561
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:46,101
I hardly see you.
Have you always been so close?

562
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,324
I think so.
- There must be something to do.

563
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:52,423
I'm going to try.

564
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:55,542
Brittany, come stand here once.
You two remain there.

565
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:59,413
Still a bit further.

566
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:01,755
That's what I right.

567
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:05,422
But not because Brittany is a mega-ultra
superstar and you guys do not.

568
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:10,519
Now a little more separated.
Brittany, where you stand.

569
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,399
Anything more apart.
Give her the space, guys.

570
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:19,041
Now look at me.

571
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:22,546
And, two, three ... Look at me.

572
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,723
Hello.
- Toby?

573
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:37,805
What are you doing in the house?
Where is Aunt Jacky?

574
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:42,542
Dave, how are you?

575
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:48,698
Aunt Jacky is in the hospital.

576
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:54,153
I am a little worried.
Who look at the guys?

577
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,608
Me.

578
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:02,170
Dave, how is Paris?
- Carried the boys?

579
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:04,838
Absolutely. Just amazing.

580
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:09,034
Toby, what is going on?
- Nothing.

581
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:12,285
Do not worry.
I know now that you should
have no stress.

582
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:15,717
So I hang up now, but everything is good here.
Come home soon. Day.

583
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:23,623
Nurse, get me out of here!

584
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:26,838
Help, I want ...

585
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,917
I will not interrupt your game but I
saw how you weathered by Ryan ...

586
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,812
There was need for courage.
- Really?

587
00:46:33,813 --> 00:46:37,696
To have that kind of guy we are looking.
Jeremy Smith, president
of the student club.

588
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:40,096
How are you, I am ...
- International star ...

589
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,590
and 'waste sitter "Simon Seville.
-" Waste keeper? "

590
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:46,073
"Waste sitter" is a new
job that we have made.

591
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:49,419
In order to create awareness of a
major problem in our community.

592
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,125
I do agree 99% plus 1.

593
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,265
You do it but little sum.

594
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:58,156
Simon, I know I ask
much, but ...

595
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:03,964
We seek a senior guy who
heads up this great job.

596
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:06,628
What do you say?

597
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,354
Sorry, everyone.
Rapid communication.

598
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,493
I'm Simon, I am the 'waste sitter',
throw your garbage in the trash.

599
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:20,253
Hello, ladies.
You have noticed that a package you've
thrown on the ground, so ...

600
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,770
we will consider this
as a warning.

601
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,432
Go away.

602
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,817
How you doing, guys?

603
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:33,272
Look, everybody.
The newest member of
the football team.

604
00:47:33,273 --> 00:47:37,969
Those participating in the first game.
- Guys, do not make jokes.

605
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,513
I have spoken with the
coach you'll be.

606
00:47:40,514 --> 00:47:43,500
That's great. Great.
- Look ...

607
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:45,315
The new 'keeper waste.

608
00:47:45,316 --> 00:47:48,571
I did not even know the
school so someone had.

609
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:51,183
This is not so, but
tell him that.

610
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:55,862
Will you still pick up?
- No.

611
00:47:55,862 --> 00:48:01,714
I'm sorry to hear, then I should
make a note for you.

612
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:08,109
No, I have a note of
the 'waste sitter'.

613
00:48:09,982 --> 00:48:14,106
Do you play the game so?
I can do all day.

614
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,167
It is a joke, man.

615
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:17,702
Waste is not something to laugh.

616
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:20,527
You're the joke.
We take you in the leg.

617
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:22,882
There is no such thing
as a "waste sitter.

618
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:25,251
What?
- Waste sitter yet?

619
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:30,337
You knew it, Alvin?
Spread the word "brother"
you anything?

620
00:48:30,338 --> 00:48:32,602
Yes, of course.

621
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:35,293
Yes, he has a few new brothers
now he is the football team.

622
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:40,856
You have still not cleaned
up the waste.

623
00:48:40,857 --> 00:48:42,553
Should I "waste" off?

624
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:45,656
Let's start with you.
- Hey, let loose. No.

625
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,393
Goal.

626
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,568
See you shortly.

627
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:07,982
Ok, I'm a real jerk, I admit.

628
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:10,719
Is it good between us now?

629
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:25,190
Ok, I forget ...

630
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:27,122
because of Theodore.
- I know.

631
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,889
Therefore I give you ...

632
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,866
my honor that I stand on
that stage Friday night.

633
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,439
Well. Why are not there?

634
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,714
Because I ...

635
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,761
What?
- I ...

636
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:46,110
You have a what?
- A football game.
Now I said it.

637
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,889
A football game.

638
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:59,274
Is everything okay?
- Theodore.

639
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:03,147
Yes, everything is good.
Just a little garbage wrestling.

640
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:05,837
Crazy weather here.

641
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:12,687
Theo Do not worry, everything
will be fine.

642
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:17,120
Alvin, do not miss the singing competition.
- Do not be afraid, Simon.

643
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:20,237
I'll be there. I promise you.

644
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,470
H guys, thanks for
the help today.

645
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:28,085
"Choice for Childs' is a really cool organization.
Everyone gets points today.

646
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,922
What happened to Theodore on?
- I have no idea.

647
00:50:38,321 --> 00:50:41,299
H Eleanor, would you turn
or Theodore needs help?

648
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:04,230
They do not look very comfortable out.
- My shoes?

649
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:08,954
They are not.
But Ian says that I
seem to be higher.

650
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,510
I think you look
good as you are.

651
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:17,617
Do you really?

652
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:28,450
This is the home of Seville,
please leave a message.

653
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:32,715
Hi, Toby.
By Julie Ortega, met yesterday
we talked ...

654
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:37,114
since we were doing.
In any case, the reason
I call ...

655
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:41,724
that I am worried for Theodore,
he acts a little down lately.

656
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:45,072
I hope you come to the singing
competition Friday.

657
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:48,411
He has all the necessary
support he can get.

658
00:51:48,507 --> 00:51:55,375
So, I see you there.
I hope that we meet
or talk, bye.

659
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,277
It is time to welcome
the warriors.

660
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:09,566
The Eagles are back, with
only five minutes to go.

661
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:14,400
Seville must do something.

662
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:17,439
Otherwise the game is over.
- I know I can there.

663
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,895
Let me join.

664
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:26,211
Time-out.
- Time Out.

665
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:29,075
Number 15 is changed.

666
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:37,906
Ok guys, it's time
for the big A.

667
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:42,231
I will crush them, I will feel pain.
The Alvinator is present.

668
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,491
Are you sure?

669
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:45,537
Four have ten say that we should
use the secret weapon

670
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:48,591
Chip is right.
He left the decision to me.

671
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:51,743
Time to make history, boys.

672
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:02,630
I take you to graze, Jennifer.

673
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:05,294
You are the one who goes
down, rattenkop.

674
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:08,657
I will crush you like a jerk,
and you eat at dinner.

675
00:53:08,658 --> 00:53:11,503
With some soy beans
and a nice Chianti.

676
00:53:12,715 --> 00:53:16,456
Is he my father?

677
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:19,622
And, two ...

678
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:30,816
Impact!

679
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,259
That's my point.
Hatred is not the pain,
hate the game.

680
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,880
I love the hunt, man.

681
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:49,528
Eagles 15. The Warriors 14.

682
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:54,354
How about that. Right at you.

683
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:57,616
That's my point.
- You're the muscular chipmunk.

684
00:53:57,617 --> 00:54:02,126
Give me a T, give me
an O give me an F.

685
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,906
What you get, TOF.

686
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,698
I am the king of the world.

687
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:10,743
Party for Alvin.

688
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:13,274
Everybody to the beach.

689
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,502
But come on.

690
00:54:21,643 --> 00:54:25,013
Listen guys, know
I'm here for you.

691
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:29,293
There is still plenty of time.
I found Alvin.
Everything is good.

692
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:34,553
Thank you, Toby.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dr..
Rubin.

693
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,866
Thank you, students.

694
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,927
Welcome to our crazy singing ...

695
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:44,990
between the nature squirrels
and chipmunk girls.

696
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:52,929
Remember that students, there
are no winners or losers.

697
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:56,288
Remember to tell the squirrels nature,
if we blow them off the stage.

698
00:54:56,289 --> 00:55:01,068
The chance to win $ 25,000 for our school,
to save the music department.

699
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:05,016
So, we go further.
I present to you the
chipmunk girls.

700
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,083
This is the girls, can
you believe it.

701
00:55:10,084 --> 00:55:13,280
Brittany, your time to shine.

702
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:16,794
Go on stage and defeat them.
- Yes sir, I can.

703
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,127
I'm just saying that you should not
stand in the way of Brittany.

704
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,269
You like what you see,
call Ian Hawk ...

705
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:12,963
310-555
- 5309.

706
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:18,909
No worries, Simon, Alvin can walk
through that door any moment now.

707
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:27,277
I'm back.

708
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:42,391
Thank you.
- Well done, ladies.

709
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:47,853
And now, applause for the group that
will crush you like a hurricane.

710
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,546
At least that is what most
students have told me.

711
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:54,855
Here they are, the
nature squirrels.

712
00:56:56,223 --> 00:57:00,034
You know they say there is no 'i' is
the word 'Team', and you're right.

713
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:03,229
Do you know where one is 'i' occupants?
In Alvin.

714
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:07,752
Bales to be you. Girls.

715
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:10,504
Unfortunately he is right.

716
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:15,645
Did you find him?
- Sorry, I looked everywhere.

717
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:18,104
And I do not know why, but
the team has not returned.

718
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,733
What should we do?

719
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:24,548
I would ...

720
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:28,700
I would ask someone.
Someone who is not like me.

721
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:32,091
I know what we should do.

722
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:45,018
Hello, everyone.

723
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:51,094
Our brother, Alvin could
not be here today.

724
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:55,658
Look, we never have occurred
without Alvin ..

725
00:57:55,754 --> 00:57:59,853
and we do not.

726
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,669
You can not have two little piglets,
you can not have two musketeers ...

727
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:09,298
but you can not have
two kind squirrels.

728
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:11,508
Thank you.

729
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:24,096
Thank you.

730
00:58:35,434 --> 00:58:36,959
You hear that girls?

731
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,899
That is the sound of success.

732
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,047
I can imagine how distressed ...

733
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:49,119
if you chipmunk fans.

734
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,600
So I guess that means that
the chipmunk girls ...

735
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:57,330
Come on girls, we go
for a victory lap.

736
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:00,857
Come on guys.

737
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:02,814
Britt, we have to.

738
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:04,840
Come on.

739
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:11,053
Thank you.

740
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:20,979
Life is good.

741
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:23,792
Especially if you're
not a loser.

742
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,419
Guys? I am.

743
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,108
Guys?

744
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:32,645
Great.

745
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:34,279
They are all gone, Alvin.

746
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:38,504
They will never forgive me.
- Do you ... Alvin

747
00:59:38,505 --> 00:59:42,407
Ian is right.
You care only about yourself.

748
00:59:47,936 --> 00:59:51,849
Besides, I never want
to win this way.

749
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,837
Simon, are you still awake?

750
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,538
I get it when you're angry.

751
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:47,366
I ran away from home?

752
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:50,463
Look me in the zoo,
because I'm not.

753
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:52,401
No, Theodore ...

754
01:00:58,271 --> 01:00:59,787
Hello?

755
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:03,158
Meerkat family?

756
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:10,975
Is anyone home?

757
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:15,142
My name is Theodore, I would like
to be part of your family.

758
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:19,375
More Cats have moved to California State Zoo.
Welcome to the raptors.

759
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,966
Maybe they hide.

760
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,275
You need not fear.

761
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:34,645
You're not a monkey.

762
01:01:35,189 --> 01:01:37,968
Toby, you take the lions,
tigers and bears ...

763
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,042
Simon and I take the
butterfly room.

764
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:42,637
Dear Eagle.

765
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,886
No, Theodore.

766
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:48,121
No problem there.

767
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:51,055
Hold on, little man.
We'll get you there from.

768
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:56,622
Ok we have a plan.
And well-founded plan.

769
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,115
But you may also like a
maniac to walk there.

770
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:02,837
Theo, watch out.

771
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:05,135
Hello, I am Theodore ...

772
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:09,920
H bird, are you hungry?

773
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:12,293
This A stands for aperitif.

774
01:02:15,055 --> 01:02:17,745
Let us easy to do, then
we talk it out.

775
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:23,842
Look, I understand why you
want to Theodore ...

776
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:27,293
but sorry, I can not
let that happen.

777
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:29,313
He is my brother.

778
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:34,465
I did not let him know, because
I've been a horrible bastard.

779
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:40,361
If anyone deserves to be
eaten, then I will.

780
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,339
Not literally.

781
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,151
I help you, Alvin.

782
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:53,662
Go away eagle.

783
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:57,686
He is a big elephant.
Luckily I speak a little
'Eagle language.

784
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,037
I think it works.

785
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:15,394
Guys, that was great.

786
01:03:15,968 --> 01:03:20,657
He's right.
We are now for all,
and three for n?

787
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,859
Come on, Simon. Hug it out but.

788
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,573
You know that I regret Si.

789
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,256
Do not let it get that
far I should kiss you.

790
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,691
Do it because I hear
it I do not care.

791
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:38,031
Here he comes again.
The "kiss and cuddle train"
departs from the station.

792
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:42,864
Give me a hug but that.

793
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:54,748
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

794
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:58,230
310-555-5309.

795
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:01,104
Morris, make sure that I get
the phone to Ian Hawke.

796
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,812
There you are al

797
01:04:06,813 --> 01:04:08,780
My dear little money earners.

798
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:13,763
Do you remember that I said
I would make you big star?

799
01:04:15,487 --> 01:04:18,429
Guess who Britney Spears is
the opening act tonight?

800
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:21,771
Say that I dream.

801
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:24,570
Wait!
Tonight, then we miss
the school game?

802
01:04:25,009 --> 01:04:27,913
That's right.
You miss the school contest.

803
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:30,292
You are so smart, I you
can never be fooled.

804
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:37,509
It never went to school that stupid
game, went to Brittany to a star.

805
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,395
That you wanted so badly anyway?

806
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:44,645
Yes.
- Tonight is your big chance.

807
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,745
It's all about you, Brittany.

808
01:04:46,746 --> 01:04:49,130
But what about Jeanette
and Eleanor?

809
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:52,173
They can be singing in the background,
I have clothes made for them also.

810
01:04:53,546 --> 01:04:59,056
We are her sisters.
- And we sing together or not.

811
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:02,825
All right.
I just have the B-girl
but necessary.

812
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:07,140
Ian, I do not do
it without them.

813
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:12,473
All right. Then we go to Plan B.

814
01:05:12,474 --> 01:05:15,349
Who loves barbecue?

815
01:05:16,703 --> 01:05:21,599
Because I know a nice shop, where you
can get delicious nature squirrels.

816
01:05:23,037 --> 01:05:27,609
Very tasty.
If you should prefer to sing?

817
01:05:35,373 --> 01:05:40,342
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our school.

818
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:45,735
Remember, choose the group you tonight,
win $ 25,000 for our school.

819
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:50,948
There are many shows and at half
past nine, the stove off, so ..

820
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:57,852
you no longer have to wait for Orange
girl, here is Lou Rosarro.

821
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:26,545
We meet again.
Still want a piece of me?

822
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,410
Eagle.

823
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:33,149
Ian Hawke?

824
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,230
Give me but that.

825
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:39,219
I had not expected
that criminal.

826
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,913
Alvin, are you still
genteresseerd?

827
01:06:43,914 --> 01:06:46,543
We can not participate tonight.

828
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,439
But then the music department.
The whole school is
counting on you.

829
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,799
I know.
I had to listen to what
you have on Ian.

830
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,839
Let me guess ...

831
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,575
Yes, he has us in a cage.

832
01:06:57,252 --> 01:07:01,872
Is this the biggest you have.
I had asked for the biggest,
that is not.

833
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,710
I will be equal to Dr.
Rubin tell.

834
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,996
Brittany?
- Alvin, stay where you are.

835
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:09,554
You got it.
Brittany, I'll get you.

836
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,208
Simon, how do you as a lock?

837
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:13,111
Ok clear.

838
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,847
I must go to those girls.
And quickly.

839
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,617
I know how.

840
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:34,788
The third theory is the
hardest to crack ...

841
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:37,225
I assume that we should
not assume ...

842
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:41,136
The first two numbers are n.
So I try n.

843
01:07:41,169 --> 01:07:42,363
He is open.

844
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,045
Ok girls ...
- Ian is coming.

845
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:45,764
Hide the phone, quick!

846
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:47,164
Time to be great.

847
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:48,635
We are ready.

848
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:53,262
I would even be.
After this performance
I am back on top.

849
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,652
Cherisse applause.

850
01:08:19,837 --> 01:08:24,371
Driver, take me to the arena.
The VIP entrance.

851
01:08:24,372 --> 01:08:28,538
To the suite.
A little moonlight ride.

852
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:32,291
Moonlight ride, we go.

853
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:34,448
Champagne.

854
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:36,987
If you do not mind ...

855
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:42,476
You know why?
Because tonight we toast ...

856
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:47,069
to a special someone, namely me.

857
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,035
They said I could not, I never
would come back to the top.

858
01:08:51,604 --> 01:08:55,102
But just look.
... Time for my fine

859
01:08:57,612 --> 01:09:02,781
The ladies who make the world forget
the nature squirrels ...

860
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:11,801
What do you do? Alvin.

861
01:09:12,693 --> 01:09:15,244
Good to see you looking good.

862
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,059
I have a signed contract.

863
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,346
Jumping, Jeanette.
- I'm not sure I ...

864
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,916
It means my end if
you do not act.

865
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:27,766
Gas out, Alvin.
- You name it!

866
01:09:28,443 --> 01:09:31,595
Ian H, in other words,
you're fired.

867
01:09:44,621 --> 01:09:48,048
Alvin heard of anything?
- No chipmunk Alvin
and no girls.

868
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:52,014
Only Dr.
Rubin and the entire school
that relies on us.

869
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:58,772
Do not worry, e
erything is good.

870
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:09,447
Faster Alvin.
- Do not worry ...

871
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:12,118
I get some help from
my friend there.

872
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:15,295
Roger, Alvin.
- Look out!

873
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:17,109
Just like I'm back
on the racetrack.

874
01:10:18,822 --> 01:10:20,743
Where you going?
What are you doing?

875
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:26,547
Wait till I tell at home that
I've saved Alvin Seville.

876
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:28,745
I think I owe you an apology
for what regards Ian.

877
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:31,451
Hold on to me but you.
With me you do not fear.

878
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,076
I'm much faster.

879
01:10:38,423 --> 01:10:41,014
I must say, he is resolute.

880
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:46,507
We must try to get rid of him.
- Hold on.

881
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:50,723
I have a plan, jump
when I'm at three.

882
01:10:50,804 --> 01:10:52,789
Three.

883
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:56,344
Exactly.
- I did not like heights.

884
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,302
Keep your tight Jeanette.
- Bring back to me but my girls.

885
01:10:59,303 --> 01:11:02,623
We have remote needed.
- Guys, I do have an idea.

886
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:04,477
Take your helmet off for Ian.

887
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,461
The remote.

888
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,428
I can not.

889
01:11:15,429 --> 01:11:17,499
I'm going to try it.
Take my ankles.

890
01:11:21,452 --> 01:11:23,176
I got him.

891
01:11:23,683 --> 01:11:25,587
I have him?

892
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:29,144
Well done, Jen.
- Top work, Jeanette.

893
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,011
Ian H, you were wrong.
I do not need.

894
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,979
Bye bye.
- Adios, Ian.

895
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,741
And now, our last act
of the evening.

896
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:52,498
We have received a recent change,
but find that you would not mind.

897
01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:56,606
Hatching for West Eastman are,
the nature squirrels.

898
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:02,809
We will still be on the
podium, Theodore.

899
01:12:10,096 --> 01:12:12,419
There are no squirrels nature,
so we should continue.

900
01:12:16,203 --> 01:12:18,297
I would not make them again.

901
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:21,785
Sorry, but we must go.

902
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:31,287
I'm not a chipmunk, as you see.

903
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:41,281
Music.
- Where is the music?

904
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:48,310
I'm going to sing.

905
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:28,605
That was another great.

906
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:35,332
Thank you.

907
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:39,096
The chipmunk girls have
entered the building.

908
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:42,562
It is the chipmunk girls.
- Alvin.

909
01:13:46,406 --> 01:13:48,629
Hello, West Eastman.

910
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:52,214
I put her to the ground.
Hold you down.

911
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:54,399
Alvin.
- Give me the five brothers.

912
01:13:57,837 --> 01:14:01,171
Ladies and gentlemen,
for West Eastman ...

913
01:14:03,082 --> 01:14:05,191
This is truly an honor.

914
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:07,742
For you or for us?
- For us.

915
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:13,684
We already get it Come on, guys.

916
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,773
And now the girls chipmunk
and chipmunk.

917
01:15:39,378 --> 01:15:42,563
Thank you.

918
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:49,463
It seems clear that we have a
winner for the $ 25,000 ...

919
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:51,229
and it is for West High Eastman.

920
01:15:52,572 --> 01:15:54,570
Guys, we did it.

921
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,837
All yours, Dr.. Rubin.

922
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:16,544
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Staples Center
is proud to welcome the chipmunk girls.

923
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:23,020
Hi everyone, I'm Jeanette
and I am Eleanor.

924
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:24,939
And I'm Brittany.

925
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,692
And we have the chipmunk girls.

926
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:33,072
And, two, three.

927
01:17:00,756 --> 01:17:03,947
Dave, you dance.
- You are even good.

928
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:06,683
Welcome back.
- Did you miss us?

929
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:09,684
Of course I missed you.
You are my guys.

930
01:17:10,287 --> 01:17:13,563
H Dave, how did you miss us.
Since we now have six of us.

931
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:14,754
Alvin, what did you do?

932
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,746
The chipmunk girls will also have
to sleep somewhere, right?

933
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:22,948
So I said that you said, that she
may continue as long as needed.

934
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:29,660
Ok, this is Dave.
Everybody shake what
your mama gave you.

935
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,142
See you again.
All ready for bed.

936
01:18:09,308 --> 01:18:11,658
Looks like the chipmunk girls
have a good influence on you.

937
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:13,901
Thanks, Dave.

938
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,650
Lights out now.

939
01:18:16,746 --> 01:18:20,637
Good night everyone.

940
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,418
Alvin?
- I'm not tired.

941
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:25,568
Sorry, but you must go
to school tomorrow.

942
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,678
Not tired.

943
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:33,536
Alvin, come on. It's bedtime.

944
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,592
Not tired.

945
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:43,003
Still not tired. More light.

946
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:45,071
I'm just kidding.
Much more light.

947
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,326
Alvin, now it's ready,
let me come to you.

948
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:55,855
Now someone is tired.

949
01:18:56,295 --> 01:18:59,405
Good night.

950
