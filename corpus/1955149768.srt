00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,700
Who knows the ways of the universe ?

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,910
Where and when a raindrop might fall ?

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,290
How strongly a wind will blow ?

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,720
I get it.
Yeah

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,680
Is it all just an accident?

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,370
- Or could it be destiny?
 - Yay, this is awesome.

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,310
- Nice. Radish
- Po

9
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,770
Help. Help me.

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,570
Sorry. Excuse me
Coming through

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,570
Dad, I'll protect you from that...

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,150
- Pen?
- I need you to autograph your stuff.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,110
Stuff?

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,070
Business has doubled since I 
turned your bedroom into a gift shop.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,370
- Gift shop?
- Dragon warrior souvenirs with every purchase.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,080
Whoa whoa whoa, you're selling my stuff?

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,790
- Oh no no no no
- Oh boy, thank you.

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,920
- I'm giving it away
- What ?

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,920
What about my furious five figures?
Where are they?

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,050
I put them in a box over there.

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,430
This box ?

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,430
Oops

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,020
No

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,900
-I'm sorry, Po.
-Dad, they're hand-made scale replicas with Kung Fu action.

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,690
I made them the day I fell in love with Kung Fu.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,690
I have to find them.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,870
Po, it was an accident.

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,830
Where are they?

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,200
Accident? Or destiny?

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:53,840
Little does Po know that it was just such an
accident that brought the furious Five together all those years ago.

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,010
This is the story of how the Five came to be

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,310
Straighten up

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,770
Yes, master Shifu.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,100
Wider.
Lower stance

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,270
Hold your ground

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,150
Steady.
Strong

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,020
Chin up

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,690
This is the way of Kung Fu

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,570
I can't even tell them apart.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,530
Focus

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,910
Control

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,790
Control

43
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,420
There she is.

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,640
What are you doing? That's not proper form.
This is not control.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
And stand on your feet.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,230
I'm sorry master.
I don't know what got into me.

47
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,060
-I won't let it happen again.
- I wish I could believe that.

48
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,770
-One hundred laps.
-Yes, master Shifu.

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,400
-Higher knees.
-Yes, master Shifu.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,490
-She wants to make you proud.
-Well, maybe I could be proud if she was doing the correct form.

51
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,910
- Your form.
- Is there another kind?

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,210
Shifu, an acorn can only become the
mighty oak. Not a cherry tree.

53
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,210
You must let her grow into
what she will be.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,010
Master Oogway
Master Shifu

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,010
Master Mongrel, What is it?

56
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,470
He's coming
A giant of warrior

57
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,640
He calls himself Boar

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,930
I am Boar

59
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,810
- He's unstoppable.
- I am unstoppable.

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,940
- He's invincible.
- I am invis...

61
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,060
inciv...

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,400
I am Boar.

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,110
He's defeating the masters one by one.
He's heading this way.

64
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,990
Shifu, only you can stop him.

65
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,040
 Some boar has destroyed the North road.
So have to go get vegetables in the South.

66
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,870
And now while I'm gone, you're the chef.

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,920
Alright don't worry, dad. I watched you cook like a
thousand times. I'll be good at cheffing...cheffery.

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,210
I almost forgot.
Goodbye

69
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,880
I'll miss you. I'll be back soon.

70
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,350
Now don't forget. Before you open, sweep the sidewalk,
wipe down the tables and pass out the menus.

71
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,810
Sweep, wipe, pass out, like everyday.
Don't worry, dad. I got this. Go

72
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,020
Okay, bye.

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,070
Well, that's done.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,990
That boar will be here by morning.
But I've dealt with his kind before.

75
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,000
I hold my ground.
Steady, Strong

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,550
He's been at this all day. Hasn't he?

77
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,550
Yes, he's amazing.

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,300
I'll never be like him.

79
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,430
No, you won't.

80
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,350
Shifu, there's a matter of the utmost importance.

81
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,770
-What could be more important than preparing for battle?
-Food.

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Let's order in.

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,730
Chop, chop, chop. Ow

84
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,730
I know I'm what preparing when I'm here somewhere.

85
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,150
Oh, the spices. Right

86
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,740
So...

87
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,030
What do you guys do all day up there at the...

88
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,830
Jade palace.

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,370
- Kung Fu
- Thank you. Bless you, too.

90
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,580
- No no, Kung Fu.
- Oh, yeah, Kung Fu.

91
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:23,130
That's really neat how you do the
Fu thing with the Kung.

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,590
You have no idea what that is. Do you?

93
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,180
No. No, I don't.

94
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,350
Well, I should get this back.

95
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,390
Right. Yeah of course.
They're gonna love it. Love it.

96
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,648
What was

97
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:37,316
in that food?

98
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,940
Please fetch a doctor.

99
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,940
- He's in no condition to fight that boar.
- I can hear you.

100
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,530
Tigress is right.
You need reinforcements.

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,740
-Master, it would be an honor to fight for you.
-No, you are not ready.

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Get me a scroll.

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,620
 This is a list of four warriors.
Find them in the Wang Fu village and hurry.

104
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,678
No. 

105
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,805
Send Tigress.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,010
Master, I won't disappoint you.

107
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,270
Be back before dawn.

108
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,980
Do not fail me.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,980
I will make you proud.

110
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,790
Po, did you hear?
Some idiot cook poisoned Shifu.

111
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,620
What ?

112
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,710
- Is he dead? 
-Not yet. But he will be when they catch him.

113
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,790
-No, I meant Shifu.
-Oh no, he's alive barely.

114
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,510
- So how did you do? 
- Oh, I've made a mess.

115
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,670
Oh, that you did.

116
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,970
My son the chef
I'm so proud.

117
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,390
Yeah, about the whole chef thing.
Maybe there's something else I'd be good at.

118
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,980
Well, let's see how good you
are at cleaning up this mess.

119
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,070
- Good thinking, dad. I clean things. I'd be a great cleaner.
- You a cleaner?

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,200
I can't even get you to take a bath.

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,320
- You're funny. You should be a comedian.
- A comedian.

122
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,540
- Or a dancer?
-Got it, dancer. I can do graceful.

123
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,040
You graceful? I feel sick.

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,170
Then you need a doctor.
I could be a doctor.

125
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,290
Cleaner, comedian, dancer, doctor.
Great, what else?

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,590
- An emperor
- Can I?

127
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,380
No, I was just kidding.

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Po, your destiny is to
become a chef like me.

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,310
I can't be a chef.
I'm the one who pois..... antidote.

130
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,430
That I can't be a chef.

131
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,980
Dad, I'm never gonna be like you.

132
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,900
I just... I don't know what I wanna do.

133
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,070
 I know what you can do.
Take out the trash.

134
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,160
Pardon me, I'm here to see Shifu.
I'm the doctor.

135
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,040
Sorry

136
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,250
The list

137
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,960
Okay, nice meeting you.

138
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,300
You have to know what you want to do in life

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,800
Otherwise you end up being a loser.
Like that chef who poisoned Shifu. Right, Po?

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,390
Yeah, right but I am.

141
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,150
I am Boar. I am unstoppable.

142
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,740
Master Shifu from the Jade Palace,
he will stop you.

143
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,620
Shifu?

144
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,950
The Jade Palace.

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,120
Make it quick.
I have a valley to defend.

146
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,840
- Acupuncture is a very precise art.
- Have you ever don this before?

147
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,670
No, you're my first patient.

148
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,380
That is weird.

149
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,730
 The cleaner? It must be a code name.

150
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,940
Masters, the valley is in great peril.
Master Shifu sent me here to fetch four warriors.

151
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,950
I'm looking for...

152
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,530
Cleaner?

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes?

154
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,210
Right

155
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,790
Master cleaner, it is an honor to meet you.

156
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,960
Master shifu's asked that you return with me to the Jade Palace.
You are needed there.

157
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,210
The Jade Palace?

158
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,050
Excellent work

159
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,640
- Yes. I... yes of course, I'll go.
- Good. We must hurry.

160
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,270
The Jade Palace. I'm needed there.

161
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,020
Let's see who's next?

162
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,400
The comedian?

163
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,690
That's not a banana, that's my wife.

164
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,030
This is awful!

165
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,030
Okay, two of us going to a bar

166
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,160
Actually one of us going... 

167
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,000
- Do not go in there. He's so bad. 
- Excellent

168
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,330
Hello. Master comedian?

169
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,330
 I've been sent by master Shifu...

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,260
- Is everything all right?
-Sure, I killed in there.

171
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,380
I can not read this.
It's upside down.

172
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,760
Master Shifu asked that you return with me to the Jade Palace.

173
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,680
Jade Palace?

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,390
That's not my wife, that's a banana.
Get it?

175
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,480
Excellent joke.

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,600
Master? Master comedian?

177
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,360
Would you come?

178
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,150
Then I say "That's my wife".

179
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,860
Well, there you go.
So who's next?

180
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
The dancer

181
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,410
Excellent show

182
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,830
 The Jade Palace

183
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,170
- Father, I'll make you proud.
- I've always been proud of you.

184
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,880
Oh, that's so cute.

185
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,260
So who's next on the list?
- What?

186
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,930
Oh yes, the doctor.

187
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm the doctor.

188
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,270
He's already there. Let's go.

189
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,730
I read about this once.
It's called eyeball acupuncture.

190
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,730
So brace for impact.

191
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,290
Coming through

192
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,180
- Now I know why Shifu chose you.
- Really? Why?

193
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
Because you're amazing.

194
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,730
- Nice
Oh wow, thanks.

195
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,150
- At this pace, we'll get there just in time.
- Great, can't wait.

196
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,410
And with the doctor, you have
the four you've requested.

197
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,330
Wait, what?

198
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,620
May I add, it was an honor to serve you.

199
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,710
Tigress, what is this?

200
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,510
- The warriors on your list.
- Warrior? Where?

201
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,180
This is not my list.
Where are the warriors that I sent for?

202
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Is it my turn?

203
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,690
I don't understand. It must be an accident.

204
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,150
There are no acci...

205
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Master, forgive me.

206
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,650
You disappoint me.

207
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,070
Who will defend the valley now?

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Wait, we can help Tigress.

209
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,330
- What?
- We can fight a little...bit. 

210
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,160
- Yes, you can count me in, too.
- Let's do this.

211
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 I'm not actually even a doctor so I'm in.

212
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
- You can help by leaving.
- Okay, bye.

213
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,340
No master, please listen. I have seen them.
They have skills.

214
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,840
But they are not the warriors I sent for.

215
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,560
- It's been an honor to know you.
- But Tigress

216
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,770
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,270
Master Shifu, master

218
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,820
The Boar, the Boar has been spotted by the great forest.

219
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,610
Evacuate the city to higher ground

220
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,320
Right away

221
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
You, you should leave now.

222
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,740
Let's go.

223
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,410
I'll do what I can.

224
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,920
The cleaner, the comedian

225
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
 The dancer and even that little doctor

226
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,340
It was no accident that you found them.

227
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,140
- I failed Shifu.
- Worse.

228
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,720
You're failing yourself.

229
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,890
No matter how much you try
,you will never be Shifu

230
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,570
The question is can you be Tigress?

231
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,290
- This is terrible.
- Yes, they're leaving before breakfast

232
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,840
No dad. If I hadn't poisoned Shifu with my food
then none of this would've happened.

233
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,220
Po, you cooked that meal for Shifu?

234
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,890
So Shifu ate noodles
from Ping's noodle hut?

235
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,480
Dad, I'm very sorry. I was gonna tell you but...
- No, this is fantastic.

236
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,810
- But...
- Now serving the Jade Palace Ping and son.

237
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,690
- You can't buy this kind of publicity.
- But dad...

238
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,570
If we hurry, we'll be the
only one selling food to all those starving folk.

239
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,780
- Wait
- I'll get the pots.

240
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,036
- But...
- Gather some roots and mushrooms from the hilltop

241
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,580
And I'll see you up there later.

242
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay, I'm on it.

243
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,750
- I wish there was something we could do.
- So any idea how big this Boar is?

244
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,920
Is it like huge? Is it gigantic? Biggish?

245
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,140
I am Boar.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,060
I hold my ground.

247
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,400
Steady

248
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,690
Strong

249
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,990
This is the way of Kung Fu.

250
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,950
So you're gonna stop me?

251
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,120
Let's see.

252
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,960
Is that all you got?
I'm disappointed.

253
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,050
I was expecting a challenge.

254
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,520
- Good morning, Shifu.
- I must do something.

255
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,650
No, her destiny is not yours to control.

256
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,610
I am unstoppable.

257
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,490
Gotcha

258
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,120
Don't move, sweetie.

259
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
You know what the best part of a joke is?

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,500
The punchline.

261
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,130
Need a hand?

262
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,760
What are you doing?
You're nothing.

263
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,300
I just defeated Shifu.

264
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,010
No

265
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,770
I'm not Shifu.

266
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
I am Tigress

267
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:31,822
Whoa

268
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,300
Let me hold your breath.
It's gonna hurt.

269
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,260
Alright, All together.

270
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,060
Twist your hips.

271
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,020
Recoil

272
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,980
And extend

273
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,280
I've been stopped.

274
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,870
Kung Fu

275
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,200
I know

276
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,540
I know what I wanna do.

277
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,620
I know what I wanna do.

278
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,420
- I guess we're done here.
- Hey, we could be a team.

279
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,500
- Yes
- Agree 

280
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,920
What should we call ourselves?

281
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,670
Here Shifu

282
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,380
Feel better

283
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,310
- What about the forensic Five?
- The funky five?

284
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,270
- The fireproof Five?
- Bigger, think bigger.

285
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,270
The fleshy Five?

286
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,270
Sloppy, very sloppy.

287
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,610
Your technique is unorthodox and undisciplined

288
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,360
Training begins right away.

289
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,570
Tigress, what are you doing?

290
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,120
It's time to develop this Tigress style of yours.

291
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,670
I am very proud of you.

292
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,800
Master

293
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,010
Wait

294
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,850
You all can stay.

295
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,720
You fought well with courage and honor.

296
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,850
We must explore those skills of yours.

297
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
You are tiny. They're small.

298
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,030
- But I already know how much pain you can inflict.
- You're welcome.

299
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,690
Oh, four fists, huh?

300
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,820
I think you should be able to handle this.

301
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,370
What ever their nature, your limbs will become your weapons.

302
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,410
Your shields. Your best allies.

303
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,250
- Right, no legs.
- Yeah

304
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,290
Oops

305
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,590
We'll work something out.

306
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,630
Alright then

307
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,340
We have five new Kung Fu styles to perfect.

308
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,560
And then Tigress went for the last blow

309
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,190
Where are they? Where?

310
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,730
I'll follow your leads, master Tigress.
Together we'll defeat this bandits.

311
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,020
They don't stand a chance against my side kick.

312
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,990
Come on you ugly bandit
Come have a taste of my foot.

313
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,870
Forgive me, master Tigress. I failed you.

314
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,040
You'll never be a great warrior.
This stance is too weak.

315
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,210
That's because he won't eat his broccoli

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,880
Well, I believe in him.

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,920
Yes, right foot.

318
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,180
That's it. Now shift your weight 

319
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,340
Twist the hips

320
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Recoil

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,850
And extend

322
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,810
Yes

323
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,350
Thank you master Tigress

324
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,350
- Come on sweetie. Bed time
- Coming mom, coming.

325
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,020
Well done little master.

326
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,070
Did you find your dolls?

327
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,570
Your father told us he accidentally gave them away.

328
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,950
No, I think they're right where they're meant to be.

329
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,410
Besides, I got the real thing right here.

330
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,500
- Yeah, that is right.
- Sweet

331
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,750
Who knows the ways of the universe?

332
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,636
Accident? Or destiny?

333
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,880
That is the secret
