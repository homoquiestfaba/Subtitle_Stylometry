00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,552
<i>Music is powerful.</i>

2
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:21,546
<i>One song can change the mood, trigger a memory.</i>

3
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:25,508
<i>One song can change your life.</i>

4
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:28,909
<i>Listening to my heart</i>

5
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,508
For God's sake, help me!

6
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:47,429
George, are you okay?
- Thanks.

7
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:51,548
What a mess, huh? Quite strong spirit today.

8
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:54,553
Be careful.
- Of course.

9
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:59,624
Would you like paper? You have to be informed.

10
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,832
Goodbye. Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:38,829
Danny, the obligations they cry. The toilet is clogged again.

12
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,720
Whose fault this time?
- My.

13
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:45,795
But you have to throw trash and clean the tables.

14
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,832
We will take care of.
- Thanks.

15
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,665
Give it.

16
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:18,509
Danny, welcome. Not much, but go well work again ...

17
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:23,472
I do not work weekends, but I lack staff.

18
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:29,510
In what should be here?
- Come later to 11.

19
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,630
Thanks, kid.
- Until tomorrow.

20
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:38,666
I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yes. Good night.

21
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:15,232
<i>Used recording kit $ 500</i>

22
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,869
A few more months.

23
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:25,987
How can you give a sweat-earned money used shenanigans?

24
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:31,903
What you spend?
- Tickets for the Knicks, the first row.

25
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,990
This is really something.
That's right.

26
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:39,912
What are you doing after the game?
- Going home.

27
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,866
With these "shenanigans" I can do something that will be forever.

28
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:46,904
People can listen to music for years.

29
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,945
Who are his shenanigans ever need him?

30
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:53,827
Anyway
- Seriously. This is a good question.

31
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:03,305
School of Music? You must be kidding.

32
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:10,952
Can I take your order?
- For her Caesar salad without croutons.

33
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:14,065
We will share the chicken parmesan.

34
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:22,545
Have you?
- Yes, it ...

35
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:30,224
Would you repeat that?
- Caesar salad without croutons.

36
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:36,747
And we will share with the chicken parmesan.
- Soup or salad?

37
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:40,145
You can choose soup or salad to chicken.

38
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,183
What soup?
- Chicken Soup ...

39
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:46,145
We'll take it.
- It will eat chicken.

40
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,663
And three cups of water.

41
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:55,150
I'll bring them, ma'am.

42
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,149
Can not take an order.

43
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,309
So good education is so important.

44
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:12,312
If they see Tony will kill you.
- Relax, I'll eat a few.

45
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:16,429
There will come a day when Tony will work for me.

46
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,349
I will buy this place and call it "When Roger."

47
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:27,505
Tasty Was?
- Very. Bill, please.

48
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,789
Sorry, forget it.

49
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:58,266
"Forget it"? Very clever, Danny.

50
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,982
<i>Every day comes a bunch of cute girls ...</i>

51
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,521
... And you stop at one.

52
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:25,819
It is different.
- Do not call you.

53
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,630
Maybe he wants to wait a little? Is not this a rule?

54
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,630
Do not call the boy soon get his number?

55
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,623
The rule is two days.

56
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:43,788
Some girls call after three days.

57
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,428
I think, depends on their menstruation.

58
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,464
How long since?
- Almost two weeks.

59
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,708
You saw the girl two weeks ago?

60
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,064
I understand that after some time to dry, despair, and I am so.

61
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,182
But it's time to overcome.

62
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,461
Do you always eat like that?
- How?

63
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,739
You're here?

64
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,748
Why do not you call? Me to tell you.

65
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,668
I will not tell anyone. Do not like it, right?

66
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:05,468
And if you like, two weeks its been a long time.

67
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:11,778
This is not according to rule for two days, regardless of menstruation.

68
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,819
<i>He here?</i>

69
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:29,626
In the kitchen f.

70
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,061
<i>I'll call you?</i>

71
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:41,906
Would lead him.

72
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:52,860
It's here.
- Yes, but I must tell you something.

73
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,220
Come to eat?

74
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:06,020
Why did you come then?

75
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,977
Do not call.

76
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,188
<i>I have no phone.</i>

77
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,258
Why?

78
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,180
<i>I'm deaf.</i>

79
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:48,982
Mom's friend was deaf. I only know his name.

80
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:53,144
Can you give me your email?

81
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,980
You need a maid.

82
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,583
Or girlfriend.

83
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:18,505
We are going to the movies.

84
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:21,898
But she did not hear anything.

85
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:33,736
<i>Lip-read if you can. And if not, enjoy the view.</i>

86
00:10:33,787 --> 00:10:36,858
<i>So it is with other things in my life.</i>

87
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,062
Did you?

88
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:52,780
Try to talk. I'm sure they will understand.

89
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:00,144
Are you hungry?

90
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,876
Come.

91
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,105
Tell me about yourself. I know almost nothing.

92
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:49,698
Spaghetti with minced meat? And I have my favorites.

93
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:57,021
You can not drive? You can change this.

94
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,342
Music, but how ...

95
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,943
Sorry about your father.

96
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,976
Is there more?

97
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,134
And you're sweet.

98
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:31,133
How do you talk to people? With my family for example?

99
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:40,861
But how can they say what you want?

100
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:47,216
Why not with sign language?

101
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,660
<i>Mom did not allow me to teach him.</i>

102
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:00,861
So you do not know how?

103
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:14,093
<i>Attended normal school, so I better read lips.</i>

104
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:17,215
Learn sign language when I grow up?

105
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,616
Very cute doing it.

106
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:28,060
Let me show you something?

107
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:38,462
That is why I work here. I play every day.

108
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,454
<i>Want to become a famous musician?</i>

109
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:49,976
No, but I want my songs to become famous.

110
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:56,136
<i>And then compose?</i>

111
00:13:56,263 --> 00:14:02,736
I learned to play the 12, and since then I write the songs himself.

112
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:08,218
Save for a demo, but I have much time to write.

113
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,936
<i>Must be nice to play the piano.</i>

114
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,537
No, everything is fine.

115
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,434
Watch.

116
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:43,095
You will play this part, and I with his right hand.

117
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,452
What do you say?

118
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:07,459
I know. But it was fun, right?

119
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:38,307
How lost your hearing?
- Meningitis is spent.

120
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:41,458
Her father also had it. Can not pay for treatment

121
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,386
and died before her eyes when she was 5 years old.

122
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,300
This makes me remember how my mother died.

123
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:50,611
I do not wish anyone.

124
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:54,296
So good to know you?

125
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:57,299
You have no idea.
- Seriously?

126
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,931
I spend the night with you?

127
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,460
Over and sent her to go there?

128
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,379
I have not slept with her.

129
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:12,336
What did you do then?
- We laughed, ate, talked about her.

130
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:17,501
Are you kidding me? How do you talk to her?

131
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,338
It was weird. You can learn sign language.

132
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,293
We have many things in common. She also loved music as a child.

133
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,058
I know you like her, but do not rush it a bit?

134
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,814
Any idea how difficult it is to communicate all day?

135
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:41,015
You'll learn sign language.
- You can not say anything.

136
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,255
In addition to her friends and get a bonus.

137
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,258
And so I'm Diana.
- Chattermouth.

138
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,140
I'm saying that you think better.

139
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:58,177
Make him consider things.

140
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,698
I will not give up something beautiful just because it can be difficult.

141
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,332
You look wonderful.
- You too.

142
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:27,458
What do you eat?
- Halibut sounds great.

143
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,738
Sorry, it says ... Spaghetti with minced meat?

144
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,773
Sweetheart, this is a chic restaurant.
- No, no problem.

145
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:48,340
How can you afford such a place?

146
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,248
Sorry, but her mother would ask at this point.

147
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,336
I work hard.

148
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:01,768
What do you do?
- Waiter am.

149
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,049
Her mother would not approve.

150
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,973
Only transfers until I am ready to meet with the family.

151
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:18,371
I doubt it will get there.

152
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,172
I do not like wine?
- Never drank, silly.

153
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:36,257
Even wine?
- This will appeal to her mother

154
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:59,291
Wine like.
- Accumulating points towards the family.

155
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,743
Give alcohol to their daughter.

156
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:07,772
She is 21 years old and never drank, even birthdays.

157
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:11,783
Never has rules and sex. Will take away her virginity and you?

158
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:17,768
Keep the reins too tight. Do you go without it?

159
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:21,730
This is called defeat.
- It will not happen.

160
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:25,495
You know your mother would not approve it.

161
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:28,575
Is large enough to solve alone.

162
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,573
Ready?

163
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,336
Welcome to the official party for your birthday!

164
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:51,335
People Ariana turned 21 today!

165
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:02,815
Really your birthday?

166
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,369
Already has.

167
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:51,252
Goodbye.

168
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,206
You're drunk.

169
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:07,927
What is it?

170
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:10,807
Are you okay?

171
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:26,334
Are you okay?

172
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:30,014
I'll take you home.

173
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:35,174
My house is quite small and reigns mess.

174
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,092
Are you sure?

175
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:57,175
Come on, drink the entire cup.

176
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:19,691
Put this on.

177
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:55,453
Time for sleep.

178
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,530
Good night.

179
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:30,563
Good night, Princess.

180
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:58,886
Good morning, sunshine. This is for you.

181
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,898
Congratulations on your first hangover.

182
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:06,846
Evidence for a great birthday.

183
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,488
Answer the following philosophical question:

184
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:24,400
If a tree falls in the forest and no one around to hear

185
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:28,410
will issue a sound? How do you think?

186
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:31,622
Come on.

187
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,883
Mr. Walker.

188
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:39,895
Sure, it sounds made.
- How do you know?

189
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,927
Tree falls, then sound.
- But nobody was there to hear.

190
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:50,644
So, if you let off and no one will release it sound?

191
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:55,003
You will hear, and smell.

192
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,880
You back.

193
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:06,965
Depends on the definition of "sound". Is it physical or mental.

194
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,681
If you define sound as natural,

195
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,535
there will be vibrations in the air.

196
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:21,566
But the sound can be thought. In this case there is no vibration,

197
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,765
and the way our brain interprets sounds.

198
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:32,885
If we consider sound as a physical concept, the tree will produce a sound.

199
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,438
But if you look like a mental concept, there is no sound.

200
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,861
Great.

201
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,722
It is so obvious, right?

202
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,327
In any case, she would not hear it.

203
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,727
How do I hear?

204
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,507
Are you okay?

205
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,005
Everything okay?

206
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:41,638
Attend two courses together. I'm Nicole.

207
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,639
You did great.

208
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:54,561
Pay no attention to Mitch, he is badass.

209
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,568
But on this subject will not be calling anymore.

210
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,278
Come here.

211
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,598
Let's go inside.

212
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,440
This is my mother.

213
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,525
Died 4 years ago.

214
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:55,004
Every day I hear how people complain about minor things.

215
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:59,119
I was with her all the time.

216
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,755
All five years, while struggling with cancer.

217
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:11,687
Not once did I heard her complain. But I did it.

218
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:19,087
Waking up in the morning, saying: "What a great day to live."

219
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:27,363
I watched her I said that there must be paradise.

220
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,319
I saw it in her smile

221
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:37,716
He was always beside me, still here.

222
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:49,971
This is her favorite sweater.

223
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:53,966
Sometimes I take it in her hand and she gives me strength.

224
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:08,522
Of course.

225
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:25,165
Your father is also a composition?

226
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:38,804
It's nothing.

227
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,644
Can I try?

228
00:31:57,886 --> 00:32:00,035
Near E.

229
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:08,999
Loved his father, right?

230
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:20,404
Sam? So I call you father? I like.

231
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,395
Sam's name do you like more?

232
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:33,759
Very beautiful, Sam.

233
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:34,073
Sounds good.
- Sorry, I did not know you're here.

234
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:38,123
Did you wrote it?
- Yes, just killing time.

235
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:42,123
How about to make a small concert here?

236
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:45,116
Will play songs, you will invite your friends.

237
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:48,009
Are you sure?
- Let's try.

238
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:51,002
Music can be beneficial for business.

239
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:59,158
Good night.
- You too. And thank you.

240
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:42,035
What would you do with Danny in the summer?

241
00:34:42,923 --> 00:34:45,835
What is it?

242
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:50,035
Not a packed suitcase. When will they take?

243
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,435
Leave for two weeks? What if your mother know?

244
00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:07,675
I'll miss you.

245
00:35:20,723 --> 00:35:22,793
That was Mom.

246
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:25,712
No problem.

247
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:34,278
Like it?

248
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,595
What is it?

249
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:46,674
Do not worry about it.

250
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:52,801
I should not say it to you, but it very seriously.

251
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:59,241
"Seriously?" What do you mean?
- Love is to the ears.

252
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:05,597
Speak with sign language.
- Use sign language?

253
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:33,011
You see? Was it scary?

254
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,911
Job Interview? Where?

255
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:44,040
Why do you want to intern in an accounting firm?

256
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,913
This is nice for certain people

257
00:36:49,961 --> 00:36:53,954
but I know you long enough and I know that this is not your dream.

258
00:36:54,121 --> 00:37:00,593
Seriously? Always wanted to play with numbers?

259
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:10,909
What then? What dreamed as a child?

260
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:20,793
I knew it. What went wrong?

261
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,833
Why not play before a large audience?

262
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,999
Wait. This does not mean you can not play.

263
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,877
Look at Beethoven.

264
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,992
You can do anything you want.

265
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,275
What is wrong with my lifestyle?

266
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,392
Do not tell me.

267
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,030
You know what I think? I think that fear.

268
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,150
Indeed, fear is.

269
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,034
Not from your mother, or Marianne, or anyone.

270
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,118
Afraid of myself, afraid to be yourself.

271
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:10,039
Life is too short to live for others.

272
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:28,829
You can not destroy their future. There disability.

273
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,875
<i>Are you there, dear?</i>

274
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:49,750
<i>Sorry about yesterday. Can I come with you?</i>

275
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,290
<i>I had to leave.</i>

276
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,151
<i>What do you mean?</i>

277
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:01,239
<i>Last night they came to take me.</i>

278
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:03,908
<i>I will be away almost all summer.</i>

279
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:10,075
<i>You would be here two weeks? Where go?</i>

280
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,889
<i>Europe. I gotta go. I'll be back next month.</i>

281
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,472
<i>Month? At least I will write it?</i>

282
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:20,733
<i>I love you.</i>

283
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,751
Greg, you know that Arianna is here?
- I'll check.

284
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:37,950
Last night is gone, will be absent all summer.

285
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:42,790
Are you sure?
- They left in 23:27.

286
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:50,557
Thank you.
- Enjoy the summer.

287
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:01,108
This is the last time you hiding something from me.

288
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:06,030
More will be meeting with him, talking or even thinking about it.

289
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:10,937
I have not raised to do with a waiter.

290
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:15,396
You'll get it in the autumn, when you start school.

291
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:28,993
Hide it. And silence again if something will look for another job.

292
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:15,188
Discard it. And everyone else.

293
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:37,275
<i>I do not know how to tell you, but I met another. Forget about me.</i>

294
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:07,041
I read the email.

295
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:11,194
Sometimes I forget how hard it was before.

296
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,708
Not properly celebrated 21st birthday.

297
00:42:15,755 --> 00:42:20,771
Give me another chance. What do you say we go for a dress?

298
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:42,354
<i>Nicole, how was your vacation?
- Great, I was with my parents.</i>

299
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:51,034
<i>Hear you Sam? When he returned from vacation?</i>

300
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:53,908
<i>What holiday?</i>

301
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:01,707
I do not know what happens. Does not correspond to my messages.

302
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:04,827
Is it online?
- Do not you see?

303
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:07,800
Will she rang the home.

304
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,624
So you know where you live?
- Were you I would not ...

305
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:14,711
I worry. I have not seen her for over a month.

306
00:43:14,754 --> 00:43:17,792
I do not want to lose her. Please.

307
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:59,511
Ariana is not here.
- I Sam.

308
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:03,388
And it is gone.
- Still on holiday?

309
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:17,433
She does not want to see you.
- Leave her alone to talk.

310
00:44:21,754 --> 00:44:24,711
Do not you want to see me?

311
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:36,279
I don't get it.

312
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,549
Security.
- You must leave.

313
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:41,305
We will leave when she tells him.

314
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:49,643
Throw this man from my home.

315
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:07,342
Get out.

316
00:45:32,673 --> 00:45:37,592
This is Richardson family. Henk, a colleague of David.

317
00:45:37,627 --> 00:45:41,585
And this is Tyler, his successful and handsome son.

318
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:44,544
You flatter me.

319
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:48,551
Nice to meet you.

320
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:56,591
Arianna, why not divorce Tyler around?

321
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,590
I will make coffee for me and Henk.

322
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,347
Do not go.

323
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:46,902
Not yet.

324
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,861
I do not know what it is, but wants to be alone for a while.

325
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:26,780
Sorry, sometimes it takes time to relax.

326
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:33,383
It's nothing.
- You're so nice.

327
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,543
Once again, thank you.

328
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,641
Goodbye.

329
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,462
Do not you dare make me so ashamed again!

330
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:19,622
You forget.

331
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:22,867
Sometimes feelings to someone, but not mutual.

332
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,386
You can not change it.

333
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,267
Do not want to hear, but outside is full of girls.

334
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,301
You'll meet someone suitable.

335
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:44,180
I'm sure it is appropriate.
- No, not when they are evaluated.

336
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,269
Who always tells me that everything is good?

337
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,261
Sometimes it is difficult to see things that way.

338
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:59,715
<i>Think about great songs that you wrote.</i>

339
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:05,506
There is no better inspiration than love ... and pain.

340
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:39,702
Probably does not make sense, but I will ask Sam to come?

341
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:42,661
Would mean a lot to me.
- Will come.

342
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:22,548
<i>"I'm sorry, but I met another. Forget about me."</i>

343
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,664
<i>Did you wrote that?</i>

344
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,619
<i>This email address does not exist.</i>

345
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:56,296
I did it for your own good. Do not want to create ties with this person.

346
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:59,305
One day I will be grateful.

347
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:05,864
I had to discard them. Take care.

348
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:33,223
Mrs. Scott, with Ariana want to go shopping before the film.

349
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:43,702
Enjoy.

350
00:52:02,026 --> 00:52:04,062
More are coming!

351
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:07,371
We need chairs.

352
00:52:07,506 --> 00:52:11,099
Below is more. This is great!

353
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:06,403
Congratulations. I sat back. It was incredible.

354
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:11,422
Thank you. I'm glad you came.
- Sam really wanted to be here.

355
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:14,349
I really tried. The bus stop ...

356
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:18,297
I do not want to hear. Is large enough to solve alone.

357
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,054
If you want to be here, would come.

358
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:25,815
'll Talk to him.

359
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:41,215
If you still want to do a concert, just tell me.

360
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:44,142
Turnover has almost tripled.

361
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:47,096
You have a golden voice, kid.

362
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:17,853
We want chicken wings for an appetizer, and four cups of water.

363
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:25,301
Excuse me, sir.

364
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,381
The service here is great.

365
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:35,860
What are you doing?

366
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:40,782
Everything is fine. It is usually very sweet.

367
00:55:42,983 --> 00:55:45,374
Get in the car!

368
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:48,193
Climb in the car!

369
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:54,295
Arianna, God!

370
00:56:35,661 --> 00:56:39,742
Her mother does all that. I swear it is the foundation of everything.

371
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:43,702
Sam slapped her, all they saw.

372
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,627
Sam is devastated. Coming after you.

373
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:49,778
I still love you.
- You had to forget

374
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:55,871
because it is full of girls?
- Forget it, I was wrong.

375
00:56:57,102 --> 00:57:01,061
Perhaps you are right, maybe Sam is really appropriate.

376
00:57:01,102 --> 00:57:06,937
Have something most can only dream.

377
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:09,986
You can not deny it.

378
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:13,980
Went in this direction. Maybe go with you.

379
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:18,577
Whether ...
- Run!

380
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:21,333
I will take your change.

381
00:57:22,261 --> 00:57:24,752
Do not let it go!

382
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:41,252
<i>I love you.</i>

383
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,020
<i>We found out that you gave up your hearing aid operation.</i>

384
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,819
<i>About 65% of undergoing such an operation,</i>

385
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,932
<i>can hear sounds, voices, even music.</i>

386
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,488
This will permanently damage your ears.
- My ears have been damaged.

387
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,533
How dare you take such a decision without telling me?

388
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:21,494
Life is mine and I want to hear. You want to control me.

389
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:26,928
So do not learn sign language and interpreter have that stupid.

390
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:35,492
That's why you never told me about this type of operation.

391
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,013
Do not want to hear, because you will lose control over me.

392
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,417
Well, I just lost it.

393
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:49,298
More I do not need a translator.

394
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:53,379
And you do not need me.
- I needed you more than ever.

395
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:58,255
Who will they last? That loser? Who will pay for college?

396
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,451
I will not go back to college. I will study music.

397
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,616
Always been dreamer, like his father.

398
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,664
That's right.

399
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:13,648
Because dreams come true, Mama.

400
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:16,770
Dad knew it.

401
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:21,654
Do everything to prevent me, but I'm in love.

402
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:26,255
Again, you hear and play, just like Dad.

403
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:30,812
And there's nothing to prevent me!

404
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:39,334
Where are you going?
- To correct an old mistake.

405
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:43,291
She is 21, slightly relax the reins.

406
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:50,851
If you climb into this car, I fired.

407
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:52,910
Leave.

408
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,851
Marian, come back. My daughter can not even drive.

409
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:05,696
You want a beer?

410
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:10,612
Every day you buy a newspaper?

411
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:14,734
And every night you throw?

412
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:18,650
Ever read it?

413
01:00:20,098 --> 01:00:25,013
Why buy it then?
- The seller is nice.

414
01:00:25,058 --> 01:00:29,973
"The seller is nice"?
- Yes, George.

415
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:38,332
Instead of begging on the street, it sells newspapers.

416
01:00:38,378 --> 01:00:43,497
Nobody buys a newspaper from a man like him.

417
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:50,454
Buy in store or kiosk.

418
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:54,817
But in the end, is the same newspaper.

419
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:05,776
The same, eh?

420
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:10,890
Is there a sports page?
- I do not think.

421
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:14,725
Entertainment?
- I have no idea.

422
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:18,769
I will use it for something more useful.

423
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:21,267
Play nice water.

424
01:01:21,737 --> 01:01:23,854
Seriously.

425
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:37,810
The stock market dropped 300 points ...

426
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:58,327
Receives a sudden attack.
- I'll heal, right?

427
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:11,687
You are here.

428
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:34,052
Glad to see you.

429
01:02:40,015 --> 01:02:42,894
I am Dr. Fraser.

430
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:48,772
Fainting is caused by glioblastoma multiforme.

431
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:51,932
This is a malignant brain tumor.

432
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:58,291
This type of cancer difficult to treat. Especially if the tumor is inside.

433
01:02:58,335 --> 01:03:02,409
Chemotherapy can attach your condition for several months,

434
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:08,209
but in any case will reappear spread.

435
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:17,255
<i>There is one medicine that has not yet been tested as a lump ...</i>

436
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,180
<i>... And is not covered by health insurance.</i>

437
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:25,295
<i>It is very expensive, but can ...
- For how long?</i>

438
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,351
<i>Depends.</i>

439
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:33,211
<i>At this stage, can give you only a few months or even days.</i>

440
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:30,444
It is time for the next procedure.
- I'm done.

441
01:05:31,213 --> 01:05:35,331
Not yet, there are several therapies ...
- I'm done.

442
01:05:58,293 --> 01:06:04,333
When I was 10, my mother brought home a duck's nest eggs.

443
01:06:04,868 --> 01:06:10,873
Be looked after for some time, but not allow me to keep them.

444
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:16,287
I was very upset by them back,

445
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:19,449
but it was actually the best part.

446
01:06:23,132 --> 01:06:26,249
They no longer need me.

447
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:30,732
Once spread their wings were free.

448
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:32,982
Heaven is theirs.

449
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:41,321
After a year I saw a group of young ducks under the bridge.

450
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:45,285
Are returned each year.

451
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:51,124
Now there are only two.

452
01:06:57,572 --> 01:07:01,530
Danny, we will now guess what girls say.

453
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:07,486
Girls, what can be used more than once?

454
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:19,249
Are you ready?

455
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:22,642
Shoes.

456
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,376
Shoes!

457
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:28,882
I know your expensive taste.

458
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:32,121
You're wrong.

459
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,322
Good books.

460
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:39,084
Love.

461
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:43,803
Do not play it.
- What do you mean?

462
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:50,487
It comes to shoes, books or your favorite food. Something fun.

463
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:55,446
But love is something better.
- Should be fun.

464
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:58,562
We have fun.

465
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,086
Smile.

466
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:08,727
Next question?

467
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,448
Soon you will see her again.

468
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:27,449
It's okay, do not worry.

469
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,807
You know? I am the happiest man in the world.

470
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:43,329
How many people can boast that they have experienced true love?

471
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,487
They have found the love of your life?

472
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:51,686
Will you promise me something?

473
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,054
Whatever happens,

474
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:02,162
listen first to ourselves,

475
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,280
in his heart.

476
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:12,962
And make that transaction.

477
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:21,199
Why wait? I want to attend.

478
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:25,323
I want to be there when the world heard for the first time.

479
01:09:26,289 --> 01:09:29,167
I want to hear your beautiful voice.

480
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,325
You can hear it now.

481
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:44,318
I love you, Danny.
- I love you.

482
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:55,698
What do you do, Sam?

483
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:22,568
I'm going to eat. Can I get you something from home?

484
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:29,721
Under the bed is a shoebox. We'll bring you?

485
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:32,983
Of course.
- Thanks.

486
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:57,323
Tomorrow I will operate.
- Everything will be fine.

487
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:04,240
The nurse will come again?

488
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:15,764
And Roger?

489
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:19,878
It is for Diane.

490
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,886
So we are alone.

491
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,997
I love you.

492
01:12:39,206 --> 01:12:43,245
The operation lasted several hours, one day you will remain under observation.

493
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:46,331
Some patients say that after several years

494
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:51,462
signals associated with sounds that recall.

495
01:13:19,206 --> 01:13:21,421
Help me out here.

496
01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:24,163
Only a few hours, you must do something.

497
01:13:24,305 --> 01:13:27,322
Are you crazy? Will not happen.

498
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:42,935
It is unbelievable that we do.

499
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:51,885
See you there.
- What are you talking about?

500
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,843
First you walk.

501
01:13:54,885 --> 01:13:58,798
I want to breathe clean air.
- Minus 10 degrees F.

502
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:02,316
I'm fine. See you at the restaurant.

503
01:14:04,604 --> 01:14:06,840
Fresh air ...

504
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:21,398
<i>A few more months.
- For what is this bug?</i>

505
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:27,200
<i>What do you buy?
- Tickets for the Knicks.</i>

506
01:14:32,284 --> 01:14:35,089
Is that you?

507
01:14:35,124 --> 01:14:38,244
How are you?
- Better than you, you look terrible.

508
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:41,316
What are you wearing? Are you lost?

509
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:43,869
I have not seen lately.

510
01:14:44,004 --> 01:14:48,798
I was sick for some time.
- Do not go out in the cold.

511
01:14:50,204 --> 01:14:55,722
It's nice outside. A great day to live.

512
01:14:55,924 --> 01:15:00,839
How is business?
- Stagnant know how it is

513
01:15:07,884 --> 01:15:12,804
Gone for a while.
- With a girlfriend?

514
01:15:12,839 --> 01:15:18,639
Pretty girl f.
- No, it will remain here.

515
01:15:18,683 --> 01:15:20,753
Pity.

516
01:15:21,763 --> 01:15:27,873
I need something to read. Do you have papers for me?

517
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:34,002
Of course. You should be aware what is happening.

518
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:38,880
How do you want?
- I do not know. Around 500?

519
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:34,272
I was worried about you.

520
01:17:13,601 --> 01:17:16,513
You're a good friend.

521
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,627
Come on.

522
01:17:23,162 --> 01:17:25,653
I'll take you back.

523
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:32,959
Call a doctor immediately!
- Call Dr. Fraser.

524
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:36,118
Are you crazy? Cold could kill him.

525
01:17:37,762 --> 01:17:40,278
Put his oxygen mask.

526
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:05,532
Sorry.

527
01:18:06,401 --> 01:18:09,393
It was a good idea.

528
01:18:16,961 --> 01:18:19,277
It was wonderful.

529
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,788
Sam will soon be out of intensive care. You can see it.

530
01:18:36,641 --> 01:18:40,838
Why not?
- You look terrible.

531
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,273
You know, that does not care.

532
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,553
And do not look too bad.

533
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,118
But you sound bad.

534
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,272
I never had a brother.

535
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,270
Do.

536
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:27,957
I love you.

537
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:31,369
I love you, brother.

538
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:45,748
But care must be toilet is not forever closed.

539
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,191
Do me a favor?

540
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:59,191
Will you go to see how Sam?

541
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:14,955
That's love.

542
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:25,508
The answer in the game is love.

543
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:44,952
Do you know when Ariana Scott will leave the ER?

544
01:20:44,998 --> 01:20:48,070
And you are?
- Her friend.

545
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:56,838
What can you use consistently?
Don't mention it.

546
01:20:56,873 --> 01:20:58,929
Nothing.

547
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:04,996
<i>Her father died in her eyes It reminds me of my mother's death.</i>

548
01:21:05,798 --> 01:21:08,870
<i>I do not wish anyone.</i>

549
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:29,432
Danny would say that he lived a wonderful life.

550
01:22:29,957 --> 01:22:32,994
Considering where you live and work

551
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:36,351
Its hard to believe.

552
01:22:36,696 --> 01:22:39,955
But people who knew him well would agree with his words.

553
01:22:41,836 --> 01:22:47,777
Danny was only 24 years but lived more than

554
01:22:47,912 --> 01:22:50,948
some people succeed for life.

555
01:22:53,676 --> 01:22:57,715
Do not worry, you will cover replacement, brother.

556
01:23:10,596 --> 01:23:16,387
We are gathered to say goodbye to Dan ...

557
01:23:18,435 --> 01:23:21,428
You can call anytime.

558
01:23:31,796 --> 01:23:36,664
It is still strange to hear.

559
01:23:36,715 --> 01:23:39,593
And to hear her voice.

560
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:42,756
I do not know whether I like it.

561
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,554
You need time to get used to.

562
01:23:47,115 --> 01:23:53,532
When Danny got acquainted with you, it was love at first sight.

563
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:59,073
I tried to warn him when it became serious.

564
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:04,951
I told him it would be difficult. And that everything is unreal.

565
01:24:06,195 --> 01:24:09,153
I tried to quit.

566
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:13,232
You know what I said?

567
01:24:13,275 --> 01:24:18,189
He said he will not give up something beautiful just because it would be difficult.

568
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:25,663
If I had listened, we would not experience the most wonderful thing.

569
01:24:29,435 --> 01:24:31,504
I have something for you.

570
01:24:34,354 --> 01:24:36,390
From Denmark.

571
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:39,347
What is this?

572
01:24:39,395 --> 01:24:41,665
That's love.

573
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:46,104
Beware, Sam.

574
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:43,900
<i>Honey, I'm very pleased for you. This is the first day of your new life.</i>

575
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:46,951
<i>But do not take good things for granted.</i>

576
01:28:46,986 --> 01:28:49,242
<i>Listen to the world.</i>

577
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:53,939
<i>Is a wonderful place, and says many things. Now you can hear them.</i>

578
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:58,269
<i>Live a full life, Sam. The life that you have chosen.</i>

579
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:01,222
<i>Seems to me no longer, but it is not.</i>

580
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:06,345
<i>I'll be with Mom for a while but will come when you need me.</i>

581
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:10,743
<i>Love with all your heart, because you will find me where is love.</i>

582
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:14,783
<i>Where love will hear my music. You only have to listen.</i>

583
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,747
<i>I love you, Sam. Forever. With love Danny.</i>

584
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:48,824
<i>Music is powerful.</i>

585
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:54,496
<i>One song can change the mood, trigger a memory.</i>

586
01:31:54,697 --> 01:31:58,297
<i>One song can change your whole life.</i>

587
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:12,800
<i>In memory of Nicole, which every day was wonderful to live</i>
