We at me the paintings
of the wall let tremble?

6
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:04,508
Sounds nicely.

7
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:19,224
I am this way.

00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,898
You are apprehended.
You have the right be silent.

You see belabberd.

00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:09,737
Couple of money wolves.

Me does a fun.
Where do I leave that troop?

14
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:17,694
No idea, but remain nou quiet.
- I am hartstikke quiet.

15
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:22,219
Will we go to happy bar?
- That is nevertheless that tenttent tent?

16
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:27,660
A couple biertjes, what mokkels,
and we forget this all.

17
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,416
Sounds good, but I must firstly
my child pick up.

18
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:36,813
Are everything oké with him?

Then I can conclude, bright.

22
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,692
Here is ie. We have hamburgers
eaten with patat.

23
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,850
That is bad for him, Quick.

24
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:06,976
Quietly, Patrice.
It is my child.

25
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,698
Our child.

26
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:13,008
How does it go?
You see belabberd.

27
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,407
That hears I more often.

28
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:19,491
I need money, Quick.

29
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:22,376

It becomes time for n real job
so that you can your zoon look.

00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,604
Verdomme, Patrice. I work myself rot
and I become only afgezeken.

36
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:51,403
That regrets me,
but you understand me hè?

37
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,447
Care for yourself, Quick.

38
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,130
Marcus need you.

39
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,972

Why Quick? Make you then

45
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,808
Nou, little chance.

Very nice.

50
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:11,887
What is this?
- I hope that the name Quick...

51
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:15,039
...does not support everything what you do.

52
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,836
I bet for three mille.
- That is very much.

53
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:27,395

00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:45,441
Firstly the pellets in the gaatjes,
then we see, however, further.

57
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:58,520
Hé, those bitch have pecked my money.

00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,678
Is that your bitch?

61
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:25,119
My bitch only pinch of me.
But late her with rest.

62
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:28,512
Differently I make my bitch of you.

63
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:34,232
You have a large mouth.
Have you also play ball.

64
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:38,280
Yes, but I use

Nou, those have I certainly.

68
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:49,147
And I have missed everything.
- Like always.

69
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,624
I come within and five guests
feel to their chime.

70
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:55,991
They no longer go for the notes.

71
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:59,146
Hou concerning notes, oké?

72
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,474
There those bitch are.

00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:08,466
Do not move you, motherfucker.
- Are you here the boss?

74
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,989
This is maltreatment.
- No, this is maltreatment.

75
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:20,827
What have do you nou?
Gooi which bitch in the busje.

00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:17,064

premium hunters?
- I saw it to their badges.

80
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,932
I come for the manager.
- That cannot be disturbed.

81
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,663
Incredible. Bowl here.

82
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:19,618
How goes ie, boys?
- Keno, this is Neil Swift.

83
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:23,900
A year after the death of your father
I found a new partner.

84
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:25,700
Nicely, hè?

85
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:29,138
What goes the time nevertheless fast.
Before you the weet...

86
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,531
Why are you here?

87
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,575
An acquaintance of your?
- A knowledge.

88
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,209
They had an adjournment command.

89
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:44,339
She had be apprehended.
- Do you call that this way?

90
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,537
Recovery agent,
they only work for me.

91
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,658
I would zoeken better friends.
- Say that, however.

92
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,892
How does the matter go?
- I have a garage.

93
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,096
The tenancy has been cancelled
and the matter goes badly.

94
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,808
I must sell everything
and what differently zoeken.

95
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,698
Why don't you precede me to work?

96
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:07,214
As a manman man?
Nothing for me.

97
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:11,291
No, I zoek people
for the departmentdepartment department.

98
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,973
You know this wereldje.
And we are almost family.

99
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:19,176
And it deserves good.
- How much then?

100
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,966
We pay by klus, therefore how more
you do, how catches more you.

101
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:25,128
Money is money.

102
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:29,413
Boys, welcome in my world.

103
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,294
A guarantor generally lies
10 and the 30,000 dollars.

104
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,528
Many people do not have that,
thus they come at us.

105
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:43,608
We pay the guarantor and they pay
our for that 10 percents.

106
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:47,245
Couple, someone is released on guarantor...

107
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:52,529
...and promises for the judge
to appear.

108
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:55,288
If ie that does not do...

109
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:59,493
...to get going we the right him
to keep and deliver.

110
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,613
Succeeds that not within six months,
then we are our money lost.

111
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,491
And that is your task.
- Allemachtig.

112
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:15,282
Is that legal?

113
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:18,843
You zoekt therefore speurders.
- premium hunters, hè?

114
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:22,209
You determine part
of recovery team.

115
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:25,045
But this is the real work.

116
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,851
Therefore no papers,
no licenses...

117
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,924
Boy, the law does not appear behind us.

118
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,810
They see going our rather.

119
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:38,442
But the voortvluchtigen
have also nothing with the law.

120
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:44,765
For us they are frightened.
We are the end of the law.

121
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,082
These are you badges.
The office must your parts.

122
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,085
And what concerns the weapons,
choice enough.

123
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:07,081
This is Orin O'Connor, the manager.
Orin, these are friends of me.

124
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:13,326
Only leave our even.

125
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:17,766
But go just as.
This is Vincent and Mushroom.

126
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,998
Lead round them just as.

127
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:26,236
How is t with your leg?
- How is t with your eye?

128
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:33,762
According to me is that those guests
that jumped ounce.

129
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:36,520
It are friends of me, Orin.

130
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:40,884
We zoeken no friends,
but professionals.

131
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,356
We suffocate in the work.
- And our males fail.

132
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:48,234
Soon come there net this way much
bailiffs as customers.

133
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:52,364
We need aid.
- Soon we are the pineut.

134
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,915
We need men
that know the profession, no sukkels.

135
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,518
Quietly nou.

136
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:04,394
Quick are well.
He has grown up in this profession.

137
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:08,523
And he has many contacts.

138
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:14,920
Our ship is sinking, Neil.

139
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:22,070
Orin O'Connor, it regrets me.

140
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:25,234
But it is here rather hectisch.

141
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:31,433
Do you have experience with this work?

142
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,832
Can it be how with difficulty?
- I you once what to tell.

143
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,231
You are vriendjes of Neil.

144
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:43,670
And he thinks that you engage
a brilliant move is.

145
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,479
But what he thinks
me interests no pocket.

146
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,111
And it does not interest me also
what you did pappies.

147
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,511
I want none vriendjes,
I want hunters.

148
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,068
And as your errors make,
you go.

149
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,473
When can we can start?

150
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:18,391
Yes, he seems.

151
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:22,277
How mean you?
Isn't he t or?

152
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:26,673
I think of, however.

153
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,670
Keno, is that that vent or not?

154
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:33,716
Yes, I think it, however.
- How hot ie also again?

155
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:37,590
Carlos Hernandez.

156
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,706
Then we go.

157
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,948
Do you go along?
- This is your party.

158
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,509
The ageing, baby.

159
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,106
To be correct.

160
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:07,390
What is there?
- You are Carlos Hernandez?

161
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:10,068
What contract does you that?

162
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,862
I hate t
if they slam the door.

163
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,230
Do you hate that also?
I hate that really.

164
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,904
Four tellen.

165
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:43,668
Ladies, lustre.

166
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,539
No more geintjes.

167
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,819
I am your friend.

168
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,307
Everything under control.

169
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,378
I weet nowhere of.
- And now?

170
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,739
Bowl but just as here.

171
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:12,059
You seem my father, however.
- How old are you?

172
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:16,107
I make only a small film.

They threw me in the busje and said

Afterwards they let go me.

But I did not have that.

314

He threatened me
and my zoon to assassinate.

315
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:36,112

316
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:39,474

There nevertheless is a reward?

00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:47,230
That occurs sometimes.
- He can do no money matter.

00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,428
And yesterday evening we had
someone caught...

334
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:54,345

00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,700
It was a mistake, Neil.
- I can no longer tolerate this.

343
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:48,099
Foutjes are too much made
and they indicate all to you.

344
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:51,338
You accuse me of...
- Not at all.

345
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:56,942
Each time if I do not look at, happens there
something that we would no longer do.

346
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:02,459
I am still a partner.

347
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:08,542
Do you support me?

348
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:11,495
From the cradle to the sepulchre.

349
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:29,216
Franky, I am this way glad that you are there.

350
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:32,022
No problem.

351
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:35,018
How is vermiculation?

352
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:40,211
I am not such a pasta-liefhebberpasta-liefhebber pasta-liefhebber.

353
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:43,975
But the wine is nice.

354
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:49,091
Pasta is of the cornerstones.
Everyone loves pasta.

355
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:52,219
I become of it windy.

356
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,612
Vincent.

357
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:02,818
Jammer then.

358
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,495
Franky, the reason
why I have asked you...

359
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,891
...something that is me already
a week busy keeps.

360
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,688
Tell...

361
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:19,377
It seems that of my people
from time to time what skims.

362
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:22,178
Weet you which?
- Yes.

363
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:26,412
And it beautiful is...
He weet not that I the weet.

364
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:30,366
What must do I, boss?
- I want you recommendation.

365
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:35,334
My recommendation?
- Your wise words.

366
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:40,407
What would I do?
- What would do Franky.

367
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:47,729
I would put an example.
- Continue.

368
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:54,926
You firstly cover the floor with plastic,
for the schoonmaak.

369
00:36:55,096 --> 00:37:00,807
I would make steaks of the hufter.

370
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:04,365
Sounds bloodily.
- But there is that plastic for.

371
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:13,093
Ingenious. What still more?

372
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:20,091
Not immediately his head eraf.
Firstly a finger, then an ear.

373
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:24,452
And afterwards a foot. He must
as long as possible continue live.

374
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:31,290
Thanks for your recommendation.

375
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:40,122
I am glad that you yourself last meal
with me have wanted share.

376
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:45,047
You have heard t.
Make steaks of m..

377
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,326
It sounds best, however, dangerous.
- It is mainly paper work.

378
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,280
But we make there what.
And how does it go with you?

379
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,441
Well, however.
- And with Marcus?

380
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:21,522
Nothing particular.
Bowl, we will eat.

381
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:29,361
He is already this way large.
I have missed much.

382
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:33,077
I am glad that you have this done.

383
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,802
Thanks for the chance.

384
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,326
It goes all this way fast...

385
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,685
...that I the important things
sometimes forget.

386
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:49,520
Tel once up to ten, for papa.

387
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,961
Complete good.
- But will play.

388
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,841
I want keep it simple, Quick.

389
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:18,395
I hou of your, but further it is
all this way complicated.

390
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,839
We take the time.

391
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:38,234
It is bed time.
Welterusten.

392
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:33,550
Quick, Travian were exactly here.
- Tracy?

393
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:38,348
He thinks that I tell on m..
- Quiet. Quiet.

394
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:42,350
Can we can agree somewhere?

395
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:55,865
It became time.
- Hé, my life runs danger.

396
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:00,951
He catches his poen at King Snake
and ervandoor want go.

397
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:06,029
Who called there nou are King Snake?
- That is a restaurant.

398
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:10,313
In south, Lennox and Grand.
There does ie much matter.

399
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:14,627
How does it go?
- I want here as from.

400
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:18,833
He has threatened my child.
Who do nou does something like that?

401
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:22,384
Why you must be silent
concerning Travian?

402
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:27,469
He does matter with those guarantor boys.
He sits in the nests.

403
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:33,302
Just well on yourself.
- Traitress.

404
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:40,303
Them would have had say
that t a restaurant is.

405
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:42,509
Hou.

406
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:03,106
This pleases nothing me, Quick.
- Nothing to the hand.

407
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,307
I have a strange feeling.

408
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,588
That feeling which you get if your
for your balls it is kicked.

409
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,905
Do I do want know this?

410
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:32,341
Travian, Quick stand.

411
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:44,379
Is it correct?
- Yes.

412
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:46,265
Complete good.

413
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,902
Hou you look.

414
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,215
Certainly happy hour.

415
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:34,093
Do you have a day dish?
Or a menu card?

416
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:36,299
No menu.

417
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:41,261
Then I want what to drink.
- Nothing to drink.

418
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:45,938
I am in a restaurant and there
is eat nothing or drink?

419
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:50,257
Quick, they want us
here do not have.

420
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:54,495
Perhaps is ie there not even...
- Oké, what wants with you?

421
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:57,255
In a flexible way, of it hou I.

422
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,449
Shit. Police force.

423
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:05,011
Remain stand.
- We are no smerissen.

424
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:11,538
Why do you do that?
He saw my badge.

425
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,419
We are no smerissen.
- I weet nothing.

426
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,140
Quick, to let we go.

427
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,656
It cannot me make a difference what your
here do. We are no smerissen.

428
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:23,775
We, however.

429
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:04,575
Three months.
Three months supervise.

430
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:09,924
A complete expensive operation.

431
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,408
And very time-consuming.

432
00:45:14,535 --> 00:45:17,891
And then you come...

433
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:23,082
...and within five minutes
to draw you everything by the plee.

434
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,929
I want only one hapje eat.
- Then you now your bord has me.

435
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:32,170
You must come look at just as.

436
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:36,292
I am now busy
with Batman and Robin.

437
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,365
You must come look at really just as.

438
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:42,650
One minuutje.
- Is that, however, sufficient?

439
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:50,727
Very nice.
If I would examine your file...

440
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:58,162
...question I me finished
or there much can be laughed.

441
00:45:58,331 --> 00:46:01,801
What think do you?
- We want only Travian.

442
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:11,490
Go to house. Nice detective goes
game in your own buurt.

443
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,846
Groentje.

444
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:36,162
Fortunately I here hoef not to eat.

445
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,157
I will catch my spullen.

446
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:52,399
I come this way.
I must still what to do.

447
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:00,724
Weet you, it does not turn out better than expected
for your friend to be...

448
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:04,356
...but that am I.

449
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:08,761
I see you tomorrow.

450
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:24,236
This is you last warning.

451
00:47:56,442 --> 00:47:59,514
We had agreed
that you would be correct firstly.

452
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:08,393
I regulate this, however.
- You are not yet ready with me.

453
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:12,352
One days, Quick. One days.

454
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,553
Wild you me what questions?
- Who Travian Woods is?

455
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,389
He was you, five years suffered.

456
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,393
Malignant, aggressively, well instinct.

457
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,756
A profit maker, a hunter.

458
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:35,548
But he went wrong.
He became hebzuchtig.

459
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:41,276
I had redeem him.
- Badly blamed?

460
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:50,591
I am faithful, Quick. Not much
people know what faithfully means.

461
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:54,067
Neil weet it, Travian knew it.

462
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:58,196
Weet you what faithfully means?
- I know the value of a family.

463
00:49:00,717 --> 00:49:05,426
You are happy people.
- What have do you with Travian?

464
00:49:06,636 --> 00:49:10,185
We have all
lijken in the cupboard.

465
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:13,791
And Travian Woods clear them
for me.

466
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:16,423
Why does the FBI zoekt him?

467
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:20,827
Very malignant of your.
You can kick it far.

468
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:24,431
Perhaps with me.

469
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:30,544
But succeed firstly your own recommendation
and think for your family.

470
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:34,946
And you do not interfere with matter
that you contract nothing.

471
00:49:47,953 --> 00:49:50,182
Quincy.

472
00:49:50,352 --> 00:49:53,628
Or do I have say Mr. Knight?
- I am called Quick.

473
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:57,944
We were not this way glad
with that stunt in that restaurant.

474
00:49:58,112 --> 00:50:02,263
But I understand that your
about that does not want talk.

475
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:07,226
Late Travian Woods with rest.

476
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:10,110
He is dangerous, an assassin.

477
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:16,742
And I do not want that ie angry become
and assassinates people still more.

478
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,300
You do your work,
I do it mijne.

479
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,587
With which right?
- He can a guarantor pay...

480
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,422
...and we regulate that.
We have one rule:

481
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,184
If you do not go to the judge,
you gamble yourself right.

482
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:35,469
That code respects you also.
- Schei nevertheless with your respect.

483
00:50:35,629 --> 00:50:41,305
The observance of the law
means that you must serve the law.

484
00:50:41,468 --> 00:50:47,737
But you only serve yourselves
and your gangster mentality.

485
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:51,695
If you want our way,
veeg the streets then clean.

486
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:57,703
Package all those guests who use
have made of Article 8.

487
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:01,223
To as long as I continue do my work.

488
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:04,456
Mr. Knight...

489
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:09,416
There a day comes
that you come...

490
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:13,056
...that Travian Woods
not the type is...

491
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:16,934
...that your badge
by the knees goes.

492
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:21,979
Once zul necessary have your aid.
Belief me.

493
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:25,744
This zul still necessary have you.

494
00:51:27,864 --> 00:51:29,934
Belief me.

495
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:36,983
How old you are zoontje?
- Marcus are four.

496
00:51:37,144 --> 00:51:40,658
Go do ie already to school?
- Yes.

497
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:46,136
They become rapidly large, hè?
- Yes, very terrible fast.

498
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:04,009
Does it go?

499
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:07,014
Where are you busy?

500
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:11,730
He has given m. that.
He could have kidnapped m. also.

501
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:15,337
Did you pay attention then not to?
- I was surprised just as the other side.

502
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,378
I weet not which you this time
deceived have...

503
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,249
...but of my zoon
must keep off them.

504
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,457
And a beetje hawks
something does.

505
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,056
I hou of my child.
I give my life for him.

506
00:52:31,379 --> 00:52:34,052
I make to this an end.

507
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:38,258
And how do you will do that?
I know you, Quick.

508
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:41,410
I do not want that you are soon dead.

509
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:46,174
But happens as Marcus something,
I do not answer for mezelf.

510
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:53,930
But take on. That is nevertheless it
most important you imagine oneself yourself?

511
00:52:56,257 --> 00:53:00,250
Have you received my message?
- The next time finishes I you.

512
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:04,974
Is you it, Travian?
Answer.

513
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:17,570
We must talk concerning Orin.

514
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:22,844
Does that have now?
- You doesn't it see then?

515
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:28,294
Discharges, lost
files. He picks you entirely bald.

516
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,490
Orin and I cooperate for a long time.

517
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:34,124
Why I cannot me
with Travian Woods interfere?

518
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,730
If the guarantor forfeited is explained,
it has expired with your.

519
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:42,250
Then are you bankrupt
before you the weet.

520
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:51,772
For the death of your father
a this decent company was.

521
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:57,888
But since Orin has been there...

522
00:53:58,052 --> 00:54:01,044
...I am the control lost.

523
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:05,568
I knew that ie no lieverdje were,
but he deserves money.

524
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,767
Money...?

525
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:13,286
A cat in narrow...
- Neil, do you have then no back edge?

526
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:17,688
Our informant is a ex-vriendin
of Travian.

527
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,365
Them is paid
to keep its mouth.

528
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:26,126
The man threatens my zoon.
- Sits still much more.

529
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,162
Do you hear me, however?
The man threatens my zoon.

530
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:33,638
I can do nothing.

531
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:43,005
The best recovery agent
to be generally most dangerous.

532
00:54:46,088 --> 00:54:48,648
The toll of the celebrity.

533
00:54:50,848 --> 00:54:55,363
It regrets me that your family
concerned is.

534
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:58,166
It regrets me also.

535
00:55:20,805 --> 00:55:27,677
Oké, we have an operation
in the south.

536
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:33,123
It is a serious matter.
I want Woods and Jacobs.

537
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:42,954
Hopelijk it is important.

538
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:47,401
Since when convicts can
also persons apprehend?

539
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:50,600
That can not at all.

540
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:54,203
Orin O'Connor, alias Orin Wells.

541
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:58,991
Five years suffered been released
after a extortion matter.

542
00:55:59,162 --> 00:56:03,280
He becomes partner and manager
of Swift's Borgbureau...

543
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:07,353
...and vervolgens rents ie
Travian Woods.

544
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:15,317
The aware guarantor office
guarantor also its had paid.

545
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:20,273
Nobody weet where he is.
He was our aim...

546
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,069
...until we Mr. O'Connor
under the magnifying glass names.

547
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,312
And what happy are the end?
- O, it becomes still leuker.

548
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,108
Neil Swift, the other partner...

549
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:35,989
...previous year two is months
suspended, after a research.

550
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:41,950
They had for about ten millions
to guarantor stand...

551
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,350
...and only 2 barrels to premiums
pocketed.

552
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:50,591
Someone is therefore robbed.
- In the same trimester...

553
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:55,433
...a lot of money comes
on the account of Orin O'Connor.

554
00:56:56,397 --> 00:57:01,312
Therefore Orin rob its boss.
- It goes still further.

555
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:04,753
Travian weet something of him.

556
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:08,955
Why ie would him help differently?

557
00:57:09,956 --> 00:57:12,106
He weet something.

558
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:16,235
And this type solicits
to happen for years...

559
00:57:16,396 --> 00:57:19,990
...without there also but
something to done becomes.

560
00:57:20,155 --> 00:57:23,067
The constitution, there you remain as from.

561
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:26,272
If they were law servants,
them gekruisigd became.

562
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:29,029
But they can their pace go.
- Bingo.

563
00:57:57,592 --> 00:58:00,425
Your weet how t must.

564
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:06,426
But go as a large boy to
the toilet. I close the door, however.

565
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,098
Seize her.

566
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:41,983
Go sit.
- Fall dead.

567
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:46,820
I will ring the police force.
Marcus...

568
00:58:47,548 --> 00:58:50,187
Leave.

569
00:58:51,388 --> 00:58:54,698
I assassinate your. Marcus.

570
00:58:57,187 --> 00:59:00,543
God-far-stupid one, Quick.
I have said t.

571
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:04,382
Leave us.
Now Marcus are gone.

572
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:10,659
I call back him, however.
Have seen you who was?

573
00:59:10,826 --> 00:59:14,102
Marcus are gone.
How mean you...

574
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:17,622
How have you this

575
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:20,778
I would have had go simply gone.
I knew it.

576
00:59:22,465 --> 00:59:25,138
He is still a child.

577
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:27,739
He needs his medecines.

578
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:33,096
Medecines...
- That ie had not yet had.

579
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,421
If ie that rapidly do not get,
can die ie.

580
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:07,096
Do you do want talk?

581
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:14,579
Travian have kidnapped my zoon.

582
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,019
I have warned you.
- I have nothing speaking.

583
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,933
What can do you for me?

584
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:34,611
Oké, Quincy... Quick...

585
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:39,493
I need something. proof material.

586
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:44,458
I want Orin O'Connor.
- You must Travian have.

587
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:49,487
Travian assassinated during
overval a mother of two kids.

588
01:00:49,658 --> 01:00:53,367
The overval went wrongly because ie
under the influence of coke was.

589
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,967
O'Connor and Tracy Willis
paid its guarantor.

590
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:06,935
Where do you aim on?

591
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:09,850
Orin and Travian
to know each other for a long time.

592
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:13,372
They have lively
history...

593
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:17,051
...of extortion and swindle
behind the back.

594
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:22,528
Travian are the means,
Orin are the boss.

595
01:01:22,696 --> 01:01:25,163
No, you are mistaken yourself you.

596
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:30,773
How someone can as Orin,
that at a guarantor office works...

597
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:36,884
...in three years time a capacity
of clear two millions build?

598
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:42,928
Calculate t but and tell themselves
then where wrong the zit.

599
01:01:45,654 --> 01:01:50,568
I can interrogate Tracy,
but you must stand behind me.

600
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:57,367
As Tracy helps us,
then I will do what I am possible.

601
01:01:58,573 --> 01:02:00,847
On my word.

602
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:04,606
I need you aid.

603
01:02:04,772 --> 01:02:10,324
Thanks to your I sit here.
You said that I could trust you.

604
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:13,767
Where are Travian?
- No idea.

605
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:20,448
But I am possible there achterkomen.
- We must lure him from his tent.

606
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:25,728
I can get you,
but then you must do something for me.

607
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:31,886
Everything. I want.

608
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:38,359
What is there?
You would continue stand at that door.

609
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,928
That joch moans.

610
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:44,959
He moans.

611
01:02:52,088 --> 01:02:54,397
How go do ie?

612
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,758
A piece improves as Marcus is.

613
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:04,326
That nasty feeling of me...

614
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:08,767
That is gone.

615
01:03:08,927 --> 01:03:13,158
There I am glad for, Keno.
- Perhaps I will get used to this.

616
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:28,562
Delta...
- Here delta.

617
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:30,681
Eagle...

01:03:30,845 --> 01:03:32,801
Fox...
- Here fox.

619
01:03:34,165 --> 01:03:37,713
Our aim is very hostile.
Indicated alert.

620
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:44,720
Aim identified.
East side.

621
01:03:44,884 --> 01:03:47,000
Clear.

622
01:03:49,443 --> 01:03:51,752
There she is.

623
01:03:54,683 --> 01:03:57,436
Where is he?
- No idea.

624
01:04:05,922 --> 01:04:10,837
Would ie tipped be?
Perhaps we must...

625
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:14,277
We succeed your recommendation.

626
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:17,592
What is that then?
- Quietly.

627
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:22,270
Vehicle range.
- Clear.

628
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,791
Marcus, are you there?
Papa comes deliver you.

629
01:04:40,479 --> 01:04:42,913
Eagle, we want a herkenning.

630
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:50,271
Does a someone have herkenning?
There does a child in the vehicle sit?

631
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:54,991
Nothing.
- Waits for a herkenning.

632
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,394
Two adults.
- Is the Travian?

633
01:05:00,238 --> 01:05:04,196
No herkenning.
- Bowl, the time expires.

634
01:05:08,997 --> 01:05:13,707
Everyone to its carriage.
But no pursuit.

635
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:27,426
Me leaves.
- Sit remain, I said.

636
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,187
Why don't they apprehend him?
- No herkenning.

637
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:39,073
Then we would betray ourselves.

638
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:44,023
Aim on the motorway.

639
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,867
We are him lost.
- Gooi a heli in air.

640
01:05:47,034 --> 01:05:49,673
No authorisation.

641
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:55,942
We must deliver my zoon.
- Yes, but according to the notebook.

642
01:05:56,113 --> 01:05:58,343
There I was already frightened for.

643
01:05:58,513 --> 01:06:02,188
All carriages, to withdraw.
To withdraw.

644
01:06:02,353 --> 01:06:06,470
Quick, what does you? To withdraw.
- This is my only chance.

645
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:14,710
Prop pursuit.
- If I have m. to catch.

646
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:18,546
You bring living
of your zoon in danger.

647
01:06:18,711 --> 01:06:22,340
Stopper differently must apprehend I you.

648
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,105
But you do.

649
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:27,545
Keno, that thing sale.

650
01:06:50,389 --> 01:06:53,585
I am the zat.
Rule it.

651
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,787
Keno? Everything oké?
- Everything oké.

652
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,574
Now I become really sick.

653
01:07:57,983 --> 01:08:01,578
You must never
of two walletjes eat.

654
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,094
Keno, package the right-hand side.

655
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:56,932
Everything come good.
The ambulance comes this way.

656
01:08:57,098 --> 01:08:59,487
He shot down me.

657
01:08:59,658 --> 01:09:02,695
Bel an ambulance.

658
01:09:02,858 --> 01:09:06,816
Everything come good.
You are my gabber.

659
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,571
Bel an ambulance.

660
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:47,728
Marcus. Soon is ie dead.
- It comes good.

661
01:09:47,894 --> 01:09:50,613
What have do do I?
Are everything oké with your?

662
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,652
Yes, I am busy.
- Are where you?

663
01:09:54,493 --> 01:09:58,452
We need that deposition
to condemn Orin.

664
01:09:58,613 --> 01:10:01,286
Differently goes ie vrijuit,
also for assassination.

665
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:06,572
Carol, I understand you completely,
but its best friend is dead.

666
01:10:06,732 --> 01:10:11,123
He does not sit wait now real
on a verhoor.

667
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:14,523
And thereby I cannot m. also.

668
01:10:14,692 --> 01:10:18,367
I want exercise none very,
but differently I have no matter.

669
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:22,567
But count on me.
For this reason I deserve so much.

670
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:31,725
I must gone.

671
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:46,168
That was complete dom, Quick.

672
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:52,045
We must us
to the procedures keep.

673
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:56,918
And those have not been considered
by someone behind an office.

674
01:10:57,088 --> 01:10:59,682
We have deads now two.
And why?

675
01:10:59,848 --> 01:11:03,921
My zoon threatens die
and you come with something that I already weet?

676
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:12,155
We close the guarantor office.
You vriendjes Orin and Neil go.

677
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,761
It are not my vriendjes.

678
01:11:14,927 --> 01:11:19,363
We have enough proof
to lock up tijdje them.

679
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:23,314
But then we have
a witness necessary.

680
01:11:23,486 --> 01:11:25,602
And that are you.

681
01:11:27,886 --> 01:11:31,560
I only think of my child,
but there I you do not test.

682
01:11:36,445 --> 01:11:39,084
We must close a deal.

683
01:11:41,725 --> 01:11:44,602
We follow Travian
already a couple months.

684
01:11:44,764 --> 01:11:47,756
He frequently comes on the rangeerterrein.

685
01:11:47,924 --> 01:11:52,554
Or he is a going by train crazy persons,
or your zoon sits there.

686
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:58,400
It was perhaps not nice
doing business, but profitable.

687
01:11:58,563 --> 01:12:01,680
You must understand a couple things.

688
01:12:01,843 --> 01:12:05,313
I have protected you
and this is my thanks?

689
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:10,033
There a tropical range waits for me
and the time presses.

690
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:13,592
After everything what I have done...

691
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,718
The groeten.

692
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:19,761
As if they slam the door.

693
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:54,670
What stand do you here nou?
Make a round.

694
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:00,470
This money is of me and the money
in your portemonnee is of you.

695
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:07,951
He thinks that ie still
500 of me gets.

696
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:19,912
Where is my child?

697
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:56,673
Papa is there, Marcus.
Everything come good.

698
01:14:05,113 --> 01:14:08,264
Orin have told concerning your, Quick.

699
01:14:08,433 --> 01:14:12,141
You are the charge mail
that overal puts in its nose.

700
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:15,543
My zoon lets go
and you get me.

701
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:20,786
So much differences we not
of each other. Money, cupidity...

702
01:14:20,952 --> 01:14:24,102
But desiring to power
our perdition becomes.

703
01:14:24,271 --> 01:14:27,343
I could have stood there also.
- That can be regulated.

704
01:14:27,511 --> 01:14:30,548
But unfortunately is that not this way.

705
01:14:32,271 --> 01:14:34,579
Quick...

706
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,425
How fast are you?
More rapidly than a ball?

707
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,620
I do not think it.

708
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:46,340
How it feels if your weet
that you will die?

709
01:14:47,309 --> 01:14:50,301
One jolts to the trigger
and it is beyond.

710
01:14:52,469 --> 01:14:54,505
Say papa but gedag, Marcus.

711
01:15:57,784 --> 01:16:00,502
Look nou nevertheless.

712
01:16:03,943 --> 01:16:06,411
You must see yourself papa once.

713
01:16:23,421 --> 01:16:25,571
We are not yet ready.

714
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,611
That was for Keno.

715
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:29,530
And that was for my zoon.

716
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:39,127
First:
Orin adopt Travian Woods.

717
01:17:39,295 --> 01:17:44,892
A well-known offender who the right
gets someone to arrest.

718
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:50,730
A man who himself is guilty
were to extortion...

719
01:17:50,894 --> 01:17:55,251
...smokkel and committing
of an assassination.

720
01:17:55,414 --> 01:18:00,885
To that discover you with
criminal no deal can close.

721
01:18:01,053 --> 01:18:04,409
I am a matter man,
such as all matter men.

722
01:18:04,573 --> 01:18:10,728
And in my profession sale you
the largest good on ground.

723
01:18:10,893 --> 01:18:13,360
Freedom.

724
01:18:13,532 --> 01:18:17,366
In this profession you break down
you always on the border...

725
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:21,764
...between your idea of me,
the offender...

726
01:18:21,932 --> 01:18:26,004
...and truth.
And truth is:

727
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:29,800
You have me and my profession
created.

728
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:35,091
For a right
that has everyone.

729
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:39,004
Innocently is to
the opposite proved is.

730
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:44,927
I have gone wrong, but I have
also good things done.

731
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:50,925
The law is there lock up people,
the constitution offers our freedom.

732
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:54,798
And freedom is only truth right.

733
01:18:54,969 --> 01:18:57,847
When a guarantor has been imposed...

734
01:18:58,009 --> 01:19:02,081
...the convict falls
under the hoede of the guarantor meters.

735
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:06,685
They can apprehend him
and extradite.

736
01:19:06,848 --> 01:19:11,478
Pursue in another state
and at all times arrest.

737
01:19:11,648 --> 01:19:15,799
They can even
its house enter.

738
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:20,040
It is equal to the adjournment
a prisoner escaped of.

739
01:19:21,847 --> 01:19:27,603
I draw at these already your licenses
concerning this profession in...

740
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:33,636
...and summon you stop with
to pay and collecting guarantor money.

741
01:19:47,605 --> 01:19:52,678
I needed only the thermostat
to replace. That is then 80 dollars.

742
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:56,200
Thank you, however.
- Your receipt.

743
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,837

745
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:24,721
For someone who Quick are called,

Are you up to that point?

747
01:20:36,881 --> 01:20:39,155
Now, however.

748
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,599
Oké, I am up to that point.

749
01:21:08,678 --> 01:21:13,115
In September 1999
is appropriate California the state...

750
01:21:13,278 --> 01:21:16,792
...the legislation
concerning guarantor.

751
01:21:17,717 --> 01:21:24,873
Up to that time
there was only one law from 1873.
