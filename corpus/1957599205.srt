00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:29,696
(music)

00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:42,709
(music)

3
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:55,688
(music)

4
00:00:55,755 --> 00:01:08,701
(music)

5
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:21,714
(music)

00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:34,727
(music)

7
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:47,740
(music)

8
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:52,946
(music)

9
00:01:53,012 --> 00:02:00,687
(music)

10
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:10,563
(child squealing with laughter)

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:18,771
(voices, laughter)

12
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,175
Where is he? Where's daddy?

13
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,913
Daddy, daddy. Take my picture.

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,016
Oh Thorold, turn that thing off, I look terrible!

15
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,885
No, you look great, honey.

16
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,487
How about a smile? Lemme see.

17
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,090
Maybe after you're finished here,

18
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,925
you and I might jump in that tub.

19
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,560
Thorold!

20
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,262
Come on in.

21
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,430
Yeah, hold on a second, here.

22
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,366
Look who's here, Maggie. Come on up here.

23
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,967
Daddy!

24
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,269
Look into the camera with daddy, yeah...

25
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:58,545
(music)

26
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,914
Hi, Thorold. Merry christmas.

27
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,550
Say Merry Christmas to Daddy, Maggie. Merry Christmas.

28
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,518
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

29
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,319
What is it?

30
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,021
Teddy bear!

31
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,956
Show Daddy.

32
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,925
Look, Daddy.

33
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,792
Say Merry Christmas, Daddy.

34
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,828
Merry Christmas, Daddy!

35
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,464
That's great, wow.

36
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:23,903
(music)

37
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,441
(giggling, laughter)

38
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,711
Why can't we do this together, as a family?

39
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,447
We don't need church to make us a family, all right?

40
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,749
I'm gonna tell you one more time, honey. I'm not goin'

41
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,651
I don't wanna hear anymore of this bible stuff.

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,386
You wanna go? Go!?

43
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,823
Why can't you just open your heart a little? Please, Thorold.

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,460
We're talking about "eternity, here.

45
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,629
Smile, honey.

46
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,999
Daddy, daddy, come on, push me up to the sky!

47
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,541
Wendy?

48
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,678
(telephone ringing)

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,347
The Messiah had this to say.

50
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,517
My children, you are now ready for the day of wonders.

51
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,586
(telephone ringing)

52
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,021
Ready to take a giant leap--

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,623
(smacking down remote control)

54
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,759
(telephone ringing)

55
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,728
Stone.

56
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:35,008
(sirens wailing)

57
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:42,715
(sirens wailing)

58
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:50,423
(sirens wailing)

59
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,397
(fire extinguishers hissing)

60
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,558
I didn't do anything.

61
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,426
Hm?

62
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,127
Tell them I didn't do anything.

63
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,829
They know you didn't.

64
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,898
I wanna go home.

65
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,700
You'll go to the hospital first.

66
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,234
No!

67
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,203
Yeah, they're gonna check you out, make sure you're okay.

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,471
Where is everybody else?

69
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,739
Fortunately there was enough left in the

70
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,508
mechanism for us to isolate the frequency.

71
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,943
Now, I've put in a request to have it traced--

72
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,012
Agent Stone!

73
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,413
Satellite tracking just located the source of the detonator signal.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,982
It came from an abandoned warehouse across town.

75
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,051
Let's go.

76
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,757
The device that destroyed the bus was detonated from a suspected haters' hideout.

77
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,559
A S.W.A.T. team has been dispatched. The haters are

78
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,159
to be considered armed and extremely dangerous.

79
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,928
I don't get it.

80
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,730
Come on, Thorold.

81
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,998
They've seen the same thing as the rest of us.

82
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,935
Every nuclear weapon on earth gone.

83
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,571
Millions of people vanishing into thin air.

84
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,807
If Macalusso's not God, then who is he?

85
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,611
He's just some con man who saw what was goin' on and took

86
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,147
advantage of it before anyone else came to their senses.

87
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,850
And maybe he's an alien from another planet.

88
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,051
Maybe he is.

89
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,620
You know, ever since we were little kids,

90
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,057
you never believed in anything. At every puppet show,

91
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,026
you're looking for strings. At Christmas,

92
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,630
you're looking for Santa's footprints on the roof. Finally

93
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,800
you got all the proof you need, and it's still not good enough!

94
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,636
Maybe I'm not looking for God.

95
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,939
I'm just looking for my family.

96
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,477
Orders are to terminate. No prisoners, no dialogue.

97
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,166
(device beeping)

98
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,700
What's that?

99
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,235
It's something my buddy Willie Spino gave me to try out.

100
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,905
He does things with computers that would blow your mind.

101
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,074
Claims this thing can read human D.N.A. through solid concrete.

102
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,745
And sure enough, there's a bunch of them down at the far end.

103
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,059
(truck rumbling to a stop)

104
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,635
All right, I know you heard the order to shoot these

105
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,972
people on sight, but listen up. Nobody fires a single shot

106
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,676
unless they get the word from me, you got that?

107
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,110
Yeah, I got it.

108
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,613
Let's go.

109
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,894
♪ I will enter His gaze with thanksgiving in my heart, ♪

110
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,097
♪ I will enter His cause with praise ♪

111
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:23,102
♪ I will say this is the day that the Lord has made, ♪

112
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,707
♪ I will rejoice for He has made me glad, ♪

113
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,277
♪ He has made me glad, He has made me glad, ♪

114
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,015
♪ I will rejoice for He has made me glad, ♪

115
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,050
♪ He has made me glad, He has made me glad, ♪

116
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:42,822
♪ I will rejoice for He has made me glad, ♪

117
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,826
(clapping, cheers)

118
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,630
Amen, Amen, Amen Hallelujah.

119
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,632
Why are you glad, friends?

120
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,903
One reason. One reason: the truth.

121
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:03,042
Yeah, Praise god and then blow up the buses, huh? Nice touch.

122
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,711
Well, it's not the first time something was

123
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,281
blown up in the name of the Almighty.

124
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,816
Satan cannot win!

125
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,084
Hallelujah!

126
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,119
Amen...

127
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,520
Hallelujah!

128
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,055
And that's why they're trying to exterminate us.

129
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:20,660
Your job is to keep the faith, and to spread the truth

130
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:26,265
to whoever will listen. But I warn you, it won't be easy.

131
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,336
No sir, it won't be easy. Because they've all seen

132
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,441
Macalusso's miracles, well, I'm here to tell you today

133
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:40,146
that in God's world, seeing is not believing. No, sir!

134
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,882
That's satan's way of trickery.

135
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,853
In God's world, you must first believe it before you see it.

136
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,022
All right, here's the deal.

137
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,425
We're gonna load 'em all into the truck

138
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,393
and take 'em down to headquarters for questioning.

139
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,828
Whattya mean, take 'em down for questioning?

140
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,096
Our orders are to shoot--

141
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,097
We're takin' 'em down to headquarters!

142
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,632
Back off.

143
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,236
...that is why the bible says that only, only as a child

144
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,273
will you enter through the gates of heaven.

145
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,474
Hallelujah.

146
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,942
Hallelujah!

147
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,946
Do you know what that means? Do you know what that means?

148
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,081
I'll tell you what it means!

149
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,015
Go!

150
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,250
Get 'em up, now! Get 'em up, now!

151
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,452
You're all under arrest! Get your hands up!

152
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,120
Get up!

153
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,054
Get 'em up!

154
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,055
Get back!

155
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,423
We didn't do anything!

156
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,891
Yeah, back off, lady!

157
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,360
If it wasn't for him, you'd all be dead right now.

158
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,695
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd shoot every one of you.

159
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,865
Nothing. Not even a knife.

160
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,835
What do you expect? We're not criminals!

161
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:41,107
Not until worshipping the true and living God became a crime, that is.

162
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,908
Well, if the God you're worshipping is so full of hate,

163
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,144
he's got you blowin' up school buses, then maybe

164
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,880
it's time to re-examine your faith, preacher.

165
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,281
Load 'em up.

166
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,284
Time to get off the soapbox. Let's go, go now!

167
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:56,756
We didn't blow up anything! Can't you see we're bein' set up?

168
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,890
Don't waste your time--

169
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,893
Hold on a second. Set up by who?

170
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,828
Franco Macalusso.

171
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,131
And all his disciples who believe he's God.

172
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,267
And let me guess, you really believe he's the devil, right?

173
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,771
I guess he'd have to have horns and a red pointy tail for you to see it.

174
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,773
The bible makes it perfectly clear!

175
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,309
See Thorold, the same thing your wife was talkin' about.

176
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,311
And you know where that got her?

177
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,380
Gone, just like the rest of them!

178
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,883
It got her to heaven, young man.

179
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,552
I only wish we all could've seen the light before that day.

180
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:32,992
We are all guilty of believin' the same thing your wife believed.

181
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,461
I've heard enough, man. You deal with this.

182
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,330
Let me ask you somethin'.

183
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,466
Do you think your wife would be killin' children if she

184
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:46,539
were still here? If you would just open your heart.

185
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,241
Why didn't you let them shoot us?

186
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,544
You don't look dangerous to me.

187
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,049
If we're not dangerous, why do you think they want us dead?

188
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,352
They believe you slaughtered innocent children.

189
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,825
They know that's not true. They sent you here because of this.

190
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,595
I worked for the O.N.E. until a couple days ago.

191
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,898
I suggest you take a look at this.

192
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,568
Do it for your wife.

193
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,435
Let's go.

194
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,908
Move it! Go!

195
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:29,215
(alarm beeping)

196
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,951
Oh, no. They got the Davis group.

197
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,152
What about the CD?

198
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,321
We'll have to assume they got that too.

199
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:39,525
Poor Selma Davis. She was supposed to meet me here with it this afternoon.

200
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,028
Oh well, that's just great! Now what?

201
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,464
That CD was our only chance for seeing what the O.N.E.

202
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,433
has planned for the Day of Wonders.

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,568
It's okay, Jake. We'll just have to find another way.

204
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,103
It's okay?

205
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,405
We've been in this filthy dump for three months already.

206
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,607
There's not a soul out there that wouldn't

207
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,143
shred us to bits if they had the chance.

208
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,211
I mean, for heaven's sake, the crowds cheered

209
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,349
when they strung your boyfriend up on national television.

210
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,884
I don't think that "okay" actually describes our situation!

211
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,020
We can't blame them, Cindy. They don't know what we know.

212
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,922
They also don't know that Macalusso's having

213
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,124
everyone who disagrees with him killed.

214
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,160
All they see are the miracles.

215
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,195
Any luck, Ronnie?

216
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,899
I'm all set up on the O.N.E. personnel file now. I'll be

217
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,302
able to get in there tonight as a security guard. Without that

218
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,006
disk, though, I don't have a clue what I'm lookin' for.

219
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,575
Anything. Anything that can help us

220
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,645
figure out what these guys have planned for the Day of Wonders.

221
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,080
Because whatever they're planning, it's big.

222
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,982
And it can't be good.

223
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,984
Here, take a look at this. It's from a tape

224
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,586
I found at my grandmother's house.

225
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,091
We are living in the last days, friends.

226
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,961
We know it because of all the prophecies that are being fulfilled.

227
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,197
But it's going to get much worse.

228
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,199
In fact, do you know that there will be a time

229
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,570
when the devil rules over the entire earth?

230
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,706
He will be a super-deceiver.

231
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,076
And he'll try to let the world know that he is the promised

232
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:08,214
Messiah, the Prince of Peace of Isaiah 9:6.

233
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,382
And he will tell the world "I have come to save you

234
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,053
from destruction", and they'll believe it because he confirms

235
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:21,126
the peace pact for a period of seven years, in Daniel 9:27.

236
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,630
But he's not the Messiah. He's an impostor.

237
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:31,237
He is empowered and incarnated by Satan, Revelations 13:3.

238
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:36,041
And therefore the peace pact fails.

239
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,479
For the bible says "when they say 'peace and safety'

240
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,284
then sudden destruction cometh upon them as a veil upon a

241
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,922
woman with child, and they shall not escape".

242
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,459
These people don't look any more dangerous than my wife and daughter did.

243
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,628
Hey, I checked the satellite readout myself, okay?

244
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,264
The command that detonated that bomb came from this very building.

245
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,432
Well, maybe the detonator was on a timer, not the bomb.

246
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,602
Maybe somebody just placed it here long before these people got here.

247
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,672
No, no, that bomb went off exactly when the last kid got on that bus.

248
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,375
Whoever set it off had their finger on the button.

249
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,443
Wait a second, Niddy. You'd need some pretty sophisticated

250
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,346
equipment to pull that off, and I didn't see anything in there like that.

251
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,350
Okay, that's not our job. The bomb squad guys will find it.

252
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,487
Maybe only one of them did it, and the rest of them are innocent.

253
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,656
Yeah, and maybe the bomb was set off from a spaceship.

254
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,293
Look, don't let what that lady in there said to you play with your mind, okay?

255
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,529
(truck starting)

256
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,068
Just trying to keep an open mind.

257
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,437
Yeah, right. You're makin' a big mistake.

258
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,177
Do you hear something?

259
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,147
I didn't hear anything.

260
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:52,217
(device beeping)

261
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,452
What do you see?

262
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,120
It's a piece of junk.

263
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,755
(door banging open)

264
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:04,263
(machine gun fire)

265
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,035
(gunshots)

266
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,542
(machine gun fire)

267
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,154
Hey, stop!

268
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,356
(gunfire)

269
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,224
(machine gun fire)

270
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,293
(gunshots)

271
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,854
Sir, I don't know how they found us,

272
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,557
but we have two O.N.E. agents in pursuit.

273
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,425
Well, take care of it.

274
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,627
Yes, sir. We'll take care of it.

275
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,843
(body slamming on floor)

276
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,247
I took this off the other one.

277
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,184
O.N.E.

278
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:07,753
A detonator.

279
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,555
Yeah, what's that tell ya?

280
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,190
The haters didn't blow up that bus.

281
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,392
That's right. Gimme your cuffs.

282
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,296
He was talkin' to somebody on that walkie.

283
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,843
Drop your weapon!

284
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,480
Mr. Parker, I'm gonna have to ask you to drop your weapon!

285
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,348
Drop that weapon, now!

286
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,984
You're in way over your heads, my friends.

287
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,220
(gunfire)

288
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,593
(gunfire)

289
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,933
Who are you?

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,002
What are you?

291
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,340
I am servant of the Messiah. I'm here to help him rid

292
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,309
the world of anyone and everyone who stands in his way.

293
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,778
And now, gentlemen, that includes you!

294
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,715
(gunfire)

295
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,494
(grunting in pain)

296
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,504
Oh...

297
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,542
Aw, man...

298
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,584
Just don't give me a reason to shoot you.

299
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,522
Let's gol get in there! Now, get in there!

300
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,993
(doors slamming)

301
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,862
Please, you don't know what you're doing.

302
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,664
Not another word.

303
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,534
Dad, you're making a mistake!

304
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,611
I've got one more foz you, officers.

305
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,513
Dad, please! Please don't do this!

306
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,815
I have to do this!

307
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,350
Please, you don't understand!

308
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,485
I'm afraid I do understand, son.

309
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,689
And I'm doing this for your own good. These men can help you.

310
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,027
Last night, I found a bible in his room.

311
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,631
And this morning, I found him kneeling by his bed.

312
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,799
Dad, I was praying for you!

313
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,102
You've done the right thing, sir.

314
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,904
I wish it felt a little bit more like the right thing.

315
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,441
You're not the first father to turn in his son.

316
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,377
Probably half the haters in captivity have been

317
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,047
turned in by families, for re-education.

318
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,984
Son, I'm sorry. But you've gotta believe,

319
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:31,323
I'm only doing this because I love you.

320
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,329
Aw...

321
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,768
What are you lookin' at, kid? School's about to begin.

322
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,071
We'll have more on the hater bombing next hour.

323
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,407
This is WNN.

324
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,510
Well?

325
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,621
Sir, we have a rather large problem.

326
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,059
What large problem is that, Spencer?

327
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,861
The second agent, Thorold Stone.

328
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,964
It would appear, sir, that something went wrong.

329
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,535
Our reports from the scene indicate that- that things-

330
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,704
Spit it out, man!

331
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,208
He's not dead, sir. And he's gone.

332
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,444
Gone?

333
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,947
How can that be? I shot him myself.

334
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,452
I want Stone, and I want him dead.

335
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,122
Issue the order. Shoot on sight.

336
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,191
Yes, sir.

337
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:45,230
There's more, sir. We didn't find the disk at the haters' hideout.

338
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:51,503
You listen to me, and you listen very carefully.

339
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,140
The Day of Wonders is less than 72 hours away.

340
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,944
If that CD makes its way into the underground,

341
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,547
and those idiots manage to find out what's on it,

342
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:06,151
they'll do everything they can to expose the Messiah's plan.

343
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,552
I understand, sir.

344
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,222
No, I don't think you do!

345
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:14,025
If you did, you wouldn't be standing here snivelling.

346
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:18,997
You'd be out looking for the disk. And Thorold Stone.

347
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,505
But remember this.

348
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,008
I have come to save you, not just your earthly bodies,

349
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,878
as I did when I removed your terrible weapons of mass

350
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,916
destruction, but your heavenly bodies as well...your souls.

351
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:42,187
And in order to save your souls, I've had to remove those who

352
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:48,260
stood in the way. Now is the time for yet another step forward.

353
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:53,064
A step that will lead you into a world of wonders.

354
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:59,304
A world unlike anything you have ever imagined. Finally, those

355
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:04,209
things which, until now, have been hidden will be revealed.

356
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,579
We'll have more about the Messiah's message at the top of the hour.

357
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,082
In other news, O.N.E. officials are combing the city tonight,

358
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,586
looking for one of their own agents. Thorold David Stone

359
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:19,257
is suspected of several acts of terrorism and the murder of partner David Nidd.

360
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,794
Coming up on the international news, a look at the new Europe.

361
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,764
Not since the days of the holy roman empire...

362
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,967
This is WNN.

363
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,903
Coming up this hour. The incredible transformation of

364
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,706
the Middle East in the wake of the seven-year peace treaty

365
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,508
between Israel and her neighbours.

366
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,376
And construction continues on the Temple of Humanity

367
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:42,247
in Jerusalem, as One Nation Earth officials struggle to

368
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,116
ensure that the expected crowds can be managed.

369
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,920
But first, another haters strike has rocked the world...

370
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,525
...perfectly clear to anyone who's not too scared to open up a bible.

371
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,162
...see Thorold, the same thing your wife was talkin' about.

372
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,964
And you know where that got her?

373
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,099
Gone, just like the rest of them.

374
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,802
...it got us to" heaven, Thorold...

375
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,806
...the answer is on the disk. It's open to you...

376
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,074
...do it for your wife...

377
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,876
...drop that weapon now!

378
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,779
(gunfire)

379
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,987
(car horn honking)

380
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,613
(door opening)

381
00:26:48,773 --> 00:27:01,987
(sound of gunfire)

382
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:11,896
(sound of gunfire)

383
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,872
Now listen here, pilgrim.

384
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,242
There ain't room in this town for the two of us! Ha!

385
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,410
Whoa!

386
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,880
Who are you?

387
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:34,019
Thorold Stone. Friend of Nidd's.

388
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:38,857
A friend of Nidd's. Oh yeah, that's funny. 'Cause I heard you killed him.

389
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,459
I'm sure that's not the only lie you've heard today.

390
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:45,797
Yeah, and what makes you think I'm gonna believe you?

391
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,133
Because I need your help.

392
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,370
And my gun's real.

393
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,273
It's a good point.

394
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,843
(door clanking open)

395
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,927
Open the door.

396
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,869
You ready to meet your maker?

397
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:25,937
Let her go!

398
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,338
C'mon!

399
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,040
(gunshot)

400
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,375
No!

401
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,512
Daddy, no!

402
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:40,452
Good afternoon, Mrs. Davis. We haven't caught you at a bad time, have we?

403
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,986
Take her.

404
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,156
Let's go, let's go! Let's go, I said. Sit down! Shut up!

405
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,226
Shut up!

406
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,494
No!

407
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,895
Daddy!

408
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,400
C'mon kid, let's go! Let's go, shut your mouth!

409
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,535
Let her go, she's just a child!

410
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,605
Oh, not for long.

411
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:06,444
Susan...no...

412
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,182
Scrambled frequency modulation, double UHL conversion,

413
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,519
this is high-tech. This is very high-tech.

414
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,388
There's no doubt this is clearly an O.N.E job.

415
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:23,061
So the haters weren't responsible for any of these things.

416
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,930
The school buses, the orphanages, the old age homes.

417
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,332
Nothin'.

418
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,367
Why? One Nation Earth has always been completely

419
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,870
dedicated to peace and unity.

420
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,405
Why now? Why do they go to all this trouble to make us think

421
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,641
the haters did these things?

422
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,144
I don't know.

423
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,647
But if the O.N.E. is lyin' about the haters,

424
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,517
what else are they lyin' about?

425
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,154
Maybe even Macalusso's lyin' to us?

426
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,589
The Messiah?

427
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,226
Maybe you wanna back that truck up right now, okay?

428
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,595
I mean, what makes you think he knew anything about this?

429
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,430
Would you think I was crazy if I said

430
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,900
I thought they were from another planet?

431
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,868
I'd say you're nuts.

432
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,438
Well, I don't know anyone from this planet who's walkin' through walls.

433
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:12,043
One of the haters gave me this.

434
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,181
She said O.N.E. was trying to kill her over it.

435
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,083
Yeah, it's O.N.E. all right. What's on it?

436
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,352
I was hoping you could tell me.

437
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,026
How do I know I'm gonna regret this?

438
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,936
C'mon, baby. There we go, bing.

439
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,072
(tapping computer keyboard)

440
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,879
Hey, what's goin' on, here?

441
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,050
This is a top secret project I've been workin' on.

442
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,952
The haters had a copy of this?

443
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,220
What is it?

444
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,055
It's what the Day of Wonders is all about.

445
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,157
(tapping computer keyboard)

446
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,393
Aw, c'mon. What's the matter with you? This is my system.

447
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,430
This is my security system, how can I be locked up?

448
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,073
You know what this is?

449
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,041
No, I have no idea.

450
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,445
This is a new program for the Day of Wonders virtual world system.

451
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,447
It's the new program, but without a password,

452
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,115
there's no way I can run it.

453
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,650
Well, why do you need a password? I thought you wrote it.

454
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,118
No, no, not this.

455
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,387
I wrote the virtual reality package that runs this,

456
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,556
but I have no idea what it is.

457
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,227
It's like I built a VCR and this is some kinda top secret videotape.

458
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,270
(tapping computer keys)

459
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:49,240
What is the Day of Wonders? What does it do?

460
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,142
Nobody knows exactly.

461
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,678
Nobody knows?

462
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:58,316
No...you remember when I told you it was like a computer game?

463
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:04,722
I may have understated that just a little bit.

464
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:08,626
Hold on one second. I'll be right back.

465
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,034
It would seem we've chosen different sides, haven't we?

466
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,605
We are soldiers in a war that only one side can win.

467
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:27,245
I thought about joining your side once. I came this close.

468
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,480
But do you know what?

469
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,217
When God claimed to be the only God, that was a pack of lies!

470
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:38,323
We can all achieve godhood. He just doesn't want anyone to know it.

471
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:43,194
So let's try this one more time.

472
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,730
Did Thorold Stone become a believer?

473
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:50,068
Or does he still think this is all about technology?

474
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:55,273
I know you gave Thorold Stone that disk.

475
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,743
Your daughter told us all about it.

476
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,746
What have you done with her?

477
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:08,519
Oh, don't worry! She's not in any pain. Now.

478
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,755
No!

479
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,094
Now you see why I keep my curtains closed.

480
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,663
I'm tellin' ya, women will kick straight through

481
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,300
windows to be near a body like this.

482
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,769
We got stuff to do. Here, put these on,

483
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:30,108
and I'll show you what I cannot explain, all right?

484
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,809
You ready for this?

485
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,111
Yeah.

486
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,579
Let's do it.

487
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,903
Lotion?

488
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,141
Do I need it?

489
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:08,613
Not really. I'm just a big fan of ambiance.

490
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:18,289
Good thing you didnt come on nudist beach day.

491
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,158
How is this possible?

492
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,428
No it's not how It's who

493
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,897
Macalusso?

494
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:30,234
Amazing huh? This guy is so far beyond us

495
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,904
"it's like we've gone through a time machine

496
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,240
Look at me I've'been around computers'all my life

497
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:40,311
buv this is beyond even my wildest dreams.

498
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,650
If' had one of these, I'd never leave the house.

499
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:52,623
yeah if I have one of these I'd never leave my chair

500
00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:00,331
you know the onlt thing I cant have in here is my step sister

501
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,502
and my grandmother

502
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,873
if that were possable I'd live in here.

503
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,476
Lost loved ones?

504
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,311
Yeah.

505
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,786
Were you close with your grandmother?

506
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,923
Aw, no. Not really.

507
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,230
I was closer to my sister my grandmother she was a nut.

508
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:37,568
That gives both of us good reason to look at this stuff.

509
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:43,007
What do you mean? I thought you said Macalusso was lying?

510
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,610
Maybe he is.

511
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:52,016
Ane what if he is? What !about this? All this?

512
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:57,955
What about our families? What happened to our families?

513
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,998
This is amazing.

514
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:13,571
Yeah, so much for seeing is believing, huh? I mean,

515
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,908
you can't trust your senses when you're in here, Thorold.

516
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,546
Truly a world without consequences.

517
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,884
Hey, take a look at this.

518
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,588
(groaning)

519
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,534
Ow!

520
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,372
Go on. Take your goggles off.

521
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,311
Hey?

522
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,348
(laughing)

523
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,617
This is incredible.

524
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,754
So whatever's on that disk is something like this?

525
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,289
Could be.

526
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,458
I mean, it could be anything, but from what I've been able

527
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,728
to put together, it's gonna be a whole lot more than what I got here.

528
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,929
(bell ringing)

529
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,499
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, cowboy!

530
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,002
Hold on a second.

531
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:24,542
There you go. It's just a delivery boy.

532
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,514
(door clanking open)

533
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,617
Hey.

534
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,352
Hello.

535
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,821
William W. Spin-o?

536
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,222
Yeah, close enough. That's me.

537
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,558
Are you still the only occupant of this building?

538
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,560
Yeah, that's right. Just me and my dog.

539
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,562
I need you to sign for your Day of Wonders package.

540
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,497
Can I see your global I.D. please?

541
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,300
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry about that.

542
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,936
There ya go. Hey, you know, it's nice not just to be a

543
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,672
number anymore. Now I'm three numbers, a dash, five numbers,

544
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,908
another dash and seven more numbers.

545
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:03,848
So I guess this stuff's keepin' you pretty busy, huh?

546
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,151
Oh shucks, yeah. But they've hired a bunch of extra guys.

547
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,554
By this time tomorrow, every man, woman and child on the

548
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,657
planet will have a pair of these glasses.

549
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,493
Can't wait to see what the fuss is all about.

550
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,996
You and me both, pal. You and me both.

551
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,438
Now these are the real deal, Thorold.

552
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,675
When the O.N.E. computer transmits its signal at noon

553
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,944
on the Day of Wonders, these babies come to life.

554
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,080
And what the whole world's gonna be lookin' at is

555
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,416
whatever is on that CD.

556
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,884
Yeah.

557
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,952
And that CD belongs to some very dangerous people.

558
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,421
Now, Macalusso may not know anything about this,

559
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,557
but we know Parker does. And whatever he's got planned

560
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,160
for the world, I can guarantee it's not a walk on the beach.

561
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:54,999
There's gotta be a way to crack that code.

562
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,102
There is.

563
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,373
What is it, Agent Spencer?

564
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,842
Sir, someone has hacked into the Day of Wonders security system.

565
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,811
Who?

566
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,715
One of our engineers, sir, William Spino. He's on the phone.

567
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,517
What's going on, Spino?

568
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,686
Stone made me hack into the database,

569
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,121
but I gave him the wrong password.

570
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,389
Nice work, Spino.

571
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,024
I also got a tracking chip on him, sir.

572
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,559
Excellent.

573
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,162
Stay right there. We'll send some men down to talk to you.

574
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,532
Well? What are you waiting for?

575
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,768
Follow that signal and kill them.

576
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,169
Them, sir?

577
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:37,108
You heard me--them! Stone and Spino! No loose ends.

578
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,909
Yes, sir.

579
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,846
Disabling the security system gave me access to the

580
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,249
password files, but it also set off an alarm. Now they not only

581
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,885
know I did it, but where I did it from. So we're just gonna

582
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,187
have to grab whatever we can and get outta here.

583
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,691
We'll have to try and find someplace else to try this disk.

584
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,626
What do you mean, "we"?

585
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,628
Hey Stone, I know Parker, okay?

586
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,964
He doesn't like loose ends, and that's what I've just become.

587
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,435
Like it or not, buddy, you just got yourself a partner.

588
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,605
Actually, two. Come on, Elvis! Come here!

589
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,740
Attaboy!

590
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,977
What are you holding on to?

591
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,784
Don't you see you've lost? You've lost! God's lost!

592
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,286
Once you and every other Christian is dead or converted,

593
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,622
He'll have no reason to return.

594
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,657
He won't have anyone to come back for, and that's what the

595
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,659
Day of Wonders is all about!

596
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,796
You're gonna renounce Christ, or you're going to die!

597
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,799
Prophecy will fail, and we will win.

598
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,002
So save your life now. Renounce Him!

599
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,603
(loud slap)

600
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,872
What's wrong with you?

601
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,316
I can see him.

602
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,551
Shut up.

603
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,885
I can see him!

604
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,153
Silence!

605
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,724
He's standin' at the Father's right hand...

606
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:07,598
What have we to do with thee, Jesus, the Son of God?

607
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,535
Aren't thou come hither to torment us before the time?

608
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,741
Look, it's not gonna take those meatheads followin' a chip

609
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,845
too long to realize they're barkin' up the wrong tree.

610
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,681
Yeah, how we gonna find out what's on that disk?

611
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,882
I don't think we have much choice.

612
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,751
We're just gonna have to take it to the haters.

613
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,153
The haters?

614
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,288
Yeah, the haters.

615
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,359
Well, first of all, we'd never be able to find 'em.

616
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,695
Even if we did, what makes you think they'd talk to us?

617
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:42,967
Well, like my friend Quasimodo used to say, I got a hunch.

618
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,337
Hold it.

619
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,172
We got him on the screen.

620
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,675
(device beeping)

621
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,244
We've got him on the monitor, Mr. Parker.

622
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,445
Yes?

623
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,713
Must be trying to set up some kind of

624
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,215
electronic relay via the telephone system.

625
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,017
They keep stopping at every telephone pole.

626
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,652
Well, take care of it.

627
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,120
Yes, sir. Spencer out.

628
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,823
Look, my stepsister's a hater, all right?

629
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,058
I told you I lost her. I never said she vanished.

630
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,460
I mean, why do you think I even listened to you

631
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,795
when you told me the haters were bein' set up?

632
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,564
'Cause you got such a pretty smile?

633
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,767
Hey, there he is!

634
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,769
Let's go, boy!

635
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:26,143
Attaboy, attaboy. Come here, stay still. Here we go...

636
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,245
Let's get outta here.

637
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,582
Jesus said in John 15:18, if the world hates you,

638
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,319
remember it hated me before it hated you.

639
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,389
If you were of the world, the world would love his own.

640
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,991
But because you're not of the world, but I've chosen you out

641
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,362
of the world, therefore the world will hate you.

642
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,365
Remember the servant is not greater than his Lord.

643
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:52,169
If they persecuted me, Jesus, they'll also persecute you.

644
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,272
In fact, Jesus said in John 16:2, the time will come

645
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:02,613
that whosoever kills you will think he's doing God's service.

646
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,185
Hey. Any word from Ronnie?

647
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,454
No, no not yet. How about you? Anything?

648
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,989
The only way we're gonna find any answers is if we can

649
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:16,093
break into the O.N.E. computer system and find that disk.

650
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,995
And who knows where that could be?

651
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,363
I do!

652
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,165
Jake, no! Stop, it's okay!

653
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,232
(laughter)

654
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,167
Willie!

655
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,401
How ya doin', sis?

656
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:25,936
Oh...

657
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,404
The news said you were killed by some crazed lunatic.

658
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,374
Helen, come on, you gotta know better than anyone else

659
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,711
not to believe everything you hear on television.

660
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,780
Helen Hannah, the woman who denounced the Messiah on

661
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,117
national television, the world's most wanted fugitive and my

662
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,920
very dear stepsister, meet Thorold Stone,

663
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,789
the crazed lunatic that killed me.

664
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,025
Hi.

665
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,268
Um, we've got some left over salad, if you're hungry.

666
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,972
Salad, you gotta be kiddin' me. Don't you have some steaks

667
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,074
lyin' around here someplace?

668
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,744
Well, I'm vegetarian.

669
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah, well if God didn't want us to eat animals,

670
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,049
he shouldn't made them outta meat.

671
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,152
Oh, I'm not vegetarian 'cause I love animals,

672
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,521
I'm vegetarian 'cause I hate plants.

673
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:21,025
Yeah, well. I didn't work my way to the top of the food

674
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,528
chain to sit around chewin' on a cucumber.

675
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:28,065
Well, that explains a lot. Vegetables are brain food.

676
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,600
Ooh.

677
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,771
She's not only gorgeous, but she's rude and sarcastic, too.

678
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,508
And best of all, she can't see my shortcomings.

679
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,044
Tell me something, Cindy.

680
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,215
Where have you been all my life.

681
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,551
Mm. Well...

682
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,788
Aliens? Come on, Thorold?

683
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,090
Take a look around. I mean, it's not people who believe in

684
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,325
flying saucers they're sending to concentration camps.

685
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,328
It's people who believe the bible.

686
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,798
And how is it that your aliens happen to be

687
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,467
fulfilling bible prophecy in exact detail?

688
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,170
Well, maybe they're just doin' it to throw everyone off track.

689
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:12,109
Whoever it is, they have my wife and daughter.

690
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:16,547
And whatever it takes, I'm gonna find 'em.

691
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,483
You're gonna have to find God first.

692
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:26,523
No offence, Helen, but if I didn't buy God from my wife,

693
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,494
I'm sure as heck am not gonna buy it from you.

694
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,998
Why is the answer so difficult for you?

695
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,102
Other than the fact that my family just vanished?

696
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,471
Oh, I don't know.

697
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:44,942
They found peace, Thorold.

698
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,146
Peace.

699
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:54,384
Yeah. I hope.

700
00:45:54,451 --> 00:46:00,124
My mother taught me to believe in God.

701
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,592
She did. We used to pray together.

702
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,128
When I was seven years old, I used to kneel next to her

703
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,965
bed and pray with her. We prayed together,

704
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:14,505
while cancer ate away at her insides. And when the pain was

705
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:18,442
so much that she, she couldn't pray, well, I prayed for

706
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:26,450
the both of us. Prayed night and day. Right up until she was

707
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:35,125
65 pounds and her last breath just slipped out of her body.

708
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:41,965
65 pounds and her last breath just slipped out of her body.

709
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:54,011
I looked in face for peace. You know what I saw?

710
00:46:54,077 --> 00:47:02,920
I saw anguish. I got my answer.

711
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:09,126
There is no God.

712
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:12,496
You're wrong.

713
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:16,633
And you're making a big mistake.

714
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:22,339
You're both making a big mistake.

715
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:26,210
Hey sis, if a man speaks in a forest and there's no woman

716
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,380
around to hear him, is he still wrong?

717
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:35,252
Okay, you guys. Come here. The hardware's all set up.

718
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,425
We are ready to take an early look at the Day of Wonders.

719
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,096
Now, the password I downloaded opened the program,

720
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,199
but there's still one line encrypted. It shouldn't

721
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,169
stop me from runnin' it. I'll keep tryin' to crack that.

722
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,071
Sorry Cindy, but right now,

723
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:58,242
I wanna take this baby for a test drive.

724
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,611
(computer beeping)

725
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,982
Let's see what all this fuss is about.

726
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,585
Whoa!

727
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,490
Yeah, nice look.

728
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,396
Hello?

729
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,467
Hello?

730
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,171
Hey, some curtains would be nice!

731
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,510
Wow.

732
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,517
So this is the Day of Wonders. Wonder who's gonna lose his job over this.

733
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,459
Well?

734
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,063
It's nothin'.

735
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,366
What do you mean, "nothing"?

736
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,536
Try and picture the opposite of everything.

737
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,272
There's no trees, there's no beaches, there's no ocean,

738
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,710
there's, there's just nothin'. There's zero! There's zilch!

739
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:11,315
I'm sorry, there's absolutely nothing to this program at all.

740
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,849
No, there's somethin' to it, all right.

741
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,652
I suggest you get back in there and find out what it is.

742
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:20,624
What can I do to help, Willie?

743
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,194
You know what, sis? I think maybe you better just leave

744
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,196
this one to the professionals, okay?

745
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,598
Professionals built the Titanic.

746
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,368
Amateurs built the ark.

747
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,440
All right, lemme see if I got this right.

748
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,176
You believe that Macalusso, who the rest of the world

749
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,813
believe to be the Messiah, who has done nothing short of,

750
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:47,184
uh, supposedly saving the world from utter destruction is Satan?

751
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,488
Satan, okay. And everyone else who believed in God

752
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:52,689
before the vanishing--

753
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,157
The rapture.

754
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:58,829
The rapture. And all the others who believed in God before the,

755
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:06,737
the rapture, have found eternal peace and happiness in heaven.

756
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:09,806
Right, well, that's all fine and dandy Helen,

757
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,642
but there's just one thing. I don't believe in God.

758
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,645
Well, He's still God, whether you believe in Him or not.

759
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,647
Well, why doesn't He show himself?

760
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:18,849
He does.

761
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,651
No, I mean really. Really show Himself.

762
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,353
So do I.

763
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,324
Why don't you ask Him to do something, Helen?

764
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,126
To give me some proof.

765
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,627
Like maybe turn the page of this book,

766
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,597
or knock that glass of water over?

767
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,799
Well, if He did that, you wouldn't need

768
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,135
much in the way of faith, would you?

769
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,603
Why is it always about faith?

770
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,139
That's what my wife used to say. Faith, faith, faith.

771
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,409
It's all about faith. What about proof?

772
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,878
It's not all faith, Thorold. Far from it.

773
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,281
I mean, God says all you need is faith the size of a grain

774
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:55,385
of mustard seed. He'll do the rest.

775
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:59,689
But I want some proof. Some real proof. That's what I want.

776
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,727
No proof is enough if the heart's not ready.

777
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:08,365
What's that supposed to mean?

778
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,701
It just means that whatever God may do,

779
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,538
you won't believe it was Him anyway.

780
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:19,443
You'll always manage to find another explanation.

781
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,480
Another explanation.

782
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,716
Well, I have an explanation.

783
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,654
How's this for an explanation? There is no God.

784
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:36,893
I wanna see Him. I wanna see it. I wanna see this thing,

785
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,597
this thing you call God. I wanna see some real proof.

786
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,467
Knock over this glass of water, God. Knock over this

787
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,669
little glass of water right now, and I'll be a believer.

788
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,870
Come on!

789
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,405
Come on, God, make a believer outta me!

790
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,941
You couldn't save my mother from cancer when I was a kid,

791
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,409
and you sure as hell couldn't save my family from vanishing,

792
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,278
so why don't you just knock over this little glass

793
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,947
of water, and make a believer outta me!

794
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:00,817
How 'bout it, God? Make a believer outta me! Huh?

795
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,886
I guess He's not up to the challenge today, Helen.

796
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:07,357
Looks to me like Macalusso's the only one around here pullin' off miracles.

797
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,525
(bumping table)

798
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,529
(glass rattling on floor)

799
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,583
I'm not looking for God.

800
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,888
I'm just looking for my family.

801
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,733
Wendy...

802
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,806
You know what, Cindy? I wish this were the same old program I already had.

803
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,275
Why?

804
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,278
'Cause then maybe I'd get to take a peek at you in a bikini.

805
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,812
For heaven's sakes!

806
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,948
Talk about your Day of Wonders, huh?

807
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,416
Ruff!

808
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,385
(howling)

809
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,853
You're terrible.

810
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,489
Hey.

811
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:23,300
Right now, I'd give anything in the world to see

812
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:29,573
Wendy and my little Maggie. For just a minute.

813
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,975
What would you tell them?

814
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,012
That I love them.

815
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,952
Sounds to me like you've pretty much figured out

816
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:45,956
what's going on in this world, then.

817
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,458
What are you talking about?

818
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,461
I'm talking about God.

819
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:57,367
Think about it. Just like Maggie is your creation,

820
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,937
we're a part of God's creation.

821
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,473
Helen...

822
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,377
Thorold, think about Macalusso.

823
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,547
I mean, he claims to be our creator.

824
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:14,751
But at the heart of it, his message isn't about love it all.

825
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:20,924
It's, it's about power. And selfishness.

826
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,927
It's about having whatever you want,

827
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,664
regardless of the consequences to anyone else.

828
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,601
I mean, can you imagine sitting down and

829
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:36,506
telling Maggie that in the name of success,

830
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:40,777
she should kill anyone who stands in the way of her dreams?

831
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:46,750
Isn't that exactly what Macalusso is telling the world?

832
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:52,656
I'm telling you, Thorold.

833
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:59,696
It's the same lie the serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden.

834
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,732
Come on, Eve. Eat the fruit.

835
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,070
It won't hurt you. Look how good it looks.

836
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,507
You know you want to.

837
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:15,478
God's just afraid that if you eat it, you'll be just like Him.

838
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:20,717
And what was your God doing when all this was happening?

839
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,953
Just sitting there powerless?

840
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:35,031
Oh, no. He wasn't just sitting there. Far from it.

841
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,138
Now it's all in your hands.

842
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:47,844
God doesn't want to win you with cheap tricks.

843
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,814
He just wants you to reach into your heart and answer

844
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,419
one question: Do you believe in Him?

845
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,665
It's time for you to decide what you believe, Thorold Stone.

846
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,588
(computer beeping)

847
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,856
Hey.

848
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,158
You always carry a big stick.

849
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,894
Only when there are new slobs in the house.

850
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,863
Oh, great. Is this seat saved.

851
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,532
No, but I'm sure you guys are prayin' for it.

852
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,666
Oh...

853
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,602
Hey Cindy, let me ask you something.

854
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,771
Blind people always wear sunglasses, right?

855
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,073
How come deaf people don't wear earmuffs?

856
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,608
Willie, let me ask you something.

857
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,110
Do men in wheelchairs complain when you leave the seat up?

858
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,714
You, uh...you ever take those glasses off?

859
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,549
Ah, only to drive.

860
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,184
I'm trying to be serious, here.

861
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,720
I've never seen you without 'em, that' all.

862
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,555
Neither have I.

863
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:10,560
Do you mind?

864
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:15,165
Where are you?

865
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,846
Wow.

866
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:33,817
Well, I think you should definitely take them off more often.

867
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:38,087
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

868
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:42,959
Thanks...

869
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:48,698
So, what makes a nice girl like you become a bible-thumper, anyway?

870
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,700
Well, I was really an atheist, but you know,

871
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,335
they didn't have enough holidays.

872
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,038
Now, come on, I'm bein' serious, here.

873
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,841
I mean, look at the way you people live.

874
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:01,644
Hidin' out in this rathole, livin' every day in fear.

875
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,681
You must really believe this stuff, huh?

876
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,182
I'll tell you the truth, Willie,

877
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,351
I really don't know what I believe.

878
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,855
My parents used to drag me to church every Sunday.

879
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:17,694
I would pray for eyesight. Mom and dad vanished and Jake

880
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,765
here came to get me, well, what was I gonna do?

881
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:26,769
I guess you could say I just came along for the ride.

882
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,138
Aw, come on. Along for the ride?

883
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,107
I mean, I watched you last night. I saw you out there

884
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,610
prayin' and singin' with them.

885
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,144
Please!

886
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,346
Going to church makes you about as Christian

887
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:39,716
as going to a pet store makes you a cat.

888
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:46,356
You know? What about you, Willie? What's your story?

889
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,891
The truth?

890
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,792
No, lie.

891
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,295
Well, I still believe Franco Mcalusso is who he

892
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,965
says he is, the Messiah. And if I can just get to the

893
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:01,037
bottom of this whole program mess, I can prove that.

894
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,339
To the whole world.

895
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,777
For the last time, Helen, I don't wanna hear about it!

896
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,345
I've explained it to you so many times--

897
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,314
Thorold!

898
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,017
Oh, it's okay, guys! Wait, it's okay. We're all on the same side.

899
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,985
We're all on the same side.

900
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,788
Ronnie, how did you do?

901
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,357
A lot better than Selma Davis.

902
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,126
What do you mean?

903
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,863
I got this tape out of the security camera.

904
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,601
What are you holding on to?

905
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,804
Don't you see you've lost? You've lost! God's lost!

906
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,206
Once you and every other Christian is dead or converted,

907
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,142
He'll have no reason to return.

908
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,209
He won't have anyone to come back for, and that's what the

909
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,346
Day of Wonders is all about!

910
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,948
You're gonna renounce Christ, or you're going to die!

911
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,417
Prophecy will fail, and we will win.

912
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,887
So save your life now. Renounce Him!

913
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,295
So that's what the Day of Wonders is all about, huh?

914
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,398
Killing people?

915
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:07,070
How's he gonna do it? With some fancy computer game?

916
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,138
What about all the people he vapourized? He didn't say

917
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,275
anything about that. What's gonna happen to them.

918
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,078
He didn't vapourize anybody, Thorold.

919
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:18,715
God took them home. Your family's in heaven.

920
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,583
(static)

921
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,886
Special Agent Thorold Stone. I know you're listening.

922
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,122
I just thought you might be interested in some special

923
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,826
guests I have here, visiting me in my office.

924
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,128
It took some doing to get them here, Stone.

925
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,131
I hope you appreciate the effort.

926
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,000
Please don't hurt us anymore!

927
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,169
We don't know anything. I haven't seem him in months.

928
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:43,873
Mommy, why doesn't daddy come and save us?

929
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,742
I don't know, honey. I don't know.

930
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:50,880
Shut up, both of you. Unless you want more of the same.

931
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:55,318
Stone? You have one choice, and one choice only,

932
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,821
so you'd better listen to me very carefully.

933
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:02,191
I want to see you here, and O.N.E. headquarters

934
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,995
by 2:00 a.m. with the disk. Have you got that?

935
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,499
If you're not here by one second past two,

936
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,868
then they'll be the first ones to discover

937
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,971
what the Day of Wonders is all about.

938
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,845
Please don't hurt my daughter. She hasn't done anything. Please, you--

939
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,186
Thorold? Thorold.

940
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,955
You've got to listen to me, it's a trick.

941
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,158
Parker doesn't have your family. It's a trick.

942
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,528
No, that's my Wendy and my Maggie.

943
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:42,165
No, listen to me. He's done it before and he's doing it again.

944
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:48,337
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna take the disk to him.

945
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:53,843
But tell me, what do I do?

946
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:58,347
I'll destroy it. I'll destroy the Day of Wonders.

947
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,818
That's what I have to do. Will you help me?

948
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,319
Thorold--

949
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,221
Please, I need your help.

950
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,858
Please, will you help me.

951
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,226
I know how we can stop it, Thorold.

952
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,761
Willie-

953
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,296
Listen, Cindy, I don't know what Macalusso had planned for

954
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,932
the Day of Wonders, but Parker and his gang of dirtbags

955
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,501
obviously have some very different ideas.

956
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,971
Now look, the mainframe computer at the O.N.E. building

957
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,140
is the hub for the entire system, right?

958
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:28,544
If we could just upload a virus, that could infect every computer on the network.

959
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,946
Meaning?

960
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:33,015
Meaning that if it works, tomorrow afternoon when

961
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,251
the whole world puts on those goggles,

962
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,387
they won't see any more in there than Cindy sees out here.

963
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:42,125
And without me, they won't be re-writin' it any time soon.

964
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,494
But what about that line of encryption on the program?

965
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,062
I mean, are you going to destroy the Day of Wonders

966
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,563
before you even see what it is?

967
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,031
No, the computer's still workin' on that,

968
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,068
but I can guarantee you that that is not the answer.

969
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:55,104
Yeah, well how do you know that?

970
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,940
Thorold, remember that day we went walkin' on the beach?

971
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,075
Yeah.

972
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,343
Yeah, you remember that seashell?

973
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,544
Yeah.

974
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,411
Yeah, well that single seashell was made up of

975
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,613
almost 4,000 lines of code.

976
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,149
We're talkin' about one line, here.

977
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,018
I'm telling you, whatever they have planned for the day of

978
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:13,022
wonders, it's not on that disk. And at noon tomorrow,

979
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,424
the whole world's gonna put on those glasses,

980
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,594
and find themselves in the middle of who knows what.

981
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,164
Yeah, well we don't have until noon tomorrow. So let's stop

982
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,901
wastin' time talkin' about if, and start talkin' about how.

983
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,369
I got a plan.

984
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,437
Look, the O.N.E. cleaning staff comes in at around 11:30, right?

985
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:32,909
I can access the security computer and get Thorold in there as a janitor.

986
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,977
Oh yeah, right. Like they won't notice a new face.

987
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:40,049
No way. That place is huge. About 5,000 people walk by that security desk every day.

988
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,250
Well, let's do it.

989
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,219
Are you going to be able to find the V.R. lab?

990
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,420
Shouldn't be a problem as long as the

991
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,688
files Willie pulled are complete.

992
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:47,223
Now, the challenge is gonna be the alarms.

993
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,692
This notepad contains all the info you're gonna need to

994
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,260
deactivate the alarm system, but once you're inside

995
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,795
you're gonna have to hurry.

996
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,064
Now, if you come to a fork in the road, Thorold, take it.

997
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,033
Oh Willie, everything's a joke to you.

998
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,601
Thorold?

999
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,204
Godspeed.

1000
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,706
I told you, I don't believe in God.

1001
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,709
It's okay.

1002
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:10,146
He believes in you.

1003
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,585
Man, I just... I don't know what else I can do.

1004
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,689
There is just nothin' in there, Cindy.

1005
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:22,458
I guess we'll just have to wait to hear from Thorold.

1006
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,628
And this stupid line of code!

1007
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,966
I mean, it's only one line. What can it possibly say?

1008
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,502
Then why did they go through all this trouble to keep you out?

1009
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:40,076
I guess I better call Thorold before he gets inside.

1010
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,478
Thorold?

1011
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,648
Yeah, here I am, I'm doin' fine.

1012
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,984
I'm about three minutes out. How are you doin'?

1013
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,518
Yeah, no problem.

1014
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,388
I'm just checkin' to make sure that whoever you are isn't

1015
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:56,993
gonna be on duty tonight. Yeah, okay, your name is

1016
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,996
Bill Rowesome. You're workin' the night shift.

1017
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,064
Now, you take your radio with you, but whatever you do,

1018
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,767
do not transmit once you're inside.

1019
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:09,405
You wait to hear from me. Love you, baby.

1020
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,945
(fumbling with goggles)

1021
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,080
Here.

1022
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,350
Still blind.

1023
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,625
How ya doin'.

1024
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,668
Go ahead, Mr. Rowesome.

1025
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,541
I'm going to be in a critically important meeting,

1026
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,511
and I don't want to be disturbed. Is that clear?

1027
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:10,232
(computer beeping)

1028
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,468
(electronic theme playing)

1029
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,537
Yes, we're in!

1030
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,805
What?

1031
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,006
That line of code. It's finally cracked.

1032
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:20,509
Now we can see what all this fuss was about.

1033
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,079
No, you can see what all the fuss is about.

1034
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,448
I can only hear about it.

1035
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,359
Hello.

1036
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:41,430
(footsteps)

1037
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,380
Ah!

1038
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,181
What?

1039
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,185
What?

1040
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,388
My god.

1041
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,289
What?

1042
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,892
Oh my God, I can't believe it. This is impossible!

1043
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,427
What, Willie? What?

1044
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,829
My finger! Look at my finger.

1045
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,030
Very funny.

1046
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,298
This has nothing to do with technology,

1047
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,468
I don't care what's in that line of code.

1048
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,137
Helen!

1049
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:46,195
All right, here we go. "Cross white wire with yellow wire"...

1050
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,531
There is no yellow wire.xpppx

1051
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:17,560
Ronnie?

1052
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,028
Yeah?

1053
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,496
Oh Ronnie, thank God you got my message. Listen, Willie's

1054
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,363
cracked the code, you better get back here right away.

1055
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:26,502
Do you really need those things?

1056
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:30,406
Hey sis, listen, any wimp can quit smoking, okay?

1057
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,741
It takes a real man to deal with lung cancer.

1058
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,844
Well, at least wait until I'm out of the room.

1059
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,045
Okay, fine.

1060
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,681
Listen, Helen, it just doesn't make any sense.

1061
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:42,384
I mean, there's nothing in there but images.

1062
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,820
Whatever we're dealing with here, it's not just technology.

1063
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,890
There's something else.

1064
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,293
Helen, what's wrong?

1065
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,396
Images.

1066
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,699
That's it, images.

1067
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:44,713
Speak to the world as you spoke to Eve,

1068
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,616
let the Day of Wonders begin.

1069
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,820
When she plucked the apple from the tree,

1070
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:55,791
let the Day of Wonders begin.

1071
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:00,696
Let each man see his heart's desire,

1072
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:04,300
let the Day of Wonders begin.

1073
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:09,071
And believe our path will take him higher,

1074
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,741
let the Day of Wonders begin.

1075
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:17,846
The real wonders are pride and greed,

1076
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:22,985
let the Day of Wonders begin.

1077
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:27,723
And those shall be our apple tree,

1078
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,327
let the Day of Wonders begin!

1079
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,964
(alarm beeping)

1080
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:44,907
Welcome to the Day of Wonders.

1081
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,809
Willie!

1082
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,664
Oh...

1083
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,833
(gasping)

1084
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,003
Oh!

1085
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:25,914
(crying)

1086
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:32,154
Hello, Cindy. Congratulations. You are the very first

1087
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:37,793
to participate in the Day of Wonders.

1088
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,928
My eyes!

1089
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,930
I can see you!

1090
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,600
That's right, Cindy. You can see.

1091
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,737
You can see. Look, all around you.

1092
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:56,512
You can see the blue sky. You can see the beautiful sunsets.

1093
01:11:56,578 --> 01:12:02,685
From now on, you'll be able to see everything,

1094
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:07,990
not just in here, but out there.

1095
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:12,161
Your voice. You're the Messiah.

1096
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,531
That's right.

1097
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:18,000
There's nothing to be afraid of. Give me your hand.

1098
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,668
No...

1099
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,070
Give me your hand.

1100
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,673
There's absolutely nothing to be frightened of.

1101
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,608
Come on.

1102
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,911
Look.

1103
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:33,449
Oh...

1104
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:39,154
No, but I wore the goggles before and I couldn't see this.

1105
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,590
No, but today is the Day of Wonders.

1106
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,993
Everything that you see is real.

1107
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,762
(sobbing)

1108
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,731
All illusions have been shattered.

1109
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:49,898
This is real.

1110
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:50,999
Yes!

1111
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,534
I am real.

1112
01:12:52,601 --> 01:13:00,075
All you have to do, Cindy, is trust in me. Believe in me.

1113
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:05,047
And all of it shall be yours.

1114
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:09,685
But I do! I believe in you! I do, I do...

1115
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,755
Then renounce him, Cindy. Tell the son of man

1116
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,891
that he has no place in your heart,

1117
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,894
that he has no place in your life. Tell him

1118
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:23,499
that you have tasted of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

1119
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,634
(gasping)

1120
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:34,977
Tell him, Cindy. And then, pledge your allegiance to me.

1121
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:39,848
Take my mark.

1122
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:51,226
Worship me as the one true god.

1123
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:55,631
I do.

1124
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,700
I do! Oh, I do!

1125
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,938
(sobbing)

1126
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:06,074
Yes!

1127
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,178
This has gotta be what the Day of Wonders is all about.

1128
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,552
It's coming, my friends, and coming very soon.

1129
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,220
And when it does, you'll know that you're living

1130
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,190
in the darkest days of the great tribulation.

1131
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,960
The antichrist, the devil incarnate, will deceive

1132
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:28,764
the whole world. He will come as a man in peace,

1133
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,834
but he will bathe the world in blood.

1134
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,603
The antichrist will have supernatural power,

1135
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,806
power to give life to the image of the beast, and the image

1136
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:41,977
of the beast will live and speak. The antichrist will

1137
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,247
kill every person on earth who will not worship

1138
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,784
the image of the beast. He will cause all the people

1139
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,654
of the earth, both small and great, rich and poor,

1140
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:56,592
free and bond-servant, to receive the mark on their

1141
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,127
right hand or on their foreheads.

1142
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:03,866
Without that mark, no man will be able to buy or sell.

1143
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,237
"And let him that hath understanding count the

1144
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:11,273
number of the beast, for it is the number of a man

1145
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,979
and his number shall be six hundred, three score and six."

1146
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,148
Oh, 666!

1147
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,117
Hey, you know what? I live at 668, maybe I'm the

1148
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,386
neighbour of the beast. That would explain that

1149
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,823
strange smell comin' from Mr. Apelbi's garbage.

1150
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,224
Willie, this is not a joke.

1151
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,760
Aw, come on, Helen, get a grip! This is real life,

1152
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,161
not a horror movie.

1153
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,130
Yeah, well I'm afraid it's about to become one.

1154
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:39,268
You said it yourself, Willie. The Day of Wonders is all about images.

1155
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,703
Yeah, whatever. We don't have time for this right now.

1156
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,974
This is incredible, Cindy. I don't know how it works,

1157
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,076
but unless we can stop it, Parker's plan to kill all of

1158
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,178
the haters might actually become a reality.

1159
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,313
I need to talk to you.

1160
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,447
Okay, can you just hold on a second,

1161
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,216
I gotta find out where Thorold is.

1162
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,417
It is really important.

1163
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,185
Okay, can you just hold on one second, please?

1164
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,987
No, it is really important!

1165
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,056
All right, what is it?

1166
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:04,393
That is the ugliest shirt.

1167
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,795
Yeah, well those...

1168
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,798
But...

1169
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,868
How?

1170
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,046
Willie?

1171
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:28,450
Hey, Elvis, it's okay, look, it's just Willie.

1172
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:29,651
It's just Willie.

1173
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,954
You know, sis, I've been thinkin'.

1174
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,089
If Thorold doesn't get that virus uploaded,

1175
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,092
we might need to warn the others, and right now,

1176
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:40,262
you're the only one who knows where the other hideouts are.

1177
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,730
I can't do that, Will.

1178
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:47,002
Helen, a halo only needs to fall a few inches to become a noose.

1179
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,705
Well, thanks for the encouragement, Will.

1180
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,007
Helen, I'm serious. I really think you

1181
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,143
should tell me where the other hideouts are.

1182
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,713
I can't do that, Will. You know I can't.

1183
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:02,718
No, you can. And it's okay, Helen. I'm on side now.

1184
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,454
I found God.

1185
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,057
What? That's wonderful, Willie. When?

1186
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,360
I mean, when did this happen?

1187
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:15,397
Just now. I finally saw the truth.

1188
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:21,470
Was it worth it, Willie? Was it worth your soul?

1189
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:26,141
Cindy! What happened?

1190
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,276
I saw the light, that's what happened.

1191
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,813
I guess now we know what the Day of Wonders is all about.

1192
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,316
Oh God, no.

1193
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,085
Oh God, yes!

1194
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,221
Put it down!

1195
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,990
Any time now.

1196
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,760
Get over there.

1197
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:49,831
Sorry, sis. He made us an offer we just couldn't refuse.

1198
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,266
No.

1199
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:55,170
No, Willie. How could you?

1200
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,173
How could you? You, you knew all this!

1201
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,278
I mean, how could you know this was gonna happen and fall for it anyway?

1202
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,783
"How could you? How could you?"you're so stupid!

1203
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,919
Thanks to Thorold and that CD, Cindy and I got a sneak preview

1204
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,790
of the Day of Wonders. And I'm tellin' you, sis, it is the

1205
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,793
greatest thing that ever happened to me.

1206
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,261
Ain't that right, Cindy?

1207
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,363
Oh yeah. I've been hanging with you bible-thumpers for

1208
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,466
three months now, and I haven't seen one single miracle.

1209
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:29,905
But now I've found the true God. And now I see everything.

1210
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,541
But the price. Willie

1211
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:37,446
Save your breath, Helen. It's no use. Their souls are gone.

1212
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,015
And once you take the mark, there's no going back.

1213
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:41,450
Oh yeah, that's right, Helen. You know,

1214
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,485
you're preaching to the perverted right now.

1215
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,154
Listen, once the world checks in to the Day of Wonders,

1216
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,989
we're gonna have a whole lotta company.

1217
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,825
All right, that's enough talk, now.

1218
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,961
Just tell us, where are the hideouts?

1219
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,063
I'd rather die.

1220
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,032
Well, that can be arranged.

1221
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:02,571
You know something, Helen? I shoulda shot you a long time ago.

1222
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:07,175
Do what you have to, Willie.

1223
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,046
(gunshot)

1224
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,115
(crashing on floor)

1225
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,351
Helen, what's goin' on?

1226
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,986
Get back in the car!

1227
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:25,861
(dog barking)

1228
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,095
Lie down!

1229
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,598
(dog barking)

1230
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,100
(gunshot)

1231
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,936
Good doggie!

1232
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,566
Thorold.

1233
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:09,437
I wouldn't be doin' this if it weren't absolutely necessary.

1234
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:13,575
The virus will not work unless the program is running.

1235
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:18,280
I repeat, it will not work unless the program is running.

1236
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:21,149
Now, find the V.R. goggles, put them on,

1237
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,119
and spend a couple of minutes in V.R.,

1238
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:28,323
and then you can come out an upload the virus.

1239
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,859
Good luck, my friend.

1240
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,499
That was perfect.

1241
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,430
Wendy. Maggie.

1242
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:12,367
Welcome to the Day of Wonders, Thorold Stone.

1243
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,569
I've been waiting for you.

1244
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:23,211
Ron, nige work. Got the big fish, Helen Hannah.

1245
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,213
I'm takin' her to Parker myself.

1246
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:31,253
Macalusso.

1247
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,991
Where am I?

1248
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,627
Well, it's a little bit like heaven.

1249
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:41,162
Only better.

1250
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,399
Look who it is, Maggie.

1251
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:48,136
Daddy, daddy, we miss you, daddy. We miss you.

1252
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:50,705
Don't abandon us again, Thorold.

1253
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:54,276
You've got to open your mind this time, and listen to him.

1254
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:57,279
It's the only way.

1255
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:00,782
Take a look at them, Thorold. They're exactly as you

1256
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:07,489
remember them. Do you know why? Because they are inside of you.

1257
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:11,293
Everything there is is inside of you.

1258
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,061
That's what I'm here to teach you.

1259
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:16,097
That's what the Day of Wonders is all about.

1260
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,766
Now, for you, it's your family.

1261
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:22,103
For others, it's something- something else.

1262
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,273
But all of it can be yours.

1263
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,677
All you have to do is believe.

1264
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:35,116
Know who I am, and believe.

1265
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:40,689
And you can have everything there is. Everything.

1266
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:45,193
Please, Thorold. You can be with us today.

1267
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,670
And what about the rest of eternity?

1268
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:09,317
(chuckling)

1269
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,354
Oh, I was wrong about you.

1270
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:17,625
I actually thought you were an alien.

1271
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,229
Yes, I know.

1272
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:26,501
But now you believe. Don't you?

1273
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:29,137
Now I believe.

1274
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,676
Hold it.

1275
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:36,845
Oh Ronnie, I hope he hasn't put those goggles on yet.

1276
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,513
Let's hope he hasn't.

1277
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,681
Which way now?

1278
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,216
This way.

1279
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:46,121
Now all you have to do is give me your pledge of allegiance,

1280
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:52,694
and everything you've ever dreamed of will be yours.

1281
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:58,500
You're not about love at all, are you?

1282
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:01,870
I would rather believe in a creator who would die for his

1283
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:07,142
creation than have his creation die for him.

1284
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,676
My son--

1285
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:14,682
I am not your son, Satan.

1286
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:20,321
And they are not my family.

1287
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:26,561
I know where my family is, where they'll be safe from you for eternity.

1288
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:31,466
So be it.

1289
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:35,303
You've made your choice.

1290
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:42,210
And now you will pay the price.

1291
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:47,849
Not even your God can save you.

1292
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,851
He already has.

1293
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,627
(maniacal laughter)

1294
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:22,183
(locks snapping shut)

1295
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,864
So this is the Day of Wonders?

1296
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,466
You make the world worship you or die.

1297
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:41,402
I don't have to make them worship me.

1298
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,705
They'll want to worship me.

1299
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:47,342
And do you know why? Do you?

1300
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:51,246
Because I give them everything that they want.

1301
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,715
And just like Eve in the Garden of Eden,

1302
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:57,552
they snap it up in a second. And those that don't,

1303
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:02,624
well, they die. So either way, I win.

1304
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:10,632
Pretty soon everything on this whole earth will be mine.

1305
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:16,271
All of it will be mine.

1306
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:21,009
And there's no reason for God to come back, now, is there?

1307
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:26,047
I found out who you really are by saying no.

1308
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:33,421
What about those who said yes? When do they find out?

1309
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,391
Tomorrow.

1310
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:40,295
But by then, it's going to be too late.

1311
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:44,999
You see, once they give me the pledge of allegiance,

1312
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:54,876
they will be mine for eternity. And those that aren't are dead.

1313
01:26:54,943 --> 01:27:00,915
It's a wonderful day, don't you think?

1314
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:05,353
Lord, I didn't honour you with my life.

1315
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:11,626
By your grace, may I do so in death.

1316
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:15,730
Oh! Very touching.

1317
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:21,002
Goodbye, Thorold Stone.

1318
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,742
Thorold, are you okay?

1319
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:31,379
Helen!

1320
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,114
Everything really happened in there.

1321
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:35,717
I know, I know. But I heard you make the right decision.

1322
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:37,518
Oh...

1323
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,489
Where's Willie?

1324
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,791
He met Macalusso in there too.

1325
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,693
He made the wrong decision.

1326
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,496
He took the mark of the beast.

1327
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:52,667
That's why he wanted me to put the goggles on.

1328
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,870
Once you're inside, you either accept the mark or you die.

1329
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,473
Yeah, either way you wouldn't be uploading that virus.

1330
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,409
Well, they won't be far behind us, guys. Let's move.

1331
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:06,447
All right. All right...

1332
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:09,117
The first thing he's gonna do is check this console.

1333
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:10,585
That's where I was supposed to upload the virus. There's gotta

1334
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,454
be another computer that linked to the main network.

1335
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,457
How about that one?

1336
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:28,936
We're in.

1337
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:31,839
(computer beeping)

1338
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:33,041
How long is gonna take?

1339
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:36,444
Hopefully no longer than we've got.

1340
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,480
We've got no time. They're here.

1341
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,549
Thorold!

1342
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:45,053
Okay, okay, all right. Find me another black disk.

1343
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,254
What?

1344
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,089
Another black disk! Find another black disk!

1345
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,065
Thorold, got one.

1346
01:28:57,131 --> 01:29:00,835
Spin that console around.

1347
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,108
Hold it right there, my friend!

1348
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:11,646
Looks like we got here just in time.

1349
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,383
Well, what are you waiting for? Get the disk!

1350
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,120
I'll take that.

1351
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:25,827
What's the matter, stupid? Did all the big words confuse you?

1352
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:29,764
Nice to see you.

1353
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,740
Open the door.

1354
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,409
(computer beeping)

1355
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,514
What's the matter with the door?

1356
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,282
I don't know why it's so slow.

1357
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:50,985
All the access doors were a little slow on the way down here.

1358
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,154
The boys upstairs must be running some big program on

1359
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,256
the main computer system.

1360
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:59,761
Three more guests for your little fireside prayer meeting.

1361
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:03,131
The virus!

1362
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:05,633
But before we turn up the heat,

1363
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,504
I'm gonna give you all one last chance.

1364
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,507
Renounce Him.

1365
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:17,211
Let me tell you something, Mr. Parker.

1366
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:21,716
The God we serve is with us.

1367
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:27,221
And he is fully able to deliver us from this place. But even

1368
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:33,928
if he doesn't, rest assured we will never serve Macalusso.

1369
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:38,266
Nor worship his image or take his mark.

1370
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,101
Ever.

1371
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,602
Amen.

1372
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:49,610
As you wish.

1373
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:59,587
I'm glad the Lord has opened your eyes, son.

1374
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,122
I'm sorry.

1375
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,257
It's okay.

1376
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:08,229
You're forgiven. We all are.

1377
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:11,899
And if the end result is your soul,

1378
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:18,773
then what we've been through is a small price to pay.

1379
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:27,949
♪ Amazing grace how sweet the sound ♪

1380
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:37,758

♪ I once was lost but now I'm found ♪

1382
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:52,006

1383
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:57,812
(roaring flames)

1384
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:02,016
(door crashing open)

1385
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:06,354

1386

1387
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:18,833

1388
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,103
Why aren't they burning?

1389
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:24,338
It's a black O.N.E. Disk!

1390
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:25,907
But Willie, I can't read!

1391
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:27,875
Just pop this! Pop this!

1392
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,777
Pop any disk! Pop any disk!

1393
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:33,047
They're not burning.

1394
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:35,883
It's Him! He's protecting them!

1395
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,019
Turn it up more! Now!

1396
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,420
(flames roaring)

1397
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:41,923
He can't do this. He can't do this!

1398
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:42,990
Where is it?

1399
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,191
It's not here!

1400
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,326
It's gotta be here! It's gotta be here!

1401
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,861
Where else? Where else would it be?

1402
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:48,062
Right there.

1403
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:51,866
(singing growing louder, flames roaring)

1404
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,834
These souls are mine! They have to die!

1405
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,703
Yes, yes...

1406
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,370
Cindy...

1407
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:56,971
What?

1408
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:57,705
Wait a minute...

1409
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:59,907
What, Willie? What?

1410
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,209
Turn it up more! Turn it up more!

1411
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:04,946
It's overloading. You'll burn down the whole building.

1412
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:05,846
(gunshot)

1413
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,715
No, no!

1414
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,751
No! No!

1415
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:13,821
This is impossible! No!

1416
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:17,124
(singing, roaring flames)

1417
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:21,262
This is our day! Our time!

1418
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,130
No!

1419
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:25,199
What? What?

1420
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:30,371
(hail of gunfire)

1421
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,207
All the way!

1422
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,710
No...

1423
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:36,744
What?

1424
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:38,412
What, Willie, what?

1425
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,850
Tell me! Tell me!

1426
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:45,319
It's over, Cindy.

1427
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:46,487
What?

1428
01:33:46,554 --> 01:33:47,722
It's over.

1429
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:51,826
No-- NO!

1430
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:54,729
I'll finish them myself.

1431
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:57,231
(screaming)

1432
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:03,070
♪ ...from when we first begun... ♪

1433
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,873
Former WNN news anchor Helen Hannah has

1434
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,809
apparently done it again. Authorities are scrambling

1435
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:10,945
to make sense of what happened last night as

1436
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:13,414
the O.N.E. headquarters burned to the ground.

1437
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,816
However, there is no doubt that the much-anticipated

1438
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,152
Day of Wonders project has been postponed.

1439
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,021
(cheers, applause)

1440
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,689
We've also learned that Miss Hannah escaped from the

1441
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:25,292
O.N.E. Rehabilitation facility overnight. The Messiah had

1442
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:28,863
this to say from Jerusalem just a few hours ago.

1443
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:37,071
And yet another act of hatred and of selfishness.

1444
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:45,179
The haters have stolen the Day of Wonders from us.

1445
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:55,056
From the new and united world. But rest assured,

1446
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:59,927
they will not prevail against us. We will double

1447
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:05,232
our efforts of the followers of the deceiver, Jesus.
