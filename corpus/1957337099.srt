[wind whipping]

4
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,294
[man 1] Hey, Gibson. Come over here, mate.

5
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,587
[weapon thuds]

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,422
Whoa. You still lugging that thing around?

7
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,884
[Gibson] Hey, I'm gonna be ready
when Zorah Magdaros finally shows itself.

8
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,888
I mean, you really think you're gonna kill
a walking volcano monster with that?

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,224
This thing can supposedly level cities
with a wag of its tail.

10
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,351
Gibson, if half the rumors are true,

11
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,188
you may wanna count yourself lucky
that it hasn't shown itself yet.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,691
- We're the Fifth Fleet. Best of the best!
- [laughs] I'll drink to that!

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,569
Zorah Magdaros
had better keep its head underwater

14
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,947
because no one's met the monster
that can handle Hunters like us.

15
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,699
- [man 1 laughs]
- [man 2] I have.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,869
- [heroic orchestral music playing]
- I faced an Elder Dragon.

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,956
You have no idea what we're up against.

Whoa! Aw, come on.

23
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,140
Lucky catch.

24
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,517
Enjoy your breakfast!

[upbeat instrumental music playing]

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,675
Morning, Mrs. Bellflower.

30
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,344
Morning, Aiden. You're out early.

31
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,889
You know what they say.
"The early Kut-Ku catches the Konchu."

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,653
[Bellflower]
I did not know they said that.

33
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,642
You and your monsters.

34
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,644
[chuckles] Nice-lookin' catch, Aiden.

35
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,313
How about a Gastronome Tuna
for some Poogie Jammies?

36
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,565
[man 1] Not gonna happen!

37
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,941
- [Poogie squeals]
- Whoa!

38
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,027
- Watch where you're going, Loke.
- [man 2] Whoa! Nice move, Aiden.

39
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,488
- You must be practicing.
- [Aiden] You better believe it.

40
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,366
Thanks again
for clearing out those Bnahabra.

41
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,244
Hopefully,
these patches'll keep 'em out for good.

42
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,246
[Aiden] Always "Bna-happy" to help.

43
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,957
[man 3] Hey, have you seen Farmer Burl?

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,420
Ooh! Ebbi's been waiting
for you there all morning.

45
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,463
[Ebbi]
Something's gotten in Farmer Burl's coops.

46
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,091
- Come on. We gotta go. It's a real quest!
- [Aiden grunts]

47
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,259
What if it's Rathalos?

48
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,803
Did you know that Rathalos
have poisonous claws? [growls]

49
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,347
- Yeah?
- One scratch, and you're a goner.

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,726
[chuckles] I kinda doubt a Rathalos
got into Farmer Burl's Gargwa coops.

51
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,145
I'd bring some antidotes anyway.

52
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,897
Yes.

53
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,362
Whoa! [laughs]

54
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,489
Mrs. Genovan, look.

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,077
[Genovan] Is that my cast-iron skillet?

56
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,245
[Aiden sighs]

00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,374

[Gargwa clucking]

60
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,351
Just finished putting the new fence in
last week, and now look at it.

61
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,769
Tracks.

62
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,355
Velociprey, I think.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,068
Can you take care of it?

64
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,279
Mr. Burl, you called
the "Right-noplos" guy for the job.

65
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,908
Because Rhenoplos, it's a...

66
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,244
With the horn? Never mind.

67
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,169
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

68
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,650
[dung splats]

69
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,989
[sniffs] It's fresh.

70
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,617
[bird calls]

71
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,718

00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,066
[screeches]

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,736
That's no Velociprey.

77
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,155
Come on!

78
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,865
- [yelps]
- [Velocidrome cries]

79
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,825

00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,244
Oh!

00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,692
[softly] Yes!

00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,613
[Velocidrome cries]

92
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,781
[Aiden] Oh!

93
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,825
[screams] Oh!

94
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,286
[grunts]

95
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,332
[Velocidrome screeches]

96
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,460
[panting] Ah. Ugh.

97
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,629
Ah. Whew.

98
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,215
[chuckles softly] That... That was close.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,093
You're fortunate
the Velocidrome was alone.

100
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,637
They usually hunt
with a pack of Velociprey.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,431
Yikes. The tracks
I was following were a Velociprey's.

102
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,101
Didn't think
I'd be running into its big brother.

103
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,937
Are you a Hunter?

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,356
You are, aren't you?

105
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,149
Like, a real Guild Hunter.

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,404
The last time one came through Timben,
I was, like, nine years old.

107
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,697
This is so cool. I'm a Hunter too.

108
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,993
I mean, well, I've never actually hunted
something that can hunt back before, but...

109
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,122
- I'm Aiden, by the way.
- My name is Julius.

110
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,208
You shouldn't be hunting
without a license from the Hunter's Guild.

111
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,085
- It's poaching.
- [Aiden] I... Well...

112
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,796
One of them Velociprey...

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,464
What are you doing?

114
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,342
One does not take
a monster's life lightly.

115
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,719
To do so
would betray the balance of nature.

116
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,807
A Hunter has an obligation
to see its sacrifice does not go to waste.

117
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,727
Now, this village
you're from, it's nearby?

118
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,563
I'm not in trouble, am I?

119
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,232
I mean, <i>you </i>killed it, right? So...

120
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,111
Here's the thing.
The last time one of the villagers

121
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,447
got an Altaroth infestation
in their basement,

122
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,574
Mitul had to walk all the way to Dundorma.

123
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,908
It took two weeks!

124
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,286
And then, when we finally met
with the Hunter's Guild,

125
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,246
they'd never even heard of
our village before.

126
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,874
There's no way
we can go for help every time a Kelbi

127
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,500
gets into the Cudgel Onion patch.

128
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,753
Ah. So you take it upon yourself
to sort things out.

129
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,173
I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.

130
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,721
Are these the Velociprey tracks
you were following?

131
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,851
Yep. Those are them.
Somebody's still gotta deal with that.

132
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,062
These are fake.

133
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,022
What?

134
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,482
And from the looks of it,

135
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,692
you have a Melynx
to thank for all your troubles.

136
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,986
Oh. When I find him, I'm gonna...

137
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,739
Aiden, later. The village first.

138
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,032
But... [scoffs]

139
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,366
This isn't over.

140
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,679
[Julius] Is there someone
who makes decisions for the village?

141
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,955
[Aiden] Elder Daazel. She's a Wyverian.

142
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,957
Lived here
longer than there's been a village.

143
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,210
She's in the building
with Huskberry bushes out front.

144
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,713
- I can show you where it is.
- [Julius] I'll find my way. Take this.

145
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,799
[Aiden yelps, straining]

146
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,018
- [Aiden grunts]
- [Ebbi] Holy moly!

147
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,063
Keep an eye on that
for me, would you, Ebbi?

148
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,317
I'll be back shortly.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,402
[Gargwa clucking]

150
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,449
Give it a rest, Feathers.
I'm not quite ready for you yet.

151
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

152
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,048
[Aiden grunts]

153
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,884
Mm! A little Felvine for flavor.

154
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,386
- [Aiden] Aha!
- [Melynx yelps]

155
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,680
Don't you move.
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

156
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,141
Why, certainly, good sir.
Uh, how much do I owe you?

157
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
You're a... Wait, you can talk?

158
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,063
I thought wild Melynx
only spoke Melynx or whatever.

159
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,650
"Meowst" do, uh, that's true.
But I'm not as wild as some.

160
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,818
I'm a merchant.

161
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,236
Nox is the name.

162
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,155
Really? Then what are you doing
with Farmer Burl's...? [yelps]

163
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,449
Why, you... Ow!

164
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,035
- [Nox laughing]
- [Aiden groans, grunts]

165
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,079
- Hey! [yelps]
- [Aiden grunting]

166
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,162
[Nox continues laughing]

167
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,039
Oh my...

168
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,833
Yeah, just put that anywhere.

169
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,084
Just don't hit the...

170
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,419
Oh! Come on!

171
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,713
- That is precious cargo.
- [Aiden grunts] Ow!

172
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,965
That was a limited-edition pot!

173
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,593
- What kind of... Oh, real nice.
- [Aiden continues grunting]

174
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,136
You "meowster"!

175
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,763
Come back here, you furry little felon!

176
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,349
- [sighs]
- [Nox yelps, grunts]

177
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,435
- [Gargwa clucking]
- [Aiden exhales]

178
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Ah.

179
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:18,326
I don't suppose I could interest you
in an array of secondhand commodities?

180
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,580
[Nox, muffled] All right, 15, uh, 20%,
but that is the best I can do.

181
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,541
For the last time,
I'm not interested in your Zenny.

182
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,544
"<i>Your </i>Zenny."
Listen to me, buying into this Bullfango.

183
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,797
- [Nox groans] Unnecessary.
- [sighs] You're a thief.

184
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,718
I'm a Hunter, and bringing you in
is gonna prove to that Guild know-it-all

185
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,094
that I can protect my village.

186
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,847
[Nox] Oh, I get it. You're a protector.

187
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,182
- You protect.
- That's right.

188
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,141
[Nox] Hear me out.

189
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,393
How much more effective
would you be as a protector

190
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,022
if you could just protect them
with your very own airship?

191
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,690
Now, I... I know a guy...

192
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,774
[Burl] Hi.

193
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,736
[calming instrumental music playing]

194
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,946
[doors squeak]

195
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,491
Well, Mr. Burl, I've solved your problem.

196
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,334
I think
you'll be pleased to have these back.

197
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,745
- My Gargwa!
- [chuckles] Nice, Aiden.

198
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,538
Heck of a good job, son.

199
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,833
- [Nox groans, coughs]
- And the thief responsible.

200
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,751
Uh, hello.

201
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,378
[villager] Yeah, Aiden!

202
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,755
Still think I shouldn't be hunting?

203
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,548
- Yes.
- [Julius grunts]

204
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,385
- [Nox] Oof.
- What's all this?

205
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,347
I was just explaining

206
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,266
that your village lies
in the path of an Elder Dragon.

207
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,350
What?

208
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,311
What does that mean?

209
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,063
Nothing good.

210
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,274
The Elder Dragons are the most ancient

211
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,152
<i>and powerful of monster kind.</i>

212
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,615
<i>Once enraged,
incredible energy flows from them,</i>

213
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,911
<i>warping ecosystems
in the places where they live.</i>

214
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,789
[Julius] <i>For the most part,
these creatures remain in one place.</i>

215
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>However, during the periodic migration,</i>

216
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,044
<i>called the Elder Crossing,
they migrate across the continent</i>

217
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,546
<i>and over the great ocean,</i>

218
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,340
<i>leaving a path
of destruction in their wake.</i>

219
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,678
<i>Based on our reports, we now believe
they are all headed to the same location</i>

220
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,597
<i>over the sea, but we don't know why.</i>

221
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,224
[Aptonoth cries]

222
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,518
[Daazel] <i>For most of recorded history,</i>

223
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,688
<i>these events were extraordinarily rare.</i>

224
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,899
- [people scream]
- [Daazel] <i>One in a century was uncommon.</i>

225
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,570
<i>It's now happening once every decade.</i>

226
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,655
[Julius] <i>Ten years ago,
the Guild summoned Hunters</i>

227
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,532
<i>to Port Tanzia to join a Fleet.</i>

228
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:22,867
<i>Their mission?</i>

229
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,953
<i>To find the cause
of the more frequent migrations.</i>

230
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,663
Hunters, like myself,

231
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,709
have been dispatched by the Hunter's Guild
to search for signs of the next migration.

232
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,377
I am here to tell you

233
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,255
an Elder Dragon is on its migration path,

234
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,507
straight for your village.

235
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,050
Holy moly.

236
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,303
You must evacuate now.

237
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,432
Wait a minute.
You expect us to just pack up and leave?

238
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,893
How do we know any of this is even true?

239
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,563
- We don't know you.
- I agree. What about our homes?

240
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,691
- Did you think of that?
- Homes? Homes can be rebuilt.

241
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,069
We're talking about lives here.
We should do as he says.

242
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,616
Some of us can't carry our livelihood
with us, Navid. I don't trust this man.

243
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,160
No, I don't either.
I mean, why should we listen to him?

244
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,161
It's true.

245
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,332
This valley is acting like a funnel
for monsters fleeing the Elder Dragon.

246
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,501
- Most likely...
- Most likely?

247
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,710
He's just guessing!

248
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,170
I believe him.

249
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,921
He saved my life.

250
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,674
Aiden, he's not from our village.

251
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,012
What if I go up there
and see this for myself?

252
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,391
Well, if <i>you </i>tell us
the danger is real, I will believe you.

253
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,893
Okay. I will too.

254
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,436
Then you will evacuate?

255
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,604
We have to know.

256
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,482
Take me there.

257
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,319
The Elder Dragon will pass
through the valley within a week.

258
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,821
I will take the boy

259
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,365
to see with his own eyes
the coming danger,

260
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,784
but there can be no delay
in your preparations.

261
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,745
You must be ready to leave
as soon as he returns.

262
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,414
We will begin at first light.

263
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,124
[Burl] This doesn't sound good.

264
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,584
What are you going to do?

265
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,294
[villagers chattering]

266
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,631
- [Nox yowls]
- Now, what to do with you?

267
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,883
I may have use for him.

268
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,759
Huh?

269
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,595
[groans]

270
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
Oh! [grunts]

271
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,766
[tense instrumental music playing]

272
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,980
[Burl groans]

273
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,236
[birds singing]

274
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,321
[monsters grunting and snorting]

275
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,415
- Have you hunted Zinogre?
- [Julius] Yes.

276
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,916
- Diablos?
- Yes.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,836
- [monsters buzzing]
- [Aiden screams]

278
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,004
Ha-ha!

279
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:40,963
Aiden, no!

280
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,214
I had that one.

281
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,384
These monsters are no threat.

282
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,219
They're fleeing the Elder Dragon.

283
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,637
[Nox screams]

284
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,724
[swords ringing]

285
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,352
[Aiden panting]

286
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,488
There's something I don't get.
How come the Guild gets to decide

287
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,490
when and what people can hunt?

288
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,326
A dead monster's a dead monster, isn't it?

289
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,369
Most people once agreed with you.

290
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,080
Ages ago,
we hunted monsters indiscriminately

291
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,792
to the point where the natural balance
of life was disrupted.

292
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,087
The effect
on our environment was devastating.

293
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,091
It is this very reason
that the Hunter's Guild was formed.

294
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,054
Our balance with nature
is more delicate than you think.

295
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,223
[softly] Whoa.

296
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,683
[Julius] Dual Blades.

297
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,894
They work separately, but always together.

298
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,145
Always on the offensive.

299
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,191
Overwhelming and outnumbering
one's opponent like two unrelenting foes.

300
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,568
The motion is fluid and precise,

301
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,737
like the flow of a stream.

302
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,156
- May I?
- Here. Try these first.

303
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,200
[rhythmic instrumental music playing]

304
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,493
[sighs]

305
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,537
[grunting, groans]

306
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,916
Concentrate on your center.
You need a stable foundation.

307
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,084
[Aiden sighs]

308
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,087
Don't worry.

309
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,547
We may make a decent Hunter of you yet.

310
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,722
[Nox panting] Hey. Hey, guys. Wait.

311
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,643
Isn't this distribution
of baggage just a little unfair?

312
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,103
[sighing] Oh God.

313
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,981
Nice armor.

314
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,650
[laughs] You noticed.

315
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,276
It's 100% iron ore.

316
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,072
Velocidrome-tested.
Works as a weapon. Got good balance.

317
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,075
Campfire cookware.

318
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,744
Perhaps you need to look the part.

319
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,372
This could fit.

320
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,082
[gasps, chuckles] Thank you.

321
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,667
- [skillet clangs]
- [Nox yowls]

322
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,335
[Julius] It is Guild-issue.

323
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,998
- Come here.
- [Julius] Aiden.

324
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,132
Come on. Bring it in.

325
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,175
Um, no. No, Aiden.

326
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,594
It's okay. Don't... Don't touch me.

327
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,609
In case you were wondering... [yawns]

328
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,530
...there's nowhere you can run
that I won't be able to track you, Nox.

329
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,408
[gasps] Say what? Uh-oh. No. No.

330
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,412
- [rustling]
- [Julius] Mm-hmm. And get out of my bag.

331
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,831
[Nox] Who, me?
I'm not. I'm right over here.

332
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,166
[rustling in bushes]

333
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,585
What?

334
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,296
I don't see anything.

335
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,379
[Julius] Quiet.

336
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,009
- [Velociprey screeches]
- [footsteps approaching]

337
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,092
Uh...

338
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,761
Run!

339
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,346
[Velociprey crying]

340
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,891
[Aiden] Nox!

341
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,100
[Nox yelps]

342
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,769
Aiden, no!

343
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,771
[tense instrumental music playing]

344
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,855
[Velociprey roars]

345
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,733
[Aiden screams]

346
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,570
Come on!

347
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,655
Climb up here!

348
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,910
That was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

349
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,662
It can't get any worse than that.
[chuckles]

350
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,539
Aiden, come up here.

351
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,169
[Aiden grunts] What's that smell?

352
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,837
[Nox] Oof.

353
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,007
Ugh. [groans]

354
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,008
Oh!

355
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,136
I was incorrect. It's...

356
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,013
- Uh, yeah, it's worse.
- [thunder rumbles]

357
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
[Aiden] Holy moly.

358
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,724
[gasps] What is that?

359
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,727
That is what you face.

360
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,937
An Elder Dragon.

361
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,357
An unbridled force of nature given flesh,

362
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,567
headed directly for your village.

363
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,569
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

364
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,822
[Aiden gasps]

365
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,160
Aiden, you have, at most, three days
until your village is destroyed.

366
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,455
[Lunastra growling]

367
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,717
[fire crackling]

368
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,684
[flames roaring]

369
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,853
That's an Elder Dragon?

370
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,314
I've tracked it for almost a month.
Your people must leave the valley at once.

371
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,526
We'll never make it.
The only way out is through the Everwood.

372
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,028
- We'd run right into it.
- Then you must go west.

373
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,780
The Western Ridge is unpassable.

374
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,741
It would take two weeks
to get out of the Elder Dragon's path.

375
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,244
- What about the Guild?
- They're too far away.

376
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,662
You said so yourself.

377
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,748
Aiden, you've seen the danger.

378
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,793
Convince your people to go west,
and you may still save some of them.

379
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,921
Remain in the valley,
and you will lose everyone.

380
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,425
Wait, where are you going?

381
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,970
It is my mission to warn every village
from here to the ocean to evacuate.

382
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,638
Not just yours.

383
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,098
So, that's it?

384
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,933
You're just gonna walk away?

385
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, what if we fight it?

386
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,314
What if we can somehow change its course
so it doesn't destroy all those villages?

387
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,565
We're Hunters.

388
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,108
We have to do something!

389
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,569
An Elder Dragon
is not just another monster.

390
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,487
And you are not a Hunter.

391
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,449
Maybe not. Maybe I've been kidding myself,

392
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,285
but at least I know
what it means to be a monster Hunter.

393
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,038
I'm not gonna turn my back
on Elder Daazel, Burl,

394
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,582
Genovan, Mitul, or Ebbi.

395
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,584
I'll fight with sticks if I have to!

396
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,960
[sighs] I bring him out here,

397
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,838
and he becomes
even more determined to stay.

398
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,425
"Care for nature,
and it will deliver prosperity."

399
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,970
"Build from prosperity
to craft a thriving community."

400
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,097
"Live harmoniously in that community

401
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,683
and teach it to always care for nature."

402
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,977
The cycle of balance?

403
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,021
Isn't that what you swore to protect?

404
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,900
That Elder Dragon is destroying nature,
and it's about to destroy community.

405
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,703
If you leave,
you're not just abandoning us.

406
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,696
You're turning your back on
what it means to be a Hunter.

407
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
Where did you learn that?

408
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,162
This journal belongs to a Hunter.

409
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
[shot echoes]

410
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,422
[bright orchestral music playing]

411
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,841
Anyone within range will find us.

412
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,345
If we're going to do this,
we're going to need some help.

413
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,265
Yes! It is "Alatre-on"!

414
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,059
[Julius]
The last entry here is only two days old.

415
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,229
- Where did you get it?
- I found it in Nox's loot.

416
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,440
- [branches snap]
- [Nox yelps, groans]

417
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,567
Who did you steal this from?

418
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,486
"Purr-cured" it, please.

419
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,071
Easy on the s-word.

420
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,199
Uh, the thing is, uh,
my memory's a little foggy, so...

421
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,287
- Find the owner, and you go free.
- [clicks tongue] Right this way.

422
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,705
[thunder crashes]

423
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,084
[birds calling]

424
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,004
[Nox] This is "purr-ty" close
to where I found the Hunter.

425
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,964
She was camped here for the night.

426
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,967
You guys smell that?

427
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,136
This way. And careful.

428
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,139
The creature
she's hunting is extremely dangerous.

429
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,517
Buddy, if we run into trouble,
plan A is run away.

430
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,811
Plans C, D, and E are hide,

431
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,688
negotiate, and run away.

432
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,732
There is no plan boomerang.

433
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,609
- [screams]
- [grunts] Get out of the way!

434
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,988
- [Julius grunts]
- [Nerscylla growls]

435
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
[jaws clanging]

436
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,636
- [Julius grunts]
- [Nerscylla growls]

437
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,742
[roars]

438
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,123
- Hey, ugly! Over here.
- [Kinsect buzzes]

439
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,669
[Hunter] Let's see what you got.

440
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,589
[Nerscylla growls]

441
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,259
[Hunter grunts]

442
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,428
You're a lot faster than that last one.

443
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,930
[yelps, grunts]

444
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,307
This is high.

445
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,894
[straining, grunts]

446
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,896
Paisley!

447
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,314
[grunting]

448
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,569
[Aiden] Don't worry!

449
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,197
We are here to he... [groans]

450
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,865
Ugh. Amateurs.

451
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,117
[Aiden screaming]

452
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,161
Ah! Oh! [grunts]

453
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,205
- [Nox] They're not coming this way.
- [screams]

454
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,374
[yelps] Oh! No, no, no, no!

455
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,626
[in slow-motion] Oh no!

456
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,294
Can't believe I'm doing this.

457
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,212
[Aiden] Help!

458
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,130
[grunts, screams]

459
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,466
I got you, man. You're gonna be okay.

460
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,468
[Hunter grunts]

461
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,638
- [Nox and Aiden screaming]
- [Hunter] Seriously?

462
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,474
[Nox and Aiden yelp]

463
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,059
- [Nox groans]
- [Aiden screams]

464
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,105
Okay, big guy.
Let's see how well you fight.

465
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,192
- Ha! You <i>are </i>a nasty one, aren't ya?
- [Nerscylla growls]

466
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,027
[Hunter yelps, grunts]

467
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,946
- [Julius grunts]
- [Aiden] Julius!

468
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,156
- [straining]
- [Julius groans]

469
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,200
[grunting]

470
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,870
[Nox] We'll be perfectly safe now.

471
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,080
[yowls]

472
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,998
- [yelps, groans]
- [Aiden] Nox!

473
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,459
- [Julius grunting]
- [Aiden] Julius! Watch out!

474
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,920
- [Julius panting]
- [Nerscylla hisses]

475
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,172
[Aiden] Whoa! No!

476
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,049
- [Julius groans]
- [Aiden] Oh!

477
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,426
[Julius grunts]

478
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,471
- [Aiden] Hey! I'm still up here!
- Time for plan boomerang.

479
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,140
No, no, no! No plan boomerang!

480
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,016
Hyah!

481
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,101
[Aiden screams]

482
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,979
[Nox yelps, grunts]

483
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,315
Sure, he gives me the weapon
that comes flying back at your face.

484
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,985
[Julius grunts]

485
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,154
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

486
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,738
- [Nerscylla growls]
- [Julius groans]

487
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,867
Give him a big kiss for us.

488
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,330
- [Julius grunts]
- [Nerscylla screeches]

489
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,293
- [Aiden] No. Shoo. Go away. No.
- [Paisley buzzing]

490
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,586
[Aiden screams, groans]

491
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,255
[Hunter and Julius grunting]

492
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,216
I'm back in this.

493
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm gonna flank him! [grunts]

494
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,596
[Hunter yelps]

495
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,389
I got a little problem here!

496
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:41,188
[grunting] Julius, I think I'm stuck,
stuck in the gooey stuff.

497
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,524
[groans] Hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry. He's coming.

498
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,776
He's gonna eat me. Hurry!

499
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,777
Watch out!

500
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,070
[Nerscylla growls]

501
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,114
- [entrails splatter]
- [Aiden] Ugh!

502
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,325
[groans] That...

503
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,660
was so cool!

504
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,537
That was so cool! Did you see?

505
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,623
Guys,
I can't hold this little fella all day.

506
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,459
Oh man. I was up in the tree,
and then I swung back. I...

507
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,769
I got a few hits in, and then...

508
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,796
Thanks a bunch, you guys.
I only needed another few minutes

509
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,216
to ascertain
its bite strength and leaping ability.

510
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,636
And those swords,
they're gonna throw the data way off.

511
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,472
- [Julius] You slayed it.
- Your partner was in big trouble.

512
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,307
And he's lucky this was a juvenile.

513
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,310
I would expect an Ace Hunter to recognize
when someone doesn't need help.

514
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,393
Ace Hunter?

515
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,480
- [Julius grunts]
- Yeah, him.

516
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,398
- You, not so much.
- Hey.

517
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,317
Nice work, geniuses. [sighs]

518
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,486
Of course, nobody else takes the time to...

519
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,780
[grunts]
...obtain proper monster data.

520
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,032
Just leave it to Mae
to do all the legwork,

521
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,535
then mess it up
when she's almost done. [sighs]

522
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,996
Here I was, thinking I was the only one
following up on these reports.

523
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,207
No? Uh, why are you even here then?

524
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,210
- You're Mae, I'm guessing.
- Oh! My journal. Oh! My notes.

525
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,628
Oh! [kisses] Oh my gosh.

526
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,838
- I thought I'd lost you.
- [chuckles] We found it.

527
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,299
Uh, I mean,
well, we found Nox, and he sto...

528
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,052
Hey, so, uh,
should we be concerned about that?

529
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,762
[man screaming, muffled]

530
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,264
- I'm up here!
- [shot rings out]

531
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,407
- [man groans]
- [Mae] Whoa.

532
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,766
[man grunting]

533
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,895
Took me a while to pick up your trail
after I saw the flare.

534
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,564
Sorry I missed the party.

535
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,816
- Nadia.
- Julius.

536
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,485
Two Ace Hunters.

537
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,405
- Today must be my lucky day or something.
- You two know each other?

538
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,824
They assigned me the region
just south of here.

539
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,076
I spotted the smoke on the horizon.

540
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,370
It's headed right into this valley.

541
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,540
It's a Lunastra, a big one.

542
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,500
- You've seen it?
- Lunastra?

543
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,837
- As in, an Elder Dragon Lunastra?
- [Julius groans] Uh... Ah...

544
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,381
And you got close to it?
What kind of a wingspan did it have?

545
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,675
Was its mane more cobalt blue
or closer to periwinkle?

546
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,634
[Nadia] Why the flare?

547
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,179
Seems like you guys
had this one under control. Wait.

548
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,807
No. You're actually going to fight it?

549
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,643
- We could use your help.
- Are you kidding?

550
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,646
No one's done a comprehensive assessment
of a Lunastra before.

551
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,189
You know what we're asking.

552
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,610
[chuckles] If that time
with the Ludroth is any indication,

553
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,737
you do a lot better
with me watching your back.

554
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,196
"Gargw-awesome."

555
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,115
- What the...?
- Uh, he does that.

556
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,744
Hey, uh, I... I don't think
that guy can breathe in there.

557
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
- [binding rips]
- [man panting]

558
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,205
Where... Where is that thing?

559
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,415
Did... Did you kill it?

560
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,960
Oh, thank you. You saved my life.

561
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,755
That thing destroyed my whole caravan.

562
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,966
You really want
to take on an Elder Dragon,

563
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,719
we're gonna need
a lot more than armor repairs.

564
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,429
We're gonna need weapons.

565
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,680
Big weapons.

566
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,393
Uh, actually, I was trading
with a smithy not far from here.

567
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,770
Name of Ravi.

568
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,605
I can show you where to find him,

569
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,567
but I should warn you,
he is not very fond of visitors.

570
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,531
- [tools clanging]
- [Nox laughs] What? Oh yeah.

571
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,072
I'm sure
this guy gets lots of customers every day.

572
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,155
Yeah.

573
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,910
- [bright orchestral music playing]
- Uh, excuse me.

574
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,080
Whatever your business, take it elsewhere.

575
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,083
Uh, please.
There's an Elder Dragon coming.

576
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,794
- We're trying to stop it.
- [steam hisses]

577
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,877
We need some...

578
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,256
If you'd just forge some equipment for us,
it can make a big difference.

579
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,133
I don't forge weapons.

580
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,636
You'll die too!

581
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,347
This Elder Dragon
you're so eager to confront,

582
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,848
its life can't be measured

583
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,392
by human understanding.

584
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,893
It has existed for ages

585
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,146
and will continue to exist
long after we're gone.

586
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,983
Compared to that,
our lives are small, meaningless things.

587
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,946
Maybe your life
has been meaningless, but mine won't be.

588
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,447
Aiden, go.

589
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,283
[Ravi] You, Hunter.

590
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,162
Did you forget
how dangerous an Elder Dragon is?

591
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,500
You're walking to your own death,
and you're taking this boy with you.

592
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,087
He's not doing it for himself,
and neither are we.

593
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,298
Or did you forget
what it means to be a Hunter?

594
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,718
You were one, weren't you?

595
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,679
Not... for a long time.

596
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,764
[theme music playing]

597
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,352
[Gargwa clucking]

598
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,730
Oh. What's this?

599
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,316
There's been a change of plans, everyone.
We're not leaving.

600
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,111
We're gonna stay and defend our homes.

601
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,697
- And I've brought us some help.
- Wait, what?

602
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,906
[villagers clamoring]

603
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,160
[Julius] There's a natural pinch point
just outside the village.

604
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,872
<i>If we can guide it right into that spot,
we can set a trap for it.</i>

605
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,624
[villagers grunting]

606
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,378
It's a one-of-a-kind Nerscylla stinger.

607
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,838
All kinds of uses.

608
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,299
- Sewing, walking stick... Ow!
- [stinger pierces]

609
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,467
...tranquilizer.

610
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,968
Oh...

611
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,516
[bird cries in distance]

612
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,686
- [Ebbi] And this?
- I scouted as far as I could get.

613
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,855
- [Mae] She's a tough one.
- Tracks all over.

614
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,482
Everything for 100 miles

615
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,942
has been stirred up
by the Lunastra's migration.

616
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,903
It may work to our advantage.

617
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,782
There are some things we need
that we can only get from monsters.

618
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,831
[Aiden grunts]

619
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,584
Ah.

620
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,378
[Bowgun cocks]

621
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,884
Uh... [grunts]

622
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,967
Oh brother.

623
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,888
- [monster growls]
- [Nadia] Here it comes!

624
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,016
- [yelps] Where are you guys?
- [Aiden] Nox! Nox! Nox!

625
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,893
What are you doin' over there?

626
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,394
[Nox screaming]

627
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,729
Nadia, now.

628
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,024
[Aiden] This way! Hurry!

629
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,734
[Nox grunts, yelps]

630
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,110
[Aiden] No, Nox!

631
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,154
- Gotcha, buddy.
- [Congalala groans]

632
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,238
Nice shot.

633
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,782
Mae, we're up.

634
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,617
[tense orchestral music playing]

635
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,744
[Julius and Mae grunting]

636
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,290
- [Congalala roars]
- [Julius groans]

637
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
[Mae grunts]

638
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,670
[Congalala snarls]

639
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,797
Julius! Look out! Yellow Mushroom!

640
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,465
[explosion echoes]

641
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,549
[Mae] Ah!

642
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,053
[grunting]

643
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,726
[Congalala roars]

644
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,980
[Mae and Julius grunt]

645
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,692
[Congalala cries]

646
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,861
[Aiden] All right!

647
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,612
[grunts] Aha!

648
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,115
- [Congalala inhales]
- [Aiden grunts]

649
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,159
- [Congalala belches]
- [Julius grunts] Look out.

650
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,996
- Whoa!
- Yellow Mushrooms cause paralysis.

651
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,913
Set the trap.

652
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,831
[Aiden] Okay.

653
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,624
[Mae yells, groans]

654
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,710
[Aiden straining]

655
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,549
- Now!
- [Aiden grunts]

656
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,551
Yes!

657
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,177
[grunts] All right!

658
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,221
[Nadia sighs] Just like you drew it up.

659
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,309
[panting] Well done, everyone.
That's what teamwork looks like.

660
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,436
Nice deployment on that trap, Aiden.

661
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,314
Thanks. I didn't even need
those extra anchors you gave me.

662
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,733
- You didn't anchor it?
- [groans] Come on.

663
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,360
- [fabric ripping]
- [Congalala growling]

664
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,738
Julius, it smells something coming.

665
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,448
[birds calling]

666
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,782
Everyone, retreat.

667
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,743
No! We can't just let him get away.

668
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,494
Aiden, now's not the time.

669
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,663
Julius, let me fix this.

670
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,334
- [ropes snap]
- [Aiden screams, yelps]

671
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,754
[grunting]

672
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,048
- Nox, get that Yellow Mushroom!
- What?

673
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,133
Are you crazy?

674
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,594
[Aiden]
We can use it to paralyze the Congalala.

675
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,971
[Nox yelps]

676
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,475
Uh... Ah! Oh! Hyah!

677
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,143
Aiden, disengage!

678
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,146
[Aiden grunting]

679
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,981
[groans] Stubborn kid.

680
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,651
[Nox chuckles]

681
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,194
Oh sh...

682
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,278
[groans]

683
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,488
Nox! You good, buddy?

684
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,948
- Whoa!
- [Mae grunts]

685
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,950
[Aiden] No! Oh!

686
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,743
- [Congalala farts]
- [Mae] Ugh. Oh.

687
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,620
- [coughs] Oh...
- [electricity crackles]

688
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,829
Oh no.

689
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,498
[grunts]

690
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,083
[monster 1 growls]

691
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,210
That can't be good. Julius!

692
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,169
Oh no.

693
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,046
- [monster 1 growls]
- [monster 2 yelps]

694
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,215
- [branches rustling]
- [monster 1 snorts]

695
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,551
[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

696
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,515
[Julius] Look out!

697
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,725
- [Deviljho roars]
- [Aiden] Whoa!

698
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,103
- [Congalala growls]
- [Deviljho roars]

699
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,229
[Aiden] Whoa!

700
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,273
[Congalala roars]

701
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,568
[Mae] Ah... Uh...

702
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,029
- [Paisley buzzing]
- [Mae chuckles]

703
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,282
[Deviljho growls]

704
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,703
There's a big monster in front of me.

705
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,964
[Congalala groans]

706
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,215
[Julius grunting]

707
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,014
[yells, grunting]

708
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
[groans]

709
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,100
[Deviljho roars]

710
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,351
[Julius groans]

711
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,644
[Nox coughs weakly]

712
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,105
[Julius groans]

713
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,481
[Deviljho roars]

714
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,943
[Nadia] Julius, stay down!

715
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,987
[Deviljho cries]

716
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,616
[Aiden grunts]

717
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,785
Gotcha. [straining]

718
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,953
[Nadia] Move it!

719
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,581
Since when did pickles grow teeth?

720
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,833
- Freaking Deviljho!
- [slurring] Deviljho?

721
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,086
Hey, that's got a Dragon Element.

722
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,881
We could totally use that
for the Dragonator.

723
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,758
- [Bowgun fires]
- [Deviljho cries]

724
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,469
- [roars]
- [Aiden] Whoa!

725
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,720
[Nadia panting]

726
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,723
[groans, laughs] It is on, dragon breath!

727
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,559
- [Bowgun fires]
- [Julius grunts]

728
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,936
- [Deviljho screeches]
- [Julius grunting]

729
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,981
- [yells]
- [Deviljho cries]

730
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,065
[Julius grunts]

731
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,193
[yells, groans]

732
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,986
- [Aiden] No!
- Deviljho?

733
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,198
- That's a Deviljho!
- Yeah. Welcome back to reality.

734
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,241
- Julius.
- Go!

735
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,325
[Deviljho growls]

736
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,205
[Nadia] Oh no!

737
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,374
[Nox] Uh...

738
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,752
Mae, we can use the mushroom
to paralyze the Jho.

739
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,835
Got it.

740
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,214
[grunts]

741
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,841
- [Deviljho growls]
- [Mae yelps, grunts]

742
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,176
- [coughing]
- [Nox] Ah...

743
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
[Mae groans]

744
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,972
- [Julius] Get out of here!
- [groans] We're a team!

745
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,767
[Mae groaning]

746
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,268
Paisley, go!

747
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,854
[Paisley buzzing]

748
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,107
[panting] Got it.

749
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,985
- [Deviljho roars]
- [Aiden] Watch out!

750
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,237
[Nadia] Got ya!

751
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,324
[electricity crackling]

752
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,493
[Julius groans, grunts]

753
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,246
[yells]

754
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,043
- [Deviljho growls]
- [Julius gasps]

755
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,003
[yelling and grunting]

756
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,759
[Aiden] Whoa!

757
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,554
- [Julius grunts]
- [Deviljho roars]

758
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,972
[Julius yells]

759
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,683
- [grunts]
- Watch out!

760
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,393
- [Nox yelps]
- [Julius grunting]

761
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,520
[Deviljho cries]

762
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,649
- [Aiden exclaims] Whoa! Yes!
- [heroic orchestral music playing]

763
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,984
Everyone all right?

764
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,946
Whoo! Did you see that?
Did you see what we just did?

765
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,156
Are you kidding me?

766
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,991
I pulled off
that sweet block you showed me.

767
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,493
Your recklessness
almost got us all killed.

768
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,497
We would've been safe
when that Deviljho appeared

769
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,372
if you had just listened to me.

770
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,167
When I command you to retreat, you do so.

771
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,668
No hesitation!

772
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,211
I was wrong about you.

773
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,051
For all of your talk
of protecting your village,

774
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,842
the only thing that you care about
is getting your pat on the back.

775
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,565
[Nadia] Don't you think you're being a...

776
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,971
No, Nadia. I know what I'm seeing.

777
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:26,601
This is not a team that I can lead.
This was always a fool's errand anyway.

778
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,603
Tell everyone to pack up.

779
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,235
[flies buzzing]

780
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,614
Do you think being slightly chewed
is gonna hurt the market value?

781
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,119
[Aiden] I really thought I was improving.
Now look at things.

782
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,538
Hey, it's not your fault.

783
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,833
No, I messed up again,

784
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,669
just like getting myself cornered
by that Velocidrome.

785
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,922
[Mae] And ruining my Nerscylla research.

786
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,882
And blowing the Congalala trap.

787
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,425
Oh, and don't forget,

788
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,470
almost getting us trampled,
fried, and devoured by a Deviljho.

789
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,553
No big deal.

790
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,098
I'm startin' to think
I'm not cut out to be a Hunter.

791
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,476
[chuckles] Oh!
And following the fake tracks I made.

792
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,144
Yeah, don't forget that one.

793
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,021
Yeah. I'm sorry for that day.

794
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,607
For trying to hit you
with a hammer, I mean.

795
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,317
I'm glad I missed.

796
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,612
[Nox] So am I, kid. So am I.

797
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,572
[villagers clamoring]

798
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,574
- [Burl] Oh, Aiden!
- [man 1] It's Aiden!

799
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,939
- [Burl] Everyone all right?
- [Nox] Thank you, thank you.

800
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,703
Heroes, coming through.

801
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,707
- The heroes have returned.
- [man 2] Hey, Aiden!

802
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,250
[Nox] Thank you, thank you, thank you.

803
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,751
Boy, are we hungry.

804
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,504
- [birds singing]
- [villagers continue chattering]

805
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,589
[gentle orchestral music playing]

806
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,302
Do you remember our first hunt?

807
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,388
Gypceros, wasn't it?

808
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,765
It was the first time
you hunted with a Gunner.

809
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,934
You spent half the fight
looking over your shoulder,

810
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,061
trying to make sure
you weren't in the way.

811
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,855
So, when the thing flashed its crystal
to blind us...

812
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,691
Ah, I saw spots for weeks.

813
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:01,487
[chuckles] Not exactly the smoothest start
for Master Kambei's prodigal student.

814
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,656
Why did you follow me, Nadia?

815
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,950
Aiden made a mistake. He's young.

816
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,910
His impulsiveness is a problem.

817
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:12,331
Says the guy who once charged
into a Rajang's mating grounds unarmed.

818
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,292
That's exactly what worries me.

819
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,336
Says the guy who risked his friend...

820
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,297
his mentor's life.

821
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,090
That was not your fault.

822
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,260
We had enough on our hands
with the Rathian.

823
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,471
Having a Kushala Daora
appear right in the middle of it

824
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,682
was a one-in-a-million chance.

825
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,559
Nah, it wasn't that.

826
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,730
I made mistakes.
The master had to come in and save me.

827
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,691
We were fighting an Elder Dragon.

828
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,527
I did it to impress the master.

829
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,196
[scoffs] It wasn't easy training with you.

830
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,116
You were Master Kambei's favorite.

831
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,953
He saw something important in you.

832
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,497
I saw it too, with the Deviljho.

833
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,250
We can't do this without you.

834
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,587
- I'm not that person anymore.
- [Nadia] You are.

835
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,340
That's why I followed you.

836
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,760
[river flowing]

837
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,768
Take my weapons.

838
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,188
Just, please stay and lead the others.

839
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,272
Protect Timben.

840
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,691
I acted like a fool.

841
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,652
The people here counted on me,
and I let them down.

842
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,989
I know you won't lead a team
with me on it.

843
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,867
We will protect Timben...

844
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,826
together.

845
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,203
[Ravi] Hunters!

846
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,248
You said you needed a smith?

847
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,461
- [upbeat orchestral music playing]
- [Ravi and Burl grunting]

848
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,009
[Ravi] I built it to your design.

849
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,678
Congalala stomach should work fine
for the steam housing.

850
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,514
Deviljho bones for the bow.

851
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,017
Never forged anything like this.
Can't promise it'll work.

852
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,855
If you're all finished, the village
has prepared something special.

853
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,399
You must eat.

854
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,943
[Nox munching]

855
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,403
What?

856
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,572
- [villagers chattering]
- [calming instrumental music playing]

857
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,789
To Timben's protectors.

858
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,500
- Good hunting!
- [Nox] Enough, already. Let's eat.

859
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,341
[Aiden]
That journal of yours is something.

860
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,522
I think I learned more flipping through it

861
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,720
than the rest
of my time trying to be a Hunter.

862
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,976
When I was about Ebbi's age,
my parents made me write down everything.

863
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,644
Needleberries, Flashbugs.

864
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,440
They were researchers.
Sticklers for accurate notes.

865
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,816
I hated it.

866
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,693
So, I got my Guild license

867
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,404
and accepted a quest
that would send me out into the world.

868
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,948
Gone for two full years.

869
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,740
Figures.

870
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:57,872
I'm about to see an Elder Dragon,
and suddenly, I'd give just about anything

871
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,459
to be back sketching bugs
and berries with them all over again.

872
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,462
"Zamite" be something wrong with you.

873
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,756
[chuckles] How come you always do that?

874
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,467
Make puns out of monster names.

875
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,601
The village I used to live in
was destroyed when I was seven,

876
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,060
overrun by monsters.

877
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,855
- [gentle music playing]
- I lost my parents.

878
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,524
I spent a long time
after that being scared.

879
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,942
Eventually...

880
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,279
I just got tired of it.

881
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,700
I figured, if I learned about monsters
and made jokes out of their names,

882
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,744
they didn't seem as scary.

883
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,540
Hmm. I'd say, "Veloci-diculous."

884
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,835
[both laugh]

885
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,673
When I was in Val Habar some years ago,

886
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,051
I remember rumors of a rogue Hunter.

887
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,930
They say he turned his back
on the Guild's philosophy.

888
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,224
Started hunting for sport,

889
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,185
taking trophies,
and selling weapons to fund his habit.

890
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,311
You came to me.

891
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,314
If you have something
you want to say to me, say it.

892
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,526
A Hunter
can easily lose his way in battle.

893
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,570
Especially alone. When we go out there...

894
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,740
I don't need a sermon
from a Hunter willing to risk <i>our </i>lives

895
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,867
to redeem <i>himself </i>from past mistakes.

896
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:23,082
Past mistakes
have a remarkable way of taking us down.

897
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,043
Well, maybe tomorrow will be a chance

898
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,421
for all of us to exorcise
some very old monsters.

899
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,007
- [woman] Watch out!
- [monster roars]

900
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,634
[villagers screaming]

901
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,583
- [Mae gasps]
- [Nadia] Move it.

902
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,180
Come on. I'm not finished eating.

903
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,600
- [Nadia] Everything's ready.
- Time to kick some Lun-<i>as</i>- tra.

904
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,978
- Really?
- [laughs] I actually liked that one.

905
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,479
Not the time.

906
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,565
[fire crackles]

907
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,571
[Lunastra growling]

908
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,489
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

909
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,204
Weapons out.

910
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,415
Whoa. She's huge.

911
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,543
- [Nadia] Cover your ears!
- [Lunastra roars]

912
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,502
[Aiden yells]

913
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,712
- [Nox] I'm out.
- Nadia.

914
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,463
- See if you can draw it off.
- Got it.

915
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,633
[Nadia] Over here, girl! This way!

916
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,138
She's not going for it.

917
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,933
[Nox] It's, uh, coming back this way!

918
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,017
Nox, go.

919
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,645
- [Lunastra growling]
- Hurry.

920
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,608
[Nox] Hyah!

921
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,152
[Lunastra snarls]

922
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,030
Oh! That's a lot of rocks.
How did that not work?

923
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,550
[Julius] It's not going to leave
the valley unless we make it.

924
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,785
- [Aiden] And now it flies?
- It'll burn the village down from the air.

925
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,412
- Ground it!
- [Nadia] Coming in!

926
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,206
[Bowgun shots echoing]

927
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,086
[Aiden] Oh no, no, no, no!

928
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,630
[groans]

929
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,381
No!

930
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,550
My brand-new shield!

931
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,552
- [screams]
- [Lunastra growling]

932
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
[Aiden] Ah!

933
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,853
- Come on!
- Look at this thing. It took me six hours.

934
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,938
Forget about it! It was terrible anyway.

935
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,399
- [Mae] Ooh!
- [Lunastra snarls]

936
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,903
[Mae grunts]
You're a lot stronger than I imagined.

937
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,950
[Ravi sighs, grunting]

938
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,495
[Lunastra growling]

939
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,247
- [Ravi] Come on!
- [blade clangs]

940
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,374
[Ravi groans]

941
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,919
We're going to draw it into position.

942
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,045
Aiden, showtime.

943
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,215
[Aiden panting]

944
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,802
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.

945
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,553
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.

946
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,682
- [Dragonator clanking]
- [electricity crackling]

947
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,350
[Lunastra roars]

948
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,521
It's time for plan Dragonator!

949
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,606
[Julius grunts]

950
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,149
[Lunastra snarls]

951
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,402
It knows!

952
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,112
- The jig is up!
- Hit it!

953
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,280
[Lunastra roars]

954
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,949
[Nox screams]

955
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,742
[Aiden yells]

956
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,417
- [Ravi] It didn't work!
- The fire damaged it.

957
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,002
[Julius]
Use the snare traps. Hold it in position.

958
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,089
[ropes straining]

959
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,717
[Lunastra growling]

960
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,138
The firing mechanism is busted!

961
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,765
[Mae] Stop the leak in the compressor,
let it pressurize.

962
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,889
Then you'll have
to trigger the Dragonator manually.

963
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,269
[Julius] See if you can fix it.

964
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,937
[Mae] Hold on.

965
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,147
We can't hold this all day.

966
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,607
[Aiden straining] Almost have it.

967
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,691
[Mae grunts]

968
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,777
- [electricity crackling]
- [Lunastra roars]

969
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,737
[Julius yells]

970
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,239
- [groans]
- [Lunastra growls]

971
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,825
[Bowgun fires]

972
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,285
You're welcome!

973
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,037
- [ropes straining]
- [Ravi groans] I'm losing it.

974
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,665
[Aiden grunts]

975
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,583
Got it!

976
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,668
- [Lunastra roars]
- [Julius grunting]

977
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:58,921
[groans]

978
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,009
[Lunastra roars]

979
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,427
[Ravi] I've got you!

980
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,222
[straining]

981
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,348
[Mae grunts]

982
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,349
[Lunastra snarls]

983
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,186
- [Mae] Ravi, get out of there.
- Get it from this end.

984
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,520
It's jammed. Hold on!

985
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,814
- [Lunastra growling]
- [Ravi grunting]

986
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,983
- Do it!
- Ravi, no!

987
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,154
- [Ravi screams]
- [Lunastra roars]

988
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,739
- No! [gasps]
- [Dragonator creaks]

989
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,449
[blasts]

990
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,075
[electricity crackles]

991
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,870
[Lunastra bellows]

992
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,872
[groans]

993
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,958
[heroic music playing]

994
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,919
[man 1] They did it!

995
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,202
- They slayed the Lunastra!
- [man 2] I knew they could!

996
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,715
- [man 3] Yes!
- [Burl] Everyone, put out the fires.

997
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,175
[Julius panting]

998
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,929
[grunts]

999
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,728
[Mae grunts]

1000
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,480
[Aiden straining]

1001
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,275
[group panting]

1002
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,289
[sighs] We did it.

1003
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,291
Everyone okay?

1004
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,922
- Ravi's dead.
- [Mae] Oh.

1005
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,590
[sniffles]

1006
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,468
[Lunastra growls]

1007
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,058
- Oh no.
- [Lunastra snarls]

1008
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,142
That's not good.

1009
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,769
[Lunastra panting]

1010
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,939
We had one shot with the Dragonator.
What do we do now?

1011
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,149
There's nothing left to do but attack.

1012
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,277
Give it everything we've got.

1013
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,612
It cannot reach the village.

1014
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,614
Here. Fight with this.

1015
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,243
- [Julius] Hmm.
- [Aiden] Wait.

1016
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,328
Dual Blades. They work separately,

1017
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,746
but always together.

1018
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,207
- [Nadia] Hey, what the...?
- Aiden, what are you doing?

1019
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,458
I have a plan.

1020
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,461
Julius, you have to trust me. I need time.

1021
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,840
You'll have it. What are you going to do?

1022
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,925
Restore balance.

1023
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,430
[Lunastra growling weakly]

1024
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,725
Did Aiden just run away
with all of my ammunition?

1025
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,519
Uh, yeah. He says he needs some time.

1026
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,605
No problem. Ideas how to do that?

1027
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,064
- [woman] Watch out!
- [Aiden] Nox!

1028
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,691
Get everyone out of the village!

1029
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,444
Oh man. It's time for plan panic.

1030
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,571
[villagers screaming and clamoring]

1031
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,949
[Julius] Fall back.
Use the buildings for cover.

1032
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,538
Julius, the villagers.

1033
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,622
Go to them.

1034
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,876
- I'm out. [grunts]
- [Bowgun clicks]

1035
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,669
[Nadia yells]

1036
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,129

[Julius groans]

1039
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,138
Please work. Please work.
Please work. Please work.

1040
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,975
Please work. Please work. Please work.

1041
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,487
[Mae] Go for its essence.

1042
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,988
[Paisley buzzing]

1043
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,991
[Lunastra roars]

1044
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,970
- [woman] The fire's spreading.
- [Burl] More buckets!

1045
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,348
- [woman] Hurry. We gotta get outta here.
- I'm not leaving.

1046
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,416
- You have to get out of here. Now.
- Here.

1047
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,795
- Oh no, Ebbi. You have to go.
- [Ebbi] But I... I'm helping.

1048
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,880
[Lunastra growls]

1049
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,510

[Mae gasps]

1052
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:36,890
Paisley.

1053
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,018
[Paisley buzzes weakly, crackles]

1054
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,605
Here we go.

1055
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,649
[Lunastra growling]

1056
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,732
[Mae] Take her.

1057
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,361
- No! Stop!
- [dramatic music resumes playing]

1058
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,073

[Lunastra roars]

1060
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,330
[Mae] Hyah!

1061
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,542
- [Lunastra snarls]
- [Mae grunting]

1062
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,627
[Mae yells]

1063
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,254
[Lunastra growling]

1064
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,464
[Mae panting]

1065
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,342
- [Lunastra roars]
- [Ebbi] Mae!

1066
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,553
- Mae.
- [Nadia] Oh no.

1067
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,740
- [Lunastra snarls]
- [Julius] No!

1068
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,516
[grunting]

1069
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,227
[Lunastra growling]

1070
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,896
[Nadia] It's dander.
It'll ignite the whole village.

1071
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,149
Go! Go! Run!

1072
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,232
[Nadia] Get out!

1073
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,862

1075
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,949
[man] No!

1076

- [Burl] The Gargwa coops!
- [villagers screaming]

1077
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,749
[Aiden groans] Son of a...

1078
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,501
- [Nadia groans]
- [Julius coughing]

1079
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,297
[Nadia grunts]

1080
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,091
[Julius groans, panting]

[both panting]

1084
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,313
Spark. Spark. Spark.
Spark. Spark. Spark.

1085
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:07,898
Yes!

1086
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,483
[Lunastra continues growling]

1087
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,028
[explosion blasts]

1088
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,535
[Aiden grunts]

1089
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,790
- Oh! [shouts]
- [heroic orchestral music playing]

1090
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,959
Ha-ha! Plan boomerang saves the day.

1091
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,964
What was Aiden's idea again?

1092
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,008
Go!

1093
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,511
- [villagers shouting]
- [Nadia grunting]

1094
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,263

1095
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,890
[Julius grunts]

1096
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:43,850
Watch out!

1097
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,395
- [shouts]
- [Lunastra snarls]

1098
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,067
[cries]

1099
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,906
[Julius sighs]

1100
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,409
[coughs] Bleh.

1101
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,670
- [birds singing]
- [gentle orchestral music playing]

1102
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,555
[Daazel]
Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.

1103
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,975
Because of you, the balance of nature

1104
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,978
can be brought back to this village.

1105
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,063
Thank you.

1106
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,984
There is no blame.

1107
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,153
It was their choice.

1108
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,906
They followed you
into an unwinnable battle.

1109
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,369
To treat it as anything less
would diminish what they gave. And why.

1110
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,746
No. It wasn't me they followed.

1111
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,918
They followed something larger,
a balance each of us hope to find.

1112
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,508
- [Nox sniffles]
- Here. This is Mae's journal.

1113
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:03,388
You keep it. It has instructions
to make that Rathalos antidote in it.

1114
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,225
I made my own journal
to start my own path...

1115
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,936
just like Mae.

1116
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,405
Timben will be in good hands
with you here to protect it.

1117
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,515
[soaring orchestral music playing]

1118
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,476
Hold up! Wait! [panting]

1119
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,729
[exhales] Where will you go next?

1120
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:53,812
Dundorma.

1121
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,566
The Guild will need to know
what happened here.

1122
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,277
I want to come with you.

1123
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,532
There's a bigger picture out there,
beyond me, beyond Timben.

1124
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,827
You taught me that
the night we first saw the Lunastra.

1125
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,205
There are bigger threats out there.

1126
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,500
If I'm gonna face them,
I need to become an Ace Hunter.

1127
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,378
[Julius] Hmm.

1128
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,259
That's a good "hmm."
I've known him a long time.

1129
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,720
And if I am translating correctly,
that means,

1130
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,515
[imitating Julius] "Why, Aiden,
you've come such a long way."

1131
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,434
"I would be thrilled
to take you on as my cadet."

1132
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,271
- [Julius grunts]
- [Aiden] That's "ama-Zinogre"!

1133
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,813
[Julius groans]

1134
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,525
[Aiden] Hey, some people like my puns.
Right, Nadia?

1135
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,485
[Nadia] That one was bad.

1136
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,406
[crew members chattering]

1137
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,201
That was pretty fantastic.

1138
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,079
Yeah, like that story
about you taking on the Zamtrios.

1139
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,833
Hey, that really happened, okay?
I came under it. I swept, all right?

1140
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,877
This wasn't one of <i>those </i>stories,

1141
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,378
was it?

1142
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,548
Read this.

1143
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,428
[theme music playing]

1144
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,764
Wow. It's Mae's last entry to her parents.

1145
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,311
[Mae]
<i>I have enjoyed every moment of my journey.</i>

1146
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,230
<i>Father and Mother,
you have taught me well.</i>

1147
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,608
<i>I think I understand now
why this world needs a Guild</i>

1148
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,695
<i>and people like you
to teach them how to live in harmony.</i>

1149
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,698
<i>Tonight, I joined a team of Hunters.</i>

1150
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,452
<i>The mission
we are going on is truly dangerous.</i>

1151
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,329
<i>I fear it may be my last,</i>

1152
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,706
<i>but interestingly, I'm not afraid.</i>

1153
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:39,085
<i>For these Hunters I fight with
are intelligent, caring, courageous,</i>

1154
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,837
<i>and they brighten my world.</i>

1155
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,548
<i>My heart is filled with hope.</i>

1156
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,091
