1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,922
- Hi, everybody. I'm Phil Lord.
- And I'm Chris Miller.

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,883
This is "Alt Universe Mode."

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:10,178
When we were making the movie,
we tried a lot of different scenes,

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,890
jokes, ideas, moments that didn't
make it into the finished film.

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,641
But in another universe...

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,811
Who knows? We do. And now you do.

7
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,706
There's gonna be
some stuff that's not finished.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,482
And I promise you,
from the very first frame,

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,776
this will be a different experience.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,821
- Enjoy "Alt Universe Mode."
- It's glorious.

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,598
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

12
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,184
Don't worry, people. It's 100% beef.

13
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,144
I'm lying.

14
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:03,064
Nothing's gonna get in the way
of me eating this hot dog.

15
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,859
What am I, pulled pork?

16
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,488
What... What?

17
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,365
I've been pig-napped.

18
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,869
So glad you could make it
to my pig roast, Spider-Ham.

19
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:19,622
Prepare to be honey "glasered."

20
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,500
Do you have any last words?

21
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,918
Why, yes, I do.

22
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,087
- You won't get away with this!
- Oh, yes, I will.

23
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,522
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

24
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,774
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

25
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,383
Oh, no, you won't. Oh, yes, I will.

26
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,818
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

27
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,986
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,887
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

29
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,015
And if you'll excuse me,
I've got a hot dog to eat.

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:47,525
No one tricks me, not I,
the intellectual genius, Dr. Craw-daddy.

31
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,028
Weird name.
I wonder if it could use a little work.

32
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:51,946
Oh, really?

33
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:56,284
I tango with guys like Annihil-ape,
Goose Cannon, The Majestic Cara-boom,

34
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,745
Cyber Billy Goat, Rene-gator,
Baked Clam-urai, Tortoise Bombshell,

35
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,498
Tele-canary, WM-bees,
Nuclear Boar-head, guys like that.

36
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,835
You wanna run with the big hogs,
you gotta nail that pun or you're done.

37
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,336
Now let's see here.

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,548
The Craw-ster, Scare-craw, Craw Maga,
that's pretty good.

39
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,301
Uh, I think I like the first one better.

40
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,802
- I don't know.
- I got it!

41
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,514
How about Dr. Crawfish, Attorney-at-Craw?

42
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,434
It was just a first pass.

43
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,567
- Enough hogwash!
- Now you're getting it.

44
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,750
Hold it!

45
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,919
Am I crazy, or is this the same room
we were just in?

46
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,212
Yeah, we ran out of money,

47
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,090
so I just figured we'd have
every room look the same.

48
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,355
Well, you mess with the Ham,
you get the hammer.

49
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,402
Now, that hot dog must be getting cold.

50
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,824
What is that? What is that!

51
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,452
I demand full-screen treatment.

52
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,536
Whoa!

53
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,374
Hey, I'm standing here!

54
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,418
Didn't you tell your experiments
that it's rude to point, Dr. Ding-Dong?

55
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:36,926
Hey, guys.
Calibrate your screen every now and then.

56
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,929
My outlines. My outlines.

57
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,515
My outlines!

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,018
Okay. Nobody look.

59
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,437
That's better.

60
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,856
Boy, that was weird.

61
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,781
What? A portal
to another movie's timeline?

62
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,576
I hope I haven't missed
the first 62 minutes!

63
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:07,373
All I wanted was a hot dog!

64
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,170
Oh, come on.

65
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,172
<i>All right, let's do this one last time.</i>

66
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,341
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

67
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,968
<i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

68
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,764
<i>And for 10 years, I've been the one...</i>

69
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,432
<i>and only...</i>

70
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,683
<i>Spider-Man.</i>

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,352
<i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i>

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,688
With great power comes
great responsibility.

73
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,068
<i>I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.</i>

74
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,490
<i>And then I saved the city again.
And again and again and again.</i>

75
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:05,824
<i>And I did, uh...</i>

76
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,118
<i>I did this.</i>

77
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,665
<i>We don't really talk about this.</i>

78
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,167
<i>Look, I'm a comic book. I'm a cereal.</i>

79
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,502
<i>Did a Christmas album.</i>

80
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,296
<i>I have an excellent theme song.</i>

81
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,466
<i>And a so-so popsicle.</i>

82
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,176
<i>I mean, I've looked worse.</i>

83
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>But after everything...</i>

84
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,015
<i>I still love being Spider-Man.</i>

85
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,433
<i>I mean, who wouldn't?</i>

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,769
<i>So no matter how many hits I take...</i>

87
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:39,024
<i>I always find a way to come back.</i>

88
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,279
<i>Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion...</i>

89
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>is me.</i>

90
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,074
<i>There's only one Spider-Man.</i>

91
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,703
<i>And you're lookin' at him.</i>

92
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,179
Miles!

93
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,016
Miles, <i>papá,</i> time for school!

94
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,435
Miles!

95
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,354
Miles!

96
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,440
- Miles!
- Yeah! Yeah?

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,859
Are you finished packing for school?

98
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,152
Yeah.

99
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,822
Just ironing my last shirt.

100
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,120
Come on! You a grown man now.
Let's show these teachers that.

101
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,121
Miles!

102
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,290
Where's my laptop?

103
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,751
If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.

104
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,044
No, Dad, I'll walk.

105
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,005
- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.

106
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,674
- Miles! Gotta go.
- In a minute!

107
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,509
- Gotta go.
- In a minute!

108
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,429
- Mom, I gotta go.
- In a minute.

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,061
See you Friday.

110
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,440
Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?

111
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,943
Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'?

112
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,655
Yo, Miles!
You feel that earthquake last night?

113
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,533
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

114
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,494
- How's that new school?
- So easy.

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,830
- We miss you, Miles.
- You miss me? I still live here!

116
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,582
Wait, you miss me?

117
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,466
<i>Contra!</i>

118
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,011
Oh, come on.

119
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,057
Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

120
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,494
You can walk plenty on Saturday
when you peel those stickers off.

121
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,436
You saw that? I don't know if that was me.

122
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,855
And the two from yesterday on Clinton.

123
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,857
Yeah, those were me.

124
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,319
Look at that. Another new coffee shop.

125
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,154
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

126
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,073
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

127
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,159
"Foam Party"? Come on.

128
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,286
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

129
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,287
I see it.

130
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,374
- Is that a coffee shop or a disco?
- Dad, you're old, man.

131
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,919
<i>There are multiple reports of another
mysterious seismic event last night.</i>

132
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,839
<i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i>

133
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,550
Spider-Man.
I mean, this guy swings in once a day...

134
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,196
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

135
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,345
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

136
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,930
Meanwhile, my guys are out there...

137
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,266
lives on the line, no masks.

138
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,227
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

139
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,312
With great ability comes
great accountability.

140
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,981
That's not even how the saying goes.

141
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,400
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

142
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,735
Oh, my gosh. Don't cops run red lights?

143
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,864
Oh, yeah, some do. But not your dad.

144
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,543
Why can't I go back to Brooklyn Middle?

145
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,337
You've given it two weeks.
We're not having this conversation.

146
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,090
- I just think that this new school is elitist.
- "Elitist"?

147
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,260
And I would prefer to be
at a normal school among the people.

148
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,179
"The people"? These are your people.

149
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,723
I'm only here
'cause I won that stupid lottery.

150
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,392
No way. You passed the entry test
just like everybody else.

151
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,187
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

152
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,539
You wanna end up like your uncle?

153
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,274
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

154
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,276
We all make choices in life.

155
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,087
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

156
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,321
You don't!

157
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,960
I love you, Miles.

158
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,922
Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday.

159
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,512
- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?

160
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,264
- I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
- You wanna hear me say it?

161
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,242
- You're dropping me off at a school.
- "I love you, Dad."

162
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,935
- Look at this place.
- "Dad, I love you."

163
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,648
Dad, I love you.

164
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,982
That's a copy.

165
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,318
<i>Tie your shoes, please.</i>

166
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,781
"I love you, Dad."

167
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,493
Hey, good morning. How you doin'?

168
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,079
- Weekend was short, huh?
- "That's a copy."

169
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh, my gosh! This is embarrassing.
We wore the same jacket.

170
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,293
Hey. Your shoe's untied.

171
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,046
Yeah, I'm aware. It's a choice.

172
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,428
Who can solve this for XY?

173
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,641
And that is known as a syllogism.

174
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,185
Read two chapters
of <i>Great Expectations.</i>

175
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,646
A take-home quiz on volumetric pressure.

176
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,023
Five-page essay
with your conclusions stressed.

177
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,242
<i>Countless other possibilities.</i>

178
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,995
<i>There could be a universe
where I am wearing red.</i>

179
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,497
<i>Or wearing leather pants.</i>

180
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,917
Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.

181
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,378
Einstein said time was relative, right?

182
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,674
Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.

183
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,555
Sorry. It was just so quiet.

184
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,059
Would you like to keep standing there,
or do you wanna sit down?

185
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,647
<i>Our universe is, in fact,
one of many parallel universes...</i>

186
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,567
<i>happening at the exact same time.</i>

187
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,920
<i>Thanks to everyone here
at the Fisk Family Foundation...</i>

188
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,030
- I liked your joke.
- Really?

189
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,283
I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.

190
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,577
But it was smart, so I liked it.

191
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,872
I don't think I've seen you before.

192
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,457
<i>Every choice that we make...</i>

193
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,877
<i>would create countless
other possibilities.</i>

194
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,463
<i>A what-if to infinity.</i>

195
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,798
A zero?

196
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,552
A few more of those, you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?

197
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,930
Maybe I'm just not right for this school.

198
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,075
If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers...

199
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,809
on a true-or-false quiz at random...

200
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,686
do you know
what score they would get?

201
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,563
- 50%?
- That's right!

202
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,068
The only way to get all the answers wrong
is to know which answers are right.

203
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,612
You're trying to quit.

204
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,239
And I'm not gonna let you.

205
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,368
I'm assigning you a personal essay.

206
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,620
<i>Not about physics, but about you...</i>

207
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,790
<i>and what kind of person
you want to be.</i>

208
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,917
Dude, can I get some help on this?

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,544
When I'm not trying to sleep, yes.

210
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,547
- Fine.
- You got this, man.

211
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,591
Okay. Thanks.

212
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,934
<i>You are watching live</i>

213
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,395
<i>as Spider-Man appears
to be battling another super</i>

214
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,939
<i>near Queens Presbyterian Church.</i>

215
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,357
<i>Meanwhile today,</i>

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,195
<i>the Bureau of Superhero Affairs addresses
the growing regulatory controversy,</i>

217
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,656
<i>all on the heels of the news
that Spider-Man...</i>

218
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,990
Superhero.

219
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,260
Take a look at my boys in blue,
they're your superheroes.

220
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,120
Good timing. Dinner's almost ready.

221
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,931
If I hear one more person
mention superheroes,

222
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,456
I'm gonna have 'em arrested.

223
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,961
- Oh! My chicken <i>adobo.</i>
- Iron Man's favorite.

224
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,256
Oh! It's like that, huh? All right.
Drop the spoon. You're coming with me.

225
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,175
Jeff, not in front of our special guest.

226
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,553
- Hey, pops.
- Miles!

227
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,637
Oh!

228
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:09,015
So, to what do we owe
this midweek pleasure?

229
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,561
So I have
a bit of an announcement to make.

230
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,860
I've decided to leave Visions Academy
and go back to Brooklyn Middle.

231
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,905
- Oh, you decided?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,699
Like a unilateral decision?

233
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,995
Yeah, if, uh, unilateral means
what I'm picking up it means

234
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,080
from the context of what you're saying.

235
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,082
Well, I have to say I don't agree.

236
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,585
Jeff, what are your thoughts
on Miles's decision?

237
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,422
Oh, I have a lot of thoughts,
which is why I'm not saying any of them.

238
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,926
I hate it there. I miss my friends.
And I'm never gonna succeed.

239
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,848
I made a difficult personal decision
to give up trying.

240
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,808
I think I'm very brave.

241
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,146
Nobody quits in this house, love.

242
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,064
Well, there is a first
for everything, right?

243
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,858
I'm like a pioneer.

244
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,777
You wanna quit something?

245
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,906
Quit messing with that graffiti
before I book you on a 1029-G myself.

246
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,241
- And you know I would.
- Jeff, <i>porfa.</i>

247
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,746
Don't you have better things to do than
to arrest your son for making public art?

248
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,229
- I mean, what are you, the fun police now?
- Miles, <i>mi hijo.</i>

249
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,167
Heck, yes, I'm the fun police.

250
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,461
I'm the doggone commissioner
of the fun police.

251
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,744
Well maybe I'll just save the fun
for when I quit school

252
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,507
and I move in with Uncle Aaron.

253
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,600
De-escalated that one.

254
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,087
Uncle Aaron! Hey! Were you scared?

255
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,385
You want that?

256
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,347
- What's up with school?
- Going great! Got tons of friends.

257
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,059
You can't tell me it's all that bad there.
Smart girls is where it's at.

258
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,352
Place must be full of 'em.

259
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,147
No, there's no one.

260
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,067
Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine
on the streets with no game.

261
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,402
Hey, I got game.

262
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:30,156
There's a new girl. Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me. You know how it is.

263
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,741
What's her name?

264
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,537
You know, we layin' down
the groundwork right now.

265
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,248
You know about the shoulder touch?

266
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,083
'Course I do.

267
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,877
But tell me anyway.

268
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,672
Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:

269
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,675
"Hey."

270
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,387
- You serious, Uncle Aaron?
- I'm tellin' you, man, it's science.

271
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,849
So walk up to her and be like: "Hey."

272
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,977
No, no, no, no. Like: "Hey."

273
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,186
"Hey."

274
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,980
No. "Hey."

275
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,774
"Hey."

276
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,779
You sure you my nephew, man?
Is that her?

277
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,366
I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.

278
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,661
Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?

279
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,664
Naw, man. You know my dad. I can't.

280
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,917
Come on.
I got a spot you ain't gon' believe.

281
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,669
Naw, I can't. I can't. Can't.

282
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,672
I'm gonna get in so much trouble.

283
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,675
Hey, man.
Tell him your art teacher made you.

284
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,473
- How'd you know about this place?
- Did an engineering job down here.

285
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,365
What's up?

286
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,533
Yeah, man, I knew we were related.

287
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,244
Whoa!

288
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,665
Brooklyn!

289
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,544
There's a lot of history on these walls.

290
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,506
This is so fresh.

291
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,224
And now you on your own, Miles.

292
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,311
Whoa, slow down a little.

293
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,521
That's better.

294
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,114
See what you got now?
Makin' mistakes is part of it.

295
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,330
The real Miles comin' outta hidin'.

296
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,009
Now you can cut that line
with another color.

297
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,220
Little help?

298
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,474
Did you want drips?

299
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,561
'Cause if you do, that's cool,
but if you don't, you gotta keep it moving.

300
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:05,854
That's intentional.

301
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,405
- Is it too crazy?
- No, man.

302
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,158
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.

303
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,912
Yeah. You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.

304
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,497
- Stop lyin'.
- It's true.

305
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,626
Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know...

306
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,671
He's a good guy, just...

307
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:32,839
You know what I'm sayin'.

308
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,180
All right, come on, man. I gotta roll.

309
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,247
Dude.

310
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,208
I gotta tell you something big.

311
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,834
I hope you don't hate me.

312
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,841
Hot, right? Right?

313
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,803
Seriously? You didn't hear a word I said?

314
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,264
I can stop dropping these sick beats
and help you prepare for your speech.

315
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,557
Never mind.

316
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,476
You're not quitting on me, right?

317
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,436
Nobody likes a quitter.

318
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,313
And nobody likes this beat either.

319
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,472
What?

320
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,889
Spider!

321
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,309
- Oh! Get it off!
- Spider!

322
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,563
Spider!

323
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,527
No! No!

324
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,753
<i>That's weird.</i>

325
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,880
<i>My pants shrank.</i>

326
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,423
I think I hit puberty.

327
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,141
<i>I gotta get new pants.</i>

328
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,019
<i>Wait. Why is the voice in my head
so loud?</i>

329
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,228
What?

330
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,107
- Are you okay?
- What?

331
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,734
<i>Why am I so sweaty?</i>

332
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,027
Why are you so sweaty?

333
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,905
It's a puberty thing.

334
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,616
I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.

335
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,286
I did, but I'm done.

336
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,747
I'm a man.

337
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,917
So you're, like, new here, right?
We got that in common.

338
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,002
Yeah. That's one thing.

339
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,462
Cool. Yeah.

340
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,463
I'm Miles.

341
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,591
I'm Gwe... anda.

342
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,301
Wait, your name is Gwanda?

343
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,846
Yes, it's African. I'm South African.

344
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,016
No accent though
'cause I was raised here.

345
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,770
<i>Do the shoulder touch now
before she walks away.</i>

346
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,274
<i>Why is this so scary?</i>

347
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,821
<i>Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?</i>

348
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,367
I'm kidding.
It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy.

349
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,328
Hey.

350
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,415
Okay, then.

351
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,624
I'll see you around.

352
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,836
See you.

353
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,046
- Sorry.
- Hey.

354
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,633
- Oh, crap.
- Can you let go, please?

355
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,636
- I can't let go.
- Calm down. It's fine.

356
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,807
- Miles, let go.
- Workin' on it.

357
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,475
It's just puberty.

358
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:58,312
I don't think you know what puberty is.
Just relax.

359
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,897
- Okay, I have a plan.
- Great.

360
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,151
- I'm gonna pull really hard.
- That's a terrible plan.

361
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,318
- One.
- Don't do this.

362
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,486
- Two.
- Three!

363
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,745
Nice to meet you?

364
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,831
Sure. Total pleasure.

365
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,423
<i>No one saw. It's okay.</i>

366
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,760
<i>No one knows, no one knows.</i>

367
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,263
<i>Everyone knows.</i>

368
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,809
<i>Everyone knows. They're talkin'
'bout me. They saw everything!</i>

369
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,811
<i>He knows. She knows. They know.</i>

370
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,313
<i>Wow, she's super tall.</i>

371
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,191
<i>Why is he smiling? Am I
the weird guy now? What am I doing?</i>

372
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,609
That guy's such a weirdo.

373
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,360
<i>How do I stop?</i>

374
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,865
<i>Can they hear my thoughts?!
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!</i>

375
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,701
Hey! I know you snuck out last night,
Morales.

376
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,161
<i>Play dumb!</i>

377
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,579
Who's Morales?

378
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,372
<i>Not that dumb!</i>

379
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,874
Hey!

380
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,873
Hey.

381
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,582
Wha...

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,127
How are you...

383
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,087
How?

384
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,675
Oh, that's how.

385
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,637
- Wow, you are really stuck up there.
- Thank you for that insight.

386
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,516
- Whose hair is that? That's her hair.
- Get me down.

387
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,060
- How?
- I don't know. You're smarter than me.

388
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,943
This is probably gonna hurt you
more than it's gonna hurt me.

389
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,996
That is such a terrible idea.

390
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,013
- Ganke.
- What? My lips are chapped.

391
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,435
Whoa, dude.
That's an accident waiting to happen.

392
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,562
It's okay. I have a low center of gravity.

393
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,606
I guess that makes sense.

394
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,359
Hey. That's good. Keep doing that.

395
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,405
- Let go. Let go.
- But I'll fall on the ladder.

396
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,498
Hey, you know what? I take back that part
about you being smarter than me.

397
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,132
Dude, what's that?

398
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,536
- It's where the spider bit me yesterday.
- You're kidding.

399
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,178
Oh, my God.

400
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,348
This is the coolest,
most amazing thing ever.

401
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,474
What is?

402
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,478
You're... You're the Spider-Man.

403
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,355
- BS.
- Seriously.

404
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,856
There's already a Spider-Man.

405
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,817
And I'm pretty sure he could sue us
just for saying "Spider-Man."

406
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,171
- You grew an inch overnight.
- I'm having a growth spurt.

407
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,948
- You took the doorknob off a door.
- It's a public building.

408
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,509
- You got stuck to the new girl.
- It's just some puberty thing.

409
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,410
And you are very poorly informed
about puberty.

410
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,788
- I'm not Spider-Man!
- You can climb walls.

411
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,791
- But I can't spin webs out of my veins.
- Neither can he!

412
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,169
- Really? I thought...
- He uses mechanical web shooters.

413
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,631
The fact you can't spin webs is just
another way in which you are Spider-Man.

414
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,633
- Uh-uh. No way.
- I'll prove it.

415
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,779
You've seriously never seen this before?

416
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,846
Couldn't we just have
watched this on YouTube?

417
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,765
I'm morally opposed to stealing movies.

418
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,143
It would just be easier than sneaking into
the library in the middle of the night.

419
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:09,105
Oh, yeah, and then no one could ever
make money making movies,

420
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,108
so movies would never exist,
so then it would be harder.

421
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,276
Burn.

422
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,322
Okay.

423
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,584
He's the motion picture,
or he's Spider-Man?

424
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,669
Shut up.

425
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,630
- What's the bad-guy plot in this one?
- Honestly, I don't remember.

426
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,231
<i>Scientist...</i>

427
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,694
<i>entrepreneur...</i>

428
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,072
<i>billionaire.</i>

429
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,116
<i>What most people don't know about me</i>

430
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,994
<i>is that I'm also
the world's toughest crime fighter.</i>

431
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,124
Dobby, no!

432
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,962
Yeah!

433
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,466
That part they made up.

434
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,093
Most of the evidence points
to Spidey being a Russian acrobat,

435
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,596
this guy from Cirque du Soleil
who mysteriously died

436
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,473
the same year Spider-Man became active.

437
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,350
- Or did he?
- Exactly.

438
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,186
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Will Gluck.</i>

439
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:35,024
<i>And this is the commentary track
for</i> Spider-Man: The Motion Picture.

440
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,818
<i>But you probably know that already.</i>

441
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:41,572
<i>Yeah, there's our star, Todd Crews,
politely laughing in the background.</i>

442
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,533
<i>And we have a very special guest
on the commentary,</i>

443
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,494
<i>a consultant for the film.</i>

444
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,039
<i>His voice has actually been altered
to protect his identity,</i>

445
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,832
<i>the actual Spider-Man.</i>

446
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,585
<i>- Spidey?
- Happy to be here.</i>

447
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,507
Can we just fast-forward
to whatever part you wanted to show me?

448
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,716
No.

449
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,968
<i>It was really cold when we shot this.</i>

450
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,429
- Okay, yeah.
<i>- The intricacies of filmmaking is such</i>

451
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,724
<i>that even though the weather
determines the outcome,</i>

452
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:13,270
<i>we have to kind of fake it
for the story terms.</i>

453
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,731
Miles. Look. Look familiar?

454
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,317
If I got stuck to a sweet Maserati,
this wouldn't be so bad.

455
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,027
<i>See those little microscopic talons</i>

456
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,321
<i>that Jim zooms in to so brilliantly?</i>

457
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,615
<i>We shot your real fingers
for this part. Remember?</i>

458
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,242
<i>You shot my actual fingers.</i>

459
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,952
<i>We changed a lot about the details,</i>

460
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,955
<i>about my real life,
to protect the people I love.</i>

461
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,998
<i>But what you see on screen is real.
That's what my fingers do.</i>

462
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:37,920
QED, i.e., AKA, I win.

463
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,630
- But...
- You don't want to miss this.

464
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,383
<i>So how did you get your hand
off the gearshift of your Maserati?</i>

465
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,429
<i>I don't drive a Maserati.
I just had to learn to relax.</i>

466
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,515
<i>You gotta get those little guys
in your fingers to chill out.</i>

467
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,767
<i>In through your nose...</i>

468
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,562
<i>- out through...
- The mouth!</i>

469
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,356
<i>- You do yoga, right?
- Always. Have to.</i>

470
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,482
Good advice, right?

471
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,527
Dude, we can use this as a guidebook
for how to handle your powers.

472
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,322
<i>We did keep Uncle Ben's death
just as it happened, Spidey.</i>

473
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,368
<i>It's the singular motivating incident
of your origin story.</i>

474
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,912
<i>You mean my life.</i>

475
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:15,833
We've just got to find your Uncle Ben,
whoever or whatever that is.

476
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,961
To fill out my origin story?
I'm just a normal kid from Brooklyn.

477
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,921
Which is the start
of a perfect origin story!

478
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,799
Don't you get it? You're Spider-Man, man!

479
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,265
- What's your problem?
- I don't wanna be a superhero.

480
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,267
Someday that movie will be about you.

481
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,186
I don't want there to be a movie about me.

482
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,998
- I want a movie about me!
- Then it should have been you who got bit.

483
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,233
I mean, probably, yeah.
Would have made a lot more sense, right?

484
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,028
Wait. Where are we going?

485
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,742
Whoa! So you can do that now.

486
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,745
I wanna know
what the hell kind of spider bit me.

487
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,623
Jeez. The maintenance staff
certainly isn't very thorough.

488
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,210
- Holy crap.
- Roxxon.

489
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,045
That's not just any spider.

490
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,758
So what's an experimental spider
branded by a massive tech conglomerate

491
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,092
doing in the music room?

492
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,011
What if it hitched a ride in my backpack?

493
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,431
In the tunnel.
They had their name all over that tunnel.

494
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,892
And if that did all this,

495
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,353
whoever did this to that
can maybe undo that to me.

496
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,522
Wait, what? You can't do that.

497
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,527
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to undo all this.

498
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,362
Whoa! What? That's crazy.

499
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,948
That's the least crazy thing
anyone has said for hours.

500
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,033
You can't just not do anything with this.

501
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,116
I'm 13!

502
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,787
Yeah, but you might save the universe
or something.

503
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,539
I don't wanna save the universe.

504
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,290
I wanna play video games.

505
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,460
Most video games are about saving
the universe. This is better.

506
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:42,836
Just stop it.

507
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,921
Miles...

508
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:48,425
with great power
comes great responsibility.

509
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:49,635
Why?

510
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,078
The world already has a guy
who's great at being Spider-Man.

511
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,140
I wanna be an ex-Spider-Man.
I wanna be a normal person.

512
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,602
I wanna go a normal school, and I wanna
hang out with my normal friends.

513
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,112
- Gotcha.
- That's not how I meant it.

514
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,781
Yeah, no. Totally. I get it.

515
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:15,035
I just feel more comfortable
around people who are... less smart.

516
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,119
Thank you.

517
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,801
You're the only thing about this place
I don't wanna get away from.

518
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,001
- I'm just really freaked out.
- Yeah.

519
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,461
Yeah, I'll bet.

520
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,883
Just take a deep breath, all right?

521
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,263
Like in the movie,
which is otherwise terrible.

522
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,607
Damn.

523
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,192
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.

524
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,154
Come back, and we can talk about it
in the morning.

525
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,573
- Sure.
- No. No, really.

526
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,201
Promise me, like a normal friend.

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,204
Yeah, okay. I promise.

528
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,779
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

529
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,048
<i>I'm right here.</i>

530
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,634
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

531
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,517
<i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i>

532
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,191
<i>Way over there.</i>

533
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,401
<i>You're like me.</i>

534
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,194
<i>Miles. Look out.</i>

535
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,947
<i>- I don't wanna be a hero.
- Miles.</i>

536
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,081
Norman, listen to me.

537
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,791
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

538
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,711
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

539
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,588
Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

540
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,007
It's not up to me.

541
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,676
<i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i>

542
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,927
Why won't you quit?!

543
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,888
I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked
into a black hole.

544
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,098
I think I'm gonna go.

545
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,767
Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.

546
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,941
No! No!

547
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,634
What now?

548
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,261
What is this place?

549
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,415
Did you know your shoes are untied?

550
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,128
This is a onesie,
so I don't really have to worry about it.

551
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,054
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

552
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:03,639
I don't wanna be.

553
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,475
I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.

554
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,353
Got a lot going through your head,
I'm sure.

555
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,354
Yeah.

556
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,606
You're gonna be fine. I can help you.

557
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,733
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

558
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,610
Yeah.

559
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,823
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick...

560
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,717
before the space-time continuum
collapses.

561
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,784
Don't move.

562
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,789
See you in a bit.

563
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:40,926
<i>How does he do that?</i>

564
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,473
Is it here? No, no, it's here.

565
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,809
All right, folks.

566
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,060
I always get this wrong.

567
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,187
Oh, boy.

568
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,605
Prowler.

569
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,402
Man, I was in the middle of something.

570
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,616
I am so tired.

571
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,372
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

572
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,214
That all you got?

573
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,801
Aw, so gross.

574
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,221
<i>I should go up there and help him.</i>

575
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,433
<i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i>

576
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:38,066
Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.

577
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,943
You like my new toy?

578
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:44,823
Cost me a fortune,
but, hey, can't take it with you, right?

579
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,160
You came all this way. Watch the test.

580
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,019
It's a hell of a freaking light show.
You're gonna love this.

581
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,085
No! No, don't do this! Stop!

582
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:01,048
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

583
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,523
I see multiple dimensions opening!

584
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,487
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

585
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,572
It's unstable! We should stop.

586
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,545
Norm, what's your take on head trauma?

587
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,343
I tried to warn you, pal.

588
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,150
Goblin, no! Get him outta there!

589
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,283
<i>Wilson! Where are we?</i>

590
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,912
<i>Really weird.</i>

591
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,455
<i>Wilson!</i>

592
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,074
Hey! Are you okay?

593
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,493
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.

594
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,748
- Can't you get up?
- Yeah.

595
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,250
Yeah, I always get up.

596
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,045
The coughing's probably not a good sign.

597
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,088
Find him. Now.

598
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,966
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

599
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,303
This override key is the only way
to stop the collider.

600
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,931
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

601
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,349
You need to hide your face.

602
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,643
You don't tell anyone who you are.

603
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,980
No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.

604
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,484
If he turns the machine on again,
everything you know will disappear.

605
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,402
Your family, everyone.

606
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,196
Everyone.

607
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,240
Promise me you'll do this.

608
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,954
I promise.

609
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,957
Go. Destroy the collider.

610
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,501
I'll come and find you.

611
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,504
It's gonna be okay.

612
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,515
Tombstone. We're done with tests.

613
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,394
Get that thing ready to go again.
And soon.

614
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,355
Run faster!

615
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:04,564
These guys are weak.

616
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,735
I'd say it's nice to see you again,
Spider-Man, but it's not.

617
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,779
Hey, Kingpin. How's business?

618
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,239
Boomin'.

619
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,574
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

620
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,161
This might open a black hole
under Brooklyn.

621
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,747
It can't be worth the risk.

622
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,625
It's not always about the money,
Spider-Man.

623
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,341
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

624
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,509
Wait.

625
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,513
I know what you're trying to do...

626
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,473
and it won't work.

627
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,683
They're gone.

628
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,031
Get rid of the body.

629
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,784
What was that?

630
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,830
Kill that guy.

631
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,867
Stop sticking!

632
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,388
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

633
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,415
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

634
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:38,510
Police! Put your hands up!

635
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,262
Miles? Miles?

636
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:46,268
Why aren't you at school?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

637
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,561
Miles? <i>¿Qué te pasa?</i>

638
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,774
Is it the earthquake?

639
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,069
Can I sleep here tonight?

640
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:59,572
Miles. It's a weeknight.
You made a commitment to that school.

641
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,157
He's upset.

642
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,829
Of course you can stay.

643
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,373
- Dad?
- Yeah.

644
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,502
Do you really hate Spider-Man?

645
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,298
Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...

646
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,508
Jeff, <i>mi amor.</i>

647
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:23,179
What? He asked me. Baby, you know
how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.

648
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,308
<i>Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.</i>

649
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,228
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

650
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,733
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

651
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,111
Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.

652
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,780
Yeah, I know.

653
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,661
- What's that about?
- He's having a hard time, Jeff.

654
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,205
When it gets hard,
that's when he's gotta stick it out.

655
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:15,814
I've got you!

656
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,031
<i>I got you! Where you going?</i>

657
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,510
<i>We interrupt
this broadcast for a special report.</i>

658
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:47,514
<i>Sad news tonight.
The hero known as Spider-Man...</i>

659
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,018
<i>has died after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake in Brooklyn.</i>

660
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:55,105
<i>Multiple sources are confirming
that Peter Parker...</i>

661
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,149
<i>a 26-year-old grad student
and part-time photographer...</i>

662
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:02,070
<i>operated as Spider-Man
for at least a decade.</i>

663
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:16,501
<i>He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane,
and his aunt, May Parker.</i>

664
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.</i>

665
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,467
<i>My husband, Peter Parker...</i>

666
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:27,220
<i>was an ordinary person.</i>

667
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:30,723
<i>He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.</i>

668
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,269
<i>He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.</i>

669
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm going to miss him.

670
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,356
Yeah.

671
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,441
We were friends, you know.

672
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,152
Can I return it if it doesn't fit?

673
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,486
It always fits...

674
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,698
eventually.

675
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,789
<i>He didn't ask for his powers...</i>

676
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,587
<i>but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i>

677
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,048
<i>My favorite thing about Peter...</i>

678
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,760
<i>is that he made us each feel powerful.</i>

679
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,764
<i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i>

680
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,352
But in our own way...

681
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,313
we are all Spider-Man.

682
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,399
<i>And we're all counting on you.</i>

683
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,902
They're counting on me.

684
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:28,198
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

685
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,118
And now a few words
from philanthropist Wilson Fisk.

686
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:36,915
As many of you may know,
I am no stranger to loss.

687
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,417
After my wife and son were...

688
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:43,046
Everyone told me to let go.

689
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:48,426
That is why I have made an unprecedented
donation to the police fund.

690
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,471
Now is the time to come forward,
so that together,

691
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,265
together we can find whoever did this

692
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,392
and make them show their face.

693
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,770
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

694
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:03,274
Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

695
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,961
- Man, you really oversold this.
- Just try to pay attention.

696
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,421
They literally show him
figuring all his powers out.

697
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,101
Yeah.

698
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,021
Yeah!

699
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,991
So he just did it three times
and got better?

700
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,826
Then just do it three times.

701
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:00,872
Four?

702
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,458
Five?

703
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,129
- Do I look cool?
- Yes!

704
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,677
Awesome!

705
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,892
No way. I don't even have web shooters.

706
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,144
You don't need web shooters. Just jump.

707
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,188
Just jump.

708
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:07,147
Jump.

709
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Yeah!

710
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,089
Dobby, no!

711
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,511
Maybe you need web shooters.

712
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,596
Well done, Mr. Morales.

713
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,890
Finally starting to meet your potential.

714
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,767
All right. Where's my essay?

715
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,269
I'm... almost done.

716
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,661
Whoa!

717
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,129
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

718
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,432
Need some ice. Oh, ice.

719
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,523
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

720
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,985
That thing you gave me, that key...

721
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,656
I think I really messed it up.

722
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,201
I wanna do what you asked.

723
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,953
I really do.

724
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,997
But I'm sorry.

725
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,833
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

726
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,545
I can't do this without you.

727
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,631
Hey, kid.

728
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,805
What did I do to him?!

729
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,483
No.

730
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,032
Who <i>are</i> you?

731
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,829
<i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i>

732
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,958
<i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i>

733
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,545
<i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

734
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,380
<i>And for the last 22 years...</i>

735
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:03,467
<i>I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

736
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,970
What a day.

737
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,431
<i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i>

738
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:11,309
<i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married...</i>

739
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,519
<i>saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i>

740
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,896
<i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i>

741
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,607
<i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i>

742
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,527
<i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i>

743
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:24,780
<i>I broke my back, a drone flew
into my face, I buried Aunt May.</i>

744
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,283
<i>My wife and I... split up.</i>

745
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,535
<i>But I handled it like a champion.</i>

746
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:35,082
<i>'Cause, you know what, no matter how
many times I get hit, I always get back up.</i>

747
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:43,299
<i>And I got a lot of time to reflect
and work on myself.</i>

748
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:46,427
<i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i>

749
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,262
<i>Could you imagine?</i>

750
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:51,640
<i>A seahorse seeing another seahorse...</i>

751
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,476
<i>and then making it work?</i>

752
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,981
<i>She wanted kids and...
And it scared me.</i>

753
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,235
<i>I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.</i>

754
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,654
<i>Flash-forward:
I'm in my apartment doing push-ups...</i>

755
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,698
<i>doing ab crunches, getting strong...</i>

756
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,867
<i>when this weird thing happened.</i>

757
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:13,329
<i>And I gotta say,
weird things happen to me a lot.</i>

758
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:16,374
<i>But this was real weird.</i>

759
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:02,586
Where are my pants?

760
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,299
I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry.

761
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,281
'Scuse me. I'm sorry.
Do you know what state I'm in?

762
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,742
<i>Do you know what time it is, what day
it is, what month it is, what year it is?</i>

763
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,601
We got a streaker.

764
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,021
You wanna be a Spider-Man,
huh, sicko?

765
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:24,024
No, no, no. I am not Spider-Man.

766
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,485
This is a really tasteless bit, man.

767
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,049
It's not a bit. You'll know
when it's a bit. My bits are funny.

768
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,698
That's why we covered 'em up.

769
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,244
Everyone knows
Peter Parker was Spider-Man.

770
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,913
- What do you mean, "was"?
- Funeral's tomorrow.

771
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,415
Maybe you should go.

772
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,347
It's a little hot back here.
You mind cracking a window just a little?

773
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,007
Yeah, if it'll shut you up.

774
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,345
Kills me to do this to you guys,
but then again,

775
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:54,972
I'm already dead!

776
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:03,147
You guys feel like
our relationship is hitting a wall?

777
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:06,817
Ow!

778
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,530
<i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i>

779
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:14,158
<i>Also, I was dead.</i>

780
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,743
<i>And blond.</i>

781
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,037
<i>I was kind of perfect.</i>

782
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:21,415
<i>It was like looking in a mirror.</i>

783
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:27,296
<i>I have a feeling that the thing that brought
me here was the thing that got him killed.</i>

784
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,008
<i>You wanna know what happened next?</i>

785
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,721
<i>Me, too.</i>

786
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,306
Who <i>are</i> you?

787
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,225
What are you doin' over there?

788
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,352
Freeze! PDNY.

789
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:42,769
Stop!

790
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,526
Are you kidding me right now?

791
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,319
Stop! Stop!

792
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,946
I gotcha. I gotcha.

793
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,405
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

794
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,161
- Hey, kid. Get over here!
- Come on, now!

795
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,249
See you, officers!

796
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,417
Aw, come on.

797
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,217
- Hey, kid.
- Kid, come on, now!

798
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,344
Put 'em up, son!

799
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:20,558
Uh...<i>adiós?</i>

800
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:27,314
Help! Somebody stop that train!

801
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:47,001
Oh, hey. What the...?

802
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,045
Sorry.

803
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,343
I'm gonna die!

804
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,934
<i>Looks like a child dressed
like Spider-Man...</i>

805
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,146
<i>dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i>

806
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,857
Yes! I didn't kill you.

807
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:11,400
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

808
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,570
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

809
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,301
Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

810
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,095
All right. Thanks, New York.

811
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:51,815
<i>What was that?</i>

812
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,526
<i>Kid electrocuted me...</i>

813
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,320
<i>with his hands.</i>

814
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,076
- You're like me.
- I got some questions.

815
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,578
Well, this is cute.

816
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,417
Okay, now it's less cute.

817
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,169
Why do you look like Peter Parker?

818
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,215
Because I am Peter Parker.

819
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:18,842
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

820
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,470
Why are you older?
And why is your body...

821
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:23,055
a different shape?

822
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,807
Pretty sure you just called me fat.

823
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,600
You don't look so hot either, kid.

824
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,602
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

825
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,104
- Are you a ghost?
- No.

826
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,438
- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.

827
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,083
- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.

828
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,292
Are you from another dimension?

829
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:37,087
Like a parallel universe where things
are like this universe but different?

830
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:39,196
And you're Spider-Man in that universe?

831
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,074
But somehow traveled to this universe,
but you don't know how?

832
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:45,661
- Wow. That was really just a guess?
- We learned about it in physics.

833
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:47,579
- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!

834
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,790
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

835
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:50,791
Before he died.

836
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,158
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.

837
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,961
Look, I made a promise to him.

838
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,587
Here's lesson number one, kid.

839
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,048
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

840
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,556
Peter, seriously...

841
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:12,062
Trust me, kid.
This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.

842
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,444
Hey, are you okay?

843
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,653
No, I'm not.

844
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,155
What's going on with your body?

845
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,700
I don't think my atoms are real jazzed
about being in the wrong dimension.

846
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,456
Look, I'm not looking for a side gig
as a Spider-Man coach.

847
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:32,583
I got a lot going on in my dimension.

848
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,710
"With great power comes great..."

849
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:38,755
Don't you dare finish that sentence.
Don't do it! I'm sick of it.

850
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,887
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

851
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:48,724
I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got
a supercollider. He's tryin' to kill me.

852
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,185
- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

853
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,312
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

854
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,855
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

855
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,231
- Goodbye.
- Where you going?

856
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,418
When it runs again,
I'll jump in and get back to my life.

857
01:02:58,442 --> 01:02:59,485
You can't let them run it.

858
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:02,863
I'm supposed to destroy it so it never
runs again or everyone's gonna die.

859
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,492
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

860
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:09,328
But there's always a little bit of time
before everybody dies...

861
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,079
and that's when I do my best work.

862
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,706
Aren't you gonna need this?

863
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,458
Aw, you have a goober. Give it.

864
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:17,794
Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

865
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,339
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

866
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:22,866
I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

867
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,345
- I need it to destroy the collider.
- I need it to go home.

868
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:27,952
I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.

869
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,015
- What?
- I said...

870
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:33,560
The collider created a portal
that brought me here. And I have to get...

871
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,564
- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.

872
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,816
I don't remember what happened.

873
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,944
See, this is why I never had kids.

874
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,321
- Can't we make another one?
<i>- We</i> can't do anything.

875
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,908
Thanks to you, I have to re-steal
what your guy stole from Alchemax...

876
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,285
and make another one of these.

877
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,911
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave...

878
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:57,251
everyone in this city, my parents,
my uncle and millions of others, will die.

879
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,671
And you're just gonna go home and leave
me here to figure this out for myself?

880
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,424
- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.

881
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,435
What are you doing?

882
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:19,690
Making you feel guilty. Is it working?

883
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,068
How could it...? No. Look at me.
Does it look like it's working?

884
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,071
No. No, it's not...

885
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:34,204
No! No! No! Do not let him win!

886
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,498
All right, kid. You win.

887
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,834
Come on, we don't have a second to lose.

888
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,298
I love this burger. So delicious.

889
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,104
Mm. One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

890
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,094
In my universe,
this place closed six years ago.

891
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:51,805
I don't know why. I really don't. Mm!

892
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,602
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

893
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:59,438
- Can we focus?
- Fine.

894
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:03,025
See, this fry is your universe.
It's soggy. It's undercooked.

895
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,319
It's small. It's weird. It's gross.

896
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,321
It wants to grow up to be
a better universe.

897
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:11,116
And this crispy, delicious,
normal fry is my universe.

898
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,244
So when the other Peter
got shoved in the collider beam

899
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,388
by the freaky giant green dude...

900
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,665
That event created a portal
that brought me here.

901
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:23,920
And I have to get the collider to send me
from your french fry to my french fry.

902
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,506
I call it "Spider-Man: Home-going."

903
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:30,260
Then you blow up all this stuff
and save the multiverse.

904
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,511
Yay, Miles.

905
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:32,929
Look up where Alchemax is.

906
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:36,642
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

907
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:40,062
You can teach me
to swing on the way there. Fwsh, fwsh!

908
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,399
I'm not swinging
to the Hudson Valley, Miles.

909
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,652
Not after a hearty burger breakfast.

910
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,029
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

911
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,623
So, when you're swinging, do you...

912
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,375
Not the time, man.

913
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,460
- Why not?
- We're in a public place.

914
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,170
These are big secrets.

915
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,672
You're a real inspiration.

916
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,843
All right. Always keep the suit clean.

917
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:14,096
Disinfect the mask. That's more for you.

918
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,557
The smell is terrible. It's disgusting.
And you don't want your skin to break out.

919
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,268
Baby powder in the suit,
heavy on the joints.

920
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:21,853
You can't have any chafing.

921
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,563
If it's raining, take the gloves off.

922
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,608
Finger strength is important,
so take up the piano.

923
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,527
Your hands are gonna get really messed up,

924
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:31,571
so take aspirin and Bengay with you
everywhere you go.

925
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,990
Okay, that's about it.

926
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,450
That's it?

927
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:37,577
- That's the secret?
- What secret?

928
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,705
You don't have a mantra or anything,

929
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:42,749
something really unexpected
that would unlock everything for me?

930
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:45,627
No, not really.

931
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:48,547
But why are you good at that stuff
and I'm not?

932
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,341
I don't know. I just go for it,
and eventually it sorta clicks.

933
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:53,885
Like, you actually heard a click?

934
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,009
You sure it wasn't
your hip popping out or anything?

935
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,054
Very funny.

936
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:00,308
So what, then? On the third try
you're just magically good at it?

937
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:01,643
Third, no.

938
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:04,396
No, no, nothing like that.
Like the fifth or sixth.

939
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,940
I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.

940
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,885
- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.

941
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,305
Take that off. It's disrespectful.
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

942
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:43,393
- So how do we retrace Peter's steps?
- That's a good question.

943
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,438
What would I do if I were me?

944
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:48,398
Got it.

945
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,233
<i>Step One: I infiltrate the lab.</i>

946
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,527
<i>Two: Find the head scientist's computer.</i>

947
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,989
<i>That lady with the bike is the head
scientist. I saw her in this documentary.</i>

948
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,450
<i>Cool! Step Three:
I reexamine my personal biases.</i>

949
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:00,118
<i>Step Four: I hack the computer.</i>

950
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,661
It's not technically hacking.

951
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,705
Not now. I just lost my train of thought.

952
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:07,000
<i>Step Five: Download the important stuff.
I'll know it when I see it.</i>

953
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,253
<i>Step Six: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i>

954
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,880
So, what am I doing?

955
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:15,258
Step Seven: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

956
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:20,013
Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do
Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help.

957
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,683
Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!

958
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:30,816
Why did I get stuck with the janky,
old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!

959
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,276
That's new.

960
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:43,578
Kingpin.

961
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,710
<i>What am I doing? What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?</i>

962
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,187
Peter!

963
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,939
Peter!

964
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,440
Peter!

965
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,568
- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.

966
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,944
Just move over.

967
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:18,864
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

968
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,367
No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man
die without doing anything about it.

969
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:24,619
I'm not doing that again.

970
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,955
What?

971
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:30,500
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me...

972
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,586
so you're a nice change of pace.

973
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,172
Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.

974
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,219
I know you can't really understand it,
but these are really good numbers.

975
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,137
And I got the password.

976
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:44,681
Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week...

977
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:47,225
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

978
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,894
You see this? And this?

979
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,023
This is multiple dimensions beginning
to crash into each other.

980
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,859
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it.

981
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:59,446
Watch this. He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

982
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:00,739
You've got 24 hours.

983
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:04,701
What this means is there could be
a rupture in the space-time continuum.

984
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:08,079
That's bad. Actually, everything
she said was bad. I was lying before.

985
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,799
Hold on. Let me get you some more data.

986
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,137
- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.

987
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:28,808
Okay, relax your fingers. We don't
have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.

988
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,852
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

989
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,521
- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.

990
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,106
I just need more time.

991
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,953
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

992
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,110
Miles, you gotta unstick.

993
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,029
What do you do to relax?

994
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,366
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

995
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,371
Oh, for crying out loud.

996
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:01,299
Teenagers: just the worst.

997
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,012
- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.

998
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,307
- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.

999
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,602
- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.

1000
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:13,979
You just poked me in my eye!

1001
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,314
This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.

1002
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,941
What's that?

1003
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,821
Remember this password.
D-g-f-a-m-p-e-s-a-n-d...

1004
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:23,822
Slow down!

1005
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:27,617
-4-$-♪-5-♪-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

1006
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,720
- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.

1007
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,871
- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.

1008
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,333
Spider-Man?

1009
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,044
Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.

1010
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,341
Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.
You're supposed to be dead.

1011
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:46,720
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.

1012
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,013
This is fascinating.

1013
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,140
Okay, that's my face.

1014
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,434
An entirely different Peter Parker.

1015
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,103
Little bit of a gut,
perhaps from dimensional warping.

1016
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,897
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.

1017
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,859
Travel through the multiverse appears
to have deteriorated the...

1018
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,778
What was the rest?!

1019
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:09,325
Hey, how old are you?
'Cause you don't look a day over 35.

1020
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,078
They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!

1021
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,663
You showed 'em you're not crazy.

1022
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,582
This might pinch a little.

1023
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,128
I know. I just need to get these samples.

1024
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,129
Okay.

1025
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:23,048
Organize your desktop, lady.

1026
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,676
Wow. Just complete cellular decay.

1027
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,554
I've never seen anything like this.

1028
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,807
- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking the whole thing.

1029
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,517
And obviously you've been glitching.

1030
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,687
"Glitchin" '? No.
Why would you even say that?

1031
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,815
If you stay in this dimension too long,
your body's gonna disintegrate.

1032
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:43,193
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

1033
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,194
I don't know.

1034
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,321
You can't imagine.

1035
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,364
And I, for one...

1036
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,200
can't wait to watch.

1037
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,650
What did you say your name was?

1038
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,830
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

1039
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,174
Can I assume
that your friends call you Doc Ock?

1040
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:08,468
My friends actually call me Liv.

1041
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:11,012
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

1042
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,472
I got this! Run!

1043
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,516
Who are you talking to?

1044
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,354
- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?

1045
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,024
I got it handled, buddy!

1046
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:26,402
Everything is fine!

1047
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,492
- Okay, this is a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.

1048
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:33,660
Gotta go.

1049
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:38,957
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

1050
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:44,420
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

1051
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,630
Peter!

1052
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:50,176
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

1053
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,011
Could you give me that back,
young man?

1054
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,721
Peter!

1055
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,641
It's proprietary.

1056
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,567
- This'd be a good time to turn invisible.
- Yep.

1057
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:08,444
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

1058
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:10,446
Act super normal.

1059
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,614
Spider-Man?

1060
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,492
- You know, that's funny, I get that a lot.
- Hey.

1061
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,786
- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!

1062
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,288
Now we do a switchy-switchy.

1063
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,582
Get back here!
Where do you think you're going?

1064
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:21,748
He took a bagel!

1065
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,003
- Time to swing, just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?

1066
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,672
I didn't. It's a little
joke for team-building.

1067
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,382
Hey!

1068
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,385
- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready!

1069
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:34,804
I can't do this yet!

1070
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,973
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn...

1071
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,142
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

1072
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,272
Come on, come on, come on.

1073
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,868
What are you doing down there?

1074
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:58,745
I run better than I swing.

1075
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:01,873
You gotta swing or they'll catch you.

1076
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,375
This is what you wanted.

1077
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,640
Come back, little boy.

1078
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,100
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

1079
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,478
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

1080
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:24,979
Don't shoot off your back foot.

1081
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,690
- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!

1082
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,027
That's the best idea you've had all day!

1083
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,453
Nice, Miles!

1084
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:45,458
Good. You're doin' it.

1085
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,211
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

1086
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,046
Thwip and release.

1087
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,341
- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.

1088
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,051
You're a natural. Thwip. Release.

1089
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,720
- Feel the rhythm?
- Thwip. And release!

1090
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,099
- Good, Miles.
- I gotta say, you're amazing, man.

1091
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,642
We're a little team!

1092
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,727
Me as the teacher who could still do it.

1093
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,438
You as the student who can do it,
just not as good.

1094
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,972
There's nowhere to swing from!

1095
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,153
These stones are really squishy.

1096
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,531
They aren't stones!

1097
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,718
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

1098
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,678
It was nice knowing you, Miles.

1099
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,683
Hey, guys.

1100
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:44,766
Gwanda?

1101
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,604
It's Gwen, actually.

1102
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:50,523
I'm from another dimension.

1103
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,234
I mean, another-another dimension.

1104
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:56,195
<i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i>

1105
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,700
<i>My name is Gwen Stacy.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

1106
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:05,872
<i>And for the last two years, I've been
the one and only Spider-Woman.</i>

1107
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,707
<i>You guys know the rest.</i>

1108
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:09,375
<i>I joined a band.</i>

1109
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:12,962
<i>Saved my dad.</i>

1110
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:18,426
<i>I couldn't save my best friend...</i>

1111
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:20,261
<i>Peter Parker...</i>

1112
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,890
<i>so now I save everyone else.</i>

1113
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:26,809
<i>And I don't do friends anymore...</i>

1114
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,853
<i>just to avoid any distractions.</i>

1115
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:33,983
<i>And one day this weird thing happened.</i>

1116
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,570
<i>And I mean, like, really weird.</i>

1117
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,661
<i>I was blown into last week.</i>

1118
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,084
<i>Literally.</i>

1119
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:54,587
<i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i>

1120
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:59,175
<i>Lucky for these
folks, Spider-Man saved the day.</i>

1121
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,137
<i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i>

1122
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,430
You guys are early.

1123
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,142
<i>Wasn't sure why until I met you.</i>

1124
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,644
Oh.

1125
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,188
How many Spider-people
from how many dimensions

1126
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,481
should I expect there to be?

1127
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:14,732
- Infinity.
- Infinity.

1128
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:15,858
Whoa.

1129
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,209
You're dead, Spider-Man.

1130
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,586
Wilson! What are you doing?

1131
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:36,796
Vanessa.

1132
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:38,089
Richard, come on.

1133
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,553
Vanessa! Richard!

1134
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,971
<i>No!</i>

1135
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:47,765
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

1136
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,494
I killed Spider-Man.

1137
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,580
Why did I just see two more?

1138
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,915
There's three, actually.

1139
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,626
No, this is good. This is very, very good.

1140
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,628
This means you get what you want.

1141
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,298
It means my collider works.

1142
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:24,177
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

1143
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:26,512
And the collider will bring
your family back.

1144
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,599
As many families as you want.

1145
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,943
Tomorrow, at my collider.

1146
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:43,988
Our collider.

1147
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,123
Thirty minutes or free. That's no joke.

1148
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,877
- What do you want?
- Open the door.

1149
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:03,883
- Is Miles here?
- Nah. Haven't seen him in a while.

1150
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,093
You, either.

1151
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,387
What, like, two years?

1152
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:11,265
- He's been coming here, then, huh?
- It's a free country, man.

1153
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:14,310
He's impressionable.
He needs good role models.

1154
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,393
- What, I'm not a good role model?
- What are you doing for work these days?

1155
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,651
He's a good kid, Jeff.
He's not like we were.

1156
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,237
Yeah, I know. I want him to stay that way.

1157
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,446
You think I don't?

1158
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:26,989
Look, man.

1159
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,158
One way or another
he's gonna find himself.

1160
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,452
Maybe you just need to let him.

1161
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,747
Hey, guys. Somebody order a pizza?

1162
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:40,419
Now if you'll excuse me, big bro,
I got a pizza to eat.

1163
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,339
If you see him,
let him know his papa's looking for him.

1164
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:51,889
He broke this?

1165
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:52,807
Yeah.

1166
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:56,644
He's actually really embarrassed about it,
so just keep it between us, okay?

1167
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:01,941
I know where we can make a new one.
And we won't let him break it this time.

1168
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,320
I'm sorry about your friend.

1169
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,073
Thanks, Miles.

1170
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:15,788
I know how hard this is. To have
to figure this stuff out on your own.

1171
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:18,958
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

1172
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,168
Yeah.

1173
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:26,048
If you ever decide to do friends again,
I could always open up a slot.

1174
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,136
I'll keep you posted.

1175
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,471
Cool.

1176
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,769
We should probably go.

1177
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:41,772
Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.

1178
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,483
- Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
- Just relax.

1179
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:48,988
You guys are all very sweet,
but no more fans today, please.

1180
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,784
I'm not ready for this.

1181
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,374
Peter?

1182
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,961
Hey, Aunt May.

1183
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:08,591
So this is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...

1184
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:10,176
An alternate dimension.

1185
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,802
Yeah.

1186
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,181
You look tired, Peter.

1187
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,433
Well, I am tired.

1188
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,644
- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.

1189
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,064
Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?

1190
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,357
Yup, that's what they are.

1191
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,193
I was there...

1192
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:29,695
when it all happened.

1193
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,781
I am so sorry.

1194
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,866
And what dimension are you from?

1195
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,659
Brooklyn.

1196
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,246
Did Peter have a place where we could
make another one of these?

1197
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,123
A goober.

1198
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:43,584
Follow me.

1199
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:51,092
Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. A little,
old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.

1200
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,940
I mean, this place is pretentious.

1201
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,782
Whoa.

1202
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:20,955
Dude. Was yours anything like this?

1203
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:24,416
Mine was like this,
but take away the jeep, the plane.

1204
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,170
Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.

1205
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,881
I feel sad for this guy.

1206
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,813
Hey, Peter.

1207
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,066
I think this is a cape.

1208
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,419
Peter knew how dangerous the job was.

1209
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:13,257
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy was Spider-Man.

1210
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,719
Kingpin knows we're coming.

1211
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,679
We're going to be outnumbered.

1212
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:20,931
Don't be so sure.

1213
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,058
You might need these.

1214
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,691
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

1215
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:34,612
Hey, fellas.

1216
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:35,946
Is he in black and white?

1217
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,490
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

1218
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,492
Wherever I go, the wind follows.

1219
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,412
And the wind, it smells like rain.

1220
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:45,998
Hi, guys!

1221
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,922
This could literally not get any weirder.

1222
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,925
It <i>can</i> get weirder.

1223
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,178
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

1224
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,222
No other reason.

1225
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,648
You're like me.

1226
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,818
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

1227
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,403
<i>My name is Peni Parker.</i>

1228
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,405
<i>My name is Peter Porker.</i>

1229
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,617
<i>- I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
- I was bitten by a radioactive pig.</i>

1230
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:25,329
<i>In my universe, it's 1933,
and I'm a private eye.</i>

1231
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,041
<i>I like to drink egg creams,
and I like to fight Nazis. A lot.</i>

1232
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,210
<i>I'm from New York in the year 3145.</i>

1233
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:34,713
<i>I have a psychic link with a spider
who lives inside my father's robot.</i>

1234
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,258
<i>And we're best friends. Forever.</i>

1235
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,486
<i>Sometimes I let matches burn down
to my fingertips...</i>

1236
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:42,012
<i>just to feel something, anything.</i>

1237
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,739
<i>I'm a photographer
for the</i> Daily Beagle.

1238
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,141
<i>When I'm not pooching around,
I'm working like a dog...</i>

1239
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,018
<i>trying to sniff out the latest story.</i>

1240
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,065
I frolic and I dance
And I do this with my pants

1241
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,939
Okay! Enough!

1242
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:55,067
So how did you get here?

1243
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,361
Well, it's kind of a long story.

1244
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,659
Maybe not that long.

1245
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:07,288
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

1246
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:12,376
The only way home is back through
that collider gizmo. The only trouble is...

1247
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,963
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

1248
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,256
I'll do it.

1249
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,758
No, no, no. You guys don't get it.

1250
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,760
Don't get what?

1251
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:29,101
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

1252
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:31,854
I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.

1253
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,649
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

1254
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:39,945
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

1255
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:45,826
Who are you again?

1256
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:47,036
This is Miles.

1257
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,371
- And he's gonna save the multiverse.
- Yeah, man.

1258
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:53,876
This kid can turn himself invisible.
Watch this. He can do it now.

1259
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:59,006
- I can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1260
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:01,675
But it is cool.
Show 'em the zappy thing, Miles.

1261
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,847
- Can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1262
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:09,016
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

1263
01:27:09,183 --> 01:27:11,685
- Just those two things.
- Just those two things.

1264
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,771
Aw, man.

1265
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:18,359
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

1266
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,987
I think he's gonna get us home.

1267
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,950
Okay, little fella, Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

1268
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:31,163
I'm talkin' hard boys, real biscuit boxers.
Can you fight them all off at once?

1269
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,499
I haven't actually fought anyone.

1270
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,125
Surprise attack!

1271
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:38,342
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

1272
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:39,338
Can I what?

1273
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:40,672
- Show me!
- Surprise attack!

1274
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,485
Can you swing and flip with the grace
of a trained dancer?

1275
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,445
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled...

1276
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,322
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

1277
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,491
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile...

1278
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:51,493
so she can get out
of the dang house once in a while?

1279
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,019
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

1280
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,105
- Can you be strong?
- Ruthless?

1281
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,815
- Disciplined?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1282
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,608
- Psychic?
- Show me some moxie, soldier!

1283
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:04,071
Above all, no matter how many times
you get hit, can you get back up?

1284
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:06,031
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor...

1285
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,866
When you think you can't keep goin'...

1286
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,952
- Come on, Miles.
- Come on. You can do it.

1287
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:12,037
- You can do this.
- Guys, cool it.

1288
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,957
- Come on. You can do it!
- Get up, Miles.

1289
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:17,251
Come on, Miles. Get up.

1290
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,759
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

1291
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:28,554
- He's not ready. It's obvious.
- There's no way. He's just a kid.

1292
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,014
If he can't do this,
we have to stay and do it for him.

1293
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,143
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

1294
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,561
Miles?

1295
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:36,895
Miles? Miles?

1296
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,152
You see that? He can, uh...

1297
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,487
He can turn invisible.

1298
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,051
Oh, man.

1299
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,179
What do I do here?

1300
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:15,434
Hey, bud. You okay?

1301
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,769
I'm not like you guys.

1302
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,563
You mean the robot or the pig?

1303
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,399
- Man.
- Yeah, I mean, this is new to me.

1304
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:25,944
I don't know what I'm doing, all right?
Congratulations, you revealed me.

1305
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,238
I'm supposed to save the world, Peter.

1306
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:33,494
Well... there's your problem right there.

1307
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,871
You can't think about saving
the whole world.

1308
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,832
You have to think about saving
one person, Miles.

1309
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,168
You just think about someone you love.

1310
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:47,007
My mom, and my uncle, and my dad.

1311
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,343
In that order? Wanna talk about that?

1312
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:50,801
No.

1313
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:56,058
There's a Mary Jane where you come from,
right? She's your one?

1314
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:00,562
She was. I mean, she's still there,
but it's, you know...

1315
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:02,856
You wanna talk about that?

1316
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:09,738
Look, Miles, this hero thing,
it gets really, really complicated, man.

1317
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,407
You lose things.

1318
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:18,205
And look, maybe if I could go back home
and I could have another chance...

1319
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,792
maybe I would do some things
I didn't do, okay?

1320
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,127
You wanna talk about that?

1321
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:28,006
Honestly, Miles, don't do it like I did.

1322
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,093
You gotta do it like you.

1323
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,847
When do I know I'm Spider-Man?

1324
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,851
You won't. It's a leap of faith.

1325
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,187
In the end, that's all it is, Miles.

1326
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,147
A leap of faith.

1327
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:49,945
Yes!

1328
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,322
That was emotional!

1329
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,250
Miles, where are you? Are you okay?
Call me right away.

1330
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:13,510
<i>Miles, what is going on with you?</i>

1331
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:16,346
<i>Nobody's heard from you.
We don't know what's going on.</i>

1332
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:19,182
<i>If you're hidin' something from us,
you need to come clean.</i>

1333
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:20,809
<i>You call me back. Now.</i>

1334
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:25,105
He's not answering me either.

1335
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:26,898
<i>Dear Uncle Aaron.</i>

1336
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:30,360
<i>I gotta do something,
and I don't know if I can do it.</i>

1337
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,531
<i>I'm scared, man.</i>

1338
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:39,161
<i>I'm just tired of lettin' everybody down.</i>

1339
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,083
<i>You're the only one I can talk to.</i>

1340
01:31:46,293 --> 01:31:48,712
<i>I just wish you were here.</i>

1341
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:45,102
Hello, Mr. Fisk.

1342
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:48,522
I've got the security tapes
from the tunnel right here.

1343
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,900
If the kid's out there, I'll find him.

1344
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:56,113
You know me, sir. I don't ever quit.

1345
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,181
This is...

1346
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,308
- Purple.
- No.

1347
01:34:48,475 --> 01:34:49,559
- Blue?
- No.

1348
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,228
Has anyone heard from Miles?

1349
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,688
Look, he's just clearing his head.
I know the kid.

1350
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,482
He's got what it takes.

1351
01:34:55,941 --> 01:35:00,028
I bet you he's gonna come back through
that door, recharged and ready to fight.

1352
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:02,113
- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?

1353
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,699
My uncle Aaron, he's the Prowler.

1354
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,786
- Slow down, Miles.
- He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me!

1355
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,663
This is a pretty hard-core origin story.

1356
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,957
It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.

1357
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:15,252
- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.

1358
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:27,597
- Cute place. Real homey.
- Oh, great. It's Liv.

1359
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,641
I guess I was followed.

1360
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:30,851
Oh, no.

1361
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:32,686
Get out of here, kid.

1362
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:36,857
You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

1363
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:42,237
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.

1364
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,322
Would you mind taking this outside?

1365
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,658
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

1366
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,244
Ooh, I think I'll be taking that.

1367
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,960
Stand, <i>niñito, dale. Prepárate a morir.</i>

1368
01:35:57,586 --> 01:35:58,962
Aw. Man, stupid pillows.

1369
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,403
I got it!

1370
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,836
I said, take it outside!

1371
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:46,468
The key.

1372
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:58,730
I got this, buddy.

1373
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:00,148
Leave the kid alone!

1374
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,070
No, no, no! No!

1375
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,289
You gotta go, man.

1376
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:22,379
Sorry, ma'am.

1377
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,724
<i>All vehicles
in the area, we have a disturbance...</i>

1378
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,185
<i>involving multiple Spider... people?</i>

1379
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:38,478
Yeah. On my way.

1380
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:49,781
Give me that thing.

1381
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:53,243
Don't be stupid, kid. Hand it over, now!

1382
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:13,680
Nowhere left to run.

1383
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,311
Miles?

1384
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:21,521
Uncle Aaron.

1385
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,276
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1386
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:33,658
Please, Uncle Aaron.

1387
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,954
<i>Prowler.</i>

1388
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:40,665
What are you waitin' for? Finish it.

1389
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,320
Get out of here!

1390
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,590
No.

1391
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:33,760
Miles.

1392
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:35,970
Uncle Aaron.

1393
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,264
This is my fault.

1394
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:45,104
No, Miles.

1395
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:47,231
I'm sorry.

1396
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,279
I wanted you to look up to me.

1397
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:57,534
I let you down, man. I let you down.

1398
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:04,040
You're the best of all of us, Miles.

1399
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:06,292
You're on your way.

1400
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,755
Just keep going.

1401
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:15,134
Just keep going.

1402
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:49,919
Hands up!

1403
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:52,630
Put your arms up. Now!

1404
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:55,425
Turn around.

1405
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,305
Hey! Hey!

1406
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,357
Aaron. Aaron, no. No!

1407
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,327
All units.

1408
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:25,455
I want an APB on a new Spider-Man.

1409
01:41:55,485 --> 01:41:56,736
Hey, bud.

1410
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,364
You okay?

1411
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:06,788
We've all been there.
You know, for me...

1412
01:42:06,955 --> 01:42:08,206
it was my Uncle Ben.

1413
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:13,127
For me, it was my Uncle Benjamin.

1414
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:16,047
For me, it was my father.

1415
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:18,716
For me, it was my best friend.

1416
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,012
Miles, the hardest thing
about this job is...

1417
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:25,515
you can't always save everybody.

1418
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:29,936
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

1419
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:33,064
Miles, we're probably the only ones
who <i>do</i> understand.

1420
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,317
Oh, no.

1421
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,785
That way, that way.

1422
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:49,288
Other way, other way,
other way, other way.

1423
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:54,168
Hey there.

1424
01:42:54,335 --> 01:42:57,296
Do animals talk in this dimension?
'Cause I don't wanna freak him out.

1425
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:06,514
What's going on?

1426
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:08,516
Bye, Miles.

1427
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:16,107
- Miles, I came to say goodbye.
- We can say goodbye at the collider.

1428
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:18,276
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

1429
01:43:18,443 --> 01:43:20,403
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

1430
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,781
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

1431
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:27,410
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

1432
01:43:27,577 --> 01:43:30,955
I'm doing what needs to be done.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

1433
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:33,166
What about MJ?

1434
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:36,878
Not everything works out, kid.

1435
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,839
I need the goober.

1436
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,216
Please don't make me take it from you.

1437
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:44,886
That's not fair!
You gotta tell them I can do this.

1438
01:43:45,053 --> 01:43:46,763
It wasn't their decision.

1439
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:53,895
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

1440
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:55,539
Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.

1441
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:56,939
But I'm ready. I promise!

1442
01:44:00,193 --> 01:44:02,111
Then venom-strike me right now.

1443
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:06,783
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

1444
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:20,421
Look, I know
how much you want this, kid.

1445
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:22,715
Poor little guy.

1446
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:28,554
But you don't have it yet.

1447
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:35,561
I'm sorry.

1448
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,481
Peter, listen to me.

1449
01:44:39,732 --> 01:44:41,400
Now you don't have to be Spider-Man.

1450
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,946
Miles.

1451
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,740
Miles, it's your dad.

1452
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:32,702
Please open the door.

1453
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,831
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

1454
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:42,503
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

1455
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,172
Look, can we talk for a minute?

1456
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,885
Something...

1457
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,763
Something happened to...

1458
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:59,061
Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.

1459
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:03,941
And I don't want
that to happen to us, okay?

1460
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:09,405
I know I don't always do what you need
me to do or say what you need me to say.

1461
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:16,579
I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.

1462
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,040
But it's yours.

1463
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,501
Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.

1464
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:32,762
Look, call me when you can. Okay?

1465
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:35,598
I love you.

1466
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:39,268
You don't have to say it back, though.

1467
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:04,228
Took you long enough.

1468
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:11,068
<i>I see this spark in you. It's amazing.</i>

1469
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:14,822
<i>Whatever you choose to do with it,
you'll be great.</i>

1470
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,367
<i>Our family doesn't run from things.</i>

1471
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:21,662
<i>You're the best of all of us, Miles.
You're on your way.</i>

1472
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:23,497
<i>Just keep going.</i>

1473
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:28,127
<i>When do I know I'm Spider-Man?</i>

1474
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,504
<i>You won't.</i>

1475
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:34,175
<i>That's all it is, Miles.</i>

1476
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,384
<i>A leap of faith.</i>

1477
01:48:55,071 --> 01:48:56,572
Made 'em myself.

1478
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:58,949
They fit perfectly.

1479
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,596
Kingpin has a private
elevator entrance...

1480
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:04,515
from his penthouse
to the collider below.

1481
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:06,433
Didn't count on having an audience.

1482
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:18,028
You gotta be kidding me.

1483
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:21,907
Thank you. It's nice to be with you
this evening to celebrate Spider-Man.

1484
01:50:22,074 --> 01:50:24,285
He and I were very close.

1485
01:50:24,869 --> 01:50:27,413
- What a pig.
- I'm right here.

1486
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,541
Hold on. Get a load
of how the waiters are dressed.

1487
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:32,334
It's in poor taste, but...

1488
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:34,670
It can't be that easy.

1489
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,840
It's that easy.

1490
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:45,681
I just wanna thank Mary Jane Parker
for being here this evening.

1491
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:48,225
MJ?

1492
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:53,814
Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

1493
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,150
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

1494
01:50:56,317 --> 01:51:00,696
Peter! Come here. Trust me. I've
been there. You gotta move on, buddy.

1495
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:02,948
It will take one second. Let me just... Oh!

1496
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,951
- Hello.
- Oh, wow.

1497
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:10,331
I just wondered if we could have
some more bread at table 12.

1498
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:12,458
Yeah.

1499
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:17,046
I'm just, uh... I'm really sorry.

1500
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:20,174
Oh! Don't be sorry. It's just bread.

1501
01:51:20,341 --> 01:51:22,676
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

1502
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:24,219
- Mm-hm.
- I didn't even try.

1503
01:51:24,386 --> 01:51:26,889
That's fine.
You know, I should really get going.

1504
01:51:27,056 --> 01:51:32,186
I know I could do better if I just had
another chance to give you, uh...

1505
01:51:32,728 --> 01:51:36,357
the bread that you deserve.

1506
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:39,401
- Are you okay?
- We'll take care of that bread right now.

1507
01:51:39,568 --> 01:51:41,695
Well, it's been nice, uh, talking to you.

1508
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:44,657
For you, they should fill this place up
with fresh bread.

1509
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:47,034
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

1510
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:49,078
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

1511
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:53,248
- Hey. What you got in there?
- Oh!

1512
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:57,002
Just your typical stuff.
Liver, hard cheese, bar-le-duc sandwiches.

1513
01:51:57,086 --> 01:51:57,920
Nothing unusual.

1514
01:51:58,003 --> 01:52:00,714
Well, that's good,
'cause I'm kinda hungry.

1515
01:52:03,258 --> 01:52:06,261
Look at this!
They even got the mask on him.

1516
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:07,972
I know, right?

1517
01:52:11,392 --> 01:52:14,561
- I don't eat pork.
- You don't deserve pork.

1518
01:52:15,688 --> 01:52:18,399
Right through there. Have fun.

1519
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:23,946
Yeah. They think we're dumb.

1520
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:26,407
- They are dumb.
- They are so dumb.

1521
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:33,205
I'm just sorry my family
can't see what we're doing here tonight.

1522
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:44,299
<i>Initializing primary ignition sequence.</i>

1523
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:50,556
Sleep.

1524
01:52:52,558 --> 01:52:53,976
Start the sequence.

1525
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:56,687
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

1526
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:59,398
Beginning scan for dimensional matches.

1527
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:09,908
- It should be right there.
- What a beautiful painting.

1528
01:53:09,992 --> 01:53:11,243
I love the use of purple.

1529
01:53:11,326 --> 01:53:13,370
Again, color's not his strong suit.

1530
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:14,705
It's purple!

1531
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:27,801
Peter! Shake a leg. Let's go.

1532
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:38,437
<i>Secondary ignition in five, four...</i>

1533
01:53:38,604 --> 01:53:43,067
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1534
01:53:59,792 --> 01:54:02,377
Peter, you don't have to stay behind.
I can do it.

1535
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,296
It's okay.

1536
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:06,465
I've made up my mind.

1537
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:13,055
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

1538
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:15,933
After you're gone, I'll blow it up.

1539
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:17,351
Good luck, guys.

1540
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:22,856
They know we're here.

1541
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:33,492
Nice to see you again, Peter.

1542
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:41,375
<i>I got you covered!</i>

1543
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:43,377
These guys are the pits.

1544
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:52,511
Why is this always difficult?

1545
01:54:52,678 --> 01:54:54,596
Where you going, Peter?

1546
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:56,765
Any last words?

1547
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:59,810
Can I get a minute to think about it?
You have a pen?

1548
01:54:59,977 --> 01:55:02,646
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1549
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:14,199
Who did that?!

1550
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:22,624
- Miles?
- Spider-Man?

1551
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,045
- Wow, Miles. You're doing it on command!
- It's about time, right?

1552
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,548
- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.

1553
01:55:29,715 --> 01:55:31,925
I love you! I am so proud of you!

1554
01:55:32,092 --> 01:55:33,969
Do I want kids?

1555
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:36,305
Oh, yeah, I forgot about her.

1556
01:55:38,182 --> 01:55:41,727
- Well, that doesn't look promising.
- No, it doesn't.

1557
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:49,985
<i>I've got genetic matches. Hold on.</i>

1558
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:51,236
It's too risky.

1559
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:52,529
Shut up and turn it up.

1560
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:54,156
- On your left!
- On your right!

1561
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:56,742
I got five o'clock!
Three o'clock! Two o'clock!

1562
01:55:56,909 --> 01:55:59,077
Every direction!

1563
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:03,582
Get to a shelter. I'll be right there.

1564
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:06,793
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

1565
01:56:21,058 --> 01:56:23,518
Guys, are you seeing this?

1566
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:26,563
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

1567
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,815
Does look cool though, right?

1568
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:31,193
We gotta get back up there.

1569
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:36,573
Is that all you got? You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

1570
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:39,159
You hard-boiled turtle slapper!

1571
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:03,433
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

1572
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,687
You got a problem with cartoons?

1573
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:13,235
Blammo!

1574
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:22,202
Did that feel like a cartoon?

1575
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:36,799
Gwen!

1576
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:46,727
I like your suit.

1577
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,353
Thanks. I made it myself.

1578
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,190
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

1579
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:08,248
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

1580
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,754
All right. Never mind.

1581
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:14,963
Let's end this thing.

1582
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:16,173
Guys, I got it.

1583
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,091
I'll go. I'm the one with the goo...

1584
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:20,844
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1585
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:24,056
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

1586
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,936
- Miles!
- Be careful!

1587
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:44,826
That was crazy.

1588
01:58:45,243 --> 01:58:46,787
We taught him that, right?

1589
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:49,748
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

1590
01:59:07,682 --> 01:59:08,934
You okay?

1591
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,145
Come on.

1592
01:59:18,735 --> 01:59:21,363
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

1593
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:25,951
<i>Alert! Quantum polarity
has been reversed.</i>

1594
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:33,333
Guess this is it.

1595
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:36,795
Well, nice to know we're not alone.

1596
01:59:37,504 --> 01:59:39,965
- Right?
- Yeah.

1597
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:43,093
I got the portal open. You first, Peni.

1598
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,220
Thank you, Miles.

1599
01:59:45,387 --> 01:59:47,514
From both of us.

1600
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:53,645
I, uh, love you all.

1601
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:56,606
I'm taking this cube thing with me.

1602
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:58,692
I don't understand it.

1603
01:59:58,859 --> 02:00:00,735
But I will.

1604
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:05,782
I want you to have this.

1605
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:07,701
It'll fit in your pocket.

1606
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:11,079
That's all, folks.

1607
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:14,166
Is he allowed to say that, legally?

1608
02:00:17,627 --> 02:00:19,546
Do I get to like the hairdo now?

1609
02:00:21,173 --> 02:00:22,841
You know I'm older than you.

1610
02:00:23,008 --> 02:00:26,261
15 months, but it's pretty significant
if you ask me.

1611
02:00:26,428 --> 02:00:30,724
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

1612
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:32,809
Nice.

1613
02:00:35,395 --> 02:00:36,980
Friends?

1614
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:39,649
Friends.

1615
02:00:39,816 --> 02:00:40,942
Cool.

1616
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:42,736
See you around, Spider-Man.

1617
02:00:53,872 --> 02:00:54,915
Your turn.

1618
02:00:56,124 --> 02:00:59,044
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1619
02:01:02,422 --> 02:01:04,508
You're not going anywhere!

1620
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:07,135
I'll hold him off. You shut this down.

1621
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:08,762
Peter, that wasn't the deal!

1622
02:01:08,929 --> 02:01:12,474
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

1623
02:01:15,852 --> 02:01:18,355
- What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!

1624
02:01:18,522 --> 02:01:21,316
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

1625
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:23,235
Neither can I.

1626
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:26,613
It's okay.

1627
02:01:27,531 --> 02:01:29,241
Yeah, it is okay.

1628
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:35,872
You gotta go home, man.

1629
02:01:37,374 --> 02:01:39,251
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1630
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:41,378
You won't.

1631
02:01:42,671 --> 02:01:44,089
Right.

1632
02:01:44,256 --> 02:01:46,091
It's a leap of faith.

1633
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,394
Not bad, kid.

1634
02:02:06,528 --> 02:02:07,571
Kingpin!

1635
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,419
Nope!

1636
02:02:22,586 --> 02:02:24,546
Sorry! That's cheating.

1637
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:27,882
<i>Adiós.</i>

1638
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:38,476
I gotta get to that button.

1639
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:44,608
Oh, no.

1640
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,110
Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?

1641
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:53,325
I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.

1642
02:02:56,703 --> 02:02:58,663
- Where am I?
- What?

1643
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:00,332
Wilson?

1644
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:03,460
- Is this what you want, man?
- What are you doing?

1645
02:03:03,627 --> 02:03:05,754
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1646
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,381
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.

1647
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:09,758
It's me. You know me.

1648
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,594
We're leaving now.

1649
02:03:12,761 --> 02:03:14,554
Don't go.

1650
02:03:14,721 --> 02:03:16,139
Stay with me.

1651
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,058
Please!

1652
02:03:23,271 --> 02:03:25,940
You're not stopping this. Not today.

1653
02:03:26,358 --> 02:03:28,610
I am stopping this. Right now!

1654
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:38,828
I need backup.

1655
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:18,159
Come on.

1656
02:04:26,334 --> 02:04:28,920
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

1657
02:04:31,506 --> 02:04:33,341
You're nothing!

1658
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,558
You took my family.

1659
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:49,482
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

1660
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:10,712
Get up, Spider-Man.

1661
02:05:13,214 --> 02:05:15,842
Get up! Come on!

1662
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:25,935
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1663
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:39,574
I'll always have my family.

1664
02:05:40,241 --> 02:05:41,826
You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

1665
02:05:43,036 --> 02:05:44,078
What?

1666
02:05:48,374 --> 02:05:49,375
Hey.

1667
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:03,389
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

1668
02:06:46,474 --> 02:06:50,728
The power of the multiverse...
in the palm of my hand.

1669
02:07:04,117 --> 02:07:05,159
Dad!

1670
02:07:07,245 --> 02:07:08,746
Come on, come on, come on!

1671
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:07,764
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1672
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:08,973
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

1673
02:08:10,016 --> 02:08:11,184
You're probably busy...

1674
02:08:11,351 --> 02:08:13,186
<i>No! I can talk, I can talk.</i>

1675
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:17,315
<i>Look, so I came by earlier because...</i>

1676
02:08:18,524 --> 02:08:20,902
- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.

1677
02:08:22,195 --> 02:08:23,488
I am so sorry.

1678
02:08:23,655 --> 02:08:25,198
Yeah.

1679
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:27,158
Do you know who did it?

1680
02:08:27,325 --> 02:08:28,951
I thought I did.

1681
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,870
But I was wrong.

1682
02:08:31,287 --> 02:08:34,374
Look, Miles, what I said at the door...

1683
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,626
it wasn't just talk.

1684
02:08:38,086 --> 02:08:42,757
Look, you know, I was thinking
maybe we could find a nice wall...

1685
02:08:42,924 --> 02:08:46,052
privately owned,
like at the police station...

1686
02:08:46,219 --> 02:08:51,641
and you could "throw up"
some of your art.

1687
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:54,227
Man, I'm bad at this.

1688
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:57,772
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1689
02:08:57,939 --> 02:09:00,692
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1690
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:02,985
- Officer.
- Spider-Man!

1691
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:05,947
Listen, down there, that was...

1692
02:09:06,114 --> 02:09:07,615
I mean, I owe you...

1693
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,118
Okay!

1694
02:09:17,208 --> 02:09:19,335
I look forward to workin' with you.

1695
02:09:19,502 --> 02:09:22,255
Yeah, me, too. I guess.

1696
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:25,258
I don't approve of your methods...

1697
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:28,803
but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

1698
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,180
Thank you for your bravery tonight.

1699
02:09:31,931 --> 02:09:33,057
I love you.

1700
02:09:33,224 --> 02:09:34,559
Wait, what?

1701
02:09:34,726 --> 02:09:36,769
And look behind you!

1702
02:09:47,739 --> 02:09:49,240
All right. Cool. Yeah.

1703
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:52,160
- Thanks, Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man, <i>a su servicio.</i> Thank you.

1704
02:09:52,326 --> 02:09:54,454
- Hey, man. What's up, little man?
- New Spider-Man.

1705
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:57,999
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.
Check it out.

1706
02:09:59,417 --> 02:10:01,794
That was part of the move.

1707
02:10:02,336 --> 02:10:06,549
<i>Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?
For real this time. This is it.</i>

1708
02:10:06,716 --> 02:10:10,386
<i>My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

1709
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:14,098
<i>And for like two days, I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

1710
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,851
<i>I think you know the rest.
I finished my essay.</i>

1711
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:20,188
<i>Saved a bunch of people.</i>

1712
02:10:21,689 --> 02:10:23,357
<i>Got hit by a drone.</i>

1713
02:10:23,733 --> 02:10:25,109
<i>I did this with my dad.</i>

1714
02:10:26,611 --> 02:10:29,197
<i>Met my roommate. Finally.</i>

1715
02:10:30,656 --> 02:10:34,160
<i>Slapped a sticker
where my dad's never gonna find it.</i>

1716
02:10:34,327 --> 02:10:38,539
<i>And when I feel alone, like no one
understands what I'm going through...</i>

1717
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:41,626
<i>I remember my friends who get it.</i>

1718
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:51,052
<i>I never thought
I'd be able to do any of this stuff.</i>

1719
02:10:51,219 --> 02:10:52,595
<i>But I can.</i>

1720
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,973
<i>Anyone can wear the mask.</i>

1721
02:10:57,475 --> 02:11:00,061
<i>You could wear the mask.</i>

1722
02:11:01,354 --> 02:11:04,690
<i>If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.</i>

1723
02:11:13,241 --> 02:11:14,283
<i>'Cause I'm Spider-Man.</i>

1724
02:11:16,327 --> 02:11:18,621
<i>And I'm not the only one.</i>

1725
02:11:19,163 --> 02:11:20,414
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

1726
02:11:28,256 --> 02:11:31,467
Miles. Miles!

1727
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:33,427
You got a minute?

1728
02:12:01,747 --> 02:12:05,251
Thank you so much for watching that.
That was really fun to show you.

1729
02:12:05,334 --> 02:12:07,563
I'm really impressed you made it
all the way through to the end.

1730
02:12:07,587 --> 02:12:09,297
You guys are true believers.

1731
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:11,257
Believe it or not, there's more.

1732
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,175
And we don't want you to miss out on it.

1733
02:12:13,259 --> 02:12:16,637
- So root around all over this disc.
- There are Easter eggs.

1734
02:12:16,721 --> 02:12:20,099
- Or electronic thing.
- Bonuses, interviews.

1735
02:12:20,182 --> 02:12:21,767
All sorts of crazy stuff.

1736
02:12:21,851 --> 02:12:25,354
And if you're a completist,
which you clearly are,

1737
02:12:25,438 --> 02:12:26,856
do not get up from that couch.

1738
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,774
- Go check it out.
- Please.

1739
02:22:13,108 --> 02:22:15,444
- You're a bit late.
- We can't all be everywhere at once.

1740
02:22:15,611 --> 02:22:16,945
Little text might've been nice.

1741
02:22:17,112 --> 02:22:19,072
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

1742
02:22:19,198 --> 02:22:21,116
Okay. I know what it looks like.

1743
02:22:21,283 --> 02:22:23,702
- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.

1744
02:22:23,869 --> 02:22:25,621
The multiverse <i>didn't</i> collapse.

1745
02:22:25,787 --> 02:22:27,289
- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.

1746
02:22:27,456 --> 02:22:28,499
But it worked out.

1747
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:31,665
- Great story. Did you finish the goober?
- It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.

1748
02:22:31,793 --> 02:22:34,063
Do you always have to call me out? It's
just really frustrating and bums me out.

1749
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:35,255
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1750
02:22:35,422 --> 02:22:36,942
- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.

1751
02:22:37,049 --> 02:22:40,552
But you could be the first person
to make an autonomous multiverse jump.

1752
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:41,553
Or the last.

1753
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:43,555
So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?

1754
02:22:43,722 --> 02:22:46,558
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

1755
02:22:46,725 --> 02:22:49,478
Let's start at the beginning one last time.

1756
02:22:49,645 --> 02:22:51,688
Earth '67.

1757
02:22:54,274 --> 02:22:55,817
Whoa! What the...?

1758
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:56,818
I'm Spider-Man.

1759
02:22:56,985 --> 02:22:58,963
- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?

1760
02:22:58,987 --> 02:23:01,281
I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.

1761
02:23:01,448 --> 02:23:03,617
- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.

1762
02:23:03,784 --> 02:23:05,786
- It's rude to point.
<i>- You're</i> being very rude.

1763
02:23:06,328 --> 02:23:08,080
Which one pointed first?

1764
02:23:08,247 --> 02:23:10,040
Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.

1765
02:23:10,207 --> 02:23:12,060
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

1766
02:23:12,084 --> 02:23:13,084
Look at your finger.

1767
02:23:13,168 --> 02:23:15,063
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

1768
02:23:15,087 --> 02:23:16,421
You haven't seen pointing.

1769
02:23:16,588 --> 02:23:18,674
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!
