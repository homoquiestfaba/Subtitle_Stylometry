00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:24,189
Matilda, you promise
you'll come back soon?

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,933
Of course I will, sweetheart.

4
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm just hurrying home to get
ready for my grandchildren.

5
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,089
They're coming to see
me tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:34,450
I will be back on
Monday, don't you worry.

7
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:36,943
I'll miss you.

8
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,038
I'll miss you too.

9
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,931
You be good.

00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,167

00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:13,907
Hello?

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,317
Is somebody there?

14
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,463
Huh.

00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:19,578
[dog barking in distance]

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,060
Is that you, kitty?

- [dramatic, ominous music]
- [crickets chirp]

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,593
Hello?

19
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:39,598
[rapid footsteps in grass]

20
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:46,230

[soft, bright music]

22
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,689
- Hey tony.
- [tony]<i> hey,</i>

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,356
<i>Did you get the package?</i>

24
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:59,451
Okay, I'm opening it now.

25
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:00,723
<i>You're gonna love it, Remy.</i>

26
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,454
[gasps]

27
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,935
[Remy] oh, tony, it's beautiful!

28
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,625
Turned out great, right?

29
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:09,353
And thank you for agreeing
to not add "socialite".

30
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,015
To the about the author blurb.

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,001
<i>I still think it could
only help in the marketing.</i>

32
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,041
<i>To leverage that aspect
of your personal brand.</i>

33
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:17,544
<i>Because you are in
fact, a socialite, Remy.</i>

34
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,190
<i>Your father is Marcus bell,</i>

35
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:20,973
<i>One of the wealthiest
men in Atlanta.</i>

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,699
<i>You've been in the society pages.</i>

37
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,534
<i>- Since you were a teen.</i>
- Stop, please,

38
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:27,037
It's a sexist word
and I don't like it.

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,873
Anyway, it looks
absolutely perfect.

40
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,628
You're the best publisher ever.

41
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,560
<i>It's gonna be a good
piece of business.</i>

42
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,063
I sure hope so, my charity
could definitely use the funds.

43
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,399
<i>I still think you should
take at least a little cut.</i>

44
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:40,717
Why?

45
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,305
- That makes zero sense.
- [phone rings]

46
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,572
Oh shoot, I'm supposed to
meet the next nanny candidate.

47
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:46,832
Thanks again, tony.

48
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:52,482
[sighs]

49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,173
Oh, hey, where are you off to?

50
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,899
On my way to go
interview a new nanny.

51
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:58,655
- That's right, good luck.
- Thanks.

52
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,994
Oh, how'd the new book turn out?

53
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,659
- Just perfect.
- Yeah?

54
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,994
All right, you gotta show me.

55
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,570
I'll make sure you get a copy.

56
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:06,594
Please.

57
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:09,741
[soft music]

58
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:12,766
[jack]<i> sorry, Remy, I</i>
<i>can't make it, I'm swamped.</i>

59
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,861
Well, we were supposed to be
interviewing her together.

60
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,697
<i>I would've thought choosing
someone to look after our child.</i>

61
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,682
<i>Is something you'd
want to be a part of.</i>

62
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,944
Of course it is something I
want to be a part of, Remy.

63
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,831
<i>You were the one who
wanted me to get involved.</i>

64
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,372
<i>In the family
business, remember?</i>

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,690
Uh huh.

66
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:30,784
Come on, Remy, nobody
knows better than you.

67
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,527
What kind of time
suck this can be.

68
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,787
And it's all on me.

69
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,048
Now that your father
has relocated to Canada.

70
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,625
To spearhead this new
property development deal.

71
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,460
<i>Yeah, okay, whatever.</i>

72
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:41,698
I'll take care of it myself.

73
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,888
[pone beeping]

74
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,016
[soft music]

75
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,686
- [sighs]
- [soft music]

76
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,135
Kendra Patterson, for
the nanny position?

77
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:08,413
- Yes, mrs. Bell-winter.
- Call me Remy.

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,990
You're really early.

79
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,584
Yes, I know, the bus got me
here sooner than I thought.

80
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,712
No need to be sorry, come on in.

81
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,817
[soft music]

82
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,095
Would you like some iced
tea or water or lemonade?

83
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,246
No thank you.

84
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,243
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.

85
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,492
[Remy] let's go into
the sitting room then.

86
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,436
- Yes, mrs. Bell-winter.
- Remy.

87
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:32,587
Sorry.

88
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,801
[Remy] no need to say sorry.

89
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,669
[sighs]

90
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,006
So as the agency probably
told you, this was unexpected.

91
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,675
We had a nanny,
Matilda, who we loved,

92
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:49,674
But she suddenly quit
out of nowhere,

93
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,015
No explanation.

94
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:53,700
And it was my
birthday yesterday...

95
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:56,536
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Oh, thanks.

96
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,965
But what I was going to say
is that she never reached out.

97
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,876
Or anything and she's
always made such a big deal.

98
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:04,303
About our birthdays.

99
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,806
- It's just so.
- Strange.

100
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,809
Right.

101
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:15,605
Anyway, we started seeing
candidates recently.

102
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,964
I must say I was most looking
forward to meeting you.

103
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,655
Wow, I'm flattered, why?

104
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:31,163
Well, it says here being
a nanny was your calling.

105
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,000
From a young age and it's
all you've ever wanted to do.

106
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,151
That's right.

107
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,729
Why is that?

108
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,916
My mother, she was
such a nurturing woman.

109
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:45,469
And I wanna be just like
her to honor her memory.

110
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,512
Her memory?

111
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,900
She passed?

112
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:49,924
Yes.

113
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,516
I'm so sorry, Kendra.

114
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:55,812
I lost my mother a little
over five years ago.

115
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,024
I still think
about it every day.

116
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,251
I know the feeling.

117
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,195
So do you want to
have kids someday?

118
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,088
Oh no, no.

119
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,032
I just wanna put
the childcare skills.

120
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,117
That my mother taught
me to use as a nanny.

121
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,165
I know in my heart that
it's my life's work.

122
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,764
I've worked with children
in one way or the other.

123
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,692
Since I was 13 and
I can't even imagine.

124
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,544
Wanting to do anything else.

125
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,771
I see that.

126
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,443
Well, I'd like to try you out.

127
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,698
To see how you and
Ella get along.

128
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,296
She'll make the
ultimate decision.

129
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,298
- Really?
- Yes, really.

130
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,967
You and everyone
else at the agency.

131
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,115
All have similar relevant
experience and of course,

132
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,876
Each of your backgrounds
have been thoroughly checked,

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,817
Which is important to be sure.

134
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:47,739
But with you, I sense
a real genuine passion.

135
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,576
For what you do and
that counts for a lot.

136
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,080
Thank you, I'm so pleased.

137
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,251
Of course I would love
for you to meet Ella now,

138
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:03,480
But she's in ballet class,
she's pretty into it.

139
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,832
She's a really
bright little girl.

140
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:09,572
She's six, but she's already
reading at a third grade level.

141
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,931
- That's very impressive.
- Yeah, she's an amazing kid.

142
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,246
Not sure where she gets it from.

143
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,102
- [laughs]
- let me walk you out.

144
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:18,489
Thank you.

145
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,273
[Remy] why don't you
get everything you need.

146
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:22,143
For an overnight stay and
we'll take it from there.

147
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,775
[Kendra] of course.

148
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,111

151
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,635
Hey, you must be Kendra.

152
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,282
Yes, hello.

153
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,047
Come on in, I'm jack.

154
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:58,029
[crickets chirp]

155
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,294
Remy's upstairs
giving Ella a bath,

156
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:02,033
I guess they worked the
kids pretty hard in ballet.

157
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,961
Can I get you
something to drink or?

158
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,226
No, I'm fine,

159
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,894
- Okay.
- But thank you for asking.

160
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,948
Yeah, come on, I'll show
you where you're staying.

161
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,116
[ominous music]

162
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,952
So this is you.

163
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,405
Wow, this is so nice.

164
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,624
Yeah, get settled.

165
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,504
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

166
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:31,676
[ominous music]

167
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,994
You excited to meet Kendra?

168
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,926
I guess.

169
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,761
You miss Matilda?

170
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:43,855
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me too.

171
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,026
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you think of Kendra.

172
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,933
Mommy likes her, but
what's most important.

173
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,196
Is to see if you like her.

174
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,183
You ready?

175
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:57,786
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

176
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:02,356
[ominous music]

177
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,601
- [door knocks]
- yes?

178
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:06,786
[Remy] are you
ready to meet Ella?

179
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,963
Of course.

180
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,461
Hello, Ella, my name is Kendra.

181
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,033
How was ballet today?

182
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,948
Good.

183
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,611
[Kendra] I heard you guys
had to work pretty hard.

184
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,372
Did you learn any new moves?

185
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,804
- Yes.
- [laughs]

186
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,898
Do you wanna show me?

187
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,314
That was incredible.

188
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,483
I can't believe how good you
are for such a young lady.

189
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:40,056
I'm not a young lady,
I'm a little girl.

190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,821
[laughs]

191
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,226
Of course you are.

192
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,325
I can do more stuff too.

193
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,401
Maybe you can show
Kendra your room.

194
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,087
And hang out before dinner.

195
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:51,278
Maybe show her some of the
rest of your dance moves.

196
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:52,483
Okay, mommy.

197
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,178
[soft, ominous music]

198
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,773
[laughs]

199
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,162
- [claps]
- bravo.

200
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,094
This is the book my
mom wrote about me.

201
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:14,687
You can read it if you want.

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,615
Oh, thank you, Ella.

203
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,682
And maybe I can tell you
a story about my life.

204
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:21,264
When I was a little girl,
would you like that?

205
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,288
Sure.

206
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,415
[soft music]

207
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,870
Oh, wow, it's so nice.

208
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,539
Your mom did a great job.

209
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,966
- [laughs]
- yes,

210
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,951
Your dress did make
it into the book.

211
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:38,448
- [laughs]
- that's awesome.

212
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,192
[Ella] tell her now, in
case she changes her mind.

213
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,452
- Okay.
- Okay.

214
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,768
[laughs]

215
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,646
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,150
Sorry to disturb you,
you have a second?

217
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,060
Of course.

218
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,041
Well, Ella was gonna throw
a fit if we didn't tell you.

219
00:10:57,065 --> 00:11:00,378
That we want you to officially
come on as her nanny.

220
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:03,553
We didn't wanna rush the
decision, but she's insistent.

221
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:06,239
She was worried you were
gonna change your mind.

222
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,143
[laughs]

223
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,502
So how about it?

224
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,245
I would love to.

225
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,650
Great.

226
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,985
I'll let you finish
your dinner in peace.

227
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,509
[laughs]

228
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,011
Oh, the code to the house
alarm is ella's birthday,

229
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:21,930
- 10-14-18.
- Thank you.

230
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:25,644
- [soft, ominous music]
- uh, no.

231
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,334
No one's excused from the table.

232
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,572
[jack] I've got work to do.

233
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,241
And besides, I can
get it from the table.

234
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:32,098
Whenever I want,
Remy, I'm not a child.

235
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,100
But it's family time.

236
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,845
[jack] I told you I have to
get these emails out, tonight.

237
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,605
[Ella] stop arguing.

238
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,533
[Remy] it's okay, baby.

239
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:46,371
- [soft, ominous music]
- [crickets chirp]

240
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:11,621
- [spits]
- [ominous music]

241
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:16,359
- [crickets chirp]
- [soft, ominous music]

242
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,837
- Hey.
- Oh.

243
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,097
I am sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

244
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,783
I was just checking on Ella.

245
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,285
Make yourself at home.

246
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,340
- I'm sorry, mr.
- No, no, no, no,

247
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,790
Hey, it's okay, you
can have some cake.

248
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:15,438
I was just teasing, and
please call me jack.

249
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,462
No, no, that was wrong of me.

250
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,110
Remy would be upset that I
didn't ask her for permission.

251
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,208
Remy's not like that.

252
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,613
I shouldn't have done it.

253
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,637
Relax.

254
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,475
- [crickets chirp]
- [soft music]

255
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,294
Promise me you won't tell Remy.

256
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:34,704
This job means the world to me,

257
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:37,131
And I promise I
won't do it again.

258
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,400
- It's really not a problem.
- Promise.

259
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,321
Okay, I promise.

260
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,990
- [laughs]
- thank you jack, I owe you.

261
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,139
You don't owe me.

262
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,074
- [crickets chirp]
- [soft music]

263
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,168
Pretty sweet house, huh?

264
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,504
Yes it is.

265
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:00,731
It's kind of crazy.

266
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,486
Kind of like living
in a museum here.

267
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,988
You didn't grow up like this?

268
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,086
[laughs]

269
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,848
No, I grew up dirt poor.

270
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,329
Not a lot of haves in heart well.

271
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,761
Just a few thousand have nots,

272
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,763
Making the best
of the situation.

273
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,484
I understand that, we
have a lot in common.

274
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:23,921
Is that so?

275
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,441
- [soft music]
- [crickets chirp]

276
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,184
I better got to bed.

277
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,537
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

278
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,497
- [soft music]
- [crickets chirp]

279
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:43,631
- [soft, ominous music]
- [crickets chirp]

280
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,721
Hey, how'd the
nanny interview go?

281
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,987
It went really well,
we've already hired her.

282
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,730
Wow, that was fast.

283
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,374
It was ella's decision, really.

284
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,380
- So, show me the book.
- Oh, yes.

285
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:29,486
Wow.

286
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,338
I got another
confirmation from a donor,

287
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,409
For the gala tonight.

288
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,265
That's great.

289
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,654
Oh shoot, that reminds me,

290
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,585
I forgot to pick up my
dress from the cleaners.

291
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,997
Maybe your nanny could do it?

292
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,276
That's not her job, but
maybe she wouldn't mind.

293
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,904
- [phone dialing]
- Remy, this is amazing.

294
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,261
They did such a great job.

295
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,619
[phone rings]

296
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:00,249
Hello mrs. Bell-winter.
I mean hello Remy.

297
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,606
How's your first
day together going?

298
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,297
Very well, we're just about
to head out to the park.

299
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,873
How lovely.

300
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,544
Hey, listen, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

301
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,029
<i>And feel free to say no,</i>

302
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:14,806
As it's not in your
job description.

303
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,474
What is it?

304
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,955
Can you pick up my dress
from harry's dry cleaning?

305
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,290
I have to wear it for this
work gala thing tonight.

306
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,981
And I won't be able
to get away from work.

307
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,725
You can of course use my uber
account I set up for you.

308
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,631
Of course, no problem.

309
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,396
You sure you don't mind?

310
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,381
Don't mind at all.

311
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,211
You're a lifesaver,
thanks Kendra.

312
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:35,235
You're welcome.

313
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,813
[Ella] let's go.

314
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:43,312
Yeah, let's go.

315
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,336
Right.

316
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:48,231
[soft music]

317
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,300
Mommy's going to a
fancy party tonight.

318
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,570
Yes, I know.

319
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:56,681
You should see her when
she's all dressed up.

320
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,599
She's so pretty.

321
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:00,904
Is she?

322
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,855
I want to grow up
to be just like her.

323
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,356
[dramatic music]

324
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:07,525
My friends told me
that she's famous.

325
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:11,270
And that she gets her
pictures taken a lot,

326
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,700
- Since she was a little girl.
- [dramatic music]

327
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:16,754
No, don't!

328
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:18,848
I'm gonna fall!

329
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,330
Too high, too high, too high!

330
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,169
- [dramatic music]
- hi Ella, hey.

331
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:29,692
[Ella] can I go play with Carly?

332
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,716
Sure.

333
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:33,793
Oh, hello, my name's lupita.

334
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:35,536
Hi, Kendra.

335
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,721
You must be the new nanny?

336
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,609
I sure am.

337
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,300
[lupita] I knew the
last nanny, Matilda.

338
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,302
I've heard good
things about her.

339
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:45,374
Yeah, no one knows
what happened,

340
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,543
She just stopped coming to work,

341
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,067
Stopped talking to the family.

342
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,527
That's strange.

343
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,655
Oh, will you excuse me please?

344
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,575
Ella, we have to go soon.

345
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:00,486
Can we play for just
a few more minutes?

346
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,371
Okay, just a few.

347
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:07,877
[dramatic, ominous music]

348
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,427
Isn't this a pretty dress?

349
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,154
It sure is.

350
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,823
All of mommy's
dresses are pretty.

351
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,934
I wonder what it would
look like on you.

352
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,918
It would be too big.

353
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,012
Of course it would.

354
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,251
Wouldn't it be funny to see
what that would look like?

355
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,275
Yeah.

356
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,853
Maybe I could try it on.

357
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,947
Maybe you could.

358
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:38,449
Hey, I have an idea,

359
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:39,929
When's the last time that
you went into the woods.

360
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,597
Behind your house?

361
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,529
I don't know.

362
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,957
Why don't you go and pick
some wildflowers for your mom?

363
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:48,771
I bet there are some
pretty ones back there.

364
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,795
Okay.

365
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,881
[soft, ominous music]

366
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,761
[laughs]

367
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,806
Try not to wrinkle it.

368
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:04,809
I don't think this
is gonna work.

369
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,956
- [laughs]
- I think you're right.

370
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,312
It's nap time anyway.

371
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,733
How about I tell you a story
about when I was a little girl.

372
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,987
Okay.

373
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:23,881
Once upon a time, there was
a little girl named Kendra.

374
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,405
- That's you.
- It is.

375
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:29,386
And she was the luckiest
girl in the world.

376
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,576
Why?

377
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,670
I'll tell you why.

378
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:35,006
She was the luckiest
girl in the world.

379
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:38,918
Because she had the best
mommy in the whole world.

380
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,513
Go away, Hailey, I
can't take this anymore.

381
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:48,519
They didn't have much,
but they had each other.

382
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,855
[soft music]

383
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:06,787
[dramatic, ominous music]

384
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,767
- [laughs]
- [dramatic, ominous music]

385
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,290
[crickets chirp]

386
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,803
- Your gin and tonic.
- Thank you, Kendra.

387
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,265
You really didn't
have to do that.

388
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,289
Oh, it's my pleasure.

389
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,625
Is it good?

390
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,810
It's very good.

391
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,961
Glad to hear that.

392
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,130
Oh my god, you look
absolutely amazing.

393
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,798
You're too kind.

394
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,805
This dress would make
anyone look good.

395
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,376
Thanks for picking it up.

396
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,568
Oh my pleasure, would you
like a drink before you go?

397
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,070
Oh no, no, no.

398
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,405
She has the tolerance
of a two year old.

399
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,198
Yeah, I'll save my one
drink for the gala.

400
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:16,887
Unless you wanna see
her blackout drunk,

401
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:17,668
Running out through
the neighborhood.

402
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,670
- Jack!
- [laughs]

403
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:21,839
Wow.

404
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,174
Shall we go?

405
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,820
Yes, you two go
have a good time,

406
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,235
Ella and I will
hold down the fort.

407
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,845
- Thanks, see you later.
- Yeah.

408
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:36,479
- [crickets chirp]
- [dramatic, ominous music]

409
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,755
[sighs]

410
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:47,990
Thanks for coming tonight.

411
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,428
Do I have a choice?

412
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,871
Come on, jack.

413
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:56,374
Sorry, it's just, you
know, this kind of stuff.

414
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:59,543
Isn't for me, I feel like
it's all a performance.

415
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,505
It's for a good cause.

416
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,632
It always is.

417
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:09,106
[sighs]

418
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,849
- [soft, light music]
- [people chatter]

419
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,652
- I believe you know my wife.
- Hi.

420
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:38,468
You know, Remy, it really is
quite an impressive turnout.

421
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:42,253
And such a lovely space,
thank you for having us.

422
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,756
Please, it's I, who should
be thanking you both.

423
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:48,259
Remy, what's wrong?

424
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,337
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

425
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,076
[jack] honey, what?

426
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,319
If you all would
please excuse me.

427
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:58,102
- Remy.
- Do you think she'll be okay?

428
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,254
Excuse us.

429
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:04,166
- [dramatic music]
- [people chatter]

430
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,944
- Remy!
- [dramatic music]

431
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:11,782
- [crickets chirp]
- [soft music]

432
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,954
I just rearranged the
furniture yesterday.

433
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,748
It's quite impressive.

434
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,252
So is there a nanny
in this house?

435
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,023
No.

436
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,454
Do you think I
should get a nanny?

437
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:31,947
It depends.

438
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,787
On what?

439
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:36,891
On whether Becky
wants a nanny or not.

440
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,962
Did you have a nanny
when you were little?

441
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:45,294
Oh no, my mother
loved me so much.

442
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,537
That she wanted
me all to herself.

443
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,540
In fact, if she had to
work nights or weekends,

444
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,634
She would sometimes bring
me with her to work,

445
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,045
If our neighbor
couldn't watch me.

446
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,286
Why doesn't my mommy
feel that way about me?

447
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,999
I'm not sure.

448
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:07,004
- [soft music]
- [phone rings]

449
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,249
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, it's jack.</i>

450
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,394
Hi jack.

451
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:12,751
<i>Remy's in the hospital.</i>

452
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:13,903
Oh no!

453
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:15,491
<i>Can you watch Ella tonight?</i>

454
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,072
Right, of course.

455
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,682
<i>- We'll be home tomorrow.</i>
- Okay.

456
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,336
What's wrong?

457
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,189
Your mommy had to
go to the hospital.

458
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,023
Why?

459
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,744
Is she sick?

460
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:30,172
She'll be fine, but she's
going to stay overnight,

461
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,271
So we'll visit her
in the morning.

462
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:33,697
It's going to be okay.

463
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,701
- Promise?
- Of course.

464
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:41,872
[soft, ominous music]

465
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,104
[Ella] I'm sad I can't hug you.

466
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,049
I know, I'm sorry I
can't hug you too.

467
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,460
Does it hurt?

468
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:57,199
They have me on medication,

469
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,873
So I feel a little better now.

470
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,559
When are you coming home?

471
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,969
The doctor said I'll be
coming home tomorrow.

472
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,230
I don't understand how the
heck you got poison ivy.

473
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:07,381
On your dress.

474
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:11,310
- I'm hungry.
- [laughs]

475
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:12,719
Give your mom an air kiss.

476
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,053
And we'll go down to the
cafeteria and get you something.

477
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,438
- We'll be back.
- All right.

478
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:25,641
I don't wanna get
Ella in trouble,

479
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,068
But I think I know
what happened.

480
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:29,587
What do you mean?

481
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,400
Well, I told her she could
go pick some wildflowers.

482
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,665
Out in the back and she
must have gotten poison ivy.

483
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,909
On her clothes because I
found her in your room later.

484
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:38,003
Playing with your
dress, trying it on.

485
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,557
And the clothes must
have gotten mixed up.

486
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,340
- Oh Ella.
- I know.

487
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,911
But when I go back home,

488
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,913
I can go out in the woods and
get rid of the poison ivy.

489
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:45,914
Oh, you don't have to do that.

490
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,496
Oh, I insist.

491
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,181
I used to help my mother garden,

492
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,586
I've got quite the green thumb.

493
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,109
It's the least I can do to help.

494
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,171
Hey.

495
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,784
Hi, I'm David, I work with Remy.

496
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:02,027
I'm Kendra.

497
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,437
The nanny, heard good things.

498
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,040
[Kendra] oh good.

499
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,108
Is this a bad time?

500
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:09,605
Oh, I was just leaving.

501
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,128
I'll go meet up
with jack and Ella.

502
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,609
[dramatic music]

503
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,300
- Hey.
- You didn't have to come by.

504
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:17,527
No worries.

505
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:20,763
You said in your text
it was poison ivy?

506
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:22,806
Long story.

507
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,218
So what's the damage?

508
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,388
Well, the gala sort of
ended before the big ask.

509
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,556
For the childhood food
insecurity program.

510
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,651
Yeah, I figured.

511
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,062
I guess it would be impersonal
to do an email blast.

512
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,156
Could do that.

513
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,901
I have an idea,

514
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:46,121
Why don't we have a barbecue
at my house for the donors?

515
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:49,645
Long as I don't have
to man the grill.

516
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,835
[laughs]

517
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:59,009
Mind if I join you?

518
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:02,565
- Sure.
- Thanks.

519
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,807
Wanted to give Remy some
time alone with David.

520
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:06,758
He's here?

521
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:08,852
Yeah, they seem pretty close.

522
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,941
I always kind of thought that.

523
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:18,195
[soft, dramatic music]

524
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:22,366
- How's the jell-o?
- It's okay.

525
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,609
Hospital food.

526
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,515
Tell you what,

527
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,683
I'll make you your favorite
grilled cheese for lunch.

528
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,448
You're the best!

529
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,378
- [laughs]
- [soft, dramatic music]

530
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,056
- Hey baby, I'm home.
- Welcome home, mommy.

531
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,391
Oh, thank you, honey.

532
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,781
[laughs]

533
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:56,286
Listen, I wanna talk to
you about what happened.

534
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,310
What do you mean?

535
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:01,363
Well, Kendra told me it was
your idea to try on the dress.

536
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,074
You shouldn't have done that.

537
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:05,484
I'm not mad,

538
00:29:05,636 --> 00:29:07,222
- But in the future.
- It wasn't my idea.

539
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,413
Ella darling don't
make it worse by lying.

540
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:10,914
I'm not lying.

541
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,325
You don't believe me
because you don't love me.

542
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:15,252
Of course, I love you.

543
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:18,163
I love you more than
anything in the whole world.

544
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,548
I tell you that all the time.

545
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,904
Well, why do you
have a nanny for me.

546
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,429
Instead of taking
care of me yourself?

547
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,175
I love spending
time with you, Ella.

548
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,269
I grew up with a nanny too,

549
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,563
And I know my mommy
loved me very much.

550
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,274
Did daddy have a nanny?

551
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:40,444
Well, no.

552
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,000
What's this all about Ella?

553
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:47,267
Kendra said that her
mommy loved her so much.

554
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,679
That she didn't want anyone
else to take care of her.

555
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:54,208
- What?
- [soft, dramatic music]

556
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:57,869
- [door knocks]
- yes?

557
00:29:58,022 --> 00:29:59,546
It's me, can we talk?

558
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:04,446
Of course, about what?

559
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,637
Did you tell Ella
that I don't love her?

560
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:08,713
What?

561
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:09,808
Of course not.

562
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:11,550
Or that I don't love her enough.

563
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,477
To take care of her myself?

564
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:14,978
No.

565
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:16,205
Why?

566
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,563
Ella told me, you said your
mother loved you so much.

567
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,652
She wouldn't let a
nanny take care of you.

568
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,398
Oh, I see where
the confusion is.

569
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,492
- Confusion?
- Yes.

570
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:31,144
Ella asked about my mother
and if I had a nanny,

571
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:33,330
Which of course I didn't.

572
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:36,052
Yes and?

573
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:38,980
Well, Ella said, maybe
you don't love her enough.

574
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,558
To take care of her by yourself.

575
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,507
<i>- She</i> said that?
- Yes.

576
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:45,879
And you let her believe that?

577
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:47,845
No, rather than
get into the fact.

578
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:49,549
That my mother couldn't
afford a nanny,

579
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:52,068
I said that you
love Ella so much.

580
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,736
That you have somebody
else to pay even more.

581
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,572
Attention to her,

582
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:58,667
That you give her even
more than I ever had.

583
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,931
And I didn't think.

584
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,625
It was appropriate to
get into the whole,

585
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,360
You know, money thing.

586
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,698
I see.

587
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:12,589
Ella also said it was your
idea to try on the dress.

588
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:15,447
Well that's normal, right?

589
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,208
Kids sometimes tell little white
lies to get out of trouble.

590
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:22,454
I suppose you're right.

591
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,767
Do you want me to go with you
so we can clear all this up?

592
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,459
Oh, no, no, no, I don't
wanna make a big deal of it.

593
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,553
That's probably best.

594
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,555
You're a good mom, Remy.

595
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,225
I just hope my
daughter thinks so.

596
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:37,377
I'm sure she does.

597
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:39,949
Thanks, Kendra,
sorry to bother you.

598
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:40,973
No problem.

599
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,232
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

600
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:46,236
[ominous music]

601
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,111
You don't have to come to the
barbecue if you don't want.

602
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,225
How can I not come?

603
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,652
It's in my house.

604
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,986
You know what I mean.

605
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,633
You can go out with your
friends or whatever,

606
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:58,323
I won't be upset.

607
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,899
Oh, I bet you wouldn't,

608
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,897
Leave you alone with David
so you too can play house.

609
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,645
Are you kidding, really?

610
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:05,808
[jack] how is it possible
that the two of you.

611
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:08,333
Made a decision to have
this thing in our house.

612
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,480
Without consulting me?

613
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:13,408
It's a work thing and
we need the donations.

614
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,911
- For our new project.
- Forget it, Remy,

615
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,842
I've heard all of this before.

616
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,513
It's for a great cause,
yada yada, do what you want.

617
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:23,523
- Jack, don't.
- Goodnight.

618
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,444
[soft music]

619
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:32,783
[dramatic, ominous music]

620
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:43,853
Is something wrong?

621
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,799
You told mommy that it was
my idea to try on the dress.

622
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,709
But it was.

623
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,377
No it wasn't.

624
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,379
I asked you,
wouldn't it be funny.

625
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,806
To see what it would look like.

626
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:59,217
And then you said maybe
I could try it on.

627
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,478
So technically it was your idea.

628
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm happy to lie
and tell your mama,

629
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,128
It was all my idea if you want,

630
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,112
But then I would have to
leave and I would miss you.

631
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:12,656
Would you miss me?

632
00:33:12,883 --> 00:33:13,883
Yes.

633
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,643
So maybe we should
just forget about it.

634
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:19,246
- Okay?
- Okay.

635
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:21,814
I love you, Ella.

636
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:22,908
I love you too.

637
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:27,421
[soft, ominous music]

638
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:33,844
- [people chatter]
- [light music]

639
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:44,354
Well, ella's up in her
room with her friends.

640
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:45,506
That's good, thanks.

641
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,027
[Kendra] quite the charmer.

642
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:51,344
[jack] who?

643
00:33:51,438 --> 00:33:53,655
Remy's friend, David,
that's his name, right?

644
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:55,925
Yep.

645
00:33:57,944 --> 00:34:00,445
Well, it looks like the
party was a success.

646
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,780
Was it your idea?

647
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:04,093
No, I wasn't even consulted.

648
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,784
Really?

649
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:08,545
That doesn't seem right,
this is your house.

650
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:10,839
No, it doesn't seem right.

651
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,552
Well, I need to get
back to the kids.

652
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:20,390
- [light music]
- [people chatter]

653
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:31,977
Hey, jack.

654
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,290
So mission accomplished,

655
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:35,942
Made our ask and we
already got commitments.

656
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:37,046
From several of the donors.

657
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,079
Well, sure appreciate
you guys hosting us.

658
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:44,414
I'm not hosting, David,
you and Remy are.

659
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:49,753
Well no, I mean, I'm
just here to help Remy.

660
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,758
Right.

661
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,595
- Did I say something?
- It's not you.

662
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:04,434
- [sighs]
- [light music]

663
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,087
- Jack!
- What?

664
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:10,165
- What was that about?
- What?

665
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,569
The way you were
talking to David,

666
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:12,995
Why are you being so rude?

667
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,185
I'm rude?

668
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:15,928
Can you keep your voice down?

669
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:18,835
All I do is keep my voice down.

670
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:21,693
I don't have a voice in
anything around here.

671
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:22,869
It's all about you.

672
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:25,914
Enjoy your party.

673
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,536
- [light music]
- [birds chirp]

674
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,256
[dramatic music]

675
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,857
[crickets chirp]

676
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:42,117
[Remy] I can't
believe you did that.

677
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,473
What?

678
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,049
Spoke up for myself?

679
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,955
In front of everybody?

680
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,698
Do you know how
that made me look?

681
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:50,730
[jack] right, so I
screwed up, again.

682
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,985
Do we need to go back
to the counselor?

683
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:56,631
Why?

684
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,229
Talking about it
doesn't do anything.

685
00:35:58,382 --> 00:35:59,489
It didn't last time.

686
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:09,741
Look, can we just,
can we not do this?

687
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,836
I have to get some sleep, I
leave for Charlotte tomorrow.

688
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:14,649
With David?

689
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,506
[Remy] yes, picking
him up at nine.

690
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,844
- It's a business trip.
- Right.

691
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:23,588
I'll leave you alone so
you can get some sleep.

692
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,016
Jack, please.

693
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,312
[soft, dramatic music]

694
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,024
[sighs]

695
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,994
I was wondering if we
could talk before you left.

696
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,112
Sure.

697
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:51,186
Jack, I want you to know

698
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,929
I heard what you said last night.

699
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:55,545
And if you want me to
tell David not to go.

700
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:56,772
It's not about that.

701
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:00,383
It's about my day to day
existence in this house.

702
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:03,256
I feel like everything
revolves around you.

703
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,055
And I'm just along for the ride.

704
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,557
Between you and your dad,
I'm just another employee.

705
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,802
You asked.

706
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:13,282
How could you feel that way?

707
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:16,566
I love you jack, and dad
thinks the world of you.

708
00:37:16,793 --> 00:37:17,879
He trusted you
with this business.

709
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,361
While he's out of the country.

710
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:21,363
Let's just drop it.

711
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,075
Jack!

712
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:27,869
[soft music]

713
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:35,730
Look, let's just talk this
out when I get back, okay?

714
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,754
- Whatever you want.
- Good morning.

715
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,383
I'm sorry, I can
go back upstairs.

716
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,427
No, no, you don't
have to do that.

717
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,598
Everything here is
fine, right, honey?

718
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:52,678
Just fine.

719
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:55,438
I'll see you later.

720
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,087
I might be a little late,

721
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,071
I have to wine and dine
some developers, lucky me.

722
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:02,171
No worries.

723
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,431
[soft, ominous music]

724
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,009
Well, I'm gonna go
say goodbye to Ella.

725
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,793
Why don't you set up a
puzzle in the library.

726
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:15,775
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

727
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,105
When I get back from Charlotte.

728
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,296
Sure, I've got
everything under control.

729
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:20,588
[Remy] good.

[soft, ominous music]

736
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:51,704
I woke up from a bad dream,
I thought I heard something.

737
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:52,798
It was just me.

738
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,559
How was your business dinner?

739
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:02,807
It was fine,

740
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:06,569
- [laughs]
- I guess, who cares?

741
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,908
- Is everything okay?
- [soft, ominous music]

742
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,249
- Not really.
- [soft, ominous music]

743
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:28,091
- I shouldn't drink anymore.
- [soft, ominous music]

744
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:34,597
I won't tell, besides
I think you deserve it.

745
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:38,726
[soft, ominous music]

746
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:48,945
- Want one?
- Oh no I couldn't.

747
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,282
I won't tell.

748
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:53,951
Gin and tonic?

749
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:59,038
- Coming right up.
- [soft, dramatic music]

750
00:41:21,538 --> 00:41:26,232
- [laughs]
- [soft, dramatic music]

751
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:31,237
- Gin and tonic.
- [crickets chirp]

752
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Shall we toast?

753
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,495
To what?

754
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,288
To getting what we
deserve in life.

755
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,252
- I'll drink to that.
- [glasses clink]

756
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:55,678
[laughs]

757
00:41:55,905 --> 00:41:57,158
Oh.

758
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,073
My mother used to
drink gin and tonics.

759
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,851
- Yeah?
- They remind me of her.

760
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:05,021
[soft music]

761
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:10,944
Is everything okay?

762
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:16,783
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just my
dream, it was about my mom.

763
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:21,349
- I just miss her so much.
- [cries]

764
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,018
- I'm so sorry you're upset.
- [cries]

765
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,042
- [soft, ominous music]
- thank you.

766
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:29,671
You've always been
so kind to me.

767
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:34,842
Remy is a very lucky woman.

768
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:39,108
I don't think that
she sees it that way.

769
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:43,893
- I do.
- [soft music]

770
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:54,904
- [dramatic music]
- [breathes heavily]

771
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,059
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, sweet baby girl.

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,399
[soft, ominous music]

773
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,499
[Ella] I love you, daddy.

774
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:38,523
I love you too.

775
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:42,435
Is that yummy?

776
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,938
- Yes.
- [laughs]

777
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,624
[jack] you stay
outta trouble today.

778
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,295
[soft, ominous music]

779
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:54,683
There's nothing wrong with
a little bit of trouble,

780
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:59,594
- Right, Ella?
- [soft, ominous music]

781

[plane engine whirs]

782
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,221
[Remy] dad!

783
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:12,707
- What a great surprise!
- [laughs]

784
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,795
- You're in town!
- That's right, Remy.

785
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,227
- That's wonderful!
- Oh its just.

786
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:17,636
For a couple of nights,

787
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,967
But I couldn't stay away
from you and Ella any longer.

788
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,636
[Remy] we can't wait to see you.

789
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,803
All right, I'll see you tonight.

790
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,327
[Remy] love you.

791
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,124
[children chatter]

792
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,555
[Kendra] come on, Ella,
wouldn't you like to play?

793
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,171
Maybe you'd go on the swing?

794
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,823
[birds chirp]

795
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,321
I don't wanna go on the swings.

796
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,656
Why not?

797
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm sad.

798
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,573
What about?

799
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,600
Mommy and daddy
are arguing again.

800
00:44:49,078 --> 00:44:50,687
And how do you know that?

801
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:51,838
I heard them.

802
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,508
Well mommys and daddies
are like that sometimes.

803
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:58,152
You're lucky to
have a mom and dad.

804
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,531
[birds chirp]

805
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,843
Do you want me to tell you.

806
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,267
More about when I
was a little girl?

807
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,922
Okay.

808
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:09,258
I only saw my dad once.

809
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:14,201
He was a nice man and he wanted
to be with me and my mommy,

810
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:16,713
But someone got in the way.

811
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:18,526
The only thing stopping me.

812
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,676
From being with you and
Haley is my daughter Remy.

813
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:25,138
I would never want to hurt her.

814
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:28,224
- If it wasn't for her.
- Leave.

815
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,562
I wanna offer you some financial
support for haley's sake.

816
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:34,616
I don't want your charity.

817
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,693
I want you out and I never
wanna see you again, ever!

818
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,364
[soft, dramatic music]

819
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,060
But it didn't
matter that he left.

820
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:52,874
Because I had my mom and I
knew she would never leave me.

821
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:56,208
And so I thought
everything would be okay.

822
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:57,588
And it was.

823
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:04,552
Until she passed away
after getting pneumonia,

824
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,490
Which I think was really her
way of dying of a broken heart.

825
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,767
Because of what he did to us.

826
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,270
[birds chirp]

827
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:17,190
- I'm sorry your mommy died.
- Me too.

828
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:21,852
But I knew I would
carry on her memory.

829
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,000
By lovingly looking after
other little children,

830
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:27,024
So they wouldn't ever
have to go through.

831
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,621
What I went through, left
alone with no one wanting me.

832
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,698
But I knew that one day,

833
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:39,111
The person who got in the way,
who ruined my mother's life,

834
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:40,546
Would eventually pay for it.

835
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:43,591
That's karma, right?

836
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:46,469
What's karma?

837
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,950
Karma is what happens when
bad people do bad things.

838
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,308
So don't do bad things, okay?

839
00:46:54,554 --> 00:46:57,555
- Okay.
- [birds chirp]

00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,402
- Hey.
- Hey there.

842
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,323
How was your trip?

843
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,991
It was fine.

844
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:11,046
I didn't really move the
needle on any major funding,

845
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,829
But it was good to know.

846
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:15,164
What some other children's
nonprofits are up to.

847
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:20,253
You know, it's a good
thing, what you do.

848
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:22,488
Why thank you.

849
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:27,468
I've been a little
selfish lately.

850
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,181
No, I understand where
you're coming from.

851
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:36,911
I'm sorry for steam
rolling the barbecue.

852
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:39,814
And generally being so bossy.

853
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,484
It's okay, really.

854
00:47:47,106 --> 00:47:50,941
Listen, there's something
I want to tell you.

855
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:52,443
What's that?

856
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,203
Do you like my dress?

857
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,781
Yes, it's very pretty.

858
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,024
Do you like it, daddy?

859
00:47:59,118 --> 00:48:00,793
Of course I do, sweetheart.

860
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,046
Go put your shoes on.

What did you wanna tell me?

864
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:15,883
Just that I want to try
harder and that I love you.

865
00:48:16,786 --> 00:48:20,354
- Okay, me too.

Good to see you, come in.

Fine.

00:48:58,678 --> 00:49:00,603
Oh boy, kisses?

882
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,439
[laughs]

883
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,590
I've missed you.

884
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,944
Hello, I'm Kendra.

885
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,947
It's nice to meet
you, Marcus bell.

886
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,784
[soft, ominous music]

887
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:16,011
My big girl.

888
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:20,122
I'm so excited about your book.

889
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:22,458
And all the work you're
doing with the charity.

890
00:49:22,685 --> 00:49:25,962
Has anyone ever had a more
accomplished daughter?

891
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,630
- [laughs]
- [soft, ominous music]

892
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:29,610
[Remy] so good to see you.

893
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,759
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

894
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,857
- [soft music]
- [crickets chirp]

895
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:36,933
[Remy] come on in,
let's get you settled.

896
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,365
All right.

897
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:39,954
- How was your drive, dad?
- It was good.

898
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,793
- Really?
- Not bad.

899
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,774
- [pair chatters]
- [soft music]

900
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:53,322
- [dramatic, ominous music]
- [breathes heavily]

901
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,682
Et you a great big dollhouse?

902
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,851
[Marcus] how about I get
you a great big dollhouse?

903
00:50:22,002 --> 00:50:23,761
[Ella] I already
have one grandpa.

904
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,929
Ah, she already has one.

905
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:27,931
[laughs]

906
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,170
You're with family, let
yourself take the edge off.

907
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,861
A little bit.

908
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:34,196
Well, one over my
limit can't hurt.

909
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:35,698
- [laughs]
- right?

910
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,533
It's a special occasion.

911
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:40,277
[Marcus] speaking of which,
sorry I missed your birthday.

912
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,279
[Remy] we didn't make
a big deal out of it.

913
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:43,471
- We had cake.
- What kind?

914
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:47,785
- Wedding cake.
- [laughs]

915
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,356
[Remy] that's my girl.

916
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,025
[Marcus] you're not getting
married on me, are you, Ella?

917
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,122
[laughs]

918
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:52,882
[jack] don't give her any ideas.

919
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:54,884
[laughs]

920
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:56,719
[Ella] I'm too young
to get married.

921
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,557
- [laughs]
- [soft, ominous music]

922
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:03,476
Thank you.

923
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:09,065
- [laughs]
- [soft, ominous music]

924
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:16,072
So, Remy tells me that Ella
is quite fond of you, Kendra.

925
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,651
[Kendra] the feeling is mutual.

926
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:22,297
Good.

927
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,747
So tell me, where'd you get
your child caring skills?

928
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:28,084
- From my mother.
- Really?

929
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:30,305
[soft, ominous music]

930
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:31,754
Tell me more about her.

931
00:51:33,149 --> 00:51:36,759
Well, she is no longer with us.

932
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,930
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

933
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,579
It's hard for me to talk about.

934
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,104
I'm sure it is and
you don't have to.

935
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,108
No, I want to.

936
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,446
My mother was everything to me.

937
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:02,701
She was the sweetest and
bravest person I ever knew.

938
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,123
And a lot of people
took advantage of that.

939
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:10,126
A lot of people hurt her and
whenever I think about it,

940
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,036
I just.

941
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:17,352
- [breathes heavily]
- [soft, ominous music]

942
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:20,719
Well, I truly understand.

943
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:24,526
She sounds like a
wonderful person.

944
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,226
I wish I could have met her, I
wish I could have helped her.

945
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,565
- I wish you could have too.
- [soft, ominous music]

946
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,985
You know what?

947
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:37,136
Let's have a toast.

948
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:41,323
To new beginnings,
new relationships.

949
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:43,659
And happier times ahead.

950
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:47,808
- Here, here.
- [soft, ominous music]

951
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

952
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,834
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

953
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:57,256
- [glass clink]
- [soft, dramatic music]

954
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:02,011
[crickets chirp]

955
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,069
[sighs]

956
00:53:08,093 --> 00:53:10,998
- [laughs]
- [ominous music]

957
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,499
You startled me.

958
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,523
Sorry, I just wanted
to say goodbye.

959
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:19,177
Yes, I just tucked Ella in
and jack put Remy to sleep,

960
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:20,582
She had a little too much.

961
00:53:20,606 --> 00:53:22,940
- Yes, I noticed.
- [laughs]

962
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,943
Well, listen, it was a
pleasure meeting you.

963
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:27,014
I'm glad you're here.

964
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,854
Thank you, have a good night.

965
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:32,186
- You too.
- [dramatic music]

966
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,361
Kendra, will you
tell me a story?

967
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:38,881
- Sure.
- [soft music]

968
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,885
I guess my putting her to
bed didn't do the trick.

969
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:45,796
She is really fond of you.

970
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:47,056
Yeah.

971
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:49,283
- Bye now.
- Bye.

972
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:54,063
- [soft, ominous music]
- [crickets chirp]

973
00:54:18,981 --> 00:54:19,997
Remy!

974
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,091
What?

975
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,258
What happened?

976
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:26,169
My phone has been
blowing up all morning.

977
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,908
Do you know what you wrote
on pixapost last night?

978
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:28,932
What?

979
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,768
I don't remember going
on pixapost last night.

980
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:35,219
I don't remember anything.

981
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,258
"My husband thinks I have
a thing for David at work.

982
00:54:40,352 --> 00:54:42,330
"He's so insecure.

983
00:54:42,354 --> 00:54:44,688
"The truth is I do
wanna cheat on him.

984
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,691
"I fantasize about David,
I wanna see him naked,

985
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,618
- "I wonder how big his".
- Jack!

986
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:54,531
I don't remember, I blacked
out, but I did not write that.

987
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:57,200
I mean, that doesn't
sound like me at all.

988
00:54:57,353 --> 00:54:59,180
I don't feel that way about him.

989
00:54:59,204 --> 00:55:03,277
Well, apparently you're
drunken alter ego does.

990
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:07,118
- Jack, please listen.
- Look, I'm gonna go to work.

991
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:11,307
I have a tough day in front
of me, even worse for you.

992
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,809
But after this, I don't
even know where we are.

993
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:17,646
[soft, dramatic music]

994
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:22,735
- [sighs]
- [soft, dramatic music]

995
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:28,324
- [keyboard clicks]
- [soft, dramatic music]

996
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,509
[phone rings]

997
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:49,678
Hi tony.

998
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:51,347
I'd rather tell
you this in person,

999
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:53,766
But I guess video call's
the next best thing.

1000
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,186
I know how hard you
worked on the book.

1001
00:55:57,337 --> 00:55:58,520
I deleted the post.

1002
00:55:58,672 --> 00:56:00,247
It doesn't matter, Remy.

1003
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,743
The damage is already done.

1004
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:04,746
This is a children's book
and the things that you said,

1005
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,104
We have no choice but to
cancel the release date.

1006
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:08,530
Tony, that's not fair.

1007
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,088
I mean, there's no way
I would've written that.

1008
00:56:13,112 --> 00:56:14,536
Well then who wrote them?

1009
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:17,351
I don't know, maybe someone
hacked my account or.

1010
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,042
I'm sorry, Remy, but
my hands are tied.

1011
00:56:20,193 --> 00:56:22,452
Yeah well, I'm sorry to.

1012
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,798
[soft, dramatic music]

1013
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,222
You excited ballet
practice today?

1014
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:36,444
I suppose you heard what I did?

1015
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:37,468
What do you mean?

1016
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:39,539
Guess not.

1017
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,471
Well, we'll talk about it later.

1018
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,565
Love you, sweetheart.

1019
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:51,459
Your mommy seems sad.

1020
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:53,650
Why don't we draw
her a picture today?

1021
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,318
Okay.

1022
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,321
[soft, dramatic music]

1023
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,618
[consultant] we'll have
the cost analysis for you,

1024
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:00,490
End of day.

1025
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,750
Sounds great,

1026
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:03,142
- Thank you ladies.
- Thank you.

1027
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:17,057
[soft, dramatic music]

1028
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,685
Hey, can I come in?

1029
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:46,514
Of course.

1030
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:48,705
I was going to come talk to you.

1031
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,467
Once I worked up the courage.

1032
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:53,021
I'm so embarrassed.

1033
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:54,522
Everyone's been
avoiding me all day.

1034
00:57:54,546 --> 00:57:57,047
Well, you don't need
to talk about it.

1035
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,285
Are you sure?

1036
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,717
Yeah, I'm sure it's, you know,

1037
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,394
Kind of embarrassing for me too.

1038
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:06,148
Look, I'm so sorry, David.

1039
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,871
I don't know how to put this.

1040
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:13,822
I just got an email and
after careful consideration,

1041
00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:17,659
Apparently the board thinks
all of this is a distraction.

1042
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:19,547
From our purpose here
at the foundation.

1043
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:21,288
The foundation I helped create.

1044
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:27,252
Yes and well, they the
board gave me the fun job of.

1045
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:29,884
- Asking you.
- If I'll step down.

1046
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:35,010
David, there's no way I
could have written that.

1047
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,304
Okay, then who wrote it?

1048
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,423
Did someone steal your phone?

1049
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,518
- I mean.
- I don't think so.

1050
00:58:42,745 --> 00:58:45,999
I mean, it was right
by my bed all night.

1051
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:49,002
I mean, I did drink
too much, but listen,

1052
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,670
I swear, that's not something

1053
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,509
- I would ever.
- Look Remy,

1054
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:52,655
You don't need me to tell you.

1055
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,341
- David, please.
- Don't make this.

1056
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,365
Any harder than it is.

1057
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:01,036
- I'm sorry, Remy.
- [soft music]

1058
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,206
- I'm sorry.
- [soft music]

1059
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:22,683
Hey, there you are.

1060
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:26,486
I like to do my laundry while
ella's at ballet practice.

1061
00:59:28,457 --> 00:59:30,732
Good idea coming home when
it's just the two of us.

1062
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:35,478
Look, this was a mistake.

1063
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,883
What?

1064
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,074
I need to be honest
with my wife.

1065
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:42,411
I need to tell her what we did.

1066
00:59:44,473 --> 00:59:45,633
And I know that means.

1067
00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:47,209
It's gonna be the end
of your employment here,

1068
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,636
But I'm gonna make sure that
you're gonna be taken care of.

1069
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,492
You're gonna be
compensated for it.

1070
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:51,812
What are you talking about?

1071
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:53,505
I mean, you can't
work here anymore.

1072
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:56,758
But what about our
future together?

1073
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,427
What future?

1074
00:59:58,578 --> 01:00:01,816
The future where I
get what I deserve,

1075
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,766
Where we get what we
deserve, you, me, Ella.

1076
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:05,601
Stop, stop.

1077
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,511
Kendra, please stop.

1078
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:10,680
Stop, what?

1079
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:14,276
You said you cared about
me, you said you loved me.

1080
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:15,593
I never said that.

1081
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:17,832
You did, the night
we slept together,

1082
01:00:17,856 --> 01:00:19,573
You said we would
be together forever.

1083
01:00:20,676 --> 01:00:21,783
You need to go, now.

1084
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,621
- No.
- Yes, get out.

1085
01:00:25,848 --> 01:00:29,625
You are not welcome
here anymore.

1086
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,272
- [soft, ominous music]
- just like him.

1087
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,296
What?

1088
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:37,257
You lied to me, just
like he lied to my mom.

1089
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:39,635
Who are you talking about?

1090
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,380
I'll admit,

1091
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:46,124
At first I thought it was just
about destroying remy's life.

1092
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:50,531
And walking away
until it became clear.

1093
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:53,056
That the best way
to settle the score.

1094
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,801
Wasn't just to make sure she
loses everything, no, no, no,

1095
01:00:56,895 --> 01:01:00,322
It was to make sure
I won everything.

1096
01:01:01,717 --> 01:01:03,909
Everything that
was hers is mine.

1097
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,830
You, Ella, all of this.

1098
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:10,143
What score?

1099
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,417
What has Remy ever done to you?

1100
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:16,079
What has she done?

1101
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:18,674
She's the reason I
didn't have a father.

1102
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:20,750
She's the reason
I lost my mother.

1103
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:22,822
She's the reason I
was left with nothing.

1104
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:23,846
While she had it all.

1105
01:01:24,072 --> 01:01:27,265
- How is Remy the reason?
- She's my sister.

1106
01:01:29,077 --> 01:01:32,938
Surprise and well, you know
how sibling rivalry can be.

1107
01:01:35,934 --> 01:01:37,820
You, you were the one who
did the pixapost last night.

1108
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:40,437
While she was passed
out, that was you.

1109
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:41,841
Pretty good, right?

1110
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,699
The dress, that was you.

1111
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,753
Guilty as charged.

1112
01:01:45,777 --> 01:01:48,111
My god, you have put
her through hell.

1113
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,113
Just like she did to me.

1114
01:01:50,265 --> 01:01:54,960
This conversation is over, I
am telling Remy everything.

1115
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,379
I'll tell Remy and the police.

1116
01:01:57,606 --> 01:01:58,886
That you forced
yourself onto me.

1117
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:01,528
Are you threatening me?

1118
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,701
'Cause if you are,
you'll be in more trouble.

1119
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:05,532
Than you are right now.

1120
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,534
No, I'm not listening
to this, I'm gonna...

1121
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:08,465
What?

1122
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,536
What are you gonna do?

1123
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,634
Call the police, huh?

1124
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:14,062
Accuse me, after you
just told me everything,

1125
01:02:14,214 --> 01:02:15,564
That you're remy's sister,

1126
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,733
That this is some
warped revenge fantasy.

1127
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,454
It's not a fantasy!

1128
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:24,322
- [dramatic ominous music]
- ah!

1129
01:02:26,893 --> 01:02:31,663
- [car honks]
- [dramatic, ominous music]

1130
01:02:40,073 --> 01:02:44,843
- [cries]
- [dramatic ominous music]

1131
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:49,657
Jack, jack!

1132
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:50,507
Oh my god!

1133
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:51,601
Oh my god, jack!

1134
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:52,751
Oh my god!

1135
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:57,831
- Oh my god!
- [cries]

1136
01:02:57,924 --> 01:02:58,993
[whimpers]

1137
01:02:59,017 --> 01:03:00,017
Kendra?

1138
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:02,922
[whimpers]

1139
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:03,779
Wait!

1140
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:04,762
Oh god, oh my god.

1141
01:03:04,856 --> 01:03:06,597
Okay, okay, wait, wait.

1142
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,767
- [whimpers]
- [soft, dramatic music]

1143
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,340
Yes, I have an emergency.

1144
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:14,105
My husband has
fallen, he's hurt bad.

1145
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,957
We need an ambulance,
please hurry.

1146
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,410
- [sirens sound]
- the broken leg and wrist.

1147
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:26,209
Will be fine but
the ct scan shows.

1148
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:28,114
That he did experience
some brain trauma.

1149
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,305
[Remy] how long will
he be in a coma?

1150
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:35,060
It's hard to say, it could
be a day or weeks or longer.

1151
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:37,554
We'll know more in
the next 24 hours.

1152
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,222
Thank you, doctor.

1153
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,441
Mrs. Bell-winter, I
need a word please.

1154
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:44,872
I just got ms. Patterson's
official statement.

1155
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:46,296
She's made some
serious allegations.

1156
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,967
Against your husband.

1157
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,566
What exactly?

1158
01:03:49,718 --> 01:03:51,287
That he attempted to
sexually assault her.

1159
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:53,381
And that she got
away up the stairs.

1160
01:03:53,405 --> 01:03:55,831
He followed, grabbed
her by the head.

1161
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,833
And smashed it
against the railing.

1162
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,652
She broke free, pushed
him away in self defense.

1163
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:03,171
And he fell down the stairs.

1164
01:04:03,398 --> 01:04:05,560
I don't believe it,
he wouldn't do that.

1165
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:06,900
I understand you feel that way,

1166
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:08,927
But we have to take the
accusation seriously.

1167
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,733
[Remy] is he under arrest?

1168
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,349
Not at this time,

1169
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
But we will be putting an
officer outside the room.

1170
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,003
Where's Kendra?

1171
01:04:19,097 --> 01:04:21,075
[officer] I think
she's down the hall.

1172
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:25,527
- [dramatic music]
- dr. Norris, dial 118.

1173
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,614
Dr. Norris, please dial 118.

1174
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:32,846
How are you feeling?

1175
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,018
I've been better,

1176
01:04:34,112 --> 01:04:35,849
They're keeping me
overnight to make sure.

1177
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,123
You're lying about jack.

1178
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,783
I'm not lying about anything.

1179
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,128
I know my husband, he
would never do that.

1180
01:04:44,697 --> 01:04:46,506
Well then you don't
know your husband.

1181
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,127
Ever since you came
into our lives,

1182
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:52,804
Everything's
started to go wrong.

1183
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,640
Are you blaming me?

1184
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:58,476
Let's just wait
until jack wakes up.

1185
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,115
There you are.

1186
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:03,381
- Where's Ella?
- With a nurse.

1187
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:05,211
There's nothing
more we can do here.

1188
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,068
Let's just all go home
and get some sleep.

1189
01:05:08,813 --> 01:05:10,884
I'll be back in the morning.

1190
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:14,034
[soft, dramatic music]

1191
01:05:26,982 --> 01:05:28,072
[intercom] dr. Norris,

1192
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,832
You have a visitor
in the main lobby.

1193
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:32,906
Dr. Norris, a visitor
in the main lobby.

1194
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,931
[soft, ominous music]

1195
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:41,997
[high tension music]

1196
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:44,073
- What?
- Shut up!

1197
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:45,500
It's my turn to talk, daddy.

1198
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,894
Daddy?

1199
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:49,921
That's right, it's
been a long time.

1200
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:54,926
Oh my god.

1201
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,323
Haley?

1202
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,921
Haley Patterson?

1203
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,159
[laughs]

1204
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,902
You remember my name?

1205
01:07:01,926 --> 01:07:03,101
I never forgot about you.

1206
01:07:04,929 --> 01:07:06,763
I wanted to support
you and your mom,

1207
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:09,910
But she didn't want
anything, she never.

1208
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:12,913
[Kendra] she's dead,
died of a broken heart.

1209
01:07:12,937 --> 01:07:16,531
Oh, Haley, I didn't know.

1210
01:07:16,758 --> 01:07:18,177
How could you know?

1211
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,826
You never bothered
to check on me.

1212
01:07:22,188 --> 01:07:23,188
I'm sorry.

1213
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,207
You should be.

1214
01:07:26,451 --> 01:07:28,668
Although you know
who I really blame?

1215
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:31,024
Who?

1216
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,881
Remy.

1217
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:35,175
She's the reason that
everything went the way it did.

1218
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:41,872
Oh, Haley, don't put
this on Remy, it was me.

1219
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:43,641
Why shouldn't I put it on Remy?

1220
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,880
I heard you, you said
it wasn't for her,

1221
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:51,900
You would be with mommy and me.

1222
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:57,822
Haley, the pain you
must have endured.

1223
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:00,825
Please, please forgive me.

1224
01:08:04,973 --> 01:08:05,973
- Okay then.
- No!

1225
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:10,304
- Ah!

I thought you were
in the hospital.

1228
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,165
They let me out.

1229
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:17,978
And your daddy's all better.

1230
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:20,002
Your mommy's there at
the hospital with him.

1231
01:08:20,155 --> 01:08:21,741
Do you want me to
take you there?

1232
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:22,765
Okay.

please remain calm,

Mrs. Bell-winter, we're
dispatching law enforcement.

- I'm leaving now.
- We need you to wait there.

No, I will not wait.

1247

I'm going after my daughter.

1248
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,329
- Mrs. Bell-winter.
- I'll call you from the road.

[emergency dispatcher] listen,
we need you to be there.

1250
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:32,052
To let the paramedics
inside the house.

1251
01:09:32,076 --> 01:09:35,148
I'll leave the front door
unlocked for the paramedics.

I thought we were
going to the hospital.

You said daddy was all better.

1258
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,436
Well, you might as well
know, he's not better.

1259
01:10:00,588 --> 01:10:03,105
And your mother doesn't
want you anymore.

1260
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,200
What?

1261
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:09,515

Where are you taking me?

1267

To a really nice
place in Mexico.

1268
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,287
Your mama gave me some jewelry.

1269
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:43,629
That we can trade in for
cash, we'll have plenty.

1270

I don't wanna go to Mexico.

1271

Well, you can't always
get what you want.

1272

You've been spoiled
your whole life.

So you're gonna have to learn
to live by my rules now.

- Stop it!
- Now be quiet.

will have to punish you.

Hey, can I help you?

Has anyone seen a
woman, has dark hair.

She has to be here
somewhere, the car's here.

1318
01:14:26,445 --> 01:14:29,516
I saw a woman, but she had
no little girl with her.

1319
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,874
- She seemed kind of.
- She seemed what?

1320
01:14:32,026 --> 01:14:34,543
Well, strange or weird even.

1321
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:36,387
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

1322
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:40,716
She came in here and she
knocked my purse off the table.

1323
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:43,697
And just, hey wait
that's my car,

1324

But I just bought us all
the extra time we need.

Oh, don't be so gloomy.

1329

What do you want?

1367
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:20,020
I'll give you anything,
just please don't hurt her.

1368
01:17:20,044 --> 01:17:21,636
What do I want?

1369
01:17:21,787 --> 01:17:24,546
- What do I want?
- Yes, anything.

1370
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,641
See, that's the problem.

1371
01:17:26,868 --> 01:17:29,810
You have everything to
give, you always have.

1372
01:17:31,055 --> 01:17:33,481
I watched you my whole life.

1373
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:35,816
The girl who had it all
while I had nothing,

1374
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:39,561
All of my suffering
was because of you.

1375
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:41,063
How was it because of me?

1376
01:17:41,215 --> 01:17:45,137
- You took my father.
- What are you talking about?

1377
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,570
- I'm your sister, Remy.
- [gasps]

1378
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:50,550
- Yes.
- Oh my god.

1379
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,242
Your father loved my mother.

1380
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,820
And we could have been a happy
family if it wasn't for you.

1381
01:17:56,914 --> 01:17:59,081
- [cries]
- he told my mother.

1382
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:02,062
That it was because of you
that he couldn't be with us.

1383
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:03,511
Do you know what my mother did?

1384
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:06,496
I asked you a question!

1385
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,994
Do you know what my mother did?

1386
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,259
What?

1387
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,664
What did your mother do?

1388
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,689
She gave up on life and
died and left me alone,

1389
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:19,985
Because of you, because
he chose you over us.

1390
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:26,492
Kendra, I had no idea, but
why are you hurting Ella?

1391
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,514
What did she do?

1392
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:31,330
I'm hurting Ella to
hurt you, is it working?

1393
01:18:32,783 --> 01:18:37,503
Kendra, listen, what happened
to you, it was wrong.

1394
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:40,530
And if there's anything
I can do to make.

1395
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,049
Do you know what I was doing.

1396
01:18:42,276 --> 01:18:44,677
While you were a horse jumping
and going to debutante balls?

1397
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:46,628
What?

1398
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,013
I lived in an orphanage.

1399
01:18:50,134 --> 01:18:52,284
- I'm so sorry.
- No one wanted to adopt me.

1400
01:18:52,377 --> 01:18:55,312
Because I was too old
and they knew my story.

1401
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,398
I was damaged goods.

1402
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:02,987
That's truly horrible, I
can't imagine how you felt.

1403
01:19:04,315 --> 01:19:07,720
I felt alone, I had no one.

1404
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,985
My mother who was my
whole world was gone.

1405
01:19:10,137 --> 01:19:11,704
I had no one, Remy.

1406
01:19:13,824 --> 01:19:15,657
And all the while I
saw pictures of you.

1407
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,042
In the society pages.

1408
01:19:18,904 --> 01:19:21,589
I saw the girl who had the
whole world in her hands,

1409
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,259
While I lived in a world
of pain, neglect and abuse.

1410
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:29,671
Do you know what the older
boys at the orphanage.

1411
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:30,766
Used to do to me?

1412
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:34,510
- Do you?
- [ominous music]

1413
01:19:34,662 --> 01:19:37,583
- [screams]
- [high tension music]

1414
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:42,401
- [grunts]
- [high tension music]

1415
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,762
Oh, I forgot to mention I
had sex with your husband,

1416
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:50,786
Not bad.

1417
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:56,582
- [grunts]
- [high tension music]

1418
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,619
I guess this is goodbye, sis.

1419
01:20:09,713 --> 01:20:14,475
- [high tension music]
- [gasps]

1420
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:26,562
- [coughs]
- [gasps]

1421
01:20:26,714 --> 01:20:28,730
Take her, I'll check her.

1422
01:20:28,883 --> 01:20:29,883
You okay?

1423
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:34,887
- [coughs]
- [gasps]

1424
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,643
- Oh Ella, I'm here.
- [cries]

1425
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,224
- Oh Ella.
- [cries]

1426
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:41,669
- I love you, mommy.
- Oh, I love you too, Ella.

1427
01:20:41,896 --> 01:20:44,004
[soft music]

1428
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:59,645
- Oh, come here.
- [soft music]

1429
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,815
Oh I love you so much.

1430
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,694
I love you too, daddy.

1431
01:21:06,845 --> 01:21:09,508
You are such a brave girl.

1432
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:10,532
I am?

1433
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,034
You certainly are.

1434
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,161
Mommy's brave too.

1435
01:21:18,432 --> 01:21:21,125
- She is.
- [soft music]

1436
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:26,505
Let's go visit grandpa bill,
he's been asking about you.

1437
01:21:27,775 --> 01:21:30,718
[soft music]

1438
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:33,532
So you're telling me that I
flew all the way down here,

1439
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:38,475
Last minute from new york to
beg you in person for nothing.

1440
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:42,137
I'm not saying that.

1441
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,857
I'm just not ready to share
this nightmare with the world.

1442
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,068
Fine.

1443
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:49,811
I'll keep bugging
you about it though.

1444
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:50,988
I'm sure you will.

1445
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:54,794
At least your children's
book is back in business.

1446
01:21:54,818 --> 01:21:56,722
Oh, thank goodness for that.

1447
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:59,391
But getting back to your ordeal,

1448
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,231
What happened to
the previous nanny,

1449
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:02,708
Before the nanny from hell?

1450
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:04,753
Matilda?

1451
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:09,998
Kendra threatened
her and her family.

1452
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,092
If she didn't disappear.

1453
01:22:12,911 --> 01:22:15,908
Fortunately she's
okay and has moved on.

1454
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:16,932
Unbelievable.

1455
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:22,327
How did the agency not
flag kendra's instability?

1456
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:24,104
Because she was
playing the long game.

1457
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:26,498
She worked with children
for a couple of years.

1458
01:22:26,591 --> 01:22:30,027
And genuinely had
glowing recommendations.

1459
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:34,022
She'd been holding
it all inside.

1460
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:37,034
Until she exploded in your life.

1461
01:22:38,012 --> 01:22:39,012
Yes.

1462
01:22:41,682 --> 01:22:46,460
It's strange as horrible as all
of it is, and it's horrible.

1463
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:47,963
Truly.

1464
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:54,093
What I feel most is gratitude.

1465
01:22:55,879 --> 01:22:57,357
That it's over?

1466
01:22:57,381 --> 01:22:58,472
That I have Ella.

1467
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:01,125
Everything else?

1468
01:23:02,536 --> 01:23:04,979
What happened to my
dad, what jack did,

1469
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:12,987
All of it, that can be
dealt with but my baby girl,

1470
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:18,117
I'm just so grateful
that she's here with me.

1471
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:21,997
Ella.

1472
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,500
- Hi, mommy.
- Time to get up.

1473
01:23:28,078 --> 01:23:30,963
- I had a scary dream.
- About Kendra?

1474
01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:34,299
- Yes.
- Yeah, me too.

1475
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:37,564
But she's gone now and will
spend the rest of her life.

1476
01:23:37,588 --> 01:23:40,233
In jail and never come back.

1477
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:44,184
And I'll be here to protect
you, honey, always and forever.

1478
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:51,025
All right, let's get you
up and ready for breakfast.

1479
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:53,193
[soft music]

1480
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,779
Excited to show off
your new project today?

1481
01:23:58,183 --> 01:24:02,536
- [laughs]
- [soft music]

1482
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,022
- Cereal's good, huh?
- Yeah,

1483
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:07,708
How are those marshmallows?

1484
01:24:07,935 --> 01:24:10,002
[soft music]

1485
01:24:11,455 --> 01:24:14,048
[ominous music]
