00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:22,941
So, why did he come over
 to see you after you
 both left the hospital?

647
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,178
Well, y-- uh--
 he, uh--

648
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:32,117
oh! He-- he--
 he said that he wanted
 to paint my portrait.

649
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,152
So I figured,
 "why not?"
 [ Chuckles uneasily ]

650
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,155
- I-it was free!
 - and you don't know
 where he lives?

651
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,625
Believe me, if I thought
 that I could find him,

652
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:44,229
I'd be on the phone to you
 to try to collect that reward!

653
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:48,166
A million dollars!

654
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,337
He never dropped any hints?
 No favorite bar? No place
 he likes to hang out?

655
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,439
He's homeless.

656
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:59,610
Oh! If you want to find him,
 search the streets.

657
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:03,548
Well, that narrows it down
 a bit, doesn't it?

You have the right
 to remain silent.

Anything you say
 can and will be
 used against you.

695

You have the right 
 to an attorney.

If you cannot afford one,
 an attorney will be appointed.
 Do you understand?

697
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,638
Don't see the need
 for an attorney.
 I've done nothing wrong.

698
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:44,575
All I've done was 
 to take my paintings back.

699

I'm certain we can
 straighten this out
 as gentlemen.

Do you confess to stealing
 paintings by vincent van gogh?

701
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:56,287
As I've tried to explain
 to you, I can't steal
 what's already mine.

I am vincent van gogh,
 and my paintings
 belong to me,

except for the ones 
 that I gave away 
 during my lifetime...

704
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,398
And the one painting
 which I did sell.

Which one
 van gogh painting
 did you sell?

706
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,571
Yes, it was called
 vineyard at arles.

00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:17,342
[ Murphy ] 
 Van gogh did sell 
 vineyard at arles.

708
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,746
Quite right. So far, so good.
 Don't disappoint me,
 Mr. Van gogh.

709
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,682
When exactly 
 did you sell it?

710
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:29,687
It was at an exhibition
 in brussels in 1890,
 to a lady named anna boch...

711
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,456
For 400 francs.

712
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:35,726
Until I died, that was 
 the only one of my paintings 
 which I did sell.

713
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,431
How do you explain,
 Mr. Van gogh, your...

714
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,600
Amazing...

715
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,535
Knowledge of
 the english language?

716
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,772
Now, I understood
 that van gogh lived
 in holland, didn't he?

717
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,840
Yes, in holland.

718
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,777
And in france.
 And in london.

719
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,845
That's where
 I learned my english.

720
00:51:54,879 --> 00:52:00,185
You're an excellent forger.
 One of the best I've ever seen

- I've seen dozens.
 - I've never forged
 anything in my life.

722
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:08,526
Do you confess
 to vandalizing van gogh's
 self-portrait at auvers ?

723
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,828
Do you confess 
 that you destroyed...

724
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,598
A great work of art...

725
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,134
By painting
 a yellow hat
 on it?

726
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:21,706
I didn't destroy it.
 I finished it.

727
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,409
I should have done it
 a long time ago.

728
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:29,214
I think that you are one
 of the most cold-blooded,
 disrespectful,

730
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,553

 in 1911.

732

00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:53,571
[ Cell door slamming ] 
 [ Man ] 
 Folks, it now appears...

734
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,640
That the man claiming
 to be vincent van gogh
 is actually...

735
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,543
Just another
 poor, starving artist.

736
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:02,680
But isn't it intriguing to
 note that, if vincent van gogh
 actually did come back,

737
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:06,351
he would quickly discover
 that his work had become
 a major cornerstone...

738
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:11,522
Of the world,
 like gold, diamonds or...
 Blue chip stocks.

739
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,426
Okay!
 What have we got on
 this vincent character?

740
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,528
Well, the suspect was
 never arrested before.

741

So, what is he, murphy?
 A first-time offender?

744
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:29,374
No match.
 He's definitely not
 an american citizen.

a visitor, vincent.

 much worse than this place.

 sue this vincent guy,
 not defend him.

Because of him,
 I'm being harassed

- I've been dead.
 - oh, that's great!

That's great.

785
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:06,831
And is that what you want me
 to explain to your judge,
 that you've been dead?

786
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,099
Yes! It's the truth.

787
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,035
All right.

 got this straight.

There you were,

00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,576
And then one bright
and cheery day,
you decided...

That you had enough of this
lying around in a coffin
for more than a century.

 and peek out.

 are all wormy,
 but no sweat.

 what happened?

 an unbelievable spectacle...

968
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:37,627
That ended up with him in 
 jail, where he is 
 now awaiting trial.

969
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:41,098
The question is, 
 is this strange prisoner 
 a con man...

970
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,567
An impostor,
 or much worse?

971
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,735
Well, not everyone
 is betting on worse.

972
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,372
In fact,
 tonight from New York,
 we have a report...

973
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:53,277
That the controversial
 publisher may be ready to come
 up with a six-figure advance

974
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,646
For the autobiography of the
 man who claims to be vincent.

975
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,083
That could mean the man
 would be out on bail.

976
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,285
Gabe insisted
 on picking you up.

977
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:04,654
We have some
 celebrating to do.
 Gabe!

978
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,623
[ Laughing ]

979
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:10,094
Oh. Thank you
 for getting me out of there.

980
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,397
How can I ever repay you?
 I've got some ideas
 on that, vince baby.

981
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:16,200
Now, remember, you're just
 out on bail until trial,

982
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,068
so don't let it
 go to your head.

983
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:20,637
You are hot as a pistol.

984
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:24,241
I just landed a deal
for your autobiography.

985
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:28,245
We, uh-- we spent 
 the six-figure advance 
 to get you out on bail.

986
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,247
So now you're gonna
 have to become a writer.

987
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,849
A writer, gabe?
 I don't know about that.

988
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,253
I wrote to my brother theo
 many letters, yes,
 but a book?

989
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:39,356
Chill out.
We'll get a ghostwriter
from New York.

990
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,692
They're a dime a dozen. 
 Come on. Get in.

991
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,499
Oh, and, vincent,
 I talked my aunt...

992
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,435
Into holding an exhibition
 of your new paintings.

993
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,671
She's even inviting
 some well-known
 west coast critics.

994
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,806
Whoo-hoo-hoo,
 whoo-hoo-hoo!

995
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,609
[ Gabe ] hold on 
 to your hat, vince! 
 Whoo!

996
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:04,448
Now, see? This.
It has your personality
written all over it.

997
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:07,484
It does.
 And see how nicely
 it goes with this jacket?

998
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,653
Mm. Okay.
Mm-hmm.

999
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:13,423
Before I'm finished with you,
 you're going to be
 a fashion trendsetter.

1000
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:18,128
Kathy, I've decided
 how to thank aunt gladys
 for giving me my show.

1001
01:08:18,162 --> 01:08:21,431
I'm going
 to make her a gift of one
 of my Hollywood paintings.

1002
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:24,568
She'll love that.
 Okay. Come on.
 Into the dressing room.

1003
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,237
In you go.
 In we go.

1004
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:32,742
I think I'll give her 
 one of my harley-davidson 
 hell angels paintings.

1005
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,744
I hope she likes 
 the large ones.

1006
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,913
She can do anything 
 with it she likes,

1007
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,284
as long as 
 it doesn't end up 
 in a chicken coop.

1008
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:42,752
Why would anybody
 put a painting
 in a chicken coop?

1009
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,256
Well, when I painted 
 a portrait of one 
 of my doctors--

1010
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:51,695
I'm talking about 
 Dr. Felix rey, a swine 
 if ever I did know one--

1011
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,165
anyway, he hated it 
 so much, he hung it up 
 in his chicken coop...

1012
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,401
To hide a hole 
 in the wall!

1013
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,782
I have with me 
 lester finley,

1014
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,352
art critic
for the Los Angeles times.

1015
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:18,722
How are you
 this evening, lester?
 I'm fine, maria, just fine.

1016
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,758
Well, lester,
 what's your verdict?
 I wish I could be kind, maria,

1017
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,761
but critics have
 a responsibility
 to the public.

1018
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:28,332
I describe this exhibit
 in one WORD:
 Very disappointing.

1019
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:30,834
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 And, lester, why
 do you say that?

1020
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:34,304
After all the controversy
 over who this artist is,

1021
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:37,607
one thing for sure,
 he's not vincent van gogh.

1022
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,643
This is nothing
 but an amateurish attempt...

1023
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:44,914
To imitate post-impressionism
 and apply it to our modern age

1024
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:46,916
where it has
 absolutely no place.

1025
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,785
Thank you, lester.
 Thank you.

1026
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:53,623
[ Maria ] We have with us 
 sarah centurion, critic for 
 art world magazine.

1027
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:57,461
-What do you say about vincent 
-Juvenile in his
message, maria.

1028
01:09:57,494 --> 01:10:00,764
No interest in it 
 in our contemporary 
 art scene,

1029
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,967
and that is
 the nicest way
 I can say it.

1030
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,303
Well, sarah, thank you
 for your honesty.

1031
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,742
[ Man ] this is a charade. 
 It's a mockery of everything 
 tat vincent van gogh held dear

1032
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,011
So, ted,
 in a nutshell?

1033
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,848
This is all
 worthless trash.

1034
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,788
Taking a few
 tough punches tonight,
 huh, vincent?

1035
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,957
I'm used to not being liked
 by the critics.

1036
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:31,495
Maybe the jig is up;
 maybe youre gona find out that
 you can't bamboozle everybody-

1037
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:33,563
that there's a lot
 of us here who love art...

1038
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:37,334
And love van gogh enough
 to put you in your place.

1039
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:41,538
If that were true--
 about the love-- I think you'd
 show me a little more respect.

1040
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:46,576
You don't deserve respect.
 You deserve to be put into
 prison for 30 years to life.

1041
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:49,613
I understand how hard it is
 for you to accept the fact...

1042
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:51,948
That I've been telling you
 the truth all along.

1043
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,885
You know, I don't know
 what it is that you want,

1044
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:59,923
but whatever it is--
 money or fame--
 you're not gonna get it.

1045
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:03,627
I have known 
 a lot of painters who've 
 turned into con men.

1046
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,329
Hell, I knew robert trotter,

1047
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:09,733
and I was there when we 
 caught him red-handed 
 and he confessed,

1048
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,537
and I saw him sweat
and fall apart the same way
I'm gonna see you...

1049
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,905
Get down on your knees
 and sweat blood.

1050
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:19,008
I've sweated enough,
 detective murphy.

1051
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:22,812
My work,
 my art is my sweat.

1052
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:26,883
That's the price I've paid
 for being who I am.
 That's my pain.

1053
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:30,887
And your pain is that you dont
 dare to allow yourself
 to believe in miracles,

1054
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,724
because if you did,
 that skeptical little world
 you live in would be destroyed

1055
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:38,795
Excuse me. What was
 your reaction to the savaging
 you received from the critics?

1056
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:41,998
Yes, well, they have
 their opinion,
 and I have mine.

1057
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,535
Do you still claim
 that you're the one
 and only vincent van gogh?

1058
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:47,704
Yes, of course.

1059
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:51,608
Believe it or not, 
 for better or worse, 
 I am who I am,

1060
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,812
and as an artist,
 I'm also my own critic.

1061
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:59,349
Sometimes I hate
 what I've done,
 and I paint over it.

1062
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:01,351
Oh. Any of these
 painted over?

1063
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:03,487
These here?
 No, no.

1064
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,024
But a long time ago,
 there was one I did
 called head of girl.

1065
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:11,595
I hated it. 
 I painted over it.

1066
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:16,099
It started out
 as picture of a young, little
 blond girl with curly hair...

1067
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:19,102
In a bright red bonnet
 and a violet scarf...

1068
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,807
But it--
 it looked too, uh, tsk...

1069
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,809
M-m-masculine.

1070
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,911
So I--

1071
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:31,715
I took out the bonnet
 and painted out
 the rest of it,

1072
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:35,018
the scarf, and called it
 head of boy.

1073
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,153
I just saw it.

1074
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,590
Here. "Van gogh's
 head of boy.

1075
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:45,161
Owned by the morganstern 
 family in hyannis port, 
 Massachusetts, since 1915."

1076
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,865
Gabe, we have to go there
and convince them to let us
have this painting x-rayed.

1077
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:52,869
Whoa. Wait a minute.
 My expenses in this case
 are beginning to add up.

1078
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:56,773
Gabe, if the girl's scarf
 and bonnet show up...

1079
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,844
Under the face of the boy
 in an x-ray, the results
 could be earth-shattering.

1080
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,713
[ Kathy ] 
 What more proof 
 would anybody need?

1081
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:17,494
But, Mr. Morganstern, there is
 no way that an x-ray could
 possibly harm your painting.

1082
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:21,498
They do it all the time.
 I give you my word.
He's absolutely right, sir.

1083
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:23,933
Do you know about
 the van gogh painting
 called winter ?

1084
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,836
A beautiful work, winter. 
 What about it?

1085
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,972
When they
x-rayed it,

1086
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,608
they found a woman
at a spinning wheel
underneath it.

1087
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:35,445
Surely if he's painted over
 winter, there must be others
 that he's painted over too.

1088
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:40,049
While you two were en route
 to come see me, I got
 another request about this.

1089
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:45,121
Do either of you by any chance
 know detective murphy of the
 LA.P.D. Art theft detail?

1090
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,791
- holy cow!
 - she seems convinced...

1091
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,594
That the x-ray will prove
 once and for all...

1092
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:53,797
That your vincent
 is a con man and a fraud,

1093
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,900
and I would like 
 the matter settled.

1094
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:09,212
There it is.
 It's right below
 the surface.

1095
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,848
Painting of 
 a young girl.

1096
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,883
It's actually there.

1097
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:17,186
[ Morganstern ] 
 Quite incredible.

1098
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,789
[ Murphy ] 
 He tricked us.

1099
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:23,527
How can it be a trick? Only
 vincent van gogh would know
 what he painted under there.

1100
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,763
There's got to be some logical
 rational explanation.

1101
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:32,235
Suppose van gogh
 wrote about this...

1102
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:34,871
In one of his letters
 to his brother theo.

1103
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,842
And suppose the impostor
 read it...

1104
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,545
And unfortunately
 we walked into his trap.

1105
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:43,913
All I know is
 there's her hat
 and her scarf.

1106
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,883
You can even see
 her curly hair.

1107
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,854
No. No.

1108
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:53,289
[ Male newscaster ] 
 Head of boy.
 Head of girl.

1109
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:57,794
Scholars say van gogh 
 never left a clue about this 
 in any of his letters.

1110
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,796
Experts are 
 more baffled than ever.

1111
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,632
The new vincent. 
 Is he really van gogh?

1112
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,934
The investigation continues.

1113
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:08,605
It's time we went
 to france together, kathy.
 Oh. What for?

1114
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,675
To get the paintings
 that I hid there
 over a hundred years ago.

1115
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:15,211
What? Wha--
 what paintings did you hide?

1116
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,781
Some of my very best,
 and they're well-hidden.

1117
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:21,951
It's highly unlikely that
 anyone has ever discovered
 them. [ Giggles ]

1118
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:26,222
Exactly where
in france are they?
 In a crypt...

1119
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,593
Inside a church
 at a place called arles.

1120

 as recently as 1992.

1447
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:40,488
*But I Could Have 
 Told you, vincent *

1448
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:46,962
*This World Was Never Meant 
 For one as beautiful as you *

1449
01:37:49,932 --> 01:37:52,167
*Starry, Starry Night

1450
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:57,940
*Portraits Hung 
 In empty halls *

1451
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:03,545
*Frameless Heads 
 On nameless walls *

1452
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:07,615
*With Eyes That Watch The 
 World And can't forget *

1453
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:10,485
*Like The Strangers 
 That you've met *

1454
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:16,524
*The Ragged Men 
 In ragged clothes *

1455
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:20,562
*The Silver Thorn 
 A bloody rose *

1456
01:38:20,595 --> 01:38:26,301
*Lie Crushed And Broken 
 On the virgin snow *

1457
01:38:26,334 --> 01:38:29,237
*Now I Think I Know

1458
01:38:31,339 --> 01:38:35,677
*What You Tried To Say To Me

1459
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:39,581
*And How You Suffered 
 For your sanity *

1460
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,552
*And How You Tried 
 To set them free *

1461
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:48,290
*They Would Not Listen 
 They're not listening still *

1462
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:55,163
*Perhaps They Never Will

1463
01:38:55,197 --> 01:39:02,670
*
