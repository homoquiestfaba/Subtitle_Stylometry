- He's compiled quite a list...

of various radical activities.

Over 10,000 so far.

You want to deport

But until we find out

to take that risk.

is impervious.

I'd start with a labor agitator
named Carlo Tresca.

He's the head
of the local I.W.W.

all those people

- They seem pretty upset about...
- Justice for Ludlow.

What about Ludlow?

242
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,308
Ludlow was a coal mine.
It was a labor dispute?

243
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,611
It was one of your mines,
right, sir?

244
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:08,181
Several of the miners
under my employ went on strike.

245
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:11,518
And when an attempt was made
to persuade them
to go back to work,

246
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,188
A riot erupted,
and we were forced to
summon the National Guard.

When several miners
were killed unnecessarily.

there's more to it than that.

have something to do...

ended up on a package bomb

something better.

isn't it?

258

Let me make something
perfectly clear,
Agent Flynn.

259
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,363
The miners
and their families...

260
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,366
Were given a roof over
their heads, food, clothing.

261
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,468
Everything they needed
was provided for them.

262
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,671
Yes, and how exactly
does that work,
the food and clothing?

263
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,207
Aren't the miners paid
in some form of scrip...

264
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,578
So they're forced to shop
at the company store?

265
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,946
At least that's
my understanding of it.

266
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,082
They're not forced to
do anything, Agent Flynn.

267
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,285
They can leave
any time they like.

268

But, uh, their money's
no good anywhere else.

269
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:25,625
So essentially they are
forced to get their supplies
at your store,

270

And the money pretty well
goes directly back
into your pocket.
