1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:01,796
Is it okay if I do this the whole time?

2
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:02,763
Is it okay if I do this?

3
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:07,968
Um, being naked is like...

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,221
Being naked is really fun.

5
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:12,056
It can be, like, super weird.

6
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:12,857
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:16,360
I wish we were both naked right now.

8
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,980
Listen up, ladies.

9
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,715
It's "Girl Code."

10
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:23,818
On this episode of "Girl Code"...

11
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:24,819
It's that voice in the back

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,086
of your head that makes you

13
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:28,322
feel bad about eating all of the ice cream.

14
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,356
Guilt.

15
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:31,392
Also, just because we hear you

16
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:33,160
doesn't mean we're paying attention.

17
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:35,162
We're learning how to listen.

18
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:37,064
Then, our code qualifiers

19
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:40,267
take your issues to task on Ask Girl Code.

20
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:41,101
I hate to make it gross,

21
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:42,670
but let's talk about
sometimes when you fart

22
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,755
and you're sitting down,
it goes up, kind of

23
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:45,840
in the front, like, ooh.

24
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,507
That's kinda fun.

25
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:47,391
That's the worst.

26
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,093
But first...

27
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:50,561
We were born like this, but it's

28
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:52,429
usually hard to feel flawless

29
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,431
when it comes to being naked.

30
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,901
I love being naked.

31
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,185
My best friend Katrina, because

32
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:59,353
we live in a studio, hates it,

33
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,188
'cause I always walk around naked,

34
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,523
and I'll throw, like, a right

35
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:03,858
titty in her face.

36
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,909
Just 'cause.

37
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,110
I'd like to wear as little

38
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:07,444
amount of clothing as possible.

39
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,029
If I could get away with just,

40
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,197
like, wearing a little denim

41
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,449
strip over my labia,
that's what I would do.

42
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,785
I love being naked.

43
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:16,787
I feel like... I mean,
everybody has a body,

44
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:19,039
so... You know, it's nothing,

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,791
it's just like skin and some body parts.

46
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,293
I like being naked, it's totally cool.

47
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:23,794
I mean, (bleep), are you asking

48
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:26,547
me to get naked?

49
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:28,098
Let's do this (bleep).

50
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,555
Do you have another question?

51
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,106
Well, being naked as a kid

52
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,474
means bathtime, and then being

53
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,561
naked as an adult means sexytime,

54
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,113
which needs a bath afterwards.

55
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:43,981
I remember my brother,

56
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:45,149
my twin brother and I would take

57
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,234
baths together and then we would

58
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,953
go naked and jump on the bed

59
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:49,987
and we would sing the song,

60
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:53,240
"You have a penis, I have a vagina,"

61
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,409
and his was, "You have a vagina,

62
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,744
I have a penis,"

63
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:57,411
but we probably mixed it up

64
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,412
and that's where I got all these

65
00:01:58,413 --> 00:01:59,463
gender issues.

66
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:01,165
My sister saw my dad naked

67
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,083
and said, I want one of those.

68
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,084
His (bleep).

69
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:05,970
Is she a lesbian, too?

70
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,637
No, we don't want (bleep)

71
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:09,840
That's not what being a lesbian means.

72
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,175
Well... I feel like I'm teaching

73
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,426
a lot by sitting next to you.

74
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,594
Great.

75
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:16,096
This is what a gay person looks like.

76
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:17,147
Being naked in a gym

77
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:19,266
locker room blows my mind.

78
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,268
There are women who are...

79
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:22,319
It's, like, always the older

80
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,655
women, and they're having full

81
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:27,775
conversations, fully naked,

82
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,526
bush just rocking out,

83
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:30,494
and they're like, oh, Joan,

84
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,362
how are the kids?

85
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:32,780
And she's like, well, Antonio

86
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,198
is now in law school.

87
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,115
Great.

88
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,117
My Morton, he's in law school.

89
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:38,953
It's like, your bush is out!

90
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,120
It seems like the people who

91
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,206
go to the gym are looking to

92
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,791
just, like, creep up and, like,

93
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,292
pick up their legs and, like,

94
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,378
give you a zoom all the way into

95
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,462
their uterus, and I'm like,

96
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:50,047
please don't, like, I don't want

97
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:50,714
to know you like that.

98
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:53,050
Everybody has imperfections
with their body,

99
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:54,301
everybody has, like, a certain

100
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:55,686
way that they are,

101
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:56,553
so you just gotta learn to

102
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:57,638
accept that and love that,

103
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,189
because chances are, the girl

104
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,857
that you're sitting in

105
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,225
the locker room with and she's

106
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:02,476
looking at you naked, she feels

107
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:03,644
a way about her body, too.

108
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,896
If you think you have a (bleep) weird body,

109
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,648
but you are just, like, have no problem

110
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,650
showing it, no one is gonna say (bleep)

111
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,535
to you, and if they do and you tell

112
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,703
them to (bleep) off, like,

113
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,072
you just won high school.

114
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:16,573
I feel like girls should be

115
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:17,658
the ones who want to get naked

116
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,076
more than men because girls'

117
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,494
bodies are, like, look like

118
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,662
works of art where my body just

119
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,714
looks like a bag of trash.

120
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:24,999
Right before I see a guy

121
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,666
naked, I'm just like, I want

122
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,333
see his (bleep), I want to s

123
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,084
his (bleep), oh, my God, oh, my

124
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,419
God, oh, my God, I'm gonna s his (bleep).

125
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,086
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

126
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,170
Oh, my God, that's his (bleep).

127
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:32,506
And then that's it, after that,

128
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,058
it's just like, yeah, okay.

129
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,009
I mean, I've definitely

130
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,094
unwrapped a present that

131
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,680
I wanted to return the next day

132
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:40,848
if you know what I mean.

133
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,182
When you're getting naked
in front of a guy,

134
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:42,933
I don't think you should do

135
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,351
lights on or lights off.

136
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,736
I think you go somewhere in the middle.

137
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,354
I call it cellu-lighting.

138
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,522
I'm most insecure about my

139
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:50,691
thighs when I'm naked, 'cause

140
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:52,576
they look like lava is just

141
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,244
spreading out, 'cause there's so

142
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,530
many divots and, like, holes and...

143
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,082
It's like very jiggly

144
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,700
and they're moving around a lot.

145
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,453
My thighs move when I'm not even breathing.

146
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,588
When are you not breathing?

147
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:05,756
When I do a test to see if my

148
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:09,376
thighs will still move.

149
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:10,961
I feel like fat girls get

150
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:11,962
real self-conscious about being

151
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:15,049
naked and they shouldn't!

152
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,550
Because it's more cushion for

153
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:20,637
the pushin', and some guys like fat women.

154
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:21,388
Light a candle, that's

155
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,640
perfect, everyone looks good in a candle.

156
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,308
But remember to blow it out,

157
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:24,975
because you're gonna burn yo

158
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:25,642
(bleep) house down.

159
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:26,977
You don't want to die
with t mother (bleep).

160
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,980
It's the first time you (bleep) him.

161
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,165
If you feel uncomfortable

162
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,232
being naked, I always tell

163
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,567
people to get a spray tan

164
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,402
because it makes you look more

165
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,071
fit and less dead.

166
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,405
I gotta get one.

167
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:39,807
Some people need to be in

168
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,458
shape in order to be comfortable

169
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,660
being naked, and some people don't.

170
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,462
Some people are just happy

171
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:48,332
with their flabby flabs.

172
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,666
You know?

173
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,668
Like most men.

174
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,420
Coming up, it's the guilt

175
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:55,422
that keeps on giving.

176
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,091
Society loves to make women

177
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,342
feel guilty, like, that's kind

178
00:04:58,343 --> 00:04:59,476
of the game, is, like, women

179
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,178
should be guilty for being women.

180
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,013
We're kind of born guilty, We're like, oh,

181
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:03,680
you're not a man?

182
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,431
What's up with that?

183
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,985
♪♪

184
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,727
I want to be in charge of the money.

185
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,728
You're not allowed.

186
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:19,813
Why not?

187
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,781
Because, you're a woman.

188
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:22,816
It says right here women can't

189
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:23,900
be in charge of money.

190
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:25,735
What's this game called again?

191
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:28,321
It's Manopoly, the new board

192
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,406
game that's so much like real

193
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,409
life, it's almost not a game at all.

194
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,994
Oh, I passed yes.

195
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,913
$300, please.

196
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:38,248
Me too!

197
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,416
Pay me.

198
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,801
You only get $230.

199
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,836
Why?

200
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:43,920
Manopoly.

201
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,006
Fun for the whole family,

202
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,592
as long as they're all men.

203
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:49,976
Yes.

204
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:50,927
No, no, no.

205
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,013
You gotta pick a secretary card.

206
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,482
But, what if I wanna be an executive?

207
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't be silly.

208
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,767
Manopoly.

209
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:01,438
You can be pretty or smart, but not both.

210
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,356
Yes, River Canyon!

211
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,357
I'm gonna buy it.

212
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,610
Not without your husband or your dad.

213
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,445
What?

214
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm sorry, who invented this game?

215
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,532
There's something for everyone.

216
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,917
What's period jail?

217
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,004
Oh, I landed on the smile space!

218
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,372
I get to tell you to smile

219
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:20,290
and if you don't, you need to go

220
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,841
back to start while I yell at you.

221
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:22,509
What?

222
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,426
Smile!

223
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,631
Your boss finds you too attractive.

224
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:29,633
$10 fine.

225
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,968
Great, well, there's the rest of my money.

226
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,472
It is impossible to win this.

227
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:36,473
Manopoly.

228
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,808
It's just life, so quit complaining

229
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,727
and have fun with it.

230
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,479
Boom!

231
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,813
The cards may be stacked

232
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,649
against you, so we should all

233
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,817
know how to play up the guilt.

234
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:50,153
Guilt is when you do

235
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:52,322
something and you're like, oh!

236
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:56,993
I feel in my heart that I don't feel good.

237
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,828
I feel guilty.

238
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:01,665
It's almost like you ate too much cheese,

239
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,667
but it's not actual
cheese, it's just, like,

240
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,586
emotional cheese, you're just like, oh!

241
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,671
You just have, like, chills,

242
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:09,339
just guilty cheese chills.

243
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,724
That's guilt.

244
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:11,891
I feel guilty because I was

245
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:12,976
late to work today.

246
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:18,515
Sorry.

247
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,602
Society loves to make women feel guilty.

248
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:23,737
That's kind of the game,

249
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:24,604
it's, like, women should be

250
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:25,855
guilty for being women.

251
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,357
We're kind of born guilty, we're

252
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:28,408
like, oh, you're not a man?

253
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:29,359
What's up with that?

254
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,028
I feel like girls do guilt themselves.

255
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:33,530
(laughs) like, one of my friends

256
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,532
was, like, cheating on
his girlfriend, like,

257
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,533
left and right,

258
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,367
and then she found out and she's

259
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:38,868
like, it's my fault.

260
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,537
I'm just like, what?

261
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:41,538
I was like, look, I'm not one to

262
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:42,622
break like any type of code,

263
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:43,873
but I was like, it's really not.

264
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,759
Women feel that all the time.

265
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,878
Girls be guiltin'
themselves on the regular.

266
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,597
Women be shopping and guilting

267
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:52,465
themselves afterwards.

268
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,383
You guys give guilt and feel

269
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:54,634
guilt for everything.

270
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:57,387
You ever seen a woman
try and eat a cupcake?

271
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:01,891
I've never felt so much stress

272
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,476
in my entire life.

273
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:04,444
I never make myself feel

274
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,562
guilty about (bleep),

275
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:06,896
even if I'm, like, trying to

276
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:08,898
diet, which is never, but if I do,

277
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,483
I'm like, oh, I just messed

278
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:11,785
it all up, I have to start all

279
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,069
over again, I feel so guilty.

280
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,155
I don't... No.

281
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,740
I wanted that (bleep) donut,

282
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:20,577
I ate the donut, I (bleep) and I feel good.

283
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:21,628
Some people are vegan because

284
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,630
they feel guilty about animals.

285
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,916
I'm all like, kill 'em.

286
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,085
(laughter) Explain.

287
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,921
Just kill 'em.

288
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,090
Did my parents ever make me feel guilty?

289
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:34,924
Does a bear (bleep) in the woods

290
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,760
and wipe his ass with a rabbit?

291
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:37,594
Yes.

292
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:39,763
I was brought up in a conservative home.

293
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:44,184
So... (sighing)

294
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,652
We can't do nothing.

295
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,187
They would say things like, Awkwafina,

296
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,855
did you know that if you
were born in China,

297
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,440
that you would be putting in the hairs

298
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:51,107
of the Barbie doll?

299
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,108
(snickering)

300
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,028
With two little chopsticks?

301
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:57,781
Moms were created just to guilt us.

302
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,616
They're guilting machines.

303
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:00,700
Like, my mom, I feel like, would

304
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,869
be happy, if I would crawl back

305
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,670
into her uterus.

306
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:04,671
Like, I feel like on a daily

307
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:05,955
basis, she's guilting me for

308
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,791
just being outside of her uterus.

309
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:08,458
You know, when people gui

310
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,125
you, they never just say wha

311
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,793
they want you to do.

312
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:10,460
Mm-hmm.

313
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:11,544
They'll just be like, it

314
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:13,012
would be really nice...

315
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:13,880
If you could find the time.

316
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:14,547
If you could just find th

317
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,049
time to call your grandma today.

318
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,967
I mean, she's alone in that house.

319
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:18,968
It's like, who's gonna be like,

320
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,136
oh, no thanks.

321
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:21,638
Hi, sweetie.

322
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,642
Um... Just calling because I haven't

323
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,193
heard our voice in a while

324
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:30,814
and I miss my baby.

325
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:32,449
Okay, bye.

326
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,152
Rip my heart in half, I feel so

327
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,704
guilty, I'm sorry, Mommy, please

328
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,824
still love me.

329
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:41,991
I have a couple of friends

330
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:42,992
who like to guilt me for things

331
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,043
that aren't my fault,

332
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,080
they're like, I was so lonely this weekend.

333
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,164
And I'm like, oh, that's weird,

334
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:48,915
you didn't text me,

335
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,333
so I couldn't read your mind.

336
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,167
Like, if a friend's guilting

337
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,168
you all the time, be like,

338
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,921
listen, Quinn, I'm not gay.

339
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:56,506
If I was, I would like you.

340
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:57,173
I would like you.

341
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,591
But, like, but don't you wanna be gay?

342
00:09:58,592 --> 00:09:59,259
But don't you want to be gay

343
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,010
I want to be gay, but it's not a choice.

344
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,011
Be gay.

345
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:02,929
It's not a choice.

346
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,680
It is a choice for you.

347
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,014
It's something you're born with.

348
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:07,016
I'll choose for you, you're gay.

349
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,685
The biggest guilt that everyone gets...

350
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,019
Come on, let's go out.

351
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
No, let's go.

352
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,906
You're not gonna stay home, let's go out.

353
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,190
You'll meet somebody.

354
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:14,941
Guilt from your friends can

355
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:15,942
be good, 'cause it can really

356
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,193
keep you out of trouble, like,

357
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:18,194
if your friends see you doing,

358
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,579
like, some self-destructive

359
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
behavior, like, it's like, dude,

360
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,082
every time I talk to you, you're hungover.

361
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,751
Maybe you should stop drinking so much.

362
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:25,752
That's cool guilt.

363
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:26,786
That's guilt that'll keep you

364
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:27,704
healthy and alive.

365
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,956
I don't use guilt to, like, help people.

366
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:30,957
I use guilt to be like, do you

367
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,959
remember that time when you made

368
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,211
me feel not nice?

369
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:39,521
Will you please buy me
a cocktail right now?

370
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,300
Thank you, that made it feel

371
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,802
a little bit better.

372
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:43,887
I don't like resorting to

373
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,889
guilt in a relationship to make

374
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,724
the person do what I want, but I

375
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,309
am a big believer of the motto,

376
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,729
pout and you shall receive.

377
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,114
Ahh... I've used guilt to get what

378
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,900
I want in a relationship and I

379
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,568
will tell you the number-one

380
00:10:58,569 --> 00:10:59,736
thing I want in a relationship,

381
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,738
and that's a mother (bleep)

382
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:02,739
massage.

383
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,573
I think you should save it

384
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:05,742
for the big stuff, and not the,

385
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:07,243
you know, oh, you left the towel

386
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,328
on the floor, oh, you did this.

387
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,079
I think you should save it for the,

388
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,798
did you just like ten of this

389
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,949
bitch's pictures in a row at

390
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,151
3:00 in the morning and I saw you?

391
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,085
You don't want to guilt them

392
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,954
into, like, texting you, or

393
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,306
telling you who they were with or why,

394
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:21,841
or taking you out or, like,

395
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,092
having sex with you, which is,

396
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,928
like, the craziest thing ever.

397
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,012
If you're guilting someone into

398
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,097
having sex with you, that is insane.

399
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:28,932
Dump that mother (bleep) and

400
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,600
delete his number out your phone.

401
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,851
Coming up, just because we

402
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:33,937
hear you, doesn't mean we're listening.

403
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,104
Girls talk a lot, like,

404
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:36,990
I have to listen to a lot of (bleep).

405
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:37,646
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:38,324
I think it's harder for you,

407
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,109
'cause you have to, like, list to a girl.

408
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,944
If I had to listen to a girl all

409
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,111
the time, I'd be like, blech,

410
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,006
- I'm not a lesbian anymore.
- Yeah.

411
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:57,395
Let's all take a minute to

412
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:59,129
bow down to Kathryn Bigelow.

413
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:00,381
She's a kick-ass director,

414
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,716
producer and screenwriter.

415
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:03,768
And she's the first woman to win

416
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,887
an Academy Award for best
director for her movie, "The Hurt Locker."

417
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:08,389
And in that same year, she beat

418
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,808
her ex-husband in the same category,

419
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:11,776
so the next time that you feel

420
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:12,893
like the odds are against you,

421
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:14,311
just remember that Kathryn Bigelow

422
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,946
paved the way for women in film

423
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:17,732
and she beat her ex in the process,

424
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,399
so let's all take a minute

425
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,401
to bow down to Kathryn Bigelow.

426
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:22,236
Welcome back to "Girl Code."

427
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,123
Whether you're the talker or the talkee,

428
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:25,656
you can save everyone a lot of

429
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,125
trouble if you're actually listening.

Listening is so important,

436
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,843
like, you need to be a good

437
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,178
listener to be a good friend,

438
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,263
to be a good girlfriend, boyfriend.

439
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:50,598
To be good in anything,

440
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,933
you have to just shut up and listen.

441
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,268
Sorry, what?

442
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,152
Stupid joke?

443
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:55,936
Okay.

444
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:56,771
That's me not listening.

445
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:57,905
That's the joke.

446
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:01,275
I hate myself.

447
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:02,276
Listening and hearing are

448
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:04,361
definitely completely different things.

449
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:05,362
Listening is when you're

450
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,198
actually trying to understand,

451
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,365
like, what the person is trying

452
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,167
to communicate, like, not just

453
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:10,835
what they're saying,

454
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:12,119
but how they're saying it.

455
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,287
Do they want something from you?

456
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,506
Are they, like, expressing an emotion?

457
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,209
And hearing is just, like, oh, sounds.

458
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,043
Cool!

459
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,511
I love sounds.

460
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,379
I think a good listener is

461
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,881
somebody that makes you know

462
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,049
that they're paying attention to

463
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,717
you and they're really, really

464
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:27,968
understand what you're saying

465
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,054
and they're not being
creepy and just, like,

466
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:31,055
staring at you in a very,

467
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:35,309
like, lesbian type... I'm kidding.

468
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,895
I'm a great listener, sometimes.

469
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:42,032
Other times, people talk and I'm like...

470
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,234
Uh-oh.

471
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,068
They're gonna stop and I'm gonna

472
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,236
have to respond.

473
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,320
The best listeners are super

474
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,989
patient, usually easygoing,

475
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,909
usually have very low standards of friends.

476
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,912
Lonely.

477
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,380
So basically, losers are good

478
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,415
listeners, because, really, how

479
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,500
else are you gonna get popular?

480
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,384
I think to be a good

481
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,719
listener, you have to...

482
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,386
You can be a good listener.

483
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:03,721
You have to want to have with that person.

484
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:04,388
Yes, for sure.

485
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,055
That's it.

486
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,090
Yes, 100%.

487
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:06,924
100%, you're right.

488
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,175
You won.

489
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:12,847
A good way to see if

490
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,432
someone's listening to
you is just ask them,

491
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,517
are you listening?

492
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:19,019
So you just go, are you listening to me?

493
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,070
And then if they, like, get

494
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,105
a little startled, they were not

495
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:24,775
listening to you in the slightest.

496
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,910
I don't know if you're listening

497
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:27,278
to me, 'cause I talked about how

498
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,529
stupid girls look in heels

499
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,415
sometimes and you guys still look stupid.

500
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,261
Why'd you leave the house
looking like that?

501
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,940
You look like a dinosaur stomping around.

502
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,037
All of a sudden, your arms are
like this and you gotta move

503
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,423
like that just to get across the street.
You look stupid.

504
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,377
One of my biggest pet peeves

505
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:44,378
is when somebody's talking to

506
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,462
you and then they're looking

507
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,797
beyond you for someone better.

508
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,549
Like, what, am I not good enough?

509
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,967
My cable TV credits aren't good

510
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:51,135
enough for you?

511
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:54,138
If you say anything to me and I go..

512
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,472
"That's a good idea."

513
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:56,557
I'm not listening.

514
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:58,142
I didn't listen to a thing you just said.

515
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,226
"That's crazy,"

516
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,278
and "oh, for real?"

517
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,897
That's how I know you're not listening.

518
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:04,949
89.9% of the time, it's your

519
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,901
fault someone is not listening to you.

520
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:08,402
You are boring as (bleep).

521
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:09,620
And you are talking about

522
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:12,239
yourself or your stupid boyfriend too much

523
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
and then people just go, uh-huh,

524
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,326
yeah, okay, sure.

525
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,578
Filing nails and whatnot,

526
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,079
so don't be boring.

527
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,965
Fake listening is actually

528
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,132
very important to a relationship

529
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,500
because a lot of times, we don't

530
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,336
really want someone to listen,

531
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:27,004
we just want someone to hear.

532
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,088
When I'm fake listening,

533
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,340
you can tell, 'cause this

534
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:30,474
is what I look like.

535
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,320
Just try to be as normal as possible.

536
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:44,021
Just try and, like,

537
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:44,688
strip it... like, just...

538
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,273
just stop doing stuff.

539
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:48,943
All right.

540
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:51,829
You're obviously not listening to me, now.

541
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,496
I wish somebody would giv

542
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,198
advice, how to be a good

543
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,950
listener in a relationship.

544
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:56,617
My boyfriend listens to

545
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,119
everything I say and all I do,

546
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,171
is, like, ignore, ignore, ignore.

547
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:02,539
I think being a good listener

548
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,291
is just one of those
things that comes along

549
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,210
when you're invested.

550
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,294
When you're invested in

551
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,679
something, you wanna do

552
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,681
everything that you can do

553
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,549
to get a great return.

554
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,351
I'm a good listener in my relationships.

555
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,219
Liar.

556
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,888
I am.

557
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,390
My boyfriend doesn't talk a lot.

558
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:20,057
That's why.

559
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:20,858
Girls talk a lot.

560
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,359
Like, I have to listen to a lot of (bleep).

561
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,143
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:24,228
I think it's harder for you

563
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:24,979
'cause you have to, like, listen

564
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,230
to a girl, like, if I had to

565
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,398
listen to a girl all the time,

566
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,065
I would be like, blech,

567
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,483
I'm not a lesbian anymore.

568
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,151
If you want a guy to listen to you,

569
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:32,536
here's what you have to do.

570
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:35,406
Go to another room, get an XBox Live,

571
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,541
put on the headset and talk to

572
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:38,993
him while he's playing.

573
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,577
Fight levels together, and in

574
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,578
the meantime, you can talk about

575
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,247
how terrible your boss is.

576
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,765
Now I'll listen to you.

577
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:46,333
Someone stole your Lean Cuisine?

578
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,001
That's terrible.

579
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,002
Now shoot that guy.

580
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,420
Oh, you could totally make your boyfriend

581
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,504
a better listener.

582
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,756
Just, you gotta stop (bleep) him.

583
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:53,724
You got to.

584
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,259
Be like, wait, I told you

585
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,261
earlier what to get from the store.

586
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:58,595
Were you not listening?

587
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:00,064
Well, you know, I forgot.

588
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:00,731
Oh, you forgot?

589
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,517
Well, I forgot to (bleep) you tonight.

590
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:04,601
It's gonna be funny.

591
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,269
It's gonna be funny

592
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,353
after a month when I forgot

593
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,604
to (bleep) you every day.

594
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,073
Real quick.

595
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,025
They get into shape real fast,

596
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,109
trust me, use it.

597
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,745
Coming up... Things get a little bunched up

598
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,613
on Ask Girl Code.

599
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,249
I'm always camel toe-ing,
always, I love it.

600
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,701
Wait, you also have a big vagina, then?

601
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:21,952
Yeah, big chubby labia.

602
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:22,636
Yeah.

603
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,371
It just always looks hungry for fabric,

604
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:25,089
whenever I wear pants.

605
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,540
It's like... (vocalizing)

606
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,374
Munch it up.

607
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:35,549
It's normal to, like,

608
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,134
wipe your butt after you poop

609
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,135
and then just want to, like,

610
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:39,970
inspect it a little bit, right?

611
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:40,637
Like, not touching it, just,

612
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:41,972
like, looking at it?

613
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,357
Asking for a friend.

614
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:52,685
Welcome back to "Girl Code."

615
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,219
If at first you don't succeed,

616
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,938
you can try, try again.

617
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,055
Or just Ask Girl Code.

618
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,226
Dangerous_Love5 asks, is it a crime

619
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,645
if I run around town without a bra?

620
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,396
No way.

621
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:05,063
No, no way.

622
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:05,981
Oh, my gosh.

623
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:06,899
Let 'em be free.

624
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,566
Yeah.

625
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,233
Let them titties out.

626
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:08,901
Do you know how much happ

627
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,068
we'd all be as women if we all

628
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,069
never wore bras?

629
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,654
Yeah, bras were never invented.

630
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:13,989
'Cause you know who they invented for.

631
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,656
It was not for us.

632
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:15,991
It was... Why?

633
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,326
'Cause they were distressing, or...?

634
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,076
It was, like, a corset-y

635
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,244
thing for beer maidens.

636
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:19,912
Like, if you watch, like,

637
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:20,913
"Game of Thrones," or whatever,

638
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:21,663
they're always, like, serving

639
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,965
meat and stuff, and they've got,

640
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:23,632
like, their tits up here.

641
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,299
"Game of Thrones"

642
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,250
isn't legit.

643
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,668
The girls have, like...

644
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:27,636
They don't have even bushes

645
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:28,921
on "Game of Thrones."

646
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,088
Well, when's the last time

647
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,006
you just didn't wear a bra?

648
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:31,673
Like, what's happening?

649
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,341
I always have on a bra.

650
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:33,091
I have issues with, like,

651
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,927
the slope of my boob and I always

652
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:35,844
want them under my chin.

653
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:36,762
Me too, me too!

654
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:37,813
I sleep in a bra.

655
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,765
I slept in a bra until, like,

656
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:42,150
college, and then I was just, like, okay,

657
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,101
this is what they do.

658
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:44,603
When they're big, it's not

659
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:46,772
comfortable having not a bra...

660
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:47,689
They literally flop around.

661
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,024
It could get caught under things.

662
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:49,691
Yes.

663
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:50,359
Yes.

664
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,277
It's why I wear underwear 'cause I just...

665
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,196
I have that problem too.

666
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,614
I got a big vagina too.

667
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,283
I'm always camel toe-ing,
always, I love it.

668
00:18:58,284 --> 00:18:59,868
Wait, you also have a big vagina, then?

669
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,286
Yeah, big chubby labia.

670
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:02,037
Yeah.

671
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,372
It just always looks hung for fabric

672
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,289
whenever I wear pants.

673
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,124
It's like... (vocalizing)

674
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,626
Munch it up.

675
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:08,961
@_ghost_gurl asked,

676
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:10,045
is it okay to change yourself

677
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,714
when nobody at school / work likes you?

678
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,384
Oh... No, you shouldn't change yourself.

679
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:16,051
You should just find people

680
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,302
who like you for who you are.

681
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:17,970
Yeah, right?

682
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,304
I feel like... I'm a weirdo.

683
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:19,972
I found you guys.

684
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:20,639
Yeah.

685
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,690
It sounds like _ghost_gurl

686
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,810
is in a (bleep) work / school

687
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:26,311
situation, which we've all been in.

688
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,312
I've gone to schools where

689
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,647
people hated me, I've worked at

690
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:29,815
jobs where everybody hated me,

691
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:32,234
but I know that changing myself,

692
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,036
like, to please those people

693
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:34,903
would not have made me into

694
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:35,904
a person I like, you know?

695
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:37,072
Yeah, totally, 'cause when

696
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,156
you're at school or at work,

697
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:39,491
you don't really choose the people

698
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,158
you're surrounded by.

699
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,826
Exactly.

700
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:41,827
So you get stuck with a lot

701
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,328
of, like, randos, and you have

702
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,713
nothing in common and then of

703
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,164
course they don't like you, 'cause, like,

704
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:46,832
you like weird stuff.

705
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,499
Yeah.

706
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,166
Yeah, like I didn't reall

707
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,002
have a lot of friends
until I found theater.

708
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,770
Right.

709
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,872
@helloiamname asks, is it

710
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,073
weird that I like it when my

711
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,008
booty muscles are twitching

712
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:57,743
after I work out?

713
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,061
Yeah, so weird.

714
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,395
I don't know what she's talking...

715
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:01,730
I've never had a butt twitch.

716
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:02,397
Oh, really?

717
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,849
Well, I don't work out, but

718
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,767
sometimes when I walk and move

719
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,019
my body, my muscles are like,

720
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
oh, don't do that, you don't use

721
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:09,738
those enough, and then I get,

722
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,356
like, leg twitches and butt twitches.

723
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,691
But what's... How is it twitching?

724
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:13,358
Is it going, like...

725
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,243
(vocalizing) or is it... Is it like Beyoncé

726
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,862
in the "7/11" video and it's just,

727
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:17,696
moving on its own?

728
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:18,530
Like, can you see the twitch?

729
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,198
I bet it's an internal feeling.

730
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,249
I hate to make it gross, but

731
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,284
let's talk about sometimes when

732
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,035
you fart and you're sitting

733
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,036
down, it goes up.

734
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:25,537
Kind of in the front, like, ooh.

735
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,204
That's kind of fun.

736
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,339
That's the worst.
