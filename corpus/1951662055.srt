1
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,236
At the end of the century XVlll
and beginnings of the XIX one...

2
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:51,909
...the Welsh immigrants brought
to America a Celtic old ritual...

3
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,215
...practiced by hundred of years.

4
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,279
The ritual was known as the one
"Devouring of Sins."

5
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,261
Mount Appalachian Mountains, 1830

6
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,309
20 years later.

7
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:06,154
My town crossed an ocean to live
in the mountains of this new world.

8
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,029
They came with the hope
of beginning a new life.

9
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,588
But we were also a town
with dark secrets...

10
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,430
...that we tried to cover
with an old ritual.

11
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,131
However, the secrets always
they are revealed by the light of the truth.

12
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:25,940
In that spring, to my ten anuses,
the whole truth was finally revealed.

13
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,015
Pope says that I resemble you, Granny.

14
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,050
You look like each other me, Cadi.

15
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,986
You also have the blue eyes
of your grandfather Ewan...

16
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,223
...and the same thirst in your soul.

17
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,674
Give him/her time to your he/she suckles, Cadi.

18
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,603
Granny that happens?

19
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,679
Not it is anything, love.

20
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,054
If it could formulate a desire now,
do you know which serious?

21
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,152
That the time went back?

22
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,630
That also serious brilliant, don't you believe?

23
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:29,006
But that that but I want now it is
something of color and beauty.

24
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,940
I return at once.

25
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:40,718
Baby, Cadi? I love you, my love.

26
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,054
I also love you, Granny.

27
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,630
.Granny, I found them! I found them.

28
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,673
Granny?

29
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,712
No, Granny. Granny.

30
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,942
Gorawen is
hardly some days ago...

31
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,341
...that I listen the powerful voice
calling it from the mountain.

32
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:31,055
He/she wanted to take a long time a little
for Cadi's good.

33
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,396
- Salt of here, Cadi.
- If. If, he/she suckles.

34
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,236
Your he/she suckles you I send out?

35
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,106
If, Mister.

36
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,540
It gathers the cedar sticks
and take them to the house.

37
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,377
They moved away the scent to death.

38
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,024
Cadi, you should listen to me, now.

39
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:53,628
Make that you make,
never go to the Devouring of Sins.

40
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,332
Do you understand me?

41
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,731
He/she has the expression of the hell
in their eyes...

42
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,501
...it has assimilated in if same
horrible habits...

43
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,877
...and if you look at it, their wickedness will relapse
on you.

44
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,674
- Do you understand me, Cadi?
- If, Mrs..

45
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,785
Very well.

46
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,331
- Angor.
- Brogan.

47
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,609
I give you spiritual comfort,
Gorawen Forbes...

48
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:46,221
...so that you don't wander forever
for the roads or mountains...

49
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,385
...or throughout the paths.

50
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,541
And for your earthly sins,
dear woman...

51
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,478
...zeal my own soul.

52
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,541
While he/she listened that man
sad and miserable...

53
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,578
...I wondered for that the one loaded
with the sins of people...

54
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,170
...that they were refused to look at it
to the eyes...

55
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:47,075
...and I wondered as soon as time
he/she would come to devour my sins.

56
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,856
He/she would have to live until the age of Granny
to liberate me of all my sins?

57
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,456
When I became, the he/she had left...

58
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,958
...and with the my hope left
of being forgiven some day.

59
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:07,333
Forget the, Cadi Forbes.
It has completed their purpose and he/she has already left.

60
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,167
Now veto to house.

61
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,664
Who the Devouring of Sins is?
To who rots to tell him/her the truth?

62
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,801
Who liberated me of my sins?

63
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,566
Can I help you in something, does he/she suckle?

64
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
Cadi, salt and it picks up some sassafras
for your he/she suckles.

65
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,883
If, potato.

66
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,415
When you overcame it
and did you begin to be he/she suckles again, does it Trust?

67
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,681
Please, Angor, leave me calm.
Not I can respond now your questions.

68
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,953
The death of Gorawen...

69
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,229
This doesn't have anything to do with the
my mother's death, and your you know it.

70
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:21,603
That girl this so affected as your
for what happened to Elen and her...

71
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,566
She needs you.

72
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,475
It hurts a lot.

73
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,447
As much as time will make us suffer?

74
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:40,516
Not it should have been my small Elen.
Not he/she should have been my baby.

75
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,057
You would want that he/she had been a Cadi
who died?

76
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,798
Is that? It is that what you say.

77
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,138
You would want that he/she had been a Cadi
who died.

78
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,885
Not you should be here, Cadi.

79
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,491
They have noticed you that you stay far.

80
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,291
.Cadi!

81
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,780
Hello, Katrina Anice.

82
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,380
There is a better place
to cross the rapids of Narrows.

83
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,316
Me you that there is him. Who are?

84
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,562
- My name is Lilybet.
- As it is that you know me?

85
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,558
All in the place of where I come
they have listened that you made.

86
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,694
Do all know?

87
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,764
All know something, Katrina Anice.

88
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,831
But who knows everything?

89
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,903
- Follow me. I know the road.
- Toward where?

90
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,647
To find the one that can liberate you
of your sins.

91
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,546
The Devouring of Sins?

92
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:08,292
- Where you live?
- This far from here, but not so much.

93
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,895
You are a very strange girl.

94
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,710
That place is not good, Cul.
You should prove there.

95
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,270
Do you want to be quiet?
You will frighten my fish.

96
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,816
Not you could fish a cow,
in any event.

97
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,585
Cadi Forbes, you are lucky that me not
have a he/she arms.

98
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,457
It would have shot you taking for Indian.

99
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,861
Leave alone it.
Their grandmother has just died.

100
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,389
I scream exactly when it was to fish...

101
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,867
...one very big.

102
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,835
Not I wanted to get scared, Cul.
Lilybet and me alone we were...

103
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,932
- Who Lilybet is?
- That girl that this there.

104
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,041
Good, it was there. It should be shy.

105
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,251
- They say that not this well of the head...
- Already this well, Cul.

106
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,949
That you make in the earth of Kai
in any event?

107
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,824
Not I realized toward where we went.

108
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,866
We walked below river
from the rapids of Narrows.

109
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,367
Your he/she suckles he/she knows
that you were in the rapids of Narrows?

110
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,768
You don't care that.

111
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,600
Are you hungry?

112
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,270
Insurance went for some side.

113
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,180
If, somehow.

114
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,980
Besides driving away my fish?

115
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,622
It was about finding
to the Devouring of Sins.

116
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,295
The Devouring of Sins?

117
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,130
He/she is a monster.

118
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:59,537
He/she is a demon of lit red eyes
and long wolf eyeteeth.

119
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:04,308
He/she is a man that sold him/her the soul
to the devil. He/she smells the death.

120
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,980
He/she lives hoping people die...

121
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,917
...to feed with their sins.

122
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:14,220
If, and he/she suckles he/she says that if he/she looks at you
with their devil eyes...

123
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,195
- These dead one.
- That is not true.

124
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,891
- As you know it?
- Good, I am not dead, or if?

125
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:27,498
Did you look at it, truth?
In the funeral of your grandmother.

126
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:32,969
Not I could avoid it.
Their voice sounded very sad and solitary.

127
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,239
Now these convict.

128
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,511
He/she prays a lot. He/she prays very much
so that the devil doesn't find you.

129
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,411
It is better than we already return home.
They Come, Glynnis.

130
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,261
I wonder where he/she lives.

131
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,703
Alone he/she comes when somebody plays
the bell of the death.

132
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,738
If somebody knew...

133
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,874
...he/she would have to be somebody but old
that you hoist them.

134
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,565
- That you made yourself?
- I walked somewhere around. Fagan is very comely.

135
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,083
He/she suckles, I want you to know somebody.

136
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,492
I met a new friend.
Their name is Lilybet.

137
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,092
Now not, Cadi.

138
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,773
This well, Katrina Anice.
Perhaps in another moment.

139
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:15,705
If. He/she suckles this busy one with their loom.
It will be in another moment.

140
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,058
I go. I already go.

141
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,365
Miz Elda, wondered
who he/she would want him to come to their funeral one.

142
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,199
Sacred God, girl.

143
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:18,140
That he/she asks for a bigger woman.
I not yet am dead.

144
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,168
Not Mrs.. But it will be very late
to ask him/her when him this.

145
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,806
Well, in that you are right.

146
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,279
And the Devouring of Sins?
Would he like that he/she came, Miz Elda?

147
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,227
Certainly. I will be very needy
of the one.

148
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,752
I have a basket full with sins
to discharge.

149
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:47,837
- And like we will look for it to him?
- Not you will have to look for it.

150
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,233
The bell of the death is listened
clearly in these mountains.

151
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,711
He listened to it.

152
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,709
But for that all these questions
on the Devouring of Sins?

153
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,047
Me...

154
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,585
...I need that the he/she helps me.

155
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,187
Turn you, Cadi.

156
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,326
He cannot make anything for you.

157
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,769
That happened in that bridge of the tree
fact this...

158
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,935
...and your you have to live your life with
it.

159
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,536
It is about making the well
from now on...

160
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,912
...and at the alone end you will have a stain.

161
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,286
Also, the one won't come for you
until your I finish sigh.

162
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,984
Then he/she would want to be dead.
In that way everything would have finished.

163
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,920
Be careful with what you want, Cadi.

164
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,931
God can hear you and to take the word.

165
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,258
You takes to my husband,
that not toward but that to complain.

166
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,837
Now, better you retract of that that
you said.

167
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,672
Not Mrs.. Not I can live with that that
I made.

168
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,477
I need to the Devouring of Sins
so that he/she already eats up my sins.

169
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:06,984
Please, Miz Elda, he/she could tell me
where he/she lives so that I can speak to him/her?

170
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,920
- Nina.
- Hello?

171
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,254
Just as their dad and their grandfather.

172
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,759
Kai is not happy
unless they are killing something.

173
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:28,602
- Mrs., I brought him/her some fresh meat.
- Were you fighting, young Kai?

174
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,369
No, Mrs..

175
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,869
A great idea on your behalf.

176
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,240
But not you that he/she has been put
to the youths of this valley...

177
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,980
...that they bring meat and flowers to one
old.

178
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,759
Squirrel meat?

179
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,963
You believed that we would make it speak
with squirrel meat?

180
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,365
Not believe that not you for that these here,
Cadi Forbes.

181
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,837
Perhaps you know. Perhaps not.

182
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,671
Do you believe that this is a game?

183
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,444
Ask to potato for the Devouring one of
Sins, and I take out myself flying of the porch.

184
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:16,920
He/she said that if he/she asked him/her again,
it would skin my back.

185
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,552
He/she said that their single mention
the demon attracts to a house...

186
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,786
...neither that to speak of looking at it, as your
you made.

187
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,193
Your you looked at it, truth?

188
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,557
If, Mrs..

189
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,335
In that were thinking?

190
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:41,178
Not I could avoid it, Miz Elda.
The form in that I speak Granny was.

191
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,409
It was listened very sad.
I speak as if he/she loved her.

192
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,117
And for a good reason.

193
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,988
After your grandfather died...

194
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:56,220
...your grandmother took an offering to her
it knocks down whenever he/she could.

195
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:01,865
A bundle of carrots,
half-dozen of ears, some eggs...

196
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:06,336
...and he/she left them there in their tomb, as
I give, for the Devouring of Sins.

197
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,765
None in this valley
I treat him with so much gracefulness.

198
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,440
Your grandmother if.

199
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,575
It got off the Dead's Montana...

200
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,775
- Montana of the Dead?
- Montana of the Dead?

201
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,520
That was not what I meant.

202
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,619
- It is hour that you two leave.
- If, Mrs..

203
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,024
If I find to the Devouring of Sins...

204
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:41,469
...and he/she eats up my sins,
does he/she suckle he/she forgot?

205
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,607
No, girl. She never forgot.

206
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,873
But perhaps it will be able to forgive.

207
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,123
The Devouring of Sins was
the only reason for which came, Cadi?

208
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,429
If, Mrs..

209
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,840
Next time won't be for that reason.

210
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,685
Who was taken my sins,
Cadi Forbes?

211
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,289
You see that you made.

212
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,832
He/she comes you well.
I hope you have broken the foot.

213
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,800
- Were you still?
- It is your blame, to spy me.

214
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,673
Not I wanted to get scared, Cadi.
I promise it, if it is not this way that die.

215
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,611
Be careful with what you want.

216
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,514
Will we go to the Dead's Montana or not?

217
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,653
- I want to speak to you first.
- On that?

218
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,997
It is that I have never seen that my potato
fear anything. Anything.

219
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,900
Except for the Devouring of Sins.

220
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,064
Well, I don't fear him/her
because you that the he/she would not harm me.

221
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,200
Perhaps already he/she harmed you when him
you looked.

222
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,039
Perhaps you didn't realize.

223
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,703
That you say?

224
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,813
First, you cannot take yourself it out of the
head.

225
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,445
He/she suckles he/she says that there are strong spirits
black for these mountains...

226
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,318
...that it is preferable not to bother.

227
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,856
Which spirits?

228
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,894
Perhaps that girl of which you spoke
be not what seems.

229
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,796
Lilybet is not a spirit.
She is my friend.

230
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:39,002
He/she looks, I sit down that your potato nagged you
for my blame...

231
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,808
...but I will look for to the Devouring of Sins
with you or without you.

232
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,349
He/she waits, I will go with you.

233
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:55,990
- Not you have to make it.
- If. I need to protect you.

234
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,594
It should have thousands of places
to hide here.

235
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:16,372
Perhaps he/she could bring to my old greyhound.
We can make him to leave.

236
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,505
The Devouring of Sins
it is not a rabbit, Fagan.

237
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,984
- Eat.
- That?

238
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,018
That you say?

239
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,855
You remember that that Miz Elda said
on the gifts that Granny left him/her?

240
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,760
After all maybe if it is
as catching a rabbit.

241
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,872
I have to leave.

242
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,706
It is the sign of Cleet
when potato me this looking for.

243
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,769
But there is even light.

244
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,942
Not I can. Pope would skin me
if it was for here.

245
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,722
Hurry and veto to house, Cadi Forbes.

246
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,016
When you finish fixing,
they come out and it finishes your tasks.

247
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,318
If, he/she suckles.

248
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,067
GORAWEN FORBES
JULIO 31 OF 1781 - JUNE 25 OF 1850

249
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,340
I have to be it to Fagan.

250
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,050
An outsider.

251
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,495
Listen to me when I call you, Mr..

252
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,123
He/she listens my sentence.

253
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,326
Because it is for you and alone for you that
prayer.

254
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,770
You are a God
that he/she doesn't find pleasure in the wickedness...

255
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,742
...and there is wickedness in these mountains.

256
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:57,042
Where you were?
For that didn't go to the cemetery?

257
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,048
Because my father you this giving bill
that I am lost the whole time.

258
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,456
Good, the wine, Fagan.

259
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,620
The Devouring one came to the tomb
and you takes the preserves that he/she leaves him/her.

260
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,459
Did you speak with the one?

261
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,665
Not exactly.

262
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,170
Let us stay as sleeping.

263
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,128
But you takes my gift. You that he/she made it.

264
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,674
For sure he/she made it.

265
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,801
Now silence. I want to hear the stranger.

266
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,284
.Mama!

267
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,419
For that took this
to the tomb of Granny?

268
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,654
Me...

269
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,133
Not you did think that I would follow you, Cadi?

270
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,205
Always these going to places
to those that you would not should.

271
00:41:53,744 --> 00:42:00,013
Now you are a thief. Also, to steal...

272
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,045
...to your own family!

273
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,380
No, he/she suckles. Me...

274
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,925
You never think before making the things.
For that?

275
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,119
.Fia!

276
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,567
That you have made?

277
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,559
.Angor!

278
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:15,180
There is an outsider camping
to the foot of the rapids of Narrows.

279
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,120
Kai says that he/she took charge of the one.

280
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,055
Which the danger is when allowing it to stay?

281
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,234
Kai says that this lunatic.

282
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:28,035
Also, there is not but earth for the one.
Not there is space.

283
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,232
It seems that Kai dictates all the rules
here.

284
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,708
Not speak bad of the, it Trusts.

285
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,713
Brogan and their family have always known
what is good for the valley.

286
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,444
We won't have anything
that to do with that stranger, of agreement?

287
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,503
Cadi?

288
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,508
That it happens, does he/she suckle?

289
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,042
I want to give you this.

290
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,712
This well. Take it.

291
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,263
That you will make with those preserves?

292
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,168
To keep them for the Devouring of Sins.

293
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:43,509
And if you take them to that lady of those
bees? She maybe knows where the one lives.

294
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,095
Devouring of Sins.

295
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,308
He/she Waits, Devouring of Sins.

296
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,146
.No! Not you should follow it, girl.

297
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,115
Leave me.

298
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,250
Devouring of Sins, he/she waits, please.

299
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:32,094
Devouring of Sins, he/she waits.
I won't leave until you speak to me.

300
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,991
Please. I need you.

301
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,703
You spoke that woman.
For that don't speak with me?

302
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:50,474
For that dared to look at myself
in the funeral of your grandmother, Cadi Forbes?

303
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,675
Because I need that you take yourself my
sins.

304
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,015
It is not made in that way.

305
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,753
Veto to house
and don't look for me another time again.

306
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,348
If you don't take yourself now my sins...

307
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,725
...then I will see that you can make it
in a way but appropriate.

308
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,159
Not I can continue living
with this pain inside my.

309
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,828
Not I can live knowing the pain
that I have caused all.

310
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,435
Devouring of Sins?

311
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,742
They come tomorrow.

312
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:30,045
The woman that you dressed, Bletsung MacLeod,
it showed you the one in route to the mountain.

313
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,119
Bring me the necessary thing for the ceremony...

314
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,387
...and we will see that it allows God.

315
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,359
And be what happens, you should promise me...

316
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,455
...that you will never return to this mountain.

317
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,024
I promise it.

318
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,563
I am here, girl.

319
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,801
Not ascend but.

320
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:29,341
I brought the wine and the bread, and the cloth
white.

321
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,647
Miz Elda was very kind in giving it to me.

322
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,011
Miz Elda should have thought it well.

323
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,121
She told me that it counted you something but.

324
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,388
He/she wants you to know
that he/she has not forgotten your name.

325
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,229
Please, give him/her my gratefulness.

326
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,899
If, Mister.

327
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:57,105
Now go to bed in the floor
and cover with the shroud...

328
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,900
...and maintain your very closed eyes.

329
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,151
Count me that sinned it is
the one that torments you.

330
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,387
My grandmother is you her sins
before dying?

331
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,993
No.

332
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,233
Then, if these of agreement,
I prefer not to pronounce my sins.

333
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:31,197
I absolve you now, Cadi Forbes,
so that you live a long and full life.

334
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:39,906
And for your peace, zeal my own soul.

335
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:05,464
Anything has changed. I feel same.

336
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,638
I sit down it, dear girl.

337
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:18,514
Please. You should say me.
As I liberate myself of that I made?

338
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,151
God willing I knew, Cadi Forbes.

339
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,515
God willing I knew.
