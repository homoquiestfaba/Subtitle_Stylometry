00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,448
Choices,

00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:53,275
choices, choices.

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,517
Hm.

5
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:57,413
Who do I want to be tonight?

6
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:02,206
Yeah. Tina Tarniquet.

7
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:04,551
Tina...

8
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:08,172
Tarniquet.

9
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:12,482
I wonder which band
they'll be going with tonight.

10
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,862
- Tara, you want anything...
- Aunt Rhonda! Can't you knock?

11
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:18,620
[chuckles]

12
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,137
Not again.
Aren't you a little old

13
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:23,344
to be crashing
Christmas parties?

14
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,689
And aren't you a little old
to be wearing skinny jeans?

15
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:27,758
I look good.

16
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,344
You should come with me.
It's gonna be a good one.

17
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,620
Better than the one
you went to last year?

18
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,655
You know, with Santa
and his shirtless reindeer?

19
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,413
Ooh, I think you're
talking about...

20
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,310
Claudia's Naughty Not Nice
Lingerie Trunk Show?

21
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,758
- Ooh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:45,689
- Remember this one?
- Mm-hm.

23
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,689
- That was so nice.
- Okay, those are cute.

24
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,424
But nothing will compare
to the birthday party

25
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,586
you threw me last year.

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,310
I still don't know
how you pulled it off

27
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:55,517
in 24 hours with no budget.

28
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,689
You know, you could be planning
these parties, hon.

29
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:01,517
But I have
a computer science degree.

30
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,172
If this plan to sneak into
the Everest

31
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,344
Christmas Party works out,

32
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,275
my dating app could be live
by next year.

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,482
Okay, I thought you were
givin' up dating

34
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:12,482
until you made
your first million.

35
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:14,551
Are we looking for love?

36
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:18,275
- I'm looking for a paycheck.
- I thought you liked your job.

37
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,344
I code operating systems
for dishwashers.

38
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,344
Do you know that last year,
consumers paid

39
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,931
over $5 billion on dating apps?

40
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:28,275
And Elliott Everest
is one of the most...

41
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,413
influential tech investors
in the country.

42
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:34,344
Why don't you just make
an appointment at his office?

43
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,551
No one like Elliott is going
to give someone like me

44
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:40,275
a second look unless I get
right in his face.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,803
You know, you're brave,
just like your mama.

46
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,689
You know, she would just
take off whenever, um...

47
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,724
- Yeah. Whenever work called?
- Okay.

48
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,137
- That's not what I meant to say.
- Mm-hm.

49
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:54,655
You know,
she's moving back to town.

50
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,517
- No.
- Maybe you guys can mend things.

51
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,896
You know, patch things up.

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,620
And maybe Santa can come down
the chimney

53
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:03,517
and leave Idris Elba
under my Christmas tree.

54
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,586
Tara, she's not as bad
as you think.

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,275
Of course not.

56
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,310
Because of her, I learned that
that the only person

57
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,724
I can depend on is myself.

Let me see what time it is.

61
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,965
Oh! Look at that.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,596
It's time for me to get ready,
and it's time

63
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,448
for you to leave my room! Bye!

64
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:27,310

Please close the door. Bye.

Shoot! Retinal scanners.

Oh! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,493
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Did I really just do that?

72
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:11,310
I designed it to be stain proof
for such tragedies.

73
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:15,448
- Oh, isn't that impressive?
- I'd like to think so.

74
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,481
So why are you leaving?

75
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,793
Uh, I misplaced my invitation.

76
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,586
And security is being
a little extra.

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,941
But they should be able
to find you

78
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:24,758
on the list though, right?

79
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:27,310
Yeah, but I mean, look at
that this line, you know, I'm...

80
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm in no mood to stand in line
with a bunch of people

81
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,758
hoping to be verified.
Not my problem.

82
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,275
Well, I don't believe in
problems. Only opportunities.

83
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,000
- Excuse me.
- Oh, um...

84
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,689
I could be your plus one.

lines either, Mr...

my panties are full price

- Great. Great.
- You're pretty good.

Yeah, well, the panty trick
is a great diversion,

to do it with.

Look, I'm sure that pretty-boy
charm has worked with you

116
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,034
quite well in life,
but I'm not the one.

117
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,724
- I apologize.
- No need.

118

Just making sure
we have an understanding.

119
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,931
Okay, we're in, but we're not
completely in the clear.

120
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,551
Luckily, I saw the wristbands
that they were handing out.

121
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:26,724
And I have a few bands
for such occasions.

122
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:31,137
So who are you and what are you
really doing here?

123
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,000
Can you keep a secret?

00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,724
My name is Tara
and I design apps.

125
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:40,172
Dating apps. I came to pitch
Lord Everest himself.

126
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,068
No way!
That's why I'm here, too.

127
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,551
- You design software?
- No. Fashion is my game.

I plan on showing my designs
to London Everest. She's the...

Ah. So you know she's a taste
maker in the fashion world.

I can finally get my big break.

- The struggle is real.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,896
It's just funny to meet
a complete stranger

00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:04,586
who's a friend in "the work."

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,448
Might say it's destiny.

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,941
Um, so what do you say
we work together

137
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,965

- Partners?
- Partners.

00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,724
- Ready? Okay.
- Let's go.

140
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,103
Oh, this way.

141
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong way.

142
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,655
Check-in is out there.

143
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,758
We already checked in.

He just had to use the bathroom.

145
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,000
- In the kitchen?
- Uh, we got lost.

00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,689
But now, we're headin' back
to our tables.

147
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,517
Where's your wristband, sir?

148
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,517
Oh, babe, did you leave it
at the table again?

149
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,241
Ugh, men, you can't take them
anywhere.

150
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,862
Which table?
And I'll escort you.

151
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,517
Not necessary.
But thanks anyway!

I'm afraid I'mma have to insist,
ma'am.

We're with London.
Hey, Lon! It's Tara!

00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,655
I'm ready to get this place
wrecked!

- Excuse me, honey.
- So you're actually not coming?

156
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,827
Babe, come on, you know I'm in
football training right now.

157
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,793
- What's her name?
- Ms. Everest...

158
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,793
Really, London? We're not going
down this road again.

159
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,724
The road of lies

160
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,620
leading directly
into skank town?

161
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,034
Mrs. Everest if I may...

162
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,665
I am sick and tired of
you always acusing me

163
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,310
of cheating

164
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:29,206
Until you learn to trust me, I
think we need to take a break.

165
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,620
No, Canyon! We're not doing this
back and forth again.

166
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,206
Either you're in or you're out!

167
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:40,102
Fine. Then I guess I'm out.

168
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,724
Fine! And for the record

169
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:46,137
you were never really
really inin to begin with.

170
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,965
- Ms. Everest
- What?!

171
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,620
These two claim to be your guests,
but I'm not sure they are properly

172
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:55,689
Well, well, London, we met at the
yacht party in San Tropez last summer.

173
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:58,000
You posted pics of us
and everything.

00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:02,206
- I did?
- It's me sweetheart.Tara.

175
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,793
- Oh, Tara?
- London. Ohh

176
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:08,931
Mwah. Mwah. You look so good in
green girl. Good to see you.

177
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,241
[laughter]

178
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:14,862
Oh, oh, is this your boyfriend?

179
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:19,034
Him? No.
This is Tre. He's my...

180
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,344
- Cousin.
- Mm-hm.

181
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,724
Um, single cousin.

182
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,758
Oh, I love my very single cuz!

183
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:26,355
Miss Everest, I need to make
sure that these two

184
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,931
are properly checked in, or
Mrs. Everest will have my hide.

185
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,344
- Sir, if you'll come with me.
- Uh, whoa.

186
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,758
Easy. This suit costs more
than most cars.

187
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,034
- Uh, run along, Maynard.
- But your mother...

188
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,931
I said, go.

189
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,620
Ma'am.

190
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,689
Why doesn't the help
just, like, help?

191
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:49,931
- Would be so much easier.
- Tell me about it.

192
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,965
- There was this salesboy...
- Soft yet strong.

193
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,103
Who, who is this?
Ricardo Cordero?

194
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:02,034
No, but I see you have on
the Ricardo Cordero pumps.

195
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,965
Gucci dress? No.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,724
- Ty Voss.
- Yes.

197
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:08,793
Ty's a personal friend of mine.

198
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,827
You know a lot about fashion.

199
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,620
It's what I live
and breathe for.

200
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,793
Why don't we get a drink

201
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,965
and I can tell you
more about me?

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,137
Okay. Let's go, guys.

203
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,137
[instrumental music]

204
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,206
Fillinger, many AR-based ideas
eventually become

205
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:37,724
fully functional mobile apps.

206
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:39,862
Listen, let's discuss this
later, Sapphy's mad enough

207
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:42,034
that I keep taking work
calls around her.

208
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,758
See you soon.

209
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,862
- Having a good time?
- Mm-hm.

210
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:51,206
Your, uh, face,
it's a little creamy.

211
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,758
Oh.

212
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,103
Little more? Mm.

213
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,068
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

214
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,689
You can have that.

215
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:08,275
- Oh, wait, uh, Mr. Everest?
- Elliott's fine? And you are?

216
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,793
I'm Tara, I'm a good friend
of your daughter's.

217
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,689
Oh, really?
She usually doesn't

218
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,793
invite friends
to things like these.

219
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,862
Maybe I'm not as dull
as she keeps telling me I am.

220
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,758
[laughs] I don't think you are.

221
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:22,965
- Have a food evening, Tara.
- Thank you.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,344
Oh, wait, don't go, um...

223
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,137
Ooh...

224
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:29,103
S-sorry, I just, I really wanna
show you something.

225
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:31,310
Okay.

226
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:33,286
Well, sir, it's this thing.
Well, it's not really a thing.

227
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,113
It's like a program. An app.
You know when you open your...

228
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,413
- Slow down. Breathe.
- Okay.

229
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,827
Is the app on your phone?
C-can you show me?

230
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:43,034
My phone? Yeah! I actually have
the beta test right here.

231
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,896
Um, so you...

232
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,068
Uh...

233
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:51,793
Of course, now it doesn't open,
right?

234
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:55,413
I mean, this damn wi-fi.
What is this place, Fort Knox?

235
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,724
Just call my office and pitch it
to my development team.

236
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,103
Okay.

237
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,758
God, please help me save this!

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,137
- Mr. Everest!
- Yes.

239
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,172
Hit the deck!

240
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,827
[crashing]

241
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,896
Oh, my God!
Darling, are you okay?

242
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:25,517
Nearly decapitated by these dumb
decorations you insisted on.

243
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:28,172
These are custom-made
one-of-a-kind designs.

244
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,344
Can we please not argue now?

245
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,206
And to think I was worried you
wouldn't have any fun tonight.

246
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,448
- Oh.
- It's not like that.

247
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:39,068
- This woman...
- Um, Tara.

248
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,379
Tara Aries.

249
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:44,034
This Tara Aries saved my life.

250
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:49,965
Well, I don't remember putting
a Tara Aries on my guest list.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,931
Tara's more of a nickname.
I'm a friend of London's.

252
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:56,758
- She invited me.
- No, I didn't.

253
00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:00,241
Yes, you did.
Back in St. Tropez.

254
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,551
Honestly I have no recollection
of who you are

255
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:08,482
or why I would ever invite you
to this bore-fest of a party.

256
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:10,310
No offense, daddy.

257
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,172
- Maynard!
- Right here, ma'am.

258
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:15,172
Would you please remove
these uninvited guests?

259
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:19,103
- Yes, ma'am. Sir.
- Come on.

260
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,379
Maynard, let them go.

261
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,965
This young lady
practically saved my life.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,413
And the way that you say thanks
is to throw them out?

263
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:37,034
Um, London, the reason you don't
recognize Tara is...

264
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:41,586
Sorry cuz,
because she got a nose job.

265
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,137
[Tara] You were actually the one
who recommended it.

266
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,413
My nose has always been perfect.

267
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,458
But that's why I told the doctor
to make mine look like yours.

268
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,931
Yeah, Tara's nose
was an absolute mess.

269
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,931
It was huge. Grotesque.

270
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,068
- Like an elephant.
- Actually, it wasn't that big.

271
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,034
I mean, children used to run
and hide for cover

272
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,103
under their beds for weeks
when she'd sneeze.

273
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,137
My cousin's such a kidder!

274
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,517
Let's get out of here and bolt
before they call the police.

275
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,344
Uh, b-but, Tre,
where are you going?

276
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,379
You know, my uncle once told me,

277
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,310
"Go where you are celebrated,
not where you are tolerated."

278
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:13,517
- Au revoir!
- Stop!

279
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:18,000
Did you say Uncle? And your last
name is Aries?

280
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:24,000
- Yes.
- So you're related to Calvin Aries?

281
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,172
Calvin!

282
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:29,206
Calvin Aries is my one of four
interior designers

283
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,931
Au revoir!
I keep on call.

284
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,275
I invited him to my brunch but

285
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,586
he's in Rio
for the next three months.

286
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,310
Yeah. You caught us. But really,
we must be going.

287
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,517
Calvin would kill me if he knew
I told his niece to leave.

288
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,965
Uh, please don't say a word.

289
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,000
My lips are sealed.

290
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,482
[upbeat music]

291
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,517
Oh!

292
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,172
Oh, that's my song!

293
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:56,241
I love this song!
Let's dance, darlin'!

294
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,965
You know I don't dance.

295
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:03,034
Mrs. Everest, you and me,
let's go.

296
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,344
Call me Sapphire. Mrs. Everest
is my mother-in-law.

297
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,344
[music continues]

298
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:40,275
When will I learn that I can't
depend on anyone but myself?

299
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,458
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to complain.

300
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,965
No, complaining is one of my

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,344
favorite past times.

302
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,034
What's troubling you?

303
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:50,310
Okay, well, every year,
I host an exclusive

304
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,724
Christmas Eve brunch,
and everyone who's anybody

305
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,413
in Atlanta wants to get
invited too.

306
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,586
That's the social event
of the Christmas season.

307
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,586
Yeah, well, this year,
it's going to be a disaster.

308
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,034
My caterer canceled.
And then my party planner quits.

309
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:05,758
Due to an ailment in her
you-know-where.

310
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:07,034
- Mm-hm, yes.
- Ooh!

311
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,172
I honestly have no idea

312
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,517
how everything just fell apart
on me so quickly.

313
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,379
I mean, my estate
isn't even decorated

314
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:16,551
because all of my designers
are unavailable.

315
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,241
I mean, why is the world turning
on me? What did I do?

316
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,172
Mrs. Everest, please calm down.

317
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,655
Maybe, maybe I can fill in.

318
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,413
[chuckles] That's sweet, Tara.
Thank you for offering.

319
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:31,448
But I need someone who can take
the reins of everything.

320
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:34,068
You know, the decorating,
the catering.

321
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:37,137
It's on a scale I don't think
you can handle.

322
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:41,241
Like on a scale of something...

323
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,103
like this?

324
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,724
I know all there is
to know about

325
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,068
throwing a Christmas party.

326
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,527
London, please, it's not really
that big of a deal.

327
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,482
It's a very big deal. Mother.

328
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:57,000
Look at Tre's suit.
Feel the material.

329
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:03,482
Um, ooh! What is that?
Adara? DiCecco?

330
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,689
Um, it's my design.

331
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:09,723
And Tre is going to design
a dress for me to wear

332
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,550
for your Christmas Eve brunch.

333
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,619
Why, how nice.

334
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,068
If I had to wear that

335
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,482
horrid thing from France
I brought. Ugh!

336
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:17,758
Gag me now.

337
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:22,310
You mean that $10,000
horrid thing?

338
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,172
Oh. I can't till you to waste
your own money one day.

339
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:28,655
So, um, Tara, what's the going
rate for a party planner?

340
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:32,689
- It varies, you know...
- Say 25K cash.

341
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:37,379
All expenses paid. You can stay
on-site at our estate.

342
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,689
You'll have full use of
all the amenities.

343
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:44,310
The pool. Chef. Masseuse.
What do you say?

344
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:47,689
Well, I'd say I think it's gonna
be a very Merry Christmas!

345
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:50,206
Yes! Yes! Cheers!

346
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,862
Cheers!

347
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,206
- Mother.
- Yes, yes.

348
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:01,931
Oh, uh, don't you think
you'll need Tre there?

349
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,862
You know, since he's making
London's dress and all.

350
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,862
Oh, but, of course.

351
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:09,413
That way, you could be with your
cousin at Christmas.

352
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:12,206
Perfect.
Tara can have my old room.

353
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:17,310
And Tre will sleep in the bed
right next to mine.

354
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:20,724
Oh.

355
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:23,344
What's this about house-guests?

356
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:27,482
Daddy, Tara will help mom
with her tiny party.

357
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:30,689
And Tre will design me
an even tinier dress

358
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,275
for mother's brunch.

359
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm not sure about this,
Sapphire.

360
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,896
A minute ago, you were mad
because I wanted her to leave.

361
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:44,310
Now you're mad
because I want her to stay!

362
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,310
Is that... I mean,
you are a piece of work.

363
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,379
- Don't even start...
- O-okay, mom. Dad.

364
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:52,517
I'm sorry, darlin', I just can't
believe all of this...

365
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,758
Ahem.

366
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,833
Tara, you sure you know
what you're getting us into?

367
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:00,586
You mean, a chance to win
their trust? You're welcome.

368
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,724
I don't know, it's one thing to
crash a party. But to plan one?

369
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,482
Well, I planned my Aunt Rhonda's
50th birthday and it was a hit.

370
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,275
I've crashed so many
parties that

371
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,941
planning and decorating this
one will be a piece of cake.

372
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,620
- Mm.
- Ooh!

373
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:18,758
It's gonna be easy.

374
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,827
- We didn't get caught.
- Mnh-mnh.

375
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:23,448
[Tara] Wait, where's Wise Man
number three?

376
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:24,803
I don't know,
I think he got mixed up

377
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:26,275
in the Kwanzaa decorations.

378
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,758
Well, I guess we could just
improvise

379
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,655
with one of the shepherds.

380
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:34,862
Maybe... a little scarf here.

381
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,379
And a necklace... there.

382
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,275
Voila.

383
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,517
Wait... Where is baby Jesus?

384
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,379
You're not supposed to display
the baby until Christmas Eve.

385
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,872
No one should see him
in the manger yet.

386
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,275
Oh, just like you never saw me
growing up?

387
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,482
Tara! Show some respect.
Diahann's still your mother.

388
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:08,689
How many times do we have to
go over this?

389
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,620
I never went to college
and I had a child to support.

390
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,758
When I finally got a sales job
that needed me to travel,

391
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,275
I had to take it,
luckily, Rhonda was able

392
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,827
to provide you
a stable childhood

393
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,379
until I could get on my feet.

394
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,241
So what, do you want me
to thank you for never

395
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,620
being there for me?
You know, Aunt Rhonda

396
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,689
was more of a mother to me
than you've ever been.

397
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,655
It hurt to watch
my sister raise you

398
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:31,000
while I was trying to make
a decent living.

399
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:32,482
Baby, if I could
change the past...

400
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:35,344
Why are you back
in Atlanta anyway?

401
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,275
A new job. And a good one.

402
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,793
Director of Communications
at a biotech firm.

403
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,517
Now that I'm back,
I-I hoped we could...

404
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,551
- Reconnect?
- Yeah.

405
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,310
No.

406
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,206
I'm not getting back
on this merry-go-round

407
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,965
that is your life.

408
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,689
Hope, then disappointment.

409
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:54,965
Trust, then more betrayal.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,620
Do you know I get
emotional whiplash

411
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,413
every time I think about you?

412
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:02,034
- Baby, I love you!
- If you love me, leave me alone.

413
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,862
I have a good life now.

414
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,551
In fact,
I'm gonna spend Christmas

415
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:09,586
with one of the most successful
families on the planet.

416
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,379
Even if you have to lie
to get there?

417
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:14,379
Tara, what kind of trouble
are you involved in?

418
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,551
I'm not in any trouble.

419
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,517
And even if I were,
I can get myself out of it.

420
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,044
Of all the things she could
inherit from you,

421
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:26,724
why does she get my stupid,
self-defeating stubbornness?

422
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:29,620
She'll come around.
Have faith.

423
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,482
You know she's right.

424
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,965
You definitely been more of
a mother to her than I have.

425
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,586
Look, you're my sister.

426
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,000
And I know the sacrifices
that you've made

427
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,655
that Tara couldn't possibly
understand. Okay?

428
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,448
I just hate that I've put
so much on you to step up.

429
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:48,931
- When I couldn't...
- Stop! Stop! Stop.

430
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,689
Don't you think it's time that
we start the healing process?

431
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,344
Sis, you've got to forgive
yourself first.

432
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:58,034
She'll come around eventually.

433
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,758
- Okay? Mm-hm.
- You're right, thank you.

434
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:04,413
All right. Go put little Baby
Jesus down, girl, help me.

435
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,655
Okay, so you pledged
Alpha at Howard.

436
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:12,482
After graduation you went
to FIT, New York.

437
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:15,103
And the you studied in Milan
for a year.

438
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,620
- Wait!
- No, that's right.

439
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,044
No, what if they ask how
we're related?

440
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,620
- My mom's side or yours?
- That's your bag.

441
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,655
After all, you already told them
our Uncle Calvin

442
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:23,931
is their interior designer.

443
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,793
I can't believe
I broke my own rule!

444
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,413
Never tell a lie
that someone can verify.

445
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,000
I guess we can just say
my dad's side?

446
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,044
Which could be the case because
he was never in my life.

447
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,034
Me neither. Or my mom.

448
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,344
Uh, I grew up in foster care.

449
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,103
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

450
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,896
My parents were great
and raised me as their own.

451
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,448
They're celebrating
the holidays in Mexico.

452
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:46,665
Don't you want to be with them?

453
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:49,034
The trip was my
anniversary present.

454
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,827
They got married on
Christmas Day 30 years ago.

455
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:55,896
Thirty years?
That's wonderful.

456
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,379
True story, they got engaged
less than a month

457
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:02,034
after they met,
real love at first sight stuff.

458
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:05,137
- Come on. Really?
- Yes, really!

459
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,182
You don't believe in
love at first sight?

460
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:09,965
I'm just too practical
for all that

461
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,482
star-crossed love stuff.

462
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,000
- No offense to your parents.
- Mm, none taken.

463
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:20,000
So, a-and this is just in case
the Everest's ask.

464
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,182
But, uh,
do you have a boyfriend?

465
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:22,724
Not right now.

466
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:24,551
I vowed to not get distracted
by boys

467
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,827
and all that drama
until my career's taken off.

468
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,148
Why does dating
have to be full of drama?

469
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:32,034
- Can't it just be fun?
- [London] Tre?

470
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:35,586
Oh, my God! Tre! Yoo-hoo!

471
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,827
London?
What're you doing here?

472
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:42,482
I came in to grab a cappuccino.
My psychic is right next door.

473
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:44,551
Well, she's really
a pet psychic.

474
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,034
But that still works for me

475
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,758
since, and you'll
never believe this,

476
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:51,931
she says I was a Pomeranian
in a former life.

477
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,413
Oh, I believe it. Absolutely.

478
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:57,172
She did a very special tarot
reading for me today

479
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,413
and guess who showed up
in my cards?

480
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:04,689
- Who?
- She didn't give an exact name.

481
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:07,137
Just that the man of my dreams
would declare his love for me

482
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,965
on Christmas Eve.

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,896
I have goosebumps.

484
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,976
Then we, uh, we gotta make sure
you're looking your best

485
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,068
for Mr. Right.

486
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:19,758
By the way, I told my publicist,
my Christmas Eve dress

487
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,965
is being designed
by a very talented

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,241
and very hot new designer.

489
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:27,655
He's already talked it up
to all the top

490
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,862
fashion culture sites and mags.

491
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,827
Your handmade designs
all over my body

492
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:36,206
will make quite the sensation.

493
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,137
That's incredible, London.

494
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,137
How can I ever thank you?

495
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,482
I'll come up with a list.

496
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,896
[clears throat] We'll be
at your house tomorrow.

497
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,724
Um, what's your address?

498
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:52,551
You're such a riot, Tre.

499
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:55,241
I will have my limo
come pick you up.

500
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,793
Limo?

501
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:03,206
Uh, in fact, um, the limo can
pick us both up from Tara's

502
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,586
so the driver doesn't have
to make more than one trip.

503
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,068
Uh, I'll text you the address.

504
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:10,310
Ooh! Wow, I'm late for my nails.

505
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,965
Why is being beautiful
so time-consuming?

506
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,034
I'll see you two tomorrow.

507
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,206
Ciao!

508
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,620
[fake laughter]

509
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:24,034
What's with all the attitude?

510
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,724
I feel like I was pretty nice
to a woman

511
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,931
who used to be a Pomeranian.

512
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:29,931
We still need her to like us.

513
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:33,827
Tara, London is my ticket
to a legitimate career.

514
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,965
A line of clothes,
branding, a store...

515
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,586
Okay!

516
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,655
Okay.
I'll play nice with the dog.

517
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,689
What's wrong?

518
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,551
Am I really gonna be able
to pull off

519
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,827
everything that I agreed to?

520
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,896
Not only is this challenging,
but...

521
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:55,827
but this could be dangerous
if-if I screw all this up.

522
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,896
You're not in this alone.

523
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:03,034
Remember the pact we made?

524
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:05,034
- Partners.
- Right.

525
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,586
Partners.

526
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,206
Oh, my.

527
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:16,793
Now I see why she doesn't want
to spend Christmas with me.

528
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,965
Come on in, Tre.
This is my Aunt Rhonda.

529
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,724
Now, can you tell her
how what we're doing

530
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:23,689
is not illegal
while I go get my coat?

531
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:29,000
[chuckles]
Uh, you have a lovely home.

532
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,310
Well, Tara decorated it.

533
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,000
She has an incredible eye.

534
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,113
Your praise means a lot
coming from the fashion designer

535
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:36,137
I've been hearing about.

536
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:38,379
- Is that one of your designs?
- This? Oh, no.

537
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:41,241
I mostly do couture. That's
where the real money's at.

538
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:44,310
Not that cash is the only reason
I got into fashion design.

539
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:48,310
It most certainly helps.
May I see your phone?

540
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:53,827
All right, thank you.

541
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,137
Okay.

542
00:26:57,862 --> 00:26:59,172
There you go.

543
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:01,413
If she needs my help,
you call me.

544
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:04,448
- She's like a daughter to me.
- She's very lucky to have you.

545
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:09,103
I'm lucky to have her.
She's a remarkable young woman.

546
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:10,862
I'm beginning
to figure that out.

547
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:13,417
What're you two
conspiring about?

548
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,113
Oh, I'm just warning him
how you're nothing

549
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:17,448
but trouble and aggravation.

550
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:19,000
Ah!

551
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:23,206
[Tre] Wow.
Our chariot has arrived.

552
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,034
- Oh, wow.
- Let me help you with that.

553
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:27,413
Oh, no, no, you don't need
to help me with my bags.

554
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,068
Okay, forgive my niece.

555
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:32,172
She has never seen
a gentleman in the wild before.

556
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,965
You don't need to worry
about me.

557
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,379
Yes, I do. Unless, of course,

558
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,034
you wanna give
the job to someone else.

559
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:42,172
Because, I know somebody
who really wants it.

560
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:45,103
I don't have time to argue
about that woman anymore.

561
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:47,758
Then don't argue.

562
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:51,172
- Just meet your mom half-way.
- Mm.

563
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:54,413
A third of the way?
A hop, skip, and a jump away?

564
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:57,275
Have a Merry Christmas.
I love you.

565
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,241
Wish me luck.

566
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,000
- Bye.
- Bye, darlin'.

567
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,344
[instrumental music]

568
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,206
[whispering]
Oh, boy.

569
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:25,827
Cookies? Thank you.

570
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:27,896
- Thanks.
- Mm.

571
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:29,793
Wow.

572
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:31,862
Pinch me and say
it's not a dream.

573
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:34,206
- It's not a dream.
- Not... [laughs]

574
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:37,413
- I'm ticklish.
- Good morning!

575
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,965
Yeah, you must be
London's friends.

576
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,172
I'm her grandmother, Carolina.

577
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,793
I'm Tara and this is Tre.

578
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,448
You two make such a cute couple.

579
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:50,000
How long have you been dating?

580
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:51,413
Oh, we're not,
we're not together.

581
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:55,344
- We're cousins.
- Oh. Mm.

582
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:59,034
Mm-hm. Cousins.

583
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,044
We can't touch like that
anymore, last thing we need

584
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:02,907
is Sophia from the Golden Girls
figuring us out.

585
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,034
Remember, it's business,
not pleasure.

586
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:09,000
[both clearing throat]

587
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,965
Nice.

588
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, wait, I, uh...

589
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:21,482
I got something for you.

590
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:24,068
Here you go, it's a tip.

591
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:33,000
Just gonna try just a little.

592
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:40,172
[sniffs]
Oh, I gotta get me some of this.

593
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:41,931
[Sapphire] Tara!

594
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,965
I only used a little bit,
I swear.

595
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,827
Oh, please, use all of it!
My home is your home.

596
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:50,482
Thank you. Okay, should we get
into party planning?

597
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:51,907
- I already made a list of...
- Oh, darling.

598
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,044
Before we get into all that,

599
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:54,965
why don't you and Tre

600
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,241
join us for a light lunch?

601
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,241
- Say a half hour.
- Okay.

602
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:00,034
Give you a chance
to slip into something

603
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:02,137
a little more... appropriate.

604
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,448
Okay.

605
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,413
"Appropriate?"

606
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:17,551
Oh, how lovely you look.
Come, sit next to me!

607
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:19,103
Okay.

608
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,034
Ow! Ooh! [groaning]

609
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,586
Here, easy, I got you.

610
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,907
Okay, okay,
you're makin' a scene.

611
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,137
I'm fine, I'm up. Oh!

612
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:39,310
I'm here. We can start now.

613
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,241
- Ahem. Um...
- Oh.

614
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:53,931
- Sorry, am I in your way?
- Not anymore.

615
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,965
You gonna rearrange the
living room while you're at it?

616
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:02,000
- Tre.
- Oh.

617
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,965
Smile.

618
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,172
Thank you.

619
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:13,000
Thank you.

620
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,413
- Tara, aren't you hungry?
- Absolutely.

621
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,241
But, um, do you happen to have

622
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:24,965
any wings in the back
or something like that?

623
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,275
[clears throat]

624
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Kidding, just kidding, I just...

625
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:32,862
I just love, um...

626
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,586
- Foie gras.
- Of course.

627
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,310
I just didn't recognize it
prepared in this style.

628
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,068
Do you know foie gras
is one of my favorite dishes?

629
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:44,310
- I'm just gonna dig in.
- Mm! Mine, too!

630
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,862
Not many people appreciate
fatty goose liver.

631
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:50,931
Can we talk about the party?

632
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:53,344
We only have three days
to get everything together

633
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,034
and it has to be luxurious.

634
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:56,896
Young lady,
now are you sure you're not in

635
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:59,241
just a little over your head?

636
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:02,137
Mother Everest,
Tara is an Aries.

637
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,068
I'm a Sagittarius. Who cares?

638
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:08,965
Her uncle is Calvin Aries.
My decorator.

639
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,344
Oh, I see. Tara, do you spend
a lot of time with your uncle?

640
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,137
Mm, not as much as I'd like to.

641
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:17,562
I just hope there's enough time
to source out

642
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,034
all these decorations.

643
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,517
Oh, the garage is full
of everything

644
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,655
the decorators have used
over the years.

645
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:25,655
Elliott, can you show her
where it's at after lunch?

646
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,034
Elliott?

647
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:31,344
Uh...

648
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,241
This is business, Sapphire.

649
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,172
I can't just ignore
these people.

650
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,103
Why not?
You ignore me.

651
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:43,172
And now Christmas has officially
switched to Def Con 2.

652
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:45,551
Tara, it would be my pleasure
to show you

653
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:48,517
where we store the decor.

654
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,344
Okay, I guess I'll just change
clothes again.

655
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:55,482
- Oh, uh, I'll help.
- Okay.

656
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,172
But you haven't even finished
your lunch.

657
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:01,758
Uh, trust me, a little of this
liver goes a long way.

658
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,137
Uh, excuse me.

659
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,724
It's foie gras.

660
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,724
[Elliot] Well, here it is.

661
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,275
Every decoration for the past
ten years.

662
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,206
Or 20.

663
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:19,551
[both] Oh!

664
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,517
It's not that much of a mess,
is it?

665
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,517
[both] Unh-unh.

666
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,217
[Elliot] I've been begging
Sapphy to throw all this

667
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:27,758
stuff out for years, but
every time I try to tell her...

668
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:30,413
Tell me what?

669
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,793
For you to throw out
all this junk.

670
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,344
Oh, our memories are junk now,
are they?

671
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:39,482
Dear, what can I help you with?

672
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,103
I came out here to ask Tara

673
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:44,206
how she's going to trim
the family Christmas tree.

674
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,655
I think that's where
we should start

675
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,793
since we're so behind
with the decorating.

676
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,310
That being said, don't you think
the family Christmas tree

677
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:53,172
should be decorated
by the family?

678
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:56,310
Thank you! I've been trying
to tell Sapphy this for years.

679
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:58,344
I loved decorating the tree
when I was a kid.

680
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:01,517
But the big tree needs to be
decorated by the professionals.

681
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,275
[Tara] Of course,
I'll do whatever you want.

682
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,758
However, I do think it'd be a
great conversation piece

683
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,517
to tell your guests
how much the tree means

684
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:08,688
to you and your family.

685
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:11,447
Oh, you mean do it ourselves?

686
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,275
Yes!

687
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,241
Maybe this Christmas, we could
start to act like a family.

688
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:18,757
And... I'll put away my phone.

689
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:22,688
Deal.

690
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:30,585
Tara Aries, you are intuitive
and a born mediator.

691
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,068
I like it.

692
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,585
Keep it up.

693
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,724
I think he really likes me!

694
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:46,688
[laughing]

695
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:49,103
[Sapphire] Oh, yes, good, yes.

696
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:55,724
- Everything okay, Carolina?
- Yes, dear.

697
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:59,103
I'm just surprised at what
I'm hearing in here, laughter.

698
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,758
[laughter]

699
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:03,241
Ooh!

700
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:07,379
Look who's under the mistletoe.

701
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:09,620
Aren't we a bit old for that?

702
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,137
Uh-oh.

703
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,310
Mm, knew that wouldn't last.

704
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:26,517
They used to be so affectionate.

705
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:28,344
Lately, my son's way
of showing affection

706
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:31,206
is just lookin' up
from his phone at her.

707
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:34,206
[instrumental music]

708
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,793
Oh!

709
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,758
Look, I found a mistletoe.

710
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,137
Oh.

711
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:51,137
They're quite the couple, huh?

712
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:52,872
Yeah, I think we're out of
tinsel, I'm gonna go see

713
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,137
if there's more in the garage.

714
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:56,872
I need to get back to workin'
on your dress.

715
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:58,620
It's not gonna sew itself, so...

716
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,344
- Yeah, but it's really...
- Yep.

717
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,896
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

718
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:11,793

724

Hey.

725
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:26,448
What have you done
to my staircase?

726
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:29,379
- Is it too much?
- Yes.

727
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:32,482
- Which is why I love it!
- Okay, good. Okay, good.

728
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:34,596
Because there's more. Carolina,
would you do the honors?

729
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,275
Sure, okay.

730
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:41,310
- Ooh!
- Elliott, you're missing it!

731
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,965
- Oh, where's London?
- Oh.

732
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,896
Her and the designer, they're a
doing fitting for her new dress.

733
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:49,275
Although I have a feeling she's
checking out his sizes, too.

734
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,965
[Sapphire laughing] Well, at
least London is getting her mind

735
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,586
off of that terrible
Canyon fellow.

736
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,413
- Canyon?
- London's ex-boyfriend.

737
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,320
[Sapphire] They've called their
relationship off and on

738
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:03,655
so many times I gave up trying
to keep up on their status.

739
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:07,517
Now that's how you do Christmas!
Remarkable job.

740
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:09,862
[Tara] Thank you, so now that
most of the decorations

741
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,700
are out of the way, I was
thinking I could get started

742
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,275
on the brunch menu
with Sapphire.

743
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,758
Ooh, I'm too pooped to think.

744
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:17,551
Why don't you write up your
suggestions

745
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:18,931
and then show me in the morning?

746
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:22,034
I want at least a dozen options
for each course.

747
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,034
- I can do that in my sleep.
- Oh.

748
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:26,413
You're so much like
your Uncle Calvin.

749
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:28,620
Always going above and beyond
what everyone expects.

750
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:33,310
[Tara] No, no, no, no, no. You
go have fun with your family.

751
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,724
Do all that Christmas
tradition stuff.

752
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:37,896
Enjoy the simple moments
you can never get back.

753
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,758
Christmas carols. Baking
cookies. Playing games.

754
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:42,827
Games? What kinds of games?

755
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:45,758
Uh, all the games that I saw
upstairs in the game room.

756
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:48,275
I totally forgot
we have that up there.

757
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,551
That's a marvelous idea,
darling!

758
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:56,344
I thought you were bonkers when
you hired someone you just met

759
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:58,620
to move in and plan your party.

760
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:02,068
But I was the one crazy
to question your judgment

761
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:03,655
in the first place.

762
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:06,482
[chuckling]
Mm-hm.

763
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:11,000
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

764
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:18,000
- Oh!
- Mm.

765
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:21,034
You look... good in feathers.

766
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,965
Well, thank you
for lending it to me.

767
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,448
- What's this for?
- Excuse the cheesy pun.

768
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:31,586
- But spill the tea.
- On what?

769
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,379
On Tre.

770
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:38,448
I need all the information
you have to make him jealous.

771
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,689
Him?

772
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:43,793
Uh, I meant them.

773
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,586
The world.

774
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,655
I want the world to know
I've found the man of my dreams.

775
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,068
Wow.

776
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,758
You must really like him, huh?

777
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:58,413
I need him more than
you could imagine.

778
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:03,034
I keep forgetting
you two are related.

779
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:05,413
I forget sometimes, too.

780
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:08,034
So what's he really like?

781
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:09,931
Well, he pledged Alpha
at Howard.

782
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,034
After graduation,
he went to FIT...

783
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,448
No! Oh, God, no!
Not his resume.

784
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:19,655
Who is he? What do you like
best about Tre?

785
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:24,482
I love his sense of humor.

786
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:28,896
He can take the most stressful
situation and make it fun.

787
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,000
Like he finds...

788
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,586
Did I say something wrong?

789
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,931
It's obvious you adore him.

790
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:41,689
- Lucky for me, he's your cousin.
- Right.

791
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,827
Otherwise, we'd have
some major competition.

792
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:46,931
Oh, believe me,
no competition here.

793
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:49,137
I mean, look at you. Rich.

794
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:52,931
Gorgeous.
Social Media Influencer.

795
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:54,827
What man wouldn't
fall in love with you?

796
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,931
You're right.

797
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:07,793
I am quite a catch, aren't I?

798
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:12,724
- Oh!
- Ooh...

799
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:16,000
Uh, let me go get the slippers
that match

800
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:18,413
your little jammies.

801
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:21,103
I didn't have time
to get a pedicure.

802
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,620
[Tre] Don't feel ashamed,
vanity is actually

803
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,172
a very empowering emotion.

804
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:39,517
I'm not vain, uh, I'm just...

805
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,620
undecided on which
face lotions to use.

806
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:45,724
That's why I dropped by.

807
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:47,758
London said the good stuff's
in here.

808
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:51,872
Yeah, so you and London seem
to really be hitting it off.

809
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:53,862
- Huh?
- You okay with that?

810
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,034
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

811
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:57,862
I don't know,
I thought maybe I sensed

812
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,482
a little jealousy
when she kissed me.

813
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:03,034
I'm not jealous.
Besides, you kissed her back.

814
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:05,517
No, I didn't.

815
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:07,482
[London] Ha! Ooh!

816
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,482
You have to come and get it!

817
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:12,862
Come on, Big Ben.
London's calling!

818
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:16,827
Oh, yeah, you can't catch me.

819
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,689
Ooh, you're fast.

820
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,931
You're gonna chase me.

821
00:41:23,103 --> 00:41:25,517
So why are you talking to me?

822
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:28,655
Go tell him how you feel
right now.

823
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, unfortunately, this London
chick is gaga over him.

824
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:35,482
You know, he might be more
gaga over you

825
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:37,655
if he knew how you felt!

826
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:40,793
Oh, okay, okay,
this makin' sense now.

827
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:43,689
This whole self inflicted dating
drama

828
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:46,551
has nothing to do with your
career aspirations.

829
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,172
It's because you're afraid he's
gonna say "No".

830
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:52,517
Just like you scared
to pitch your app.

831
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,551
What No!

832
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,758
No, that's crazy, look...

833
00:41:56,793 --> 00:41:58,862
It's simply about timing, okay,
with Tre

834
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,034
- and the app
- Ok girl,

835
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,689
If that helps you sleep.

836
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,206
Look, either way you better
get on both that app

837
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:07,724
and the one that's getting away.

838
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,103
It's almost Christmas Eve,

839
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:11,241
and after that
it's gonna be over.

840
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,862
Okay.

841
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,068
Okay, I'm gonna tell him.

842
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,655
I'm gonna let Tre know
how I feel.

843
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,034
Good! Cause you've already
risked

844
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:21,137
so much already...

845
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,586
for your plans to fall apart.

846
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,862
And, uh, that way, I can oversee

847
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:31,113
Bragg's Catering when they
show up in the morning.

848
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:32,620
Wait a minute.

849
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,010
You're not talking about
Michael Bragg?

850
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,793
- Mm.
- What? I checked.

851
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:37,620
He's completely booked.

852
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,586
Well, he was.
But I changed his mind.

853
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:44,310
I must say, Tara.

854
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:47,034
You are obviously born
to do this.

855
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:48,793
The party isn't for
another two days

856
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:51,034
and we're way ahead of schedule.

857
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,689
- Tara? Everything okay?
- Yeah.

858
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:56,931
A-and I really appreciate
the compliment.

859
00:42:56,965 --> 00:43:00,344
But I was born
to design software.

860
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,620
It's not that I don't love
party planning.

861
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:04,689
But I just really wanted
to make something

862
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:06,655
that brings people together.

863
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:10,275
After all, love, romance, and...

864
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,793
and building a family is
the lifeblood of civilization.

865
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:17,000
That's what motivated me
to make a dating app.

866
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:19,862
You're kidding me.
That's what my husband does.

867
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:22,862
Well, the apps, not dating.

868
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:25,620
At least, he better not be.

869
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:27,206
Darling, did you know
that Tara creates

870
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,206
those cute apps for phones?

871
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,379
Yeah, yeah,
she told me at the party.

872
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:34,896
Actually, uh, I didn't get to
tell you everything.

873
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,068
'Cause we had
gotten interrupted...

874
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:39,758
Kobe!

875
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:42,310
I really can't stand
playing you.

876
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,724
- Tara, you wanna play?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure!

877
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:47,655
And then maybe after we can talk
about my dating app? There's...

878
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,103
Oh, wait. I gotta take this.

879
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:51,631
Table those thoughts
for a minute, okay, Tara?

880
00:43:51,655 --> 00:43:53,217
- Okay. Yeah.
- Circle back around to it.

881
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:55,689
- Yes. Sure. Of course.
- Tre!

882
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:57,137
Take on your cousin.

883
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:59,241
A real player knows
when to leave the game.

884
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:04,379
Ah, I'll take on Tara.

885
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:08,206
It's really rare
I get any competition.

886
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:12,931
- Let's do it.
- All right.

887
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:14,689
Oh! Oh, wow.

888
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:19,862
Oh. Okay.

889
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,206
[gasps]

890
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,034
What is your deal?

891
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,862
It's just a game, Tara!

892
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:35,241
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:39,310
- I guess I got carried away.
- Mm-hmm.

894
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,206
- Mm.
- Excuse me.

895
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:46,310
Just a...

896
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,034
Tara, what's going on?

897
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,344
- I don't know my own strength?
- No.

898
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:58,344
I feel like this is about
something else.

899
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:03,941
I've been trying all day to
think of a good way to say this.

900
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:06,965
And... I guess I'm scared.

901
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:11,137
You don't need to be.

902
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,862
Ask for what you want
and you'll get it.

903
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:18,275
Okay. Here I go. Tre...

904
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,448
You don't have to do it now.

905
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:22,206
You should tell him
at the party.

906
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,931
Elliott.

907
00:45:25,965 --> 00:45:28,034
I know you're upset
because he rejected your idea,

908
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:30,034
but the party is the ideal time.

909
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:31,976
He'll be surrounded by
all of his investor friends

910
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,413
so when you pitch your app,

911
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:35,931
it will look good
for both of you.

912
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:37,379
And don't worry.

913
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,931
I'll smooth things over
with London.

914
00:45:39,965 --> 00:45:41,793
You just concentrate on Elliott.

915
00:45:41,827 --> 00:45:43,034
Okay.

916
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:47,000
Remember, it's business,
not pleasure.

917
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:50,862
Of course. Right. Gotcha.

918
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:55,379
- Oh. Hi.
- Uh-huh.

919
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:59,241
You sure you wanna
go back out there?

920
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:01,896
Yes, I think I should go
apologize to London

921
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,413
for being so competitive.

922
00:46:03,448 --> 00:46:05,103
She'll get over it.

923
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,448
Besides, it'll be good for her.
You thirsty?

924
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:11,137
- Not really. I just...
- You might be thirsty. Mm-hmm.

925
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:16,000
My grandfather drank a shot
of this every day

926
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:19,862
with his oatmeal,
and lived to be 99.

927
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:22,827
Mm-hmm.
So we're going to...

928
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:25,413
- Oh, that's good.
- Ah, ah-ha. Don't tell me.

929
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:28,448
Mm-hmm. All right.

930
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,827
- Cheers! Mm-hmm.
- Cheers!

931
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:35,000
[coughs]

932
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,034
It's a shame
you can't spend Christmas

933
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:39,379
with the rest of your family.

934
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:42,344
I mean, besides Tre.

935
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,034
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't have much family

936
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,482
to spend it with anyway. So...

937
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,103
No mom or dad?

938
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:50,206
Well, I haven't seen my dad
in ever.

939
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,275
And my mom, let's just say
we don't get along

940
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,965
as well as you and your son do.

941
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,482
Elliott and I didn't always
get along.

942
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:01,655
Mm, I used to be
so critical of him.

943
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:05,034
I warned him he was making
all the wrong choices.

944
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:07,068
Obviously, he proved me wrong,

945
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:09,241
which made me
even more mad at him.

946
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:10,620
So I stopped talking to him.

947
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:12,517
For five years!

948
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:15,068
Me and my stupid pride.

949
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:17,896
Well, what changed?

950
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:20,344
One day, he invited me
for dinner.

951
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,034
He just wanted to talk,
and I listened.

952
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:29,413
And we learned each other
all over again.

953
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:33,413
And today, he's not just my son.
He's my best friend.

954
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:35,896
That's nice, but I don't think
my mother and I will

955
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,034
ever have a relationship
like that.

956
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:39,655
Mm.

957
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:42,448
Take it from someone
who learned the hard way,

958
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:46,344
anger is a very
overrated emotion.

959
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:48,517
And you only get one family
in this lifetime.

960
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:54,137
Besides, I heard why you created
your dating app.

961
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:58,241
And I admire someone that values
relationships and love.

962
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:01,241
Which is why I don't think
you wanna shut your mom

963
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:03,724
out of your life forever.

964
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:08,206
Maybe I don't, but shouldn't
she be making the first move?

965
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:11,137
Wait.
I guess she did.

966
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:13,689
Mm-hmm. You don't have to
forgive your mom.

967
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,620
Just listen.
Give her a chance.

968
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:20,310
There's nothing to fear.

969
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:24,000
After all, you were brave enough
to sneak in here

970
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:28,172
and win favor with
not just my son, his wife, too.

971
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:31,103
And Sapphire don't like anybody.

972
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:34,172
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

973
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,655
I've pulled a few fast ones
in my day, too.

975
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:40,700
- Oh, I don't need another shot.
- Look, girl this is... Uh-huh.

976
00:48:40,724 --> 00:48:42,931
- Look, girl. Uh-huh.
- Yes, ma'am

[mellow music]

978
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:49,206
Just call her. Just call her.
Just call her. Okay.

[line rings]

980
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:00,344
[Diahann on phone] Hello?
[Tara on phone] Um, mom?

981
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:02,551
- Tara?
- Hey.

982
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:07,137
- Am I, am I bothering you?
- You're not a bother, Tara.

983
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,758
You never were, baby.

984
00:49:11,275 --> 00:49:17,034
Look, uh... I just wanted
to say that, uh...

985
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:19,689
I...

986
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:24,379
I know that...

987
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:29,620
Tara?
Hello, are you there?

988
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:33,758
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

989
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:36,413
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, Tara...

00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:56,724
- [Tre] Tara.
- Hey. Come in.

994
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:03,137
So I got good news and bad news.

995
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:04,689
The bad news is

996
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:06,284
London wants me to
make her a new dress.

997
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,103
She wants something more
provocative.

998
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:11,000
But the good news is,
she wanted to offer this to you.

999
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,517
What's wrong?
You don't like it?

1000
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:16,137
No, no, it's stunning.

1001
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:19,379
I'm just, just kinda
over myself at the moment.

1002
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:22,344
So it's gonna be
that kind of night.

1003
00:50:23,793 --> 00:50:25,137
What kind of night?

1004
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:29,241
- A "Come to Jesus" night.
- Oh, my God.

1005
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:32,344
Appropriate since
it's almost Christmas.

[liquid pouring]

1007
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,655
- Talk to me.
- Thanks.

1008
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:46,620
I always thought
my mom was the villain

1009
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,172
'cause she was never there
for me.

1010
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:53,034
And now that she wants
to be back in my life...

1011
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,655
Isn't that a good thing?

1012
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:56,793
I spent years pushing her away

1013
00:50:56,827 --> 00:50:59,068
and protecting my heart.

1014
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:00,562
And I just don't know
if I will ever be

1015
00:51:00,586 --> 00:51:02,241
ready to let her in,

1016
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:04,689
even though, rationally,
I know I should.

1017
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:06,551
Don't rush into
reconciling a relationship

1018
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:07,793
you're not ready for.

1019
00:51:07,827 --> 00:51:09,517
Yeah, but will I ever be ready?

1020
00:51:09,551 --> 00:51:12,862
Well, why do I always
overthink everything?

1021
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:15,137
You're just keeping
your options open.

1022
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,413
My mother comes back to town

1023
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:19,137
practically on her
hands and knees

1024
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:20,586
begging me for another chance,

1025
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,206
and I hang up the phone.

1026
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,586
I feel so lame.

1027
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:32,137
So lame that the first time
you went to the club

1028
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,517
you wore church clothes?

1029
00:51:34,517 --> 00:51:36,793
That was me.

1030
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,379
Well, sure, you looked cute.

1031
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:40,344
To my grandma's friends, maybe.

1032
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:42,793
I had no fashion sense
back then.

1033
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:45,379
You know what,
I think I can beat that. Yeah.

1034
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:48,551
My Aunt Rhonda told me
the 80's were back

1035
00:51:48,586 --> 00:51:51,137
and convinced me to wear
stirrup pants to school.

1036
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:54,068
So I walk in all confidently,
and I get detention

1037
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:56,113
because the principal said
I looked like a prostitute.

1038
00:51:56,137 --> 00:51:58,172
[Tara] Yeah. [laughs]

1039
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:01,172
Go ahead. Get it off.
Yeah, I know. I won.

1040
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:03,655
- You did.
- I won.

1041
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:09,275
Look, as for your mom...
give her a chance.

1042
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:13,172
I would hate for her
to not witness the amazing woman

1043
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:14,758
you've turned out to be.

1044
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:17,793
To you.

1045
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,413
To us.

1046
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:28,793
[Tara] I'm like, oh,
you don't get anymore.

1047
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:32,793
Okay, wait, so you're telling me
your first kiss

1048
00:52:32,827 --> 00:52:36,310
was with a girl named Mildred?

1049
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:38,586
What, what was she, 80?

1050
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,310
It was a family name. You?

1051
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:45,137
His name was Sylvester.

1052
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,931
- Wait, he was black?
- Yeah.

1053
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,379
And I thought he was so hot.

1054
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:54,241
He looked like,
like a young Carlton.

1055
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,482
- From the Fresh Prince?
- Mm-hmm.

1056
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:01,448
The original or the reboot
version?

1057
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,379
Original Carlton all the way.

1058
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:05,827
I was wrong,

1059
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:07,551
You are lamer than me.

1060
00:53:07,586 --> 00:53:09,862
I'm just being honest.

1061
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,896
I am, too!

1062
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,620
In fact, I've never been this
honest with

1063
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:15,586
in my entire life.

1064
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:25,862
Most girls aren't impressed
by the guy who spends more time

1065
00:53:25,896 --> 00:53:29,275
in the sewing room
than at the gym or the club.

1066
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,827
Well, then, I guess
I'm not most girls.

1067
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,827
- [laughs]
- No, you're not.

1068
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:40,586
It's getting late.

1069
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,862
Maybe we should both
get some rest.

1070
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:44,862
The party is in two days,
and we still have to...

1071
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:46,448
Whoa.

1072
00:53:47,655 --> 00:53:49,448
Everything's spinning.

1073
00:53:49,482 --> 00:53:52,344
Ah, just stay here
until it stops.

1074
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,206
You're good.

1075
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,517
[sighs]

1076
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:02,827
Thanks.

1077
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:05,655
For what?

1078
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:08,448
For everything.
Crashing the party.

1079
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,896
Bringing me along.

1080
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:12,896
I haven't had this much fun
or been this relaxed

1081
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:16,275
with someone in...

1082
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,448
well, ever.

1083
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:20,655
Mm.

1084
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:24,551
- Tre?
- Mm.

1085
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:28,517
Remember when I said I didn't
believe in love at first sight?

1086
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,655
Well...

1087
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:38,965
I didn't believe in love
at first sight.

1088
00:54:40,379 --> 00:54:41,931
Until I met you.

1089
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:47,482
That sounded so corny. Huh.

1090
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,379
Tre?

1091
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:55,586
Tre?

1092
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,000
[mellow music]

1093
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:08,620
[birds chirping]

1094
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,965
[Tara sighs]

1095
00:55:16,758 --> 00:55:18,482
[giggling]

1096
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:22,000
[instrumental music]

1097
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:29,034
Tre?

1098
00:55:30,758 --> 00:55:32,620
Tre?

1099
00:55:32,655 --> 00:55:33,862
What?

1100
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:37,000
I think you should wake up.

1101
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:45,724
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

1102
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:48,482
Ah, di-di-did we...

1103
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,769
Ah, of course not! Because we,
we still have our clothes on.

1104
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:52,931
Tara, you don't have to
take your clothes off to...

1105
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:54,655
- [knock on door]
- [London] Tara?

1106
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:57,931
Is Tre in there with you?
I can't find him.

1107
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:01,517
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1108
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:04,862
Ah, no.
No Tre in here.

1109
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:06,931
Are you sure?

1110
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:08,551
I've been looking everywhere.

1111
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:10,655
I can't find him.

1112
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:11,931
What?

1113
00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:14,137
Tell her I needed more fabric.

1114
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:16,758
Tre went out to see a mechanic.

1115
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:20,689
What? Why would he need to see
a mechanic?

1116
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:24,172
Did I say mechanic?
Did I say mechanic?

1117
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:29,517
No, what I meant to say was,
he's, uh, he's, he's...

1118
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:32,103
Fabric.

1119
00:56:32,137 --> 00:56:35,413
Tre went to get more fabric.

1120
00:56:35,448 --> 00:56:36,827
Yeah, tons and tons of fabric.

1121
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,551
He was just like,
"I need fabric."

1122
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,068
It's fine.

1123
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:43,137
If you speak to Tre,

1124
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:46,862
remind him,
the party's in 24 hours!

1125
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:50,862
Consider it done.

1126
00:56:50,896 --> 00:56:52,068
Ugh.

1127
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,551
[Tara] You can come out now.

1128
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:01,793
- [laughing]
- Oh, my gosh.

1129
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:08,000
- A mechanic? Really?
- Yes.

1130
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:10,517
Yeah. I turn into
such a blubbering idiot.

1131
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:12,103
This is just one of
the many reasons

1132
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,931
that it is pointless for me
to pitch my app to Elliott.

1133
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,965
I just don't get you at times.

1134
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,793
You can be so bold
and confident, and then this.

1135
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:22,517
Yeah, I can crash a party,
create an app,

1136
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:24,827
do almost anything,
but I turn into an idiot

1137
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,079
when it comes to
pitching my work.

1138
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:27,862
With that attitude, you will.

1139
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:30,137
- Gee, thanks for the pep talk.
- Sorry.

1140
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:32,068
I'm just saying,

1141
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:34,758
if you go into a situation
already defeated,

1142
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:37,551
then, yeah, it won't work out.

1143
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:41,068
You have to sell you on you,
before anybody else.

1144
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:45,965
[groans]

1145
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,517
- Pitch me. Right now.
- Not right now.

1146
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,172
- I have too much to do.
- [Tre] Tara...

1147
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:56,965
What makes my app
different from the rest is that,

1148
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,620
instead of giving you an endless
parade of choices,

1149
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:02,965
it searches the entire globe
to find your one true love.

1150
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,275
It's like having a personal
relationship with Cupid.

1151
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:10,068
- See? How easy was that?
- Yeah, that was good.

1152
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:11,689
But it was only easy
to talk to you

1153
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:13,068
because I have nothing to lose.

1154
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:15,068
You're not some mega-wealthy
tech investor

1155
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:17,206
who can make
all my dreams come true.

1156
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:20,068
So when you pitch Elliott,
just pretend that he's me.

1157
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:21,103
Super easy.

1158
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:23,103
Wait, Tre.
One more thing.

1159
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:24,931
[phone vibrates]

1160
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:30,068
- [chuckles]
- What is it?

1161
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, it as just London sending
over dresses to inspire me.

1162
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:36,689
[Tre laughs]

1163
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:37,931
That girl definitely leaves

1164
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:39,586
nothing to the imagination.

1165
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,965
But I do appreciate
her pushing me.

1166
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,310
[scoffs] Wasn't that a nice of
way saying she is demanding?

1167
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:48,310
She can be,
but she's also extremely funny

1168
00:58:48,344 --> 00:58:52,000
and honest about who she is
and what she wants.

1169
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:54,034
You know, the more
I get to know her,

1170
00:58:54,068 --> 00:58:56,206
the more
I, I genuinely like her.

1171
00:58:57,862 --> 00:58:59,586
Anyway, what were you saying?

1172
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,103
Um, nothing. Just good luck
with her dress.

1173
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:04,172
Because I know
she's gonna love it.

1174
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:11,793
Okay, so everybody emailed
their RSVP's.

1175
00:59:11,827 --> 00:59:13,347
They'll be coming in
through that door.

1176
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:16,931
[London] Ooh.

1177
00:59:16,965 --> 00:59:18,931
This is sweet.

1178
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:21,172
The valet is right there, so it
should be little less...

1179
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:23,931
You take their jackets
and put it in the, um,

1180
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:25,344
in that closet right over there.

1181
00:59:25,379 --> 00:59:27,275
Because that way
it won't be too much.

1182
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,103
[instrumental music]

1183
00:59:32,413 --> 00:59:33,931
Oh, my...

1184
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:36,758
Oh, my God, it fell.

1185
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:38,793
You gotta put it on my neck.

1186
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:47,275
- Here, let me help you.
- Oh.

1187
00:59:55,379 --> 00:59:56,862
Oh.

1188
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,827
I see.

1189
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:05,000
You don't really like me,
do you?

1190
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,344
What's not to like?

1191
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:10,068
You're rude, spoiled,
self-centered...

1192
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:14,000
But in a stylish,
girl-boss kinda way!

1193
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:15,182
If this is about
the air hockey game,

1194
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:18,103
then I really do
apologize again.

1195
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:19,862
Forgiven and forgotten.

1196
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:21,827
Most women don't like me,

1197
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:23,793
but I admire your honesty.

1198
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:25,965
Which is why I'm surprised

1199
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,034
I don't remember you
from St. Tropez.

1200
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:31,379
There was a lot going on.

1201
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:36,172
Well, regardless,
I'm really glad you're here.

1202
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:38,793
I usually bail on my family
at Christmas.

1203
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:40,206
But for the first time,

1204
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:43,620
I'm actually having more fun
here at home.

1205
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:46,655
I mean, you made something
as simple as

1206
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:49,689
decorating for Christmas
or playing games

1207
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:52,137
actually enjoyable.

1208
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:54,034
And I owe that to you.

1209
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,793
You don't owe me anything.

1210
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:58,034
And don't worry.

1211
01:00:58,068 --> 01:00:59,758
I'll make sure
he won't get hurt.

1212
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:03,275
Tre.

1213
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:07,034
I could see how protective
you are of him.

1214
01:01:07,068 --> 01:01:09,413
I mean, it's obvious
you two love each other.

1215
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:12,000
And he talks about you
constantly.

1216
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,793
He cares a lot about you.

1217
01:01:17,827 --> 01:01:23,344
Oddly enough, I may have
found a friend in you.

1218
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,448
Mm. [laughs]

1219
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,379
I might need to
lay off the eggnog.

1220
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:29,931
Yeah. Maybe.

1221
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:33,758
Well, it's getting late.

1222
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:37,241
I still have to do my cold packs
and my face creams.

1223
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:39,827
Have to look my absolute best
at this party tomorrow.

1224
01:01:41,379 --> 01:01:43,896
[instrumental music]

1225
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:48,862
Did London say something
to upset you?

1226
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,310
No.

1227
01:01:52,344 --> 01:01:58,275
But I always thought she was
just a rich and vapid snob.

1228
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,931
In fact, none of them are.

1229
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,482
The Everests are
a, a real, true family

1230
01:02:03,517 --> 01:02:05,241
who love each other and...

1231
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:09,034
and I shouldn't be here.

1232
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,034
- Tara.
- What?

1233
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,103
We know why we're here.

1234
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,389
I snuck into these
people's lives

1235
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:24,758
just to take advantage of them.

1236
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:27,482
- I'm just as guilty as you are.
- No, you're not.

1237
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:29,482
At least your intentions
will come across as pure

1238
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,413
now that you're
falling for London.

1239
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:33,310
I'm not falling for London.

1240
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:34,965
Yes, she's becoming
a good friend.

1241
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,182
But I can't imagine
her ever being

1242
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:37,275
anything more than that.

1243
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,310
Why not?

1244
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:40,034
She's rich, gorgeous,

1245
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:43,034
influential,
pushing you creatively.

1246
01:02:43,068 --> 01:02:45,103
What? Tara...

1247
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:47,827
[phone ringing]

1248
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:49,448
Oh, shoot!
That's the caterer.

1249
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:51,758
I have to take this.
Excuse me.

1250
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:53,413
Hello?

1251
01:02:53,448 --> 01:02:55,241
Y-yeah, no,
this isn't a bad time.

1252
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:59,896
[instrumental music]

1253
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:01,527
Okay, even if somebody has
a peanut allergy

1254
01:03:01,551 --> 01:03:03,517
they could still have
peanut butter, right?

1255
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:07,344
It's different.
Or maybe not. I don't know. Ugh.

1256
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:10,551
So you're gonna be
the cook now, too?

1257
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,034
Yeah, the call I got earlier
was from the caterer.

1258
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:15,068
And he thought it was
a good idea to go skiing

1259
01:03:15,103 --> 01:03:16,586
and broke both of his legs.

1260
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,517
- Ouch.
- Mm.

1261
01:03:18,551 --> 01:03:20,413
And w-what are you gonna do?

1262
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:25,241
[Sapphire] Do about what?
Oh, my, food is everywhere.

1263
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:28,034
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:29,586
It's just a minor hiccup.

1265
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,517
Mr. Bragg had
an unfortunate accident

1266
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:33,862
and he can no longer make it.

1267
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:35,413
But, but don't freak out.

1268
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:38,413
I have all the ingredients,
the instructions,

1269
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,931
we're good to go.

1270
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:41,355
We're gonna have to
cancel the party.

1271
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:45,551
What? No, no!
Trust me, I got this.

1272
01:03:45,586 --> 01:03:47,413
Well, you know,
it's really late,

1273
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,931
so you should probably
go upstairs and,

1274
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:52,068
and get some rest, so you could
be gorgeous tomorrow.

1275
01:03:52,103 --> 01:03:54,862
I'm all nerves.
I can't sleep.

1276
01:03:54,896 --> 01:03:58,034
Well, I'm sure your husband can
help find a way to relax you.

1277
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,896
Isn't that one of the perks
of marriage?

1278
01:03:59,931 --> 01:04:02,068
[laughs]

1279
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:06,586
Well, perhaps I can see if
Elliott would like a,

1280
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,241
a little late night snack.

1281
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:11,206
Snack? I was just thinkin' of
giving you a sna..

1282
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:12,586
We're, we're here.

1283
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,241
Excuse me.

1284
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:18,137
How about a... champagne...

1285
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,586
and strawberries?

1286
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:25,068
That's romantic.

1287
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:28,034
Oh-ho, darling, you're the best.

1288
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:29,551
Have fun.

1289
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:35,413
Tara, I appreciate
your ambition,

1290
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,286
but there's no way you can do
this alone. Let me help.

1291
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,068
No, no, you still have to finish
London's dress. So just get ou...

1292
01:04:40,103 --> 01:04:41,665
But there's no way
you could cook a gourmet brunch

1293
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:43,068
for 20 people.

1294
01:04:43,103 --> 01:04:44,172
Twenty is nothing!

1295
01:04:44,206 --> 01:04:45,517
For my aunt's birthday,

1296
01:04:45,551 --> 01:04:47,655
do you know we fed over 100?

1297
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:49,965
And you cooked for all 100?

1298
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,275
Yeah. Kinda. A little.

1299
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:55,379
She did all the cooking.

1300
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:56,655
But-but don't freak out.

1301
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:58,413
I watched and learned.

1302
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:03,103
Besides, brunch is just a
fancy version of bacon and eggs.

1303
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:05,448
So how hard can this be?

1304
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,448
[grunting]

1305
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:10,551
I don't think
it's supposed to look like this.

1306
01:05:14,482 --> 01:05:18,620
Mm, shouldn't you be sewing
something fabulous for London?

1307
01:05:18,655 --> 01:05:20,517
Ah, about the catering...

1308
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:23,620
I told you, I have the brunch
under control.

1309
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:25,620
I've already started cooking
the Cornish hens,

1310
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,551
I just have to roll out
the cinnamon buns.

1311
01:05:27,586 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm fine!

1312
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:31,448
Speaking of,
they're probably ready.

1313
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:35,517
Mm, here we come.

1314
01:05:37,724 --> 01:05:39,448
Why is it still raw?

1315
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:42,103
Because you probably
turned on the broiler

1316
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:44,034
instead of the oven.

1317
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,310
Don't be mad at him.

1318
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:50,517
He knew you needed the help.

1319
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:53,551
That's what family is for.

1320
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:57,275
Which is also why I also
called in for some more backup.

1321
01:05:58,517 --> 01:06:01,517
You wouldn't. You didn't.

1322
01:06:01,551 --> 01:06:04,103
[instrumental music]

1323
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,724
She did.

1324
01:06:08,482 --> 01:06:10,689
So, where do you
want me to start,

1325
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:13,068
pastries or potatoes first?

1326
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:17,000
[instrumental music]

1327
01:06:24,517 --> 01:06:26,241
You know, Tara,
cooking like this

1328
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,137
reminds me, when you were five...

1329
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:29,689
Shh, shh, shh!

1330
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:32,517
Diahann, I'm concentrating.

1331
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:35,620
Did you just call me Diahann?

1332
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:37,620
I can't exactly call you mom.

1333
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:39,079
What would the Everest's
think if they knew

1334
01:06:39,103 --> 01:06:40,596
my mom and aunt came in
to save my butt?

1335
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,275
Oh, that you're being honest?

1336
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:45,793
If anyone asks, you two are
catering professionals

1337
01:06:45,827 --> 01:06:48,655
that I hired at
the last minute. Okay?

1338
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:51,586
I'm just glad
you're calling me anything.

1339
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:54,689
This doesn't mean
I'm not still mad at you.

1340
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:57,034
Let's just keep
this professional. Okay?

1341
01:06:57,068 --> 01:06:59,379
I will pay you both
for your time and services.

1342
01:06:59,413 --> 01:07:00,793
We don't want your money.

1343
01:07:00,827 --> 01:07:04,275
Oh, no, no, no,
you speak for yourself! No.

1344
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,206
But don't worry,
tomorrow, I can go back

1345
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:09,379
to being the absolute
worst mother in the world.

1346
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:12,379
I never said you were
the absolute worst mother

1347
01:07:12,413 --> 01:07:13,758
in the world.

1348
01:07:17,379 --> 01:07:19,103
Here, taste this.

1349
01:07:19,137 --> 01:07:22,034
It's a sauce for the Panettone
French Toast Casserole.

1350
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,172
Yes, that will do.

1351
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:36,551
Careful.
You might start to love her.

1352
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,137
[instrumental music]

1353
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:51,586
Stop. Don't move.

1354
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:54,517
What's wrong? Is it my hair?

1355
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:55,862
I have something in my teeth?

1356
01:07:55,896 --> 01:07:57,862
You look simply radiant.

1357
01:07:57,896 --> 01:08:00,931
Oh.
[giggles]

1358
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:02,896
Mm, thank you, darling.

1359
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:06,344
Tara reminded me to appreciate
the simple moments

1360
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:08,551
I never get back.

1361
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:10,620
I'mma start by dialing
back on my work.

1362
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,586
I adore you, Sapphy.

1363
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,309
Even more than
when we first met.

1364
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,448
- Oh.
- Mm.

1365
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:24,309
[chuckles]

1366
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:26,896
You know, last night felt like

1367
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:30,103
the first time in years
that we truly connected.

1368
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:33,585
I think we've been denying
ourselves

1369
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,724
the perks of marriage
far too long.

1370
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:38,827
[laughs]

1371
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:40,792
Mm, Tara reminded me of that.

1372
01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:43,448
Well, I'm gonna have to add that
to the list of things

1373
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:44,585
to thank her for.

1374
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,792
Oh.

1375
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,172
Wait, do we put out the muff...
Okay, muffins are there.

1376
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:52,379
Pass the bread over here.

1377
01:08:52,413 --> 01:08:54,550
No, leave the bread right there,
please.

1378
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:57,620
- Oh! Good morning.
- [Sapphire] Oh, my...

1379
01:08:57,655 --> 01:09:00,931
Well, it certainly is!

1380
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,274
Tell me you didn't do all of
this while we were sleeping?

1381
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:05,758
I had some help.

1382
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:10,517
Mr. and Mrs. Everest, I, I would
like for you to meet, um...

1383
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:11,792
This is...

1384
01:09:11,827 --> 01:09:14,000
Diahann and Rhonda.
Such an honor.

1385
01:09:14,033 --> 01:09:16,827
Yes, we're the secret weapon
Ms. Aries calls out

1386
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:20,274
when she wants to make an
exceptionally good impression.

1387
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:21,758
On a scale of one to ten,

1388
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:24,585
I say you ladies scored
ten million.

1389
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,344
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1390
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,827
Tara's one of the most gifted

1391
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:30,344
and talented young women
I've ever known.

1392
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:32,241
I'm just glad we were able
to to work together

1393
01:09:32,274 --> 01:09:33,734
before some big tech company
steals her away

1394
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:36,482
with all those amazing
phone apps she makes.

1395
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:39,482
Tara, I keep forgetting that
you have a secret life

1396
01:09:39,517 --> 01:09:41,931
as a computer software engineer.

1397
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:43,585
We have to do
something about that.

1398
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,896
Sure. In fact...

1399
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,724
In fact, I need to make sure

1400
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,482
that the cranberry mimosa bar
is stocked.

1401
01:09:52,517 --> 01:09:53,550
So, I'm gonna go do that.

1402
01:09:53,585 --> 01:09:55,000
I can do that.

1403
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:56,965
Why don't you get changed
and enjoy the party?

1404
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,379
The party planner
doesn't exactly

1405
01:09:58,413 --> 01:09:59,689
get to enjoy the actual party.

1406
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:00,769
[Sapphire] Well, now she does.

1407
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:02,000
You've done so much work

1408
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,517
around the house this week,
Tara.

1409
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:05,827
Please. Come socialize with us.
Mm?

1410
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:07,585
Thank you.

1411
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:10,448
We don't need you.

1412
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:12,931
You go have yourself
a good time. Boss.

1413
01:10:12,965 --> 01:10:14,585
[laughs]

1414
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,758
- Thank you.
- [Rhonda] Yeah.

1415
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:20,275
[instrumental music]

1416
01:10:31,379 --> 01:10:33,596
You have no idea how much
meeting you has changed my life.

1417
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,275
You've changed mine, too.

1418
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:36,517
I already have five women

1419
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:39,206
who want me to make them
custom gowns.

1420
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:41,275
I don't know
how I can ever thank you.

1421
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:43,309
Let's take a good pic.

1422
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:49,309
If this doesn't get
his attention,

1423
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:50,931
nothing will.

1424
01:10:50,965 --> 01:10:52,309
Pardon me?

1425
01:10:53,344 --> 01:10:54,965
Oh, my!

1426
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:57,550
[instrumental music]

1427
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:59,482
Wow.

1428
01:10:59,517 --> 01:11:01,585
- Girl!
- You like it?

1429
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,896
Oh, my God.

1430
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:07,034
- So, am I, am I wearing it well?
- I'll say!

1431
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:11,550
Honey, you are wearing
that dress better than I did.

1432
01:11:11,585 --> 01:11:12,585
Thank you.

1433
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,896
Oh, I really hope

1434
01:11:13,931 --> 01:11:15,758
this budding friendship
is genuine.

1435
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:18,827
I need someone as honest and
as bold as you in my life

1436
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,585
who doesn't take any of my crap.

1437
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,758
- Yeah.
- Merry Christmas, beautiful.

1438
01:11:22,793 --> 01:11:24,448
Merry Christmas.

1439
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:28,585
Oh, Tara, you are amazing!

1440
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,550
It does my heart wonders to see
so many of my friends

1441
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:33,896
grit their teeth
with compliments.

1442
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:35,862
- Gotcha.
- Yes, Tara.

1443
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:37,896
You designed the perfect party.

1444
01:11:37,931 --> 01:11:40,585
But parties aren't
the only thing she designs.

1445
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,585
Tara never finished telling you
about her dating app.

1446
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:47,000
And since she now has
your undivided attention...

1447
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:50,309
It's that time, huh.

1448
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:51,965
- I guess so.
- Come with me.

1449
01:11:57,068 --> 01:11:58,448
[indistinct chatter]

1450
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:00,896
Everyone, gather around please.

1451
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:07,862
This is Tara Aries.

1452
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:09,550
And not only did
she put together

1453
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:11,827
this extravagant affair,

1454
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:13,620
but she has a dating app

1455
01:12:13,655 --> 01:12:15,379
that she wants to share as well.

1456
01:12:17,068 --> 01:12:20,550
You know what's so great
about a Christmas tree?

1457
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:22,550
It never goes out of style.

1458
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:24,517
And neither does dating.

1459
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:28,482
It will always be a strong,
reliable investment.

1460
01:12:28,517 --> 01:12:31,827
MY1MATCH is one of one.

1461
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:33,655
We use the latest technology,

1462
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:36,034
based on predictive
analysis and trends

1463
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:38,000
in your mental
and physical state.

1464
01:12:40,758 --> 01:12:42,585
Okay, to be clear,

1465
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,620
our technology scans
public domain data

1466
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:47,379
and social media outlets

1467
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:49,517
to find compatible matches.

1468
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,896
It's kinda like having
a personal relationship

1469
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,068
with Cupid.

1470
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,931
So you're trying to tell me

1471
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:59,620
that this app can show me
my one true love?

1472
01:13:00,862 --> 01:13:02,758
I'm not trying to tell you.

1473
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:04,103
With Carolina's help,

1474
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:06,068
I entered Elliott's
necessary information

1475
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:09,931
and made the details
as accurate as possible.

1476
01:13:09,965 --> 01:13:12,137
Now let's see if he has a match.

1477
01:13:12,172 --> 01:13:15,724
W-wait! What if I don't show up
on that app for him?

1478
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:19,000
- [phone chimes]
- Oh, my.

1479
01:13:20,172 --> 01:13:23,655
Well... I'm so sorry.

1480
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:27,068
But, uh, it seems like
the two of you

1481
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:29,689
are stuck with
each other for life.

1482
01:13:29,724 --> 01:13:32,931
Ohh. God. Okay, okay.
[laughing]

1483
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:34,896
Thank you. Thank you.

1484
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:39,000
Tara, I'll be in touch.

1485
01:13:39,034 --> 01:13:40,689
Yes, sir.

1486
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:48,068
Tara, you truly are
a Christmas miracle.

1487
01:13:48,103 --> 01:13:51,068
It's as if you're too good
to be true.

1488
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,000
She is.

1489
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:54,517
[laughing]

1490
01:13:56,758 --> 01:13:58,689
- Can you believe that?
- It all worked out.

1491
01:13:58,724 --> 01:14:01,079
- Did you see it? Did you see it?
- Just like you said it would.

1492
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,655
It did, didn't it?

1493
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,206
Oh, it's so sweet
to see you two cousins

1494
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:09,172
sharing so much love and joy
during Christmas time.

1495
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:11,550
If only Calvin
was here to see it.

1496
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:13,000
[Calvin] Here to see what?

1497
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:15,517
[instrumental music]

1498
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,068
Oh, look!
It's your Uncle Calvin!

1499
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:22,103
[Tara] Uh-oh.

1500
01:14:22,137 --> 01:14:24,758
It looks like the gingerbread
is about to hit the fan.

1501
01:14:26,034 --> 01:14:27,793
Smile.

1502
01:14:27,827 --> 01:14:30,137
[Sapphire]
Calvin! You're back from Rio!

1503
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:33,206
As much as I love lying on
the beach drinking Caipirinhas,

1504
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:35,585
missing the event of the year
wasn't an option.

1505
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,241
So I cut the trip short.

1506
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:39,172
- You look stunning.
- Ohh...

1507
01:14:39,206 --> 01:14:41,655
This party is beyond epic.

1508
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:42,700
That's because we had your
wonderful niece

1509
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:45,206
who saved the day.

1510
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:47,655
- Niece?
- And nephew.

1511
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:49,206
He designed London's dress.

1512
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:52,034
They practically
saved Christmas.

1513
01:14:52,068 --> 01:14:55,620
How touching, but I don't have
a niece or a nephew.

1514
01:14:55,655 --> 01:14:56,931
[Sapphire] What?

1515
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:59,931
I told you, we barely know
each other.

1516
01:14:59,965 --> 01:15:04,550
Tara, what's going on?

1517
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:05,872
[Tara] Okay, we don't know
each other.

1518
01:15:05,896 --> 01:15:07,827
I mean, I know of Mr. Aries.

1519
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,550
I guess I haven't been
completely honest.

1520
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:17,103
Did you lie your way
into my family

1521
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,827
just so you could
sell me something?

1522
01:15:21,068 --> 01:15:22,896
Yes, I did.

1523
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:25,620
I knew I didn't know you
from St. Tropez.

1524
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:27,931
Who are you people?

1525
01:15:27,965 --> 01:15:30,241
For starters, we're not cousins.

1526
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:33,309
I'm an app designer

1527
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:35,034
and I've been crashing
corporate parties

1528
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:37,275
just trying to get a break.

1529
01:15:37,309 --> 01:15:41,758
And I thought that if I could
make you something so memorable

1530
01:15:41,793 --> 01:15:44,206
it could help legitimize
my fashion career.

1531
01:15:46,034 --> 01:15:48,103
And that's my mother and my aunt

1532
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:49,655
that came to help me
make the food

1533
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:51,620
when the caterer cancelled.

1534
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:53,758
- Hey.
- Hi.

1535
01:15:53,793 --> 01:15:58,137
Mr. and Mrs. Everest,
please believe me when I say...

1536
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:00,655
I think you have said
more than enough.

1537
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:06,309
Please just... pack your things.

1538
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:09,034
I'm really sorry, okay?

1539
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:11,620
[mellow music]

1540
01:16:19,068 --> 01:16:21,931
Tre, don't go.

1541
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:25,241
- I forgive you.
- Thank you.

1542
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:27,379
But if you all are asking
Tara to go, I'm going, too.

1543
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:30,275
Ah, ah, ah, whoa.
No!

1544
01:16:32,206 --> 01:16:33,862
I still need you.

1545
01:16:33,896 --> 01:16:35,758
Come with me.

1546
01:16:42,655 --> 01:16:44,793
- Say it.
- Say what?

1547
01:16:46,172 --> 01:16:47,896
How disappointed you are in me.

1548
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:51,172
I'm not.

1549
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:55,000
So it's worse?
You're ashamed of me?

1550
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:56,655
You think I'm dumb?

1551
01:16:57,827 --> 01:16:59,103
Because I do.

1552
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:02,206
I just made a fool out of myself

1553
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:05,344
in front of one of the most
powerful families in Atlanta.

1554
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,344
[mellow music]

1555
01:17:13,344 --> 01:17:15,931
I think you are very brave.

1556
01:17:17,448 --> 01:17:19,862
You're not afraid to hustle
and break the rules

1557
01:17:19,896 --> 01:17:22,137
to get what you deserve.

1558
01:17:22,172 --> 01:17:25,344
And I'm so proud
that you are my daughter.

1559
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,309
That's the worst thing
you can tell me!

1560
01:17:31,344 --> 01:17:33,896
Why?

1561
01:17:33,931 --> 01:17:36,379
Because now it means
I can't hate you anymore!

1562
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:39,206
[instrumental music]

1563
01:17:40,862 --> 01:17:43,758
We-we're not gonna be
like the Kardashians,

1564
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:47,275
like sharing clothes and go into
the cosmetics industry, okay?

1565
01:17:47,309 --> 01:17:48,862
Of course not.

1566
01:17:50,275 --> 01:17:51,931
And we still have
a lot to work on.

1567
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:56,000
But you've met me half-way.

1568
01:17:56,034 --> 01:17:59,448
So I'm willing to start over
if you are. Deal?

1569
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:03,448
Deal. Absolutely.
Deal, deal, deal!

1570
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:07,109
I always knew why you couldn't
spend much time

1571
01:18:07,137 --> 01:18:09,517
with me as a child.

1572
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,448
It wasn't because
you didn't love me.

1573
01:18:12,482 --> 01:18:15,034
You just wanted to provide me
a better life.

1574
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:16,827
I just wanted to make enough

1575
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:19,379
to give you all the things
I didn't have as a little girl.

1576
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:21,309
But all I ever needed was you.

1577
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:25,965
You know, the Everest's
taught me that.

1578
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,103
While money is nice,
love is the more important.

1579
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:36,309
And, uh... I love you, mom.

1580
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,965
I always have.

1581
01:18:41,793 --> 01:18:43,827
Tre, no, please. Tre!

1582
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:46,827
Please, stay for just
five more minutes.

1583
01:18:46,862 --> 01:18:48,172
- What? Why?
- Because...

1584
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:49,517
[Canyon] London.

1585
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,309
- Kiss me.
- Are you crazy?

1586
01:18:51,344 --> 01:18:53,424
Kiss me and I'll get you
a pop-up store on Rodeo Drive

1587
01:18:53,448 --> 01:18:55,172
in six months.

1588
01:18:55,206 --> 01:18:56,482
[moaning]

1589
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,827
Oh, Canyon!

1590
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:03,517
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

1591
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:05,585
You and me are going to Vegas.

1592
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,241
Baby, we're getting
married tonight.

1593
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,965
I can't marry you.

1594
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,862
- I'm in love with another man.
- We're just friends.

1595
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:15,827
Oh, no, wait.
Canyon, wait.

1596
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:19,413
I only just, just
wanted you to see

1597
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:25,103
how much you'd miss me if I,
if I run off with another man.

1598
01:19:25,137 --> 01:19:29,172
You mean to tell me,
you manipulated my feelings

1599
01:19:29,206 --> 01:19:31,379
just so I would fall back
in love with you?

1600
01:19:35,585 --> 01:19:39,103
Baby, that is so hot!

1601
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:40,585
Oh, my God, baby, you're hot.

1602
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,379
[indistinct chatter]

1603
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:45,389
- Do you have a ring?
- Yeah, I do.

1604
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:47,931
I'm-I'm-I'm, I just, I'm sorry.

1605
01:19:47,965 --> 01:19:50,241
Just one-one minute.
One...

1606
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:53,206
Go grab a quick bite to eat
and I'll-I'll be right there.

1607
01:19:58,137 --> 01:20:00,550
So this entire time,
you just used me

1608
01:20:00,585 --> 01:20:03,034
to get your boyfriend back?

1609
01:20:03,068 --> 01:20:04,965
Just as you used me
to get everyone

1610
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,309
to see your designs.

1611
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,413
- Touche.
- Touche.

1612
01:20:10,448 --> 01:20:13,965
But I wasn't kidding
about the pop-up store.

1613
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,931
You're exceptional, Tre.

1614
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:18,068
And I wanna invest in you.

1615
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:21,068
No hard feelings?
We even?

1616
01:20:21,103 --> 01:20:22,344
Even-Steven.

1617
01:20:24,068 --> 01:20:25,344
Even-Steven.

1618
01:20:26,931 --> 01:20:29,309
Come on, Tre.
My mom will drive us home.

1619
01:20:30,344 --> 01:20:32,206
Do you really have to go?

1620
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:34,034
Yeah. Your mom just...

1621
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,896
Oh, my mother is always making
something out of nothing.

1622
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:39,896
She will get over this.
Trust.

1623
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:41,448
You actually want me to stay?

1624
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,309
Of course I do!

1625
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:45,896
You were able to do a snow job
on all of us

1626
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:49,206
with such style,
class, and sincerity.

1627
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,103
I'm in complete awe of you.

1628
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,137
Um, thanks, I guess.

1629
01:20:53,172 --> 01:20:56,103
And I'm taking you
to St. Tropez this summer.

1630
01:20:56,137 --> 01:20:57,413
What?

1631
01:20:57,448 --> 01:20:59,379
I know I can learn
a thing or two from you.

1632
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:01,103
I would love that.

1633
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:03,206
[indistinct chatter]

1634
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:06,172
Excuse me, but I think
you all fail to realize

1635
01:21:06,206 --> 01:21:07,620
that we have all
been grifted here.

1636
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,655
- Listen here.
- Nuh-unh. Girl, hold my earrings.

1637
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:13,206
Mom. Aunt Rhonda.
I made my own bed.

1638
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:17,103
You know, I was growing
to really like you.

1639
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,068
But now that I've seen
your true colors...

1640
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:20,931
Oh, Sapphire! Shut up!

1641
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:24,103
Mrs. Everest, I respectfully ask
for you to stay out of this.

1642
01:21:24,137 --> 01:21:25,413
And I respectfully ask for you

1643
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,931
to pull your head
out of your butt.

1644
01:21:27,965 --> 01:21:29,965
Didn't you get the party
you wanted?

1645
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,550
A party that this woman
worked night and day on?

1646
01:21:33,585 --> 01:21:34,931
Now you wanna kick her out.

1647
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:36,550
Well, I could've
had her arrested.

1648
01:21:36,585 --> 01:21:39,965
You could have. And you could be
having a miserable Christmas.

1649
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,034
But-but for whoever this young
woman was pretending to be,

1650
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:46,965
was authentically here
for all of us.

1651
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,241
And, Elliott...

1652
01:21:49,275 --> 01:21:51,550
Didn't she help you both realize

1653
01:21:51,585 --> 01:21:54,448
how much you are truly
meant for one another?

1654
01:21:54,482 --> 01:21:57,620
And on top of that, didn't she
just hand you an invention

1655
01:21:57,655 --> 01:22:00,206
that's gonna earn you millions?

1656
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:02,620
- Well...
- Well?

1657
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:05,275
Thank you for
standing up for me.

1658
01:22:05,309 --> 01:22:07,379
But I've caused your family
enough trouble.

1659
01:22:07,413 --> 01:22:12,689
And besides, I have
my own family to go home to.

1660
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:15,068
And for once,
I'm actually excited about it.

1661
01:22:15,103 --> 01:22:17,206
[Carolina] I told you, baby.
Just listen.

1662
01:22:17,241 --> 01:22:18,585
The rest will take care
of itself.

1663
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,000
I'll never forget you.

1664
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:21,285
I won't forget you either,
sugar.

1665
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:23,689
Wait. Mother's right.

1666
01:22:23,724 --> 01:22:26,206
If anything, we owe you.

1667
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,309
Please stay. As our guests.

1668
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:31,068
As my friends.

1669
01:22:31,103 --> 01:22:34,000
Friends and business partners?

1670
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:39,655
I forgot what it was
like to put it all on the line

1671
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:43,103
for a chance to
make your dreams come true.

1672
01:22:43,137 --> 01:22:45,550
Thank you for reminding me,
mother.

1673
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:48,034
In your ever-so-eloquent way.

1674
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:50,344
That's what I'm here for, baby.

1675
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:53,103
- Mrs. Everest...
- No, no.

1676
01:22:53,137 --> 01:22:55,585
You may have come here
under false pretense,

1677
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:00,241
but you have certainly
given more than you received.

1678
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:03,413
I appreciate all that
you have done our my family.

1679
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:06,758
And I'm sorry I got so angry.

1680
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:09,068
I'm the one
that should apologize.

1681
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:11,379
- Oh. Yes.
- I'm sorry.

1682
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:14,389
[Elliot] Now, before we
rejoin the party,

1683
01:23:14,413 --> 01:23:16,241
let's all have a
celebratory drink

1684
01:23:16,275 --> 01:23:17,413
in the living room.

1685
01:23:17,448 --> 01:23:19,655
Yes!
That sounds good.

1686
01:23:21,137 --> 01:23:22,413
Yes!

1687
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,206
Wait, Tre!
Um, come here a minute.

1688
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,344
Did that really just happen?

1689
01:23:30,379 --> 01:23:32,413
- It really did.
- Oh, my God.

1690
01:23:32,448 --> 01:23:35,309
So about you and London.

1691
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,413
[clears throat]

1692
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:39,206
There's only been one woman

1693
01:23:39,241 --> 01:23:41,206
I've had my eyes on
this entire time.

1694
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:44,068
A woman who made me realize

1695
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:45,655
how fun it is
to chase my dreams.

1696
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:49,172
A woman who refuses to settle
for anything less

1697
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:50,758
than the absolute best.

1698
01:23:52,482 --> 01:23:56,000
I just hope I can meet
her expectations.

1699
01:23:57,309 --> 01:23:59,379
You can't.

1700
01:23:59,413 --> 01:24:01,241
Because you're better
than anything

1701
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:03,344
I could've ever imagined.

1702
01:24:08,517 --> 01:24:10,758
Um, you got something
on your lip.

1703
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:13,309
What?

1704
01:24:13,344 --> 01:24:15,655
[instrumental music]

1705
01:24:20,103 --> 01:24:21,526
I've been wanting to do
that ever since

1706
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,344
you spilled coffee on my jacket
outside the party.

1707
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:26,517
And I wanted to do that
ever since you were impressed

1708
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:30,689
by me sneaking past security
talking about women's underwear.

1709
01:24:33,413 --> 01:24:35,206
But hold up.

1710
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:37,275
Didn't you say
a person had to be crazy

1711
01:24:37,309 --> 01:24:39,206
to believe in love
at first sight?

1712
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,309
I did, but now I know
you'd have to be

1713
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:45,034
even crazier
not to believe in it.

1714
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:48,585
[instrumental music]

1715
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:50,827
[clearing throat]

1716
01:24:52,896 --> 01:24:54,793
You know,
