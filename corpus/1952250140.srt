00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,728
BEWARE OF SNOW TEAMS

3
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,582
FOR SALE.

4
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,023
Dear Santa,
I know it's very late, but ...

5
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:13,819
We have just moved to Edmondton
Alberta. That is in Canada.

6
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:20,817
I wanted to be sure that you
my new address.

7
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:26,573
My old address in Los Angeles
is not good.

8
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:32,299
Go not go there.
Well, you can still have go ...

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,719
but let there be no gifts for me
back, because I'm not.

10
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:52,016
I like it here,
but not my brothers.

11
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:59,892
And although Christmas is
there is no snow.

12
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,992
Hi, Danny.

13
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:24,545
I send you an e-mail ...
- Mary ...

14
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,358
Come down, honey, breakfast.
Yes, Dad.

15
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:33,804
Can you hear me? - I come,
even finish that letter to Santa.

16
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,196
If you ask something,
ask for a miracle.

17
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,036
What did I say?

18
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:47,758
Frying pan.

19
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,476
Brian, you know in which box
the skillet is?

20
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:56,676
It depends what you want, Dad.
- Breakfast cook.

21
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,800
Then I'm not sure.
You're the best at home.

22
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,350
Get the pan, or I offer to you
for adoption.

23
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:08,440
Can I get that black and white?
Brian, please.

24
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:11,837
Okay,'s see ...

25
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,950
If I had a frying pan,
where would I be?

26
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,753
Maybe in the box where
"Kitchen Stuff" on it?

27
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,837
Please pa.
- Thank you, sir.

28
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,825
Remember that,
there is "Kitchen Stuff 'on.

29
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:32,675
That is probably not a child of mine.

30
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:53,950
Hey Mary, you want the fireplace
chiselling not open?

31
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:57,083
But I must make a hole,
so Santa can come inside.

32
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,500
This is not a real place,
there is no chimney.

33
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,250
How can Santa come over,
if it is not real?

34
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,880
Santa is surely a way.
It is a very clever guy.

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,517
We also get a Christmas tree,
Dad?

36
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,797
Completely forgotten, a tree.
Of course we get a tree.

37
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,934
It is surely no Christmas
without a Christmas tree.

38
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:23,910
I promise you that we have a Christmas tree
get. And now ... eat.

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,034
Oh, Danny, what do you want for breakfast?
Toast or pancakes?

40
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,635
Cyanide, please.

41
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,619
Okay, what is there now on?

42
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,200
He does not like Edmonton.
He says it sucks.

43
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,855
Did you say that your sister said?

44
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,619
It eluded me, sorry.

45
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,810
I do not know what sucks.

46
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,661
Whatever. Honey.

47
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,300
And what is wrong with Edmonton?

48
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,280
Everything. I hate it here.

49
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:55,040
Yeah, come on.
We're here two days now ...

50
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:59,084
't seems fair that you' t least
24 hours have the chance.

51
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,955
I give up no 24 seconds.
Everything is getting worse.

52
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:05,840
To me, we immediately
back to LA.

53
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,080
Since I am voting for.

54
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:11,731
The only thing here is the same
as in America, the English language.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,900
And sometimes I even doubt it.

56
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,301
Did you call them gjeld money?

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,250
That says enough anyway.

58
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:23,010
I like it here, Dad.
- Thank you sweetheart.

59
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,211
Your welcome.

60
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,308
Brian is right, Dad.
Did you hear how they talk here?

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,790
I need a lobotomy to
to communicate with someone.

62
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,370
Find another solution,
is too expensive for a lobotomy.

63
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,750
I do it with pleasure free.

64
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,672
What is a lobolomie?

65
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:45,765
Brian, you quickly come here,
to look at the pancakes?

66
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,602
We are back in eggshells.

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,060
This is the worst Christmas
of my life.

68
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,400
You're kidding, you're stranded?
Why are you stranded?

69
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,236
Because 't is Christmas Eve, and the flight
overbooked. I am on a waiting list.

70
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,606
How long is this list?
- No idea, they said maybe ...

71
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,048
I can get a flight tonight ...

72
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:18,971
but I think I will not come home
this time with Christmas.

73
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,022
Great, really great.

74
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,900
That means,
that you must do the shopping.

75
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:28,200
As for shopping, eating?
- Food? No, gifts.

76
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,825
You must buy the presents.

77
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, just ... I'm afraid we do
not much to give this year.

78
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:41,500
With that move and stuff,
and the other what happened.

79
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:48,980
Fired? You're not even
started, how can you dismiss them?

80
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,931
The company was purchased by another
oil company, with private drillers.

81
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
What do we do now Wayne?

82
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,350
I am trying a new job
as oil driller found.

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,030
If we put this house back on sale,
and go back to LA.

84
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:03,550
The kids love it here
not so fun.

85
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:06,451
One reason why something nice for them
under the tree to have.

86
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,490
<i> You're right. </ i>

87
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,450
You surely
to a tree thought, huh?

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Of course I thought of a tree.
It is Christmas anyway?

89
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,325
What kind?

90
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,890
What kind?

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,950
Such green with needles and stuff.

92
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,810
Well. I 't forget.
I will buy one this afternoon.

93
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:32,180
I love you.
- I love you. Day.

94
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,644
What a Christmas.
Is there something wrong, Dad?

95
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,009
No, there is nothing wrong sweetheart.

96
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,712
You look so happy.
- I am very happy.

97
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,150
Papa would like to have one million,

98
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,762
he could pretty things
You buy for Christmas.

99
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:56,560
I have 2023 penny in my piggy bank,
who likes you have.

100
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:03,730
That's nice, honey. You keep your money
but. It'll be pretty good.

101
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,222
Well, who is my angel?

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,700
I do not know.
- You are.

103
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:14,100
Hey, I got an idea. Shall we're
all to go to the shopping center go?

104
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,301
Are we then to Santa?
Sure.

105
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,300
We go to Santa, we will
to Santa ...

106
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:31,404
I'm not a stupid mall.
- Why not?

107
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:36,120
Because it is still sucks.
Not exactly the Christmas spirit, Danny.

108
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:39,370
How can I have Christmas thoughts
if I have no friends.

109
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:45,490
All your friends in LA is to leave
difficult, but you will make new.

110
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,375
And, I noticed that the Edmonton
filled with girls your age is.

111
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,652
Girls?
I have said nothing about girls?

112
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:57,113
I was sixteen,
or your 't believe or not.

113
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,130
And I was ... I was madly in love
puppy with my girlfriend.

114
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,850
How was your girlfriend again,
Chayenne?

115
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:08,601
Shane.
- Shane. Ah yes, that was "t.

116
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,390
It'll be good, Danny,
believe me.

117
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,500
But I really need your help.

118
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,825
You have to watch Brian and Mary,
if I do the Christmas shopping.

119
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,747
Now I do not.
- Okay. So no one can go ...

120
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:27,338
Christmas at the buttons,
and everyone will blame you.

121
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,969
I can live with.

122
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,500
And unfortunately I can to Xbox 360
do not buy what you wanted.

123
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:49,321
Where have you bought them?
- Xbox 360. And you?

124
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,151
iPod.
- Good.

125
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:54,760
But you know
that we can not get them, huh?

126
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,420
What do you mean?
Dad has already lost his job.

127
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,370
What? How do you know?
Because I've opened his mail.

128
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,500
A source of information.
- Unbelievable.

129
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,310
You do not mention Mary, huh?
- Of course not.

130
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,935
Well, because if you do,
I'll kill you.

131
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:21,050
No worries,
I will say nothing against Mary.

132
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:25,100
It is the only one in the family
still innocent.

133
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,170
Here we go.

134
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,261
Hupsakee, doll.

135
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
Well, gabbers ...

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,756
Buckle up, ready to take off,
time for super shopping.

137
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,000
Nice work with Santa, Danny

138
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,530
Leave me alone,
but it is a lot of scrap.

139
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:54,538
Now.

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,850
<i> Well people, you can have as many bells
read if you want ...</ i>

141
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,369
<i> but it is not the perfect Christmas
we used to. </ i>

142
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,160
<i> Sorry, but no speck
snow expected in Edmonton, this year. </ i>

143
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,930
<i> CKWR The weatherman is this the
warmest Christmas ever in our history. </ i>

144
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,270
Look, there 't.

145
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,260
Wow!

146
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,294
Double wow.
- Yes. Double wow.

147
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,050
This is certainly a lot more
than I had expected.

148
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:05,090
Yes, you see
how big is the dome.

149
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,705
That is at least about 10 stories high.

150
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:11,191
Yes, and you look,
they are a real pirate ship.

151
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,344
Weird.
- Is Santa here, Dad?

152
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,845
That is down here somewhere

153
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:21,100
Santa lives here?
- No, Santa lives at the North Pole ...

154
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,713
and this is the mall in Edmonton.
- Our Santa live where I live.

155
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,516
You know what I think, Mary?
That you've discovered the secret.

156
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,714
Why has no one ever
found in the Arctic.

157
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,917
Because he's here all the time Sat

158
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:40,000
Ok. Then, you watch Brian and Mary,
then I go shopping.

159
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,645
I want to see Santa.
I want to see whether he lives here.

160
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,360
Dad.
- No hassle, we have an appointment.

161
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,799
But she wants to see Santa.
- Then take her to Santa.

162
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,350
I obviously do not count.
- Oh, certainly.

163
00:12:57,271 --> 00:13:01,925
We are all back here about 2 hours.
Understood? Exactly here.

164
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:06,259
Yes, Dad.
- Guys? Well.

165
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,767
Who is my little angel?
- I dunno.

166
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,501
You are.

167
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:17,550
See you later.
Fun.

168
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,906
Okay, creatures from hell,
let's go find Father Christmas.

169
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,220
Wow, what a lot of people.

170
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,100
<i> Yes, the fools. </ i>

171
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,140
<i> spend money that they have not,
a greasy bite to eat is not </ i>

172
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,200
Just to pretend they
happy. A silent days per year.

173
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,524
Christmas. What a mess.

174
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,155
Why I have not thought of themselves?
- I want it 6 times instead of Christmas 1.

175
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,410
Can we go see Santa?

176
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,050
We have to work. Come on.
- Hey, can I have a hat?

177
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
No.

178
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:02,025
But hop off and grab a candy cane,
because there is still someone.

179
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:08,600
Look who's here.
A boy. A tough guy.

180
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,950
A cat and a dog and a hat.
- A cat a dog and a hat.

181
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,980
I would like a hat.

182
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,833
Still 75 minutes to Santa,
from this point.

183
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,890
Brian Okay, listen.

184
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:46,321
You stay here with Mary, and I'll
You get about 76 minutes exactly.

185
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,375
Wait a effe,
why me?

186
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:50,755
We do not with his
Mary to fit on two.

187
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,890
I can of myself.

188
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:56,620
Why do not you?
- Because I'm older and stronger than you.

189
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:58,571
I can of myself.

190
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,320
Yeah but Dad said we were together
should continue. - I know what Dad said.

191
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:05,450
But how did he find out?
- Gee, let me 's thinking ...

192
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:10,738
How dad ever find out?
Who would tell him?

193
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,803
Okay, how much?
Daniel, I'm shocked ...

194
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:19,554
I think you my own blood brother
would blackmail?

195
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:21,805
How about 5 peak?
- How about 10?

196
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,900
Well.
Mary not only lost the eye.

197
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,300
My eyeballs are always
glued to her.

198
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:35,500
Come on. Now that walking hormoonbal
way, we can really have fun. Come.

199
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,750
But I must speak Santa, Brian.
It is important.

200
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,540
Listen Mary,
I'm not saying that Santa does not exist ...

201
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,690
but there is a great opportunity
that this man is real.

202
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:51,641
Must be a drunkard that she
have hired an employment agency.

203
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,529
I am pretty sure
that he was not really thick.

204
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Come, Mary, but there are one million
for our children.

205
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,300
We are now going to rest
of our lives.

206
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:08,818
It is surely not last long.
- Yes, half of the row certainly lost?

207
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:15,253
Come on, guys, we should sing.
Afterwards we can still see Santa.

208
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:24,045
You see, I said it anyway?
Come.

209
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:30,314
That is scary.

210
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:36,866
I have this morning-you e-mailed
but I give up anyway,

211
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,800
if your computer broke or something.

212
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,510
I am moved, I no longer live in
Los Angeles. This is my new address.

213
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,693
I understand. Do not worry,
Mary, you know Santa is always available.

214
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,632
There is a bicycle shop on the corner of
our street, if that helps.

215
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,725
This is Brian, that's my brother.

216
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,536
How you doing, Grandpa?

217
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,500
Nice outfit.
You look fine.

218
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,833
He does not believe
you're the real Santa.

219
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:08,044
Oh no? Maybe I can on other
bring thoughts.

220
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:10,962
Yes, by a Breathalyzer
successfully to make.

221
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,160
You see, I told you.
- Do not worry about him ...

222
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,350
Santa brings him to
other thoughts.

223
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,729
What would you like for Christmas from Santa
want, Mary?

224
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,540
I wanted things first six questions,
but now I have only one.

225
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:29,611
But one thing?
That must be something special.

226
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,692
What is it?
- I would like one million U.S. dollars.

227
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,090
A one million U.S. dollars?
That is a lot of money, Mary.

228
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,391
It is not for me, it is my
father. He says he 's needs.

229
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:45,915
I don 't.
Santa will see what he can do.

230
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,290
Want nothing for yourself, Mary?
- No, I have enough stuff ...

231
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:56,765
maybe next year.
- You are a very nice girl, Mary.

232
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,747
I wanted some more questions ...

233
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:05,540
Yes Mary?
- You live here 's mall, huh?

234
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,900
Happy Christmas, Mary.

235
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:45,275
Oh, I miss California.

236
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:05,300
On reflection,
What do I care about California.

237
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:46,212
Hey, hello.

238
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:52,474
Oh. Sorry, I thought someone
different. My mistake.

239
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:19,775
Listen well. The address is
Bonny Meadow Lane 9007.

240
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,764
You better not be on the roof countries,
because our focus is fake.

241
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:29,280
Land just in the backyard, I will
leave the kitchen, okay?

242
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,432
Mary, what are you doing?
- Rudolf I give our new address.

243
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,344
Keep them in there.
You look retarded.

244
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,550
And no longer do you wander, otherwise
The ghost will grab market.

245
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,260
The shop ghost?
What is that?

246
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,024
The store is a ghost ... dude,
A zombie guy, who dwells in the basement.

247
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,107
He grabs like little children
who stray, and then ...

248
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,743
He served there for burgers.

249
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:01,120
Really?
He grinds them into hamburger?

250
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:05,655
Yes he does. And he gives them ...
to a giant wolf to eat.

251
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,533
You're making only.
- No.

252
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,351
Do you.
- Well, then believe you me.

253
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,345
Wandering and see,
then we'll see what happens.

254
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:19,647
The shop ghost?
- Yes. Come along.

255
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:24,029
They have an ice rink here,
We can skate without wheels.

256
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:43,690
Please,
You can make more noise?

257
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,110
I can not help it.
These donuts are so good.

258
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,869
Want one?
- No, thank you

259
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,804
I try to eat less carbohydrates.
Would you also must do.

260
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:58,251
Why?
- No idea, maybe because you're fat?

261
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,400
This jam is delicious.

262
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,950
Really? How interesting.
I had no idea.

263
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:10,320
I like nice jam.
Jam is good.

264
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,085
I think it's even fun to jam to say.
Say with me, Lennert:

265
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:18,000
Jam, jam, jam.
Please love your head.

266
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,303
Just keep your head.
Shut up.

267
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,435
Jam.

268
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,880
I can not believe we are family.

269
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,755
<i> Wait for me.
- Can not you faster? </ I>

270
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:44,356
Hey, skating is very cool.
- Wait for me.

271
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,075
This looks really great.

272
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:06,740
Stop road. What matter with you?
It to anyone ...

273
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,700
You want it eat?
- That is inedible, who eats money nou?

274
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,600
You. You're just
a waste container on feet.

275
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,213
But you're still planning, huh?
- Yes.

276
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,245
Well, what is it?

277
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,300
I forgot.

278
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,811
For the tenth,
and I hope the last time ...

279
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:38,515
We take this money, go for it
shops, and buy stuff.

280
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:39,946
What stuff?

281
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,380
It does not matter, as long as it
cheaper than $ 100.00

282
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:46,010
We are charged with 't fake money
and get real money back. Understand?

283
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:49,001
But if they see that the false nou
money is counterfeit? - That they do not see.

284
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,400
This is Christmas Eve,
the busiest day of shopping of the year ...

285
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:55,040
in the largest shopping mall
of North America.

286
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,780
Nobody has time to look
whether the money is real.

287
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,181
And a hat?
- What?

288
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,945
I would buy one, I love hats.
- Well, you can buy a hat.

289
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,154
Not now. Wait for Ginger here is,

290
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:12,117
You're in love with her, eh?
- I'm not in love with her.

291
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:18,540
Leonard and Ginger sat in a bus,
and gave each one ...

292
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,460
Shut up, eat bread.

293
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:23,622
Good, but no sandwiches,
the donuts are.

294
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,513
Try it 's one, here, with Maple cream.
- I say I do not want any one.

295
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:28,964
You sure? They are really nice.
- Get that under my nose away.

296
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,880
What have you there?
I think 't is the gift from Santa.

297
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,450
Make 't nou.
- Look.

298
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:00,900
Those two kids have our money.
Hey, that bag is from us!

299
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,433
Hold the fuck up.
Do you think everyone knows our business?

300
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:06,512
What should we do?
- 'M Recovering before Ginger here.

301
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:09,101
These are only a couple stupid kids.
How hard can it be.

302
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:11,648
Okay, go.
- Good.

303
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,425
Too late.

304
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,109
What should we do now?
- Think, think ...

305
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,125
We ... We will, we ...
tell her the truth.

306
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,800
The truth, okay. Ginger has a small
heart. She forgives' t we do.

307
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,380
Day boys.
- Ginger, how you doing?

308
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:53,307
You look good, Ginger.
- You look great.

309
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,200
Tell me something I do not know.
Well, where is it?

310
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:01,615
It?
- Yes, the bag with the money?

311
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:06,106
Where is it?
You got him anyway, right?

312
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,925
Leonard is' m lost.
- I 'm not lost.

313
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,361
What?
- All through your stupid donuts.

314
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,247
Oh yes, you kieperde
him over the railing, there.

315
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:16,628
False. You're lying. It is because
the whole time you eat fatty junk.

316
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:18,729
Well who is the grand personality, huh?

317
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:23,100
Enough! I do not care which of
You two idiots' m has lost.

318
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,550
Find him and find him quickly.
- It is good that we do.

319
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,801
Well.

320
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,450
I am in the Beauty
for treatment.

321
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,810
Not that I need it, eh?
No, no ... come on ...

322
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,675
The correct answer.
When you are ready, you over there.

323
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,910
And do not disappoint me, boys.

324
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,420
Because if you do,
I do this.

325
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,585
Until ... you know.

326
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,470
And I do not want to know, too.
Let's go get the money.

327
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:04,660
He is full of money.
- I told you.

328
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,780
It's the one million U.S. dollars,
I've asked Santa.

329
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,415
He thought that we like
needed.

330
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,730
Yes, of course,
that sounds very logical.

331
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,755
I bet someone here is looking for.

332
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:18,703
We can spend some, and
the rest to give dad.

333
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:21,645
We must, I think,
for 'found objects' into.

334
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,595
If we buy gifts
for mom and Danny.

335
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:28,912
Or ... to the police.
Maybe we get a nice reward.

336
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,621
Or ... we buy something for you and me.

337
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,690
Well ... I think we best
a few dollars to spend.

338
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,100
Something like a finder fee.

339
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,785
Perhaps this was not
Christmas so bad as we thought.

340
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,420
Come on, let go.

341
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,600
Where are they?
- I do not know.

342
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,700
There are one million children here.

343
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,915
I see no children in the bag,
What should we do? - Come on.

344
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,580
Imagine: You are a child
and is $ 200,000, what would you do?

345
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,400
The deposit paid for Dad.
- Then.

346
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,651
The deposit paid for mama?
- Then.

347
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,985
Shopping. I would go shopping.
- Bingo!

348
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,105
Pick me. Hold on.

349
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,010
Look, play stuff.
Let's see.

350
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,550
Let's go.

351
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,575
Hey, kid, gone.
Get out.

352
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,275
This is so the XL Pro ...

353
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,420
Excuse me, ma'am ...
- What?

354
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:16,090
There are two gentlemen here,
to see you.

355
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,610
These two men are anything but.

356
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,400
I feel very comfortable on
Currently, corruption is not for me.

357
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,060
Forward.
- If it can, today.

358
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Ginger ...

359
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,920
Sheldon has "screwed up, and the children
escaped. - What? That is not true.

360
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,775
He is lying.
True.

361
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,010
Wait, bunch of idiots ...

362
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,800
So the two children in my bag
money, and they let you go?

363
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,710
Technically, no.
We just have not found them.

364
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:54,133
But we do find them.
No worries Ginger.

365
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,035
Do it, and quickly.

366
00:31:56,435 --> 00:32:00,120
The next time that I am useless
see lumps of meat ...

367
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:03,100
with the money, clear?

368
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,770
Yes Ginger.

369
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,530
They're certainly not here, do you
not? - No Ginger.

370
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,615
Day.

371
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,280
Yes.

372
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,225
We have to split.
- No. You touched easily distracted ...

373
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:27,301
and ends on the lap of Santa,
or so. We stay together.

374
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:30,005
Can we go to Santa below?
- No.

375
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,900
I can not.

376
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,136
Wayne Come on, how hard can it be?
Just as hard as ...

377
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:44,480
to a drilling rig, 20 m high
the air?

378
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,925
Maybe.

379
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,250
I said: Can I help you?
- No, no, I ...

380
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,915
Yes.
I want to buy.

381
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:35,150
A present.
- For your girlfriend.

382
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,980
I? No, no.
Do I look if I have a girlfriend?

383
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:42,835
Ah, I understand.
So for yourself?

384
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:47,550
Yes. I mean, no.
It is for my wife Julie ...

385
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:51,430
She is not here. She is in LA,
but now they will now ...

386
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,000
ever come.
What is this thing?

387
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:04,045
$ 75.00.
- $ 75.00 for underwear?

388
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:16,097
This is a combination, imported
satin, nylon and spandex with ...

389
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,975
excellent elastic,
for a good tight fit.

390
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:26,024
But it is very small.

391
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,250
Well, you might ...
one size bigger.

392
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:34,870
I? No, no. I told you,
it is not for me.

393
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,930
It is ...
for my wife.

394
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:42,875
Your secret is safe with me.
Mein Herr.

395
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,650
I do not know enough,
To me see 't good.

396
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,190
Are you Block?
- Yes, sir.

397
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:01,607
Inspector Gordon McLoosh,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

398
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,160
Really? We have just called.

399
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,600
We walk to move forward Brock.
We love it here already weeks into the holes.

400
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:10,330
Waiting on that mob until waste
they will hang paper.

401
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:13,945
Waste gang?
- Yes, yes, bad Jim ...

402
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,650
This is wallpaper, definitely.
Scrap paper.

403
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,530
Crazy money, coin dispenser, toy money,
Monopoly ...

404
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,231
You mean counterfeit money.

405
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:28,041
Did I not just?
You must be careful, Black.

406
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,400
You could make something of learning.
The Block, sir.

407
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,351
What?
- My name.

408
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,800
I already know your name
You need a 4-1-1 call on the Mulla Bulla.

409
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:43,500
We have a vendor with counterfeit money
In the next room.

410
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,260
Seller with counterfeit money, next?
Interesting strategy ...

411
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:56,160
These men will stop at nothing in return.
- No, no, a victim sitting right.

412
00:35:57,383 --> 00:36:00,725
Try now more clearly
to speak, Beck.

413
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,529
Nobody understands a word
what you say.

414
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,790
McLoosh,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

415
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,951
What is your name, boy?
- Walter Crump, Mr

416
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,825
Well, Crumpmijnheer,
where did you get that wallpaper from?

417
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,610
What?
- Who gave you that money, Walter.

418
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,200
I am quite sure
it was a bunch of children.

419
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:28,050
Children? What do you mean? Diapers,
bedplassertjes? A joke surely?

420
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,560
No, a girl and boy,
approximately six and twelve years.

421
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:34,665
Bought a mini scooter, cash.
$ 2000, incredible, huh?

422
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:38,280
And you were not a ietsiepietsie
suspicious?

423
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,330
Yeah, but they said they Lottery
won.

424
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:44,385
This can happen, huh? My brother won
's 50 with a peak ticket.

425
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:50,120
The lottery? Jesus, Louis Clump, which
were you when I used cars sold?

426
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,180
No idea.

427
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:56,400
Inspector, there is everywhere in 't center
counterfeit money surfaced.

428
00:36:56,401 --> 00:37:01,040
Toy Land, The Gap, the Fruit Basket,
and many candy stores.

429
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:06,230
Every vendor says' t the same, two
Children who have won the lottery.

430
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:08,650
Exactly what I said, huh?

431
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:13,225
Here are their alerts
and an address ...

432
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,160
where a scooter Minin Delivery
should be.

433
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:21,070
Well well, that's a big mistake.
Us their fucking address.

434
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:26,205
Well guys, they will be our Christmas
mind again shown.

435
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,700
This is the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
We have a search warrant.

436
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:51,960
You have 60 seconds to open the door.
1 2 3 ... 60. Trap him in.

437
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,950
"Looks like their operation
want to move.

438
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,760
Search 's house.
- What are we looking for?

439
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,770
For clues, look, money,
everything is suspect.

440
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:19,150
That the two children,
and this is the man behind it, Mr. Big.

441
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,251
I 't scan and fax to McLoosh.
- Well, yes.

442
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,170
All books are my hope thrown.
- Good

443
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,871
Throw it there but to hope.

444
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,300
Now we have,
they are easy to find.

445
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:45,070
Enrico, this increases, make copies and
give them to any company in 't Center.

446
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,115
We need to catch criminals.

447
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,900
My name is Block, sir.

448
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,990
Where are they?

449
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,925
Great, they are gone. If I
rotzakjes think, I killed them.

450
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:04,515
If I
rotzakjes think, I killed them.

451
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,316
What if they all broke?

452
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,090
No worries, sun,
they never come out.

453
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:13,733
I have agents who assist each exit.
- Yes, but with so many people here ...

454
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,500
Mr. Bock, my people are very good
trained security experts.

455
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,250
A look at the pictures, and faces
are forever imprinted in their brains.

456
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,900
They are really not over
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

457
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,651
Believe me.

458
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,202
I can not believe what I
to say, but ...

459
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:31,253
I can think of nothing
to buy.

460
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:35,704
Me neither. I have a stomach ache.
How much money do we have?

461
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,300
No idea.
Seems still one million U.S. dollars.

462
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,340
I'm in hell.

463
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:57,925
You know, if they are in here,
they may stay in here.

464
00:39:58,126 --> 00:39:59,626
I'm out.

465
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,570
Yeah, sure,
I 'm not even once.

466
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,530
Hey, nice to you again ...

467
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,440
Oh my God, it's you.

468
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:19,375
You are her.
- Pardon?

469
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,210
Of the pool.
The girl with the red bikini.

470
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,361
I tried to reach you,
but then someone else, and ...

471
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:26,812
and then I thought again that someone
otherwise, but ...

472
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,975
This time you're you.

473
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:33,865
Come on and try me again.
- Sorry, I'm a little excited.

474
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,620
Hi, I'm Danny Saunders.
- Shane Rivers.

475
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,870
Shane did you say?
- Yeah, why?

476
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:45,875
Just to know you well or I
I understand.

477
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,550
What are you doing here in the playground,
Shane?

478
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,390
I'm looking for my little sister.
She 's cell phone off.

479
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,420
I have killed her later.
What are you doing here, Danny?

480
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,350
I'm looking for my brother and little sister.
- And, lucky?

481
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,050
No. I think that I did with the trains
try.

482
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:05,975
And the Juice Centrifuge?
- The Juice centrifuge?

483
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,760
You think ...
- You can not know ...

484
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,360
I think that's a very good idea.
- Okay.

485
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,300
When they arrive, they stay here.
We go. Come.

486
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:27,455
Can not we who ride
try? - No.

487
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,510
What you eat there?
- An apple.

488
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,420
There is something.
- A simple red apple.

489
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:34,875
There is candy on.
You're sweet on 't eat. Enter here ...

490
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,400
Merry Christmas.

491
00:41:54,415 --> 00:42:00,015
Hello. I would like this to my map
pay, please.

492
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,640
This is for my wife.
- Sure.

493
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:11,200
Will they like. Right?
- Sure.

494
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,770
If your husband would give you something ...

495
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:16,625
I'm sorry sir, but the map
is not good.

496
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,635
Not good? How do you not?
- He was rejected.

497
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:26,755
Oh, great.
I just moved from Los Angeles ...

498
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:30,855
I think the card is marked.
Try it only "s, I promise ...

499
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:34,280
Hurry.
- That he is good. Please.

500
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:41,175
Sorry, folks.
- Your friend will thank you.

501
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,550
Rejected again, sir.
Do you have another sir?

502
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,200
No, I do not.
- Cash, checks, perhaps?

503
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,520
Checks, I do.
- Then go to that row.

504
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:56,990
Here it only cash and card.
- What? - Next!

505
00:42:57,935 --> 00:43:00,705
I have almost one hours in the row
stood.

506
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,750
Then you had better be on the board
watch. Only cash and card.

507
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,255
I did not know when I went in this row
stand. - Next please.

508
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,220
Wait a minute, I was not ready.
Oh, yes hear.

509
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,450
Keep moving. Thank you

510
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,950
I'm in hell.

511
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,240
This is unbelievable.

512
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:31,955
You could not count right?

513
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,673
Pardon?
- I said you certainly could not count.

514
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,260
I can see.
You look like you need something cool.

515
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,610
Welcome to the club.
I could not count.

516
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:48,150
You take 't quite lightly.
- What do you think?

517
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,500
If one thing I learned is that the
things naturally be fine ...

518
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,201
in one way or another.

519
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:58,220
Is that so?
- Believe me, I know how hard it's ...

520
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,450
Traveling at Christmas time.

521
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,320
I have to meet people ...

522
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:09,700
And I mean, many people,
and yet, I'm here.

523
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:16,320
But I know that everything is going.
I've never missed a Christmas.

524
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,845
<i> Christopher Kringle, you want to
American Airlines ticket counter come? </ I>

525
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:27,495
That's me. I said it anyway? If you
't really want, everything is always good.

526
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:31,695
You need only a little
confidence. That's it.

527
00:44:31,696 --> 00:44:32,896
<i> Mr. Kringle ...</ i>

528
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:39,000
Merry Christmas, Judy.
- Well, Merry Christmas.

529
00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:44,985
Hey, how do you know my name?

530
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:12,255
Rough day?

531
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:21,000
I will make it this way: If they ever Christmas
do away, I feel fine.

532
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,660
Wait a minute, friend.
You did it on my job.

533
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,960
Do not worry, you can always find something.
You may be Easter Bunny ...

534
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,520
But all these children?

535
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,380
Think 's what they will miss,
abolished as Christmas is.

536
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,400
Not much if you ask me.

537
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,650
Sounds like you forgot how it is
to a child at Christmas time to have.

538
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:47,995
To be honest, I do not know
not how it is, a child.

539
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,245
Have you forgotten who then bangs,
you got it for Christmas ...

540
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,450
when you were eight years old?

541
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,640
Oh, yes ...
How could I forget?

542
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,700
I expected nothing,
that Christmas, because my father was broke.

543
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:12,345
But, sure, on Christmas morning,
there he was, behind the house ...

544
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,260
Little Lightning.

545
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:20,400
Did you know he had two extra jobs,
that your pony can give?

546
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:24,000
Because he knew how to love you
horses.

547
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:26,225
Really?

548
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:30,220
Two jobs?
I did not.

549
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:33,315
Wait a minute ...

550
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,170
How do you know?

551
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,470
Pardon,
Sat Santa just is not there?

552
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,710
Santa Claus?
You know, white beard, red jacket ...

553
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:00,200
He sat there,
and then disappeared a bit.

554
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,380
Well, but I think you're crazy.

555
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,370
But maybe I'm right.

556
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,600
We have him.

557
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,550
Yes, against the wall, you.
Your identity, come on, bitches.

558
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,960
What is this?

559
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,720
McLoosh,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

560
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,000
You are arrested,
gozertje crazy money.

561
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:28,605
Arrested?
But I did nothing.

562
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,260
Nothing else than $ 10,000
wallpaper issued.

563
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:37,305
Wallpaper, what?
- Counterfeit money, you do not like the stupid.

564
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,750
Counterfeit money? Impossible.
I have no money spent.

565
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,010
Of course not.
And I have monkeys flying around me.

566
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,000
You what?

567
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:48,051
You have made a big mistake,
snotoog ...

568
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,160
These mini scooter to your home address
delivered.

569
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,520
You make the mistake, not me.
- Yes, of course, hear.

570
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,320
Rico, scrap bucket to get here
from me.

571
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:00,771
Otherwise I vomit it all down.

572
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,720
That 's people. It is here
nothing to see. Keep moving.

573
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,500
Oh you, we are in trouble.
- Why have they caught on Dad?

574
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,470
Say, in big trouble.

575
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,000
What is going on?
- We have counterfeit money spent, I think.

576
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,000
False, what is that? Common?
- That means that it is not good stuff.

577
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,600
Not good?

578
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,660
It also means that the real owner,
is now looking to us.

579
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,570
And I think it 's not nice
people.

580
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:38,955
That makes no sense. Why should Santa
give us money that is not good?

581
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,140
Come on.

582
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,450
We need to find Danny.

583
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,800
They make that money itself, but it looks
there really.

584
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,440
And only stupid people buy
there stuff.

585
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,650
So it's really no money.
- No, but for bad people do.

586
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:05,520
But it is so busy, they have established
Who has not seen the money found.

587
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,780
That's not quite right, I think.

588
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,150
Day children.
How are you guys doing?

589
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,670
Do you have a minute?

590
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,490
Relax, as Lennert says, it takes
but a minute. Only a few questions.

591
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,420
Look out!
Let me go!

592
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,140
I think you have something
ours is.

593
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,010
You need something more precise,
what you mean.

594
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:43,385
The bag, which you have found,
with the money in it.

595
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,720
We have no bag of money found.
Not fair.

596
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,110
You know what I think?
I think the money sits in your backpack.

597
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,970
No, not true.
- Really? But let's see.

598
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,170
I need you to show anything.

599
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,350
I sometimes tougher action against
you? I have a knife.

600
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,420
It is a folding knife,
and he does not know how to open.

601
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,730
Shut up.

602
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,822
Do not listen to him, he is tapped.
I have a knife ...

603
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,930
and I really know how to open.

604
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:10,156
What will 't be, lad?

605
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,200
What do you think happens when we
suddenly started screaming?

606
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,435
Really hard?

607
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,740
On Christmas Eve, in a busy mall?
Probably nothing.

608
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:24,591
Do it is so hard you can.

609
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:27,983
Mary, do it, please.

610
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,940
Good, good.
Enough.

611
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,970
Happy,
I was afraid of that child.

612
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,960
Happy now?
Nothing happened.

613
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,611
Be a smart boy,
and give me the bag.

614
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,851
<i> Excuse me.
Step aside, boy. </ I>

615
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:53,330
'Thank you, Grandpa.
Glad I could help you, son.

616
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,475
There they go.
Hey, hey, wait. Walk, not run.

617
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:04,600
You attract too much attention otherwise.
Just walk. Well.

618
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:31,955
Hey, Jack, look what you do.
We are chased by those two.

619
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,100
I don 't.

620
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,675
Do not worry,
I count it off with those bad men.

621
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:49,820
What are you doing, gentlemen?
Dear children bother?

622
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,570
I remember about the police
to report.

623
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,090
Okay, lady, do not get on.
We were just playing what.

624
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,250
Yes, Ginger, we were just
some fun with the kids, that's all.

625
00:52:03,545 --> 00:52:06,295
Gosh, how do you know her name?

626
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,930
How do you, smart guy?

627
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,180
Where is it? And do not say, "what is true ',
because then I bite your head off.

628
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:18,765
It's in his backpack.

629
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:22,895
Do you?

630
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,260
Here is t then.

631
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,110
Okay, run, run!
- Oh, my nose!

632
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,695
All right?
- Not important, grab those kids.

633
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:38,155
If he is not broken.
I have a lot of money paid for that nose.

634
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,260
Okay, Saunders,
what have you done with the record?

635
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:50,361
The plates?

636
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,970
They are still not unpacked, we have
they leave the bar.

637
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,450
Have you created them?
- Created?

638
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,150
Of course not. I thought we
They had come to the Hema.

639
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,530
Oh, one funny guy.
See us laugh?

640
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,900
You think you're very clever, huh?
The grapjak hang.

641
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,150
That is not my Saunders.
I am an expert.

642
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,280
Why do not you tell us where
the rest of the gang is?

643
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,070
And you make it yourself easier.
- What kind of gang? I have no gang.

644
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:25,670
Oh, yeah?
Well, how do you explain this?

645
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,460
This is your hand, I think.

646
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,350
Of course it's my hand.
I know I do.

647
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,900
McLooshe provided it.
- I mean it, yes.

648
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,110
Where did you get that?
- From where do you think?

649
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:47,200
You had your kids say,
using a fake address ...

650
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,940
Mr. Big Brain behind the whole operation.

651
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,250
What have my children
this make?

652
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:55,401
If you know them even with a finger
have touched ...

653
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,543
Then what are you doing?

654
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,930
Then I sit.

655
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,125
I am ...
I am calm.

656
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,910
And, if you have no objection,
I now see my children.

657
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,700
Guess
We would also like to see them.

658
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:21,470
Tell us why,
like a good boy, where they are.

659
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:25,595
I do not know where they are.
Not exactly.

660
00:54:26,406 --> 00:54:29,256
I saw them one hours ago with Santa
left.

661
00:54:29,257 --> 00:54:34,932
Santa Claus?
And we should believe that story?

662
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,910
Okay ...
they are gone.

663
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,235
What are you doing?

664
00:54:58,415 --> 00:55:02,365
If those guys that get at,
Dad's innocence, we can never prove.

665
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,316
We leave it here,
and retrieve it later on. Come on.

666
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:07,967
We find Danny,
He knows what to do

667
00:55:15,285 --> 00:55:17,535
Danny will have to wait for us to
Santa Claus.

668
00:55:17,835 --> 00:55:21,415
You see the villains here somewhere?
- No, nothing to see.

669
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,125
There they are.
Look ... Hurry!

670
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:28,276
We need to Danny.
What should we do, Brian?

671
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:31,805
Quick ...
Ready? Sliding it!

672
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:36,945
If they could, that we too.
- If you say so.

673
00:55:41,065 --> 00:55:42,565
Come we go.

674
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,955
Would you please rely on me?

675
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,710
Thank you

676
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,975
Tell ...
How long you been living in Edmonton, Danny?

677
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,840
54 hours and 37 minutes exactly.

678
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:15,591
You kidding?
I live here myself only two weeks.

679
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,855
Really?
Where are you from?

680
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:20,855
Los Angeles.
Really? Me too.

681
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:23,720
We had to move,
My father lost his job.

682
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,922
My father.
Too crazy ...

683
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,470
We are brought together
by unemployment.

684
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:34,705
Do you like it here?
- Fair? I hate t.

685
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,300
Me too.

686
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,150
It sucks here.
- That is exactly what I said.

687
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:42,665
This is great.
We have much in common.

688
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,210
Including missing family members.
We had them but at start searching.

689
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:47,711
Yeah, well.

690
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,150
First, here drink this, and then search.

691
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:55,640
Thus, the very rotzakjes should they
not into trouble?

692
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,570
Which way?

693
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,400
This way, come on.

694
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,310
You go left, I right.

695
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,340
Shop the ghost lives here?
- No, no that I only imagined.

696
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,450
It seems like he lives here.
No, because I got it but invented.

697
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,300
What was that noise?

698
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,471
I think ... the boiler.

699
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,440
Okay, I'm not afraid.
- Well, because there is no reason to.

700
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,380
As I said,
there is no shop spo ...

701
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,650
We are not afraid of a boiler,
but maybe we should go back.

702
00:58:39,865 --> 00:58:42,085
Yes, I think.

703
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,280
Walk, walk.

704
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:14,615
We have here, come.

705
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,610
Too bad you do not want to play along.
Give the money back.

706
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,500
Mary, run, now!

707
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,615
You want to have money, muff ...
Come 't get it.

708
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,980
Well do I cut you, kid.

709
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,610
Gotcha!
- Oh, Danny, glad you 're t.

710
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,800
Beautiful.
What are you doing? Let go.

711
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:43,700
From my life Never thought that I
's would be glad to see you.

712
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,490
My little brother,
We are a close family.

713
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,450
Get off me.

714
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:53,005
You will not believe what happened.
It is unbelievable.

715
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:56,675
Where have you been?
You would wait for me with Santa.

716
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:58,526
We did too.

717
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,675
Where's Mary?

718
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:04,400
I do not know. Those two guys were
after us in the basement ...

719
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,500
I went one way,
inform the other.

720
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,165
Guys chasing you?
Brian, what are you talking about.

721
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,810
The last time I saw her, we were
here. - Yes, of course.

722
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,350
And where is all this fake money remained
you would have found?

723
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,501
I have a window pop
left. - A pop window?

724
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,900
You think I believe all this,
Brian?

725
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,015
I think he is telling the truth,
He looks too scared to lie.

726
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:28,970
Thank you.
You deserve this woman.

727
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,875
He looks scared, because he knows
Mary that he has lost.

728
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:34,182
And he invents a strange story
order to cover themselves.

729
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,310
Let's go find Dad.

730
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,890
Yes, there is a little bad news
about papa.

731
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,105
He is ... a little
arrested.

732
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:51,170
Arrested?
't Is always fun.

733
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:53,605
The truth is Danny.

734
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:59,225
Oh dear, there he is again.
- Him?

735
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:03,115
Who again?
- The ghost store.

736
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,880
Yeah, come on,
Well there's a ghost?

737
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,265
See you.
I told you.

738
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,750
Hello.
Where have you been?

739
01:03:23,365 --> 01:03:28,150
How are you? Everything good?
Yeah, well, Bob has to me appropriate.

740
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,120
Thank you, sir.

741
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:32,935
Dad would have killed us,
if something had happened to Mary.

742
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,040
Bob is the dog?
And who is that?

743
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:47,501
He is a wolf.
- Bob the dog, along with a wolf.

744
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,550
That's as logical
when all else today.

745
01:03:51,075 --> 01:03:55,200
Sir, we need to monitor,
Our father was arrested.

746
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:58,350
Can you tell us how to get there?
- Sure.

747
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,700
I know this road,
though I have built it myself.

748
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,980
You're not really shopping ghost, huh?
- Maybe, maybe not.

749
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,900
That you can decide.
- Wait a minute ...

750
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:16,520
there is no shop phantom. I have
invented just for Mary.

751
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:20,550
Really? You have a vivid
fantasy, young man, because here I am.

752
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,610
In person.
Or not.

753
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,930
Does that mean that you served our minced
and Bob will carry us?

754
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:28,881
Then you already have a hamburger.

755
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,285
But Mary says that you have enough
sitting in the nests.

756
01:04:31,295 --> 01:04:35,650
Bob should just settle with porridge,
today. - Thank you.

757
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,270
The monitoring is on the ground floor,
opposite the rink.

758
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:44,350
By the way, the stairs,
and the white door. Understood?

759
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:49,260
White door at the top of the stairs.
And not the red door under the stairs.

760
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,030
Why not?
- You would then reach the North Pole.

761
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,150
Thank you sir.
- Sure.

762
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,515
Bob Day.

763
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,645
Merry Christmas, Wolf.
- Happy Christmas, my angel.

764
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,130
And what I remember about the red door
said.

765
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,070
The Arctic, yes, of course ...

766
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:14,921
I think what higher
located on the map, Caspar.

767
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,780
Brian, hurry.

768
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,810
's Let's see.

769
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,045
Hello.
How are you guys doing?

770
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,995
Is this sometimes ... the Arctic?

771
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:04,005
Well, okay.
I wanted to know.

772
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,600
The best then.

773
01:06:15,325 --> 01:06:17,225
Hello ...

774
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,395
What are you 't do, Brian?
- What?

775
01:06:26,225 --> 01:06:29,825
Nothing.
- It was the Arctic, eh?

776
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,530
Of course not.
You're kidding, right?

777
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,140
Do not be ridiculous.

778
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:39,755
Do you want come and see?
- I want nothing.

779
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,715
Let us go.
- Quiet stand, lean forward.

780
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,140
You have the wrong people.

781
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,220
Is this bad, Brian?
- Worse, is an understatement ...

782
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,523
This is heavy shit.

783
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:05,233
We take you.
Well, aside, RMCP business.

784
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,200
Now we do.
Come.

785
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,125
What do we do?
- Dad and Danny off the hook to help.

786
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,065
How?
- We get the backpack of the window pop ...

787
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:24,721
And they lure the creeps,
so 't police agency.

788
01:07:24,935 --> 01:07:28,750
So we do.
But first, in the spirit of Christmas ...

789
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,200
Do they get a present from the
Saunders family.

790
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,600
What then?
A neatly packed revenge.

791
01:08:14,585 --> 01:08:17,000
You know what to do?
Yes, sir.

792
01:08:17,075 --> 01:08:19,500
Then we go for it.

793
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:24,570
My brother and sister have the money
found, they did not know that 't was false.

794
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:26,650
They thought he of Santa Claus came.

795
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,850
And now they are chasing
by two creeps.

796
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,600
Creeps? McLooosh,
my kids are in trouble ...

797
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,200
I gotta right to search them.
- You ...

798
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,500
have the right to remain silent.
And that 's about it.

799
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,400
And your not going anywhere.
Except for the bucket.

800
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,400
Rica, to bring these three 's office.

801
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:48,570
Perhaps what they are talkative,
After a night in prison.

802
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:52,255
Yes, sir.
And, sir, my name is Smith.

803
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,950
Smith? Really?

804
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:03,075
Who of you is Rico?
- None of us is called Rico, sir.

805
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:09,545
Well then, we are glad that the world
have helped.

806
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:20,895
Smit So, you ... and others who take
Donald and Sherry in your car ...

807
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,260
Sandstrm I do in mine.

808
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,155
Is that clear?
- Yes.

809
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:32,365
Well.

810
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,970
Damn stupid place for a closet.

811
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,995
Come there with me for the wire,
what excuse is it this time?

812
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:10,015
That little shit has me in a Wells
thrown.

813
01:10:10,016 --> 01:10:11,400
With man-eating sharks,

814
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:15,151
And I was chased by a
zuurdruipend ghost, with strange eyes.

815
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:19,302
I understand. People eating sharks,
zuurdruipende and ghosts.

816
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,905
You actually say that you
still not have the money.

817
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,906
Unbelievable.

818
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,915
I the new color of your hair beautiful.
Thank you.

819
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:31,908
But you keep an idiot.

820
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,550
Watch out.
Aside.

821
01:10:39,075 --> 01:10:42,300
Hello,
Council 's what I have in my backpack?

822
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:51,025
Stay there not sit back there.
And this time grab the money.

823
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:30,485
Looking for this sometimes happen?

824
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:36,590
Enough. I will myself
care for the little rat.

825
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:42,925
Look out!

826
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,085
Let me go!

827
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,020
Hey!

828
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:28,710
Hey, I got a hat.
- Forget that stupid hat, I see nothing.

829
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,400
Get that thing off me!

830
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,500
What is that?

831
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:45,010
Oh, no!

832
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:25,775
I see nothing.
- Just go straight.

833
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,755
Leonard, you may be better left.
Left!

834
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:39,792
Oh oh, what?

835
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,700
Obliterated.

836
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:48,350
Little girl ... if you want the roof,
you passed me.

837
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:50,251
And that does not happen.

838
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:53,210
Stop the Thunder
and come forth.

839
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:56,850
I will hurt you.
Parole

840
01:14:57,051 --> 01:14:59,801
Okay, Madam, you have won.
I give 't on.

841
01:15:04,565 --> 01:15:07,950
That's a very smart girl.

842
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:24,260
Well, give me the money,
you can go home.

843
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,530
You can have it.
Please.

844
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:33,810
Just kidding!
- Oh no!

845
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,295
Look, the show will begin.

846
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:56,800
Come on baby, give me your hand.
You're a nice girl, huh baby

847
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,730
I'm a nice girl ...
than most.

848
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,770
No, do not.

849
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,410
Money!

850
01:16:20,355 --> 01:16:23,105
I give you half.
You can get half.

851
01:16:23,206 --> 01:16:26,156
That does not, you may all
have. Please.

852
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:28,905
No!

853
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,910
So nice that you came in fall.

854
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:45,500
This girl is amazing.
- Go get dr.

855
01:16:59,355 --> 01:17:01,205
What are you watching,
visvreter?

856
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:22,965
That's really funny, huh.
- Look, sir, the money!

857
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,230
What?
- The counterfeit money.

858
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,140
Counterfeit money,
I smell miles away.

859
01:17:29,455 --> 01:17:31,405
Where did you say it was?

860
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,375
Inspector ...
- Yes, I am.

861
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,060
Look at what we are in the pool
found.

862
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:50,730
Who 's name again.
- These are the Cardoza brothers.

863
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:53,540
Leonard and Sheldon,
You know everything about them, of course.

864
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:58,310
Of course. The Carbenzol brothers,
Larry and Seamore.

865
01:17:58,705 --> 01:18:00,655
I never forget a face.

866
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,250
What have you creeps in
my children done?

867
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,150
We are your children? Look rather
what we have done with your kids!

868
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,360
Really?
That my children have done?

869
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,920
Excuse me, can we get through.
- Do not push.

870
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,420
Inspector,
Look at where the cat came into incitement.

871
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:26,665
If not ...
You know ..

872
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,650
This is Ginger Peachum, Inspector
You know everything about her.

873
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:34,430
Who does not?
The notorious Gina Bietbil.

874
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,145
I had a feeling
that you were involved.

875
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,746
Rico ...

876
01:18:40,847 --> 01:18:42,547
or whatever your name is ...

877
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,970
take her away, with the others.

878
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,250
Well, come on, we go.
- Come on big boy.

879
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:56,775
Great! Solved.
First class, gentlemen! We're going home.

880
01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:00,200
Sir ...
What of him, sir?

881
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:05,300
Oh, yes well.
Smit, Rudolf ...

882
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,440
how dare you this honorable
to arrest people.

883
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,900
Let them immediately Fri
I'm in the truck.

884
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:19,400
If the van ...
or where we come along.

885
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:24,950
Well, well ...
Silent night ...

886
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:31,600
Wow.
- There is something seriously wrong with your boss.

887
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,025
You did not you noticed?
- Was once a good guy ...

888
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:37,640
Never become old, after which
horse kicked at his head.

889
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,600
Get all those notes out of the water.

890
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,695
I do not know if you ever had a reindeer
talks, if so ...

891
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,700
Rudolf then remember to
I am moved.

892
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,560
You look like you do not completely
understand.

893
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,450
Thanks, you're a true friend.

894
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,450
What are you doing?
- Talking to the seals.

895
01:20:07,735 --> 01:20:09,685
What did I say about it nou?

896
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:14,580
Hello ...
How 're you?

897
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:18,485
Come, we have to pa.

898
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,840
Here is your jacket.

899
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:39,420
I must go, there's my mother.

900
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,305
And she has found Sarah.

901
01:20:44,265 --> 01:20:49,400
Shall we agree on Friday night?
- Sure. Of course.

902
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,300
If I do not get house arrest,
for the rest of my life.

903
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:55,525
Call me.
If I call you.

904
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,450
It was very nice.
And you know ...

905
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,100
I have not thought of California,
since our meeting.

906
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,960
Me neither.

907
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:08,010
Day

908
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,450
What are you watching?

909
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:20,590
Oh, nothing.
- Edmonton is still fucking nou?

910
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,650
Get ready for the big event,
there is pa.

911
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:38,950
Hi, guys.
- I am not really looking out.

912
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,300
Daddy!

913
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,200
You OK, honey?
- Everything is fine with me, Dad.

914
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:50,101
You look a little scared.

915
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,920
Council 's. ..
The great news is ...

916
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:04,850
We have three tickets for
the park for the whole year.

917
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,730
The bad news is ...

918
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:12,380
that we as counterfeiters arrested
should be to get them.

919
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:15,540
That's my fault pa.
The whole gang is my fault.

920
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,400
It was not Brian's fault, Dad.
It was mine.

921
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:23,030
I'm Brian and Mary left alone,
as you had said not to.

922
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:28,100
Well, technically, correct.
But then, it's all my fault.

923
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,590
If I had not only left alone ...

924
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,915
It was my idea to the money is
to spend.

925
01:22:33,405 --> 01:22:36,445
Stop it, both.
It comes down to ...

926
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,910
that you both your little sister
neglected.

927
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:42,110
I am good care of myself, papa.

928
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,220
And I would be furious at you,
that you were so irresponsible.

929
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,460
And I am angry.

930
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,920
But ...

931
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:57,280
I'm much happier that it good to
you go, then I'm furious.

932
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,650
But you must promise me one thing ...

933
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:03,950
If I ever 's ask for your sister
to adapt ...

934
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,510
then you do that, whatever happens.
Agreed?

935
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:12,565
Ok.
- Sure.

936
01:23:12,575 --> 01:23:15,325
And now ...
we go home.

937
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:24,100
I can say, now,
we all do Christmas shopping in July.

938
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:32,120
Okay, come here, my little.

939
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:35,750
You now have a girl, huh?

940
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,600
Wayne Saunders, and family?
- Yes, sir.

941
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
Sam Nichols, the owner of this place.

942
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:56,520
Annoying with you what happened.
Well glad it's good ends.

943
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,430
Yes, we.

944
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,650
Amazing
how sometimes everything is still good, huh?

945
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,600
Well, I wish you a happy ...

946
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:11,925
Say, you happen to know something about
working on a ranch?

947
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,310
Certainly, there am I
grown up, why?

948
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,560
You look a little like this.

949
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,800
The reason that I did ask is that I
that have little plot in the north.

950
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:27,900
400 acres, 50 horses, 300 pieces
cattle ...

951
01:24:29,115 --> 01:24:31,685
I even have some dozen reindeer.

952
01:24:31,995 --> 01:24:35,900
My husband called me, and resigned.
Looking for someone to "manage up.

953
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,970
If you already interested, come over here
along, after the holidays, right?.

954
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:45,610
Well, I will do.
Thank you

955
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:52,420
Fine. Well, a happy Christmas,
to all of you.

956
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:55,210
You too, sir.
- Happy Christmas.

957
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:06,120
That was strange.
Come on, we go ...

958
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:10,405
I've seen that man somewhere.

959
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,600
It reminds me of something, after all,
We have no Christmas presents.

960
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:28,840
Never mind. We need nothing.
- Yes, family is still the most important.

961
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,510
What did you just say?
- I do not know what possessed me.

962
01:25:35,395 --> 01:25:37,835
I am not myself.
- Come here silly.

963
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,350
Danny,
Santa can you try to repair ...

964
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:55,760
Oh, my God ...
What happened here?

965
01:25:56,605 --> 01:26:00,735
Look here 's, order a search
Inspector Gordon McLooshe.

966
01:26:00,835 --> 01:26:03,300
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

967
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:04,901
Unbelievable.

968
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:09,760
The beauty is that
They already have us unpack.

969
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:15,525
Shall we go away?
- No, not after today. I can not.

970
01:26:15,535 --> 01:26:18,635
Let 's tomorrow. We order
's pizza, and go' s movie.

971
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,545
Extra large, and double cheese?
Salami and mushrooms?

972
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,700
And many Canadian bacon.

973
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,460
Oh, my God.

974
01:27:19,255 --> 01:27:21,155
Good morning, darling.

975
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,350
Hey, my Julia.

976
01:27:26,155 --> 01:27:31,100
What am I happy.
- Mommy!

977
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,650
I knew you'd be with
Christmas, I knew it simply.

978
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,900
Mom, you've "made it.
- Ma, you're there.

979
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,440
I must do to be
if you do open your presents?

980
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:46,240
Oh, listen, about ...
- I know 't. I was shocked ...

981
01:27:46,635 --> 01:27:48,500
I will never understand ...
- No, no, I can ...

982
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:50,800
How the house as soon as ready
given you.

983
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,060
How ready are you?

984
01:27:53,635 --> 01:28:00,000
The tree, the presents ...
Oh Wayne, it is beautiful.

985
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,600
Oh yeah?

986
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:32,690
I am so proud of you.
It's fantastic.

987
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:35,141
You must all night long
have been.

988
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:41,130
Not really.
- Yes, it wasn 't, eh Dad?

989
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,331
Yeah, right.

990
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:47,835
Well I do my part,
I make the best Christmas ever.

991
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:50,185
You still have to
's turkey thought, huh?

992
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,270
Kalkoe ...?
You know how hard turkey ...

993
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,900
Wayne!
Beautiful.

994
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,470
Of course I have turkey,
what is Christmas without turkey.

995
01:29:07,495 --> 01:29:09,195
What is this?

996
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,850
<i> Dear Mary,
Thanks for the milk and cookies. </ I>

997
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:28,300
<i> I would have eaten them too, but
Mrs. Claus wants me to go lines. </ i>

998
01:29:28,755 --> 01:29:31,305
<i> I'm so glad everything is good
past. </ i>

999
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:34,855
<i> But you knew all along eh? </ i>

1000
01:29:35,815 --> 01:29:39,180
<i> Thank you for believing in me.
Mary. </ I>

1001
01:29:44,155 --> 01:29:47,750
<i> I think that Danny and Brian
