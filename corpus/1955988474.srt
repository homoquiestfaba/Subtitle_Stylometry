1
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,293
I'd come to this project with many of
the same assumptions that you have

2
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,291
concerning the Jersey Devil murders
and the guilt of Jim Suerd

3
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,867
His characterization as a troubled
young man responsible for a spree of

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,709
The question in my mind had been
why ?

5
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,442
Why would a man commit such
crimes?

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,317
After reviewing hours of archived
footage generated by Steven Avkast

7
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,249
and Locus Wheeler, the hosts of
Fact or Fiction,

8
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,225
I've been forced to
change my perspective.

9
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,830
The question for me now is What?

10
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,963
What really happened that night, and
is Jim Suerd truly responsible?

11
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:16,434
Ironically in the course of this
project, Jim Suerd has died in prison

12
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,907
under mysterious causes.

13
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,547
His death will forever shroud the
reconciliation of this case.

14
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,979
As they said on Fact or Fiction,
you decide.

15
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,844
911, what is your emergency?

16
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,647
My name is Jim Suerd, and I just
hitchhiked here from the middle of

17
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:04,452
the pine barrens, and I can't seem to
find the people I was in the pine

18
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,026
Barrens with- and I was cam ping
with them last night doing a project.

19
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:07,919
Are you lost?

20
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,856
I'm not I'm not lost, I'm just trying,
just trying to... I can't find the

21
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:17,938
people that drove me here. I looked
around for them and I went back to

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,304
nowhere to be found... I don't know
where they are...

23
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,509
The vehicle is still there?

24
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,739
The vehicle is still there and I had to
hitchhike to this pay phone.

25
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,610
How far are you from the vehicle
right now?

26
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,049
About... about five, ten miles,
I don't know.

27
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,490
Okay Jim, we'll send someone out.

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,518
Yeah, you should send someone
out... I don't know... I have a bad

29
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:46,098
feeling. You might wanna send
someone out quickly and uh...

30
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:59,340
WBRK time it is 5:00". it's time for
afternoon drive you love so much-.

31
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,391
Hey guess who made the missing
reports? It's those hosts from

32
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,111
Factor Fiction. Missing. Ha!

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,120
Bob, you know those guys are
going to show up saying

34
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,552
"surprise did you miss us?"

35
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,883
Let's go to the phones and we'll ask
you... do you miss them?

36
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,058
We have found bodies. At this time
we don't know who they are

37
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:23,561
or how many we have found.

38
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:29,200
We can not assume at this time that
it is the Factor Fiction crew.

39
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,884
At this time, we have arrested
Jim Suerd for the murders

40
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,148
of Rein Clackin and Locus Wheeler.

41
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,122
Behind me is the house where
Jim Suerd resided till his arrest

42
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,524
nearly seven months ago.

43
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,322
Inside, amongst his dirty laundry,
blood evidence was found

44
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,332
linking him to the grisly
Fact or Fiction murders.

45
00:03:56,003 --> 00:04:00,270
Today Jim's own life hangs in the
balance as Jurors decide his fate.

46
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,086
I had heard of the
Fact or Fiction murders.

47
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,383
They were big news for a period of
one year and then like so many

48
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,788
things in today's fast paced
world, were forgotten.

49
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,431
I was intrigued by how this case, this
story, was so well documented.

50
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,600
How, in spite of the remote
location of the murders

51
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,273
and the rural nature of the people
prosecuting Jim, that these were

52
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,806
murders of a high tech age.

53
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,304
I was intrigued by the fact that the
four individuals were indeed

54
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,972
children of a digital age.

55
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,481
Mostly though, I wondered why the
man named Jim Suerd would

56
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,714
commit such horrendous
acts of violence.

57
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:20,715
This is Johnny

58
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,625
and we are live in the pine barrens
where tonight we are doing a first

59
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:33,859
ever internet broadcast, cable, ham
radio broadcast All live- all real -

60
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,166
and we are doing with the help of a
psychic and a sound man who

61
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,636
has the ability to record sounds from
other worlds, otherworldly sounds.

62
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,943
Yeah, that's right Steven. We're here
in the Pine Barrens; southern

63
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,311
New Jersey live and direct, coming
right at you in your living room.

64
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:56,181
First ever web simulcast, cablecast
and everybody is on the edge

65
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,624
of their seat. And I know you are,
because I am and I'm sure

66
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,420
Steven is too.

67
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,094
A little later we're going to be
showing you the campsite

68
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,758
but right now we're going to do a
little recapping and you're going to

69
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,866
see some tape of the history of the
legend of the Pine Barrens

70
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:11,936
and the Jersey Devil.

71
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:22,414
They lived their show; Factor
Fiction. Here's this real eerie

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,818
circumstance that comes into
play and they were

73
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,010
actually the victims of it.

74
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,112
He had the opportunity.

75
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,020
It appears as if he had the motive.

76
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:37,194
He did lure those people up there in
a veil of secrecy.

77
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,399
I would say yeah - I think he
fits the profile.

78
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,429
Who was Jim Suerd?

79
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,464
The answer proved more difficult
than I imagined.

80
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,841
His mother had died four months
before the murders;

81
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,406
his father, five years before.

82
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,645
The only two people I was able to
speak with, that actually knew him

83
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,119
personally were his landlady,
Joyce Dryer

84
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,847
and a child Psychologist named
Dr. Orstall.

85
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,193
I was sort of a father figure to
him

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,035
I feel sort of a surrogate father,
if you will.

87
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,607
He didn't talk a whole lot
about his family life,

88
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:27,580
but one of the things I know, his
father left them when he was

89
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,615
very young - ran off with
another woman.

90
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,979
He had few friends, if any.

91
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,852
He was very reclusive.

92
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:44,997
I remember him being a loner, he
seemed to stay in his room quite a bit

93
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,190
when he wasn't at work.

94
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:54,933
And the computer seemed to be a
highlight in his life.

95
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:01,011
With the advent of the internet, of
course he got into that years after I

96
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:05,015
was seeing him... it wasn't even
available, I don't think, at the time.

97
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,557
It opened up a whole new world for
a guy like Jim.

98
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:23,335
Often he would be on the internet,
and of course we know the horrible

99
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:29,774
situation that has come up because
of the internet fiasco with him being

100
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,811
blamed for these murders.

101
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,412
The internet was the first of two
interests that would lead him to the

102
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:40,181
Fact or Fiction show. The second
interest was a bit more obscure.

103
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:46,885
Jim had a fascination with magic, a
true fascination. As I said he was

104
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,928
very reclusive sol believe he must
have spent countless hours in his

105
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:56,401
room, alone, working on tricks. He
used to come in and start the session

106
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:04,537
with a trick. Often it was a simple
card trick. Very quickly he built

107
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,607
skills and became very
proficient at magic.

108
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,311
The internet and magic.

109
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,178
Both interests generally considered
harmless. Both interests that could

110
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:19,226
have a sinister edge to them. Either
way, it was a combination that

111
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,862
virtually sealed his fate with
meeting and Steven Avkast

112
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,706
Locus Wheeler - the hosts of
Fact or Fiction.

113
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,493
Locus Wheeler - the hosts of
Fact or Fiction.

114
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,536
Welcome to Fact or Fiction.

115
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,606
Welcome to Fact or Fiction. We are
rolling, we are on, we are ready to

116
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,649
go. Locus, you joker, you knew
all along we were on didn't you?

117
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,184
Yes, welcome to our new show.
Well actually ifs not a new show,

118
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,483
it's got a new name. Thanks to
everybody out there who helped us

119
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,852
come up with new great name,
Fact or Fiction.

120
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:52,684
That's right.

121
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,786
Fact or fiction was one of those fluke
successes that no television producer

122
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,556
would ever predict. Short on
production value, talent, and

123
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:05,161
execution, it maintained a following
of youth probably more amused by

124
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,373
it's kitsch value than anything else.

125
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,538
Steven Avkast, the creator of Fact or
Fiction, is remembered.

126
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:17,540
Steven - I always got bad vibes
from Steven.

127
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:23,051
He always came in with this
attitude... all he was doing was

128
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,491
making a little cable show...
Nobody ever goes anywhere with

129
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,562
this stuff, but he had this idea that he
was destined for stardom;

130
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,833
that he was going to be rich, millions
of dollars.

131
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:39,304
He basically had that big “director”
stereotype.. like he was a big time

132
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,702
Hollywood director... He really had
to put it in perspective.

133
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,713
Steven's long time friend Locus
Wheeler was the cohost of the show.

134
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:57,781
Their pairing was like oil and water-
Locus- He and Steven would have

135
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:03,639
problems getting along sometimes,
but I think Locus... he knew what he

136
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,532
was doing with this. He knew it was
just a little cable show. I think he

137
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,430
was just in it for the fun.

138
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:14,002
Somehow Steven, a misguided
egomaniac and Locus, a sardonic

139
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:18,476
slacker managed to keep turning
out shows for the better part of 1995.

140
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,978
The ideas were slim, however
they did latch onto one idea

141
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,349
that intrigued many.

142
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:32,382
We are also doing something new
tonight. We are on irc... live... Irc is

143
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:37,260
Well I'll have to say that the one
thing that they did, at first it was

144
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,939
people can ask questions on the
show? Well they tied this into the

145
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,639
internet with IRC chat, so people
could ask questions on the show, but

146
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,809
they rigged up some text to speech
converter so whatever was typed in

147
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,953
was actually said on the show,
like it was a voice.

148
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,949
It was this idea that provided the
impetus for what would ironically

149
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:09,324
give Steven the fame he so craved.
By the fall of 1995 the one joke

150
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,898
television show was losing
popularity. By November

151
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,031
the show was about to self destruct.
Everyone had this sense.

152
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:25,871
Once again, Steven in his
delinquency and procrastination, has

153
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,763
At this desperate time, Steven turned
to viewer suggestions, one of which,

154
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:39,123
would take took hold in his mind.
It provided the seedling

155
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,760
with which Steven hoped to rebuild
the show's popularity.

156
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:49,361
We had an IRC come in the real
eerie voice. It almost drove me

157
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,101
nuts...l almost couldn't stand it
after a while. This voice. Hello...

158
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,743
why don't you do a show about...

159
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:02,175
Why don't you do a show
about the Jersey Devil?"

160
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:08,519
Steven's idea was to do a first ever
live broadcast of Fact or Fiction.

161
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:13,191
It would be broadcast simultaneously
to cable television and the internet.

162
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:17,660
The promotions began immediately,
and with ratings dropping at an ever

163
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,132
increasing speed, the concept was
implemented immediately.

164
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:25,900
This Jersey Devil cable cast; I for
one knew it would never work.

165
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,407
These guys couldn't even make a
halfway decent TV show. Now they

166
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:35,442
wanted to do a live broadcast from
the Pine Barrens; have radio and

167
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:41,052
internet, this and that... I knew it was
going to be a fiasco... I never thought

168
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,385
it would and up they way it did but I
knew it wasn't going to look pretty.

169
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:49,425
Since the show was going to air from
a remote location, Steven hastily

170
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:53,090
looked for people who might be able
to help. A former employer of his,

171
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,968
Sam Woods was approached.

172
00:13:55,869 --> 00:14:00,773
This is the room of Sam Woods.
I used to out his grass.

173
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:09,408
He's a filmmaker. He used to direct
soap operas and we're going to ask if

174
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:15,981
he wants to direct the show, because
he'd be perfect, and he's a “name”.

175
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:23,295
So I've had to talk to Locus and try to
convince him about it... here they

176
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,297
come so I'm going to turn
the camera down.

177
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,759
...and this is Locus.

178
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:38,409
Well they say that up to fifty
thousand people could be watching

179
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:46,119
selling lots of t-shirts, sol
think that's a good sign.

180
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,914
Anyway, we have this idea where we
want to take it in this direction where

181
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,618
it could become much bigger. It
would be really cool if you could

182
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:58,722
help out... direct the show. I know
you used to direct soap operas...

183
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:07,631
This union of cable access show and
former network soap director never

184
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:12,042
made sense to anyone, though it was
later discovered that Steven was

185
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:16,115
paying Sam out of his own pocket,
in an act of desperation to save

186
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:16,806
Fact or Fiction.

187
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,929
Sam Woods, a once successful
television soap director

188
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,438
became one of the people I would
question about these events.

189
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:45,034
In stark contrast to his work, meeting
him was another road sign on my

190
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,579
travel into a surreal world.

191
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,414
Well this devil hunt thing
never appealed to me.

192
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,984
We were getting into a pretty flaky
area there, you know.

193
00:15:54,388 --> 00:16:01,090
The kids, they were asking for it with
that one. Not the kind of work that

194
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,787
I do. Not what I do...

195
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,293
For the internet and, Jay Mcdowell
was enlisted.

196
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,437
Well they came to me with this
seedling idea, they said,

197
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,164
"We want to use some of this
technology we've been using for

198
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,748
teleconferencing, for video
conferencing, and we want turn this

199
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:21,610
into a live broadcast thing...

200
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,150
They'd heard some talk about it and
they'd seen some sites that were

201
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,582
trying to do that, so they wanted to
do something like that.

202
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:33,753
They wanted to do a live thing.
Rather than streaming canned video,

203
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:37,290
they actually wanted to stream and
compress it all live.

204
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:43,631
So they came to with this concept
and I had to figure out all the

205
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:49,971
technical aspects of it, how to make
it real... kind of the packaging for it;

206
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,238
what it was really going to be in
the final product.

207
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,513
Steven and Locus decided that
they needed additional help

208
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:56,648
at the actual location.

209
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,948
They searched vaguely for a sound
man and a guide and on

210
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,198
December 21995, worlds collided.

211
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,691
December 21995, worlds collided.

212
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:08,420
Okay. We're here at Ram's and we've
come today to meet him in hopes

213
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,793
that he'll be able to help us out on
our trip to the pine barrens.

214
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:16,368
Basically Rein is an audio wiz...
and suppose-bly he's been able to

215
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,909
document... supposed-l}; he's been
able to document paranormal

216
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,374
occurrences on tape. So that's what
we're going to see today.

217
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,074
We're also going to be meeting Jim,
who does some psychic things,

218
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,249
and we'll see. Hopefully these guys
will fit the bill and we'll be able to

219
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,285
go down to the Pine barrens with
them. We could use the extra help.

220
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,089
Is that good. Yeah, You got enough?

221
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:43,286
I hope this damn mic works.
You ready?

222
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:49,966
Okay, Remember play it cool...
play it cool...

223
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,567
ls this going to blow it for us, this
airplane sound?

224
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,178
Steven, this is Rein...right Rein?

225
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,372
I'm Locus.

226
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:01,977
Locus?

227
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:11,583
So you just taped us?

228
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,255
Yeah I guess so, Accidentally.

229
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,825
So do you have some kind of
surveillance setup or something?

230
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,932
For the time being I kind of do. I
have plugins where I can plug in on

231
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:25,630
the wall... At one point this was like
a working studio.

232
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,709
I think that Jim has arrived now.

233
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:35,738
How are you?

234
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,051
You're pretty determined that
we've met.

235
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,078
Hey Jim what's up?

236
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,323
How are you... Lotus.

237
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:45,889
Uh... Locus.

238
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,388
How are you. I'm Jim.

239
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,630
It was inevitable that the
combination of the internet, a

240
00:18:56,737 --> 00:19:00,332
television show about paranormal
happenings and similar ages

241
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,238
would draw Jim Suerd to
Fact or Fiction.

242
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:13,184
Okay, just to give a little
background. We're going to be doing

243
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,987
a webcast - cablecast in search of the
jersey devil down in the Pine

244
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,062
Barrens, and basically the reason
we've gotten you guys together is

245
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:30,263
because you have skills - Rein
regarding paranormal audio, and

246
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,969
Jim, you can help us with the
psychic thing.

247
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,734
I have psychic abilities, my psychic
abilities. I feel that I can really help

248
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,370
out. I understand what you're
trying to do and I really think

249
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,412
that I can help out.

250
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,674
You can help us find a location?
You can really help tap into

251
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:45,843
whatever we needed?

252
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,819
I can pinpoint that location.

253
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:55,229
Jim came to me one day and told me
how excited he was about how he

254
00:19:55,329 --> 00:20:01,496
had met these people over the
internet. It was some show, Fact or

255
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:07,336
Fiction; and he was to be their guide,
in the Pine Barrens. And what really

256
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:13,312
amazed me... I just didn't think he
knew or had any knowledge of the

257
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:20,046
Pine Barrens to even be a guide...
But he seemed so excited about it.

258
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,547
Is this good?

259
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,517
Do you want to hold them up
or do you want me to

260
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,226
Just like this... You can't touch them.

261
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:33,829
Six spade...

262
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:38,968
seven spade...

263
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,130
four spade...

264
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,705
five spade...

265
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:48,940
eight club...

266
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:51,043
eight diamond...

267
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:17,168
I saw him about two or three weeks
before the incident. I ran into him at

268
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:23,216
a shopping mall. He was very excited
about his life.

269
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:30,751
He was studying acting. His magic
was coming together people were

270
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,828
appreciating it. combined with the
acting he had done a few gigs.

271
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,625
It was going very well.

272
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,440
Give him more ashes. Give him
more ashes.

273
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:50,639
There's something on his arm.

274
00:21:56,183 --> 00:22:01,121
What does it say? one three nine
five... What does this mean Jim?

275
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:03,989
What does this mean Jim ?

276
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:04,852
I don't know

277
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,931
Back off. Back off.. are you
recording this?

278
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:19,067
Was Jim a psychic? It was not likely.
The card demonstration and the

279
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:22,937
supposed psychic fit in which
numbers appeared on his arm were

280
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,640
nothing more than simple tricks,
known by any amateur magician.

281
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:32,652
To Steven and Locus, Rein Clackin
and Jim Suerd were perfect

282
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:37,383
for Fact or Fiction; youthful, eager...
and strange.

283
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:54,002
On December 15, 1995 Steven
Avkast, Locus Wheeler,

284
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:59,536
Rein Clackin and Jim Suerd headed
for the Pine Barrens of New Jersey

285
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,339
to do a live broadcast in search
of the Jersey Devil.

286
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,250
Jim Suerd would be the only
one to return.

287
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,623
911, what is your emergency?

288
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,196
My name is Jim Suerd and I just
hitchhiked here

289
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:22,598
from the middle of the pine barrens
and I can't seem to find the people

290
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,804
I was in the Pine Barrens with and I
was cam ping with them

291
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:25,804
last night doing a project.

292
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:26,732
Are you lost?

293
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,241
I'm not I'm not lost, I'm just trying,
just trying to I can't find the people

294
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:38,511
that drove me here. I looked around
for them and there not at the van and

295
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,212
there nowhere to be found. I don't
know where they are.

296
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,254
The vehicle is still there?

297
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,483
The vehicle is still there and I had to
hitchhike to this pay phone.

298
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:54,759
About... about ten miles, I don't
know.

299
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,326
Okay Jim, we'll send someone out.

300
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:03,471
After Mr. Suerd made the call, we
went to the area he specified and did

301
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:09,812
a preliminary look around under a
missing person's investigation.

302
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:13,246
I mean I just figured it was one of
their little stints to do to get that

303
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:18,188
extra sensationalism... Sol didn't
think anything of it at first.

304
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,658
I kinda of expected them to try
something like that.

305
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:25,696
We have a one eighty seven.
Repeat... we have a one eighty seven.

306
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,598
This isn't a missing persons report
anymore.

307
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:30,797
Nine one twelve.

308
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,606
We're clear. Do you need emergency
support?

309
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:39,711
Ten Twelve. No this guy is
definitely DOA.

310
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:45,751
One body we found approximately
2.5 miles from the campsite.

311
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,688
The other body we found
3 miles from the campsite.

312
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:55,871
The body of Steven Avkast was
never found. Large amounts of blood

313
00:24:55,896 --> 00:25:00,265
in the snow and a hat were all that
remained of this third victim.

314
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:06,239
In any murder investigation, anybody
associated with the victims is a

315
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,143
suspect. Our job is to eliminate
suspects based on the evidence we

316
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:16,979
sift through and gather- and as we
sifted through and gathered the

317
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:20,815
evidence there was only one suspect
left at the end, and that suspect was

318
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:21,397
Mr. Jim Suerd.

319
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:21,650
Mr. Jim Suerd.

320
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,115
Who led everybody to the site?

321
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:26,223
I did

322
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:27,025
You did.

323
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:30,856
Did anybody else know where you
were going to set up and cam p?

324
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:36,562
Well I was asked to find a place for
us to camp. I thought

325
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:40,896
I was doing a good job. Rein
continued to provoke me

326
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,803
and give me a hard time about my
abilities to find a location for the

327
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:49,712
camp. Ultimately it led to an
argument and that's when

328
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,482
I ran away from the group.

329
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:52,814
Did you hit him at first?

330
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:58,254
I -I- I don't know. I might have
pushed him. Sometimes I can't

331
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:05,025
remember... I did what I... I ran
away from the group and I found the

332
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,734
spot that would be good to locate the
Jersey Devil.

333
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:13,431
After we got the permission from the
state of Pennsylvania to search

334
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,376
Mr. Suerd's residence, we went to his
residence and we did conduct a

335
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:23,483
search for anything that we felt
would help us in this case and we did

336
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,986
find the garments Mr. Suerd was
wearing that night, with the blood of

337
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:31,988
the three victims on it. Interestingly
the garments Mr. Suerd was wearing

338
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:35,821
were merely lying on his bedroom
floor, along with

339
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:37,362
the other dirty laundry that was
there.

340
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:45,402
Even as Jim was arrested, evidence
continued to mount against him.

341
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:54,576
We could tell that the nature of the
blows with the weapons that were

342
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:59,848
used were consistent with the size
and build of the accused.

343
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:06,850
In this case it was very clear that the
attacker was using both hands with

344
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:11,488
two weapons and was ambidextrous,
and the subject in this case is

345
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,225
ambidextrous which is quite rare.

346
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:19,296
He was the only survivor in a place
where nobody else was.

347
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,438
It doesn't look that good for him.

348
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,803
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
We will show that on

349
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:30,884
December 15, 1995 Jim Suerd
maliciously and with premeditation

350
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,544
killed Rein Clackin and Locus
Wheeler. We will show without

351
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,589
doubt how he planned this well in
advance of that day.

352
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,850
We will show with video shot by the
deceased, that Jim Suerd was and is

353
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:46,463
a devious and cunning person, using
the guise of psychic to perpetrate

354
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,693
these horrible acts.

355
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,604
The proceedings that summer turned
out to be one of the greatest

356
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,266
spectacles in Baroake County's
history. The trial attracted a strange

357
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:59,141
assemblage of cult followers, ritual
homicide fanatics and others seeking

358
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,512
to satisfy their morbid curiosities.
Eventually it became a matter of

359
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,379
trying to keep the tabloid press
at bay;

360
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,687
an attempt which was not
entirely successful.

361
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:16,188
When the court case came up, the
media frenzy was hysterical. I felt

362
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:21,763
like somebody was watching me
every minute. Talking to

363
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,930
everybody... everybody who had the
slightest thing to do with the show.

364
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:28,598
Who knows they probably even
talked to everyone who said they

365
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:36,139
watched the show. Reporters day in
and day out. The police here. Taking

366
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:44,283
everything- every tape, props. I don't
know what they were looking for.

367
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,253
All they were getting was a bunch of
bad television.

368
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:53,934
In an election year, what the
prosecution was looking for was an

369
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:58,834
open and shut case. And in the state
of New Jersey Vs Jim Suerd, they

370
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:03,604
found it. Not content to leave any
stone unturned, they decided to

371
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,772
utilize the very video that Steven
Avkast and Locus Wheeler had shot.

372
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:13,844
The man who would later come to be
known as the killer cutter was hired

373
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,718
to go through this video and put
together an incriminating

374
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:17,916
image of Jim Suerd.

375
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:27,860
The prosecution contacted me in
early January 1996. They had a

376
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:33,697
pretty good case against him from
what I saw. They had blood

377
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:37,869
evidence. They'd found the blood
and this was the only guy there, and

378
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:44,909
he was the only one who knew
where it was. But they really wanted

379
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:49,785
to clinch this case. They really
wanted to get him. They didn't want

380
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:56,720
to leave any question that he had
done it. So they came to me with all

381
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:02,701
this video tape... 15 hours of video.
This was video that these guys had

382
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:11,904
shot- on location. Now I had never
seen anything like this. Video from

383
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:19,111
the crime scene. Normally I have
hours and hours of talking heads,

384
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:24,286
shot in a room somewhere, badly I
mean this was badly shot, but

385
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,520
at least it was out in the woods.
It was different.

386
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,992
The Prosecution's video was
intended to show facts.

387
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:35,596
Perhaps, not inadvertently, it also
created an intimacy with the

388
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,331
murdered three that the defense was
unhappy with.

389
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:45,370
They protested it, deeming it an
unfair swaying toward a guilty

390
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:50,883
verdict. This was not enough reason
for the video to be struck down, and

391
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,474
so... it was used.

392
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:58,567
The first point demonstrated that Jim
was indeed leading the group into

393
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:02,028
very remote regions of the New
Jersey Pine Barrens areas where

394
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:05,723
there was no hope for help or aid
from the civilized world.

395
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,926
The following represents excerpts
from the first section of the

396
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:19,075
wandering deeper into the Pines was
shot. It is estimated that the four

397
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,979
walked for more than two hours
before Jim finally decided upon the

398
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,050
locations of their operation.

399
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,320
Hey guys he's starting to go Let's get
this stuff together.

400
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,282
So what's up Jim?

401
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:42,467
When Jim finally found the perfect
location, it was more than three

402
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,038
miles from the van and the nearest
access road.

403
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:52,579
The second point was to make
evident a defendant who had an

404
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,173
agenda... an agenda warped enough
to commit these murders.

405
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:09,220
I've been contacting the supernatural
world for the last week, for the last

406
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:13,493
couple of days. I've been in contact
getting my spiritual self together for

407
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:21,966
this journey that we've put ourselves
out on... and we are headed in the

408
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:29,209
right direction, I can assure you . I
can feel it. It's a gut instinct in my

409
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:35,848
body that we are going to find the
Leeds Devil... and that we're going to

410
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:40,826
settle this case... once and for all.

411
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:50,963
I feel that what I'm doing here and
for you is perfectly authentic and I

412
00:32:53,407 --> 00:33:01,407
have a feeling inside it's a definite
feeling.. it's a place where we will

413
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:13,692
Repeated phrases such as "We're
going to settle this thing once and for

414
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:19,392
all" and "I know we're headed in the
right direction" seemed to clearly

415
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:23,834
show Jim's agenda. It didn't take
much to read into these phrases and

416
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:28,037
see an individual with a plan that
was to be carried out in the desolate

417
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:28,641
Pine Barrens.

418
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:36,874
As the prosecution's video
progressed, Jim's personality

419
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:41,851
changed; from a quiet and shy person
to one that presented the Prosecution

420
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:46,256
with an opportunity to show the
violent nature just below the surface.

421
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:49,118
Look Man...

422
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,865
I don't know. I don't know what Jim's
doing. I think he's talking about

423
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:02,339
burning something.

424
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:06,468
An agenda proven and a potential
violent streak proven, the

425
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:10,413
prosecution solidified their first
degree murder case against Suerd

426
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:14,846
with video taken in the barn; video
in which the original date of the trip

427
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:16,183
appeared on Suerd's arm.

428
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:20,424
The defense attempted to have this
also struck from the records,

429
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,687
claiming the video of Suerd to be
that of a character he was playing.

430
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:28,701
The prosecution countered by
agreeing fully with this assessment

431
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:33,115
of Suerd and the events in the barn.
Events that had taken place a full

432
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,475
two weeks before the trip; the best
argument for premeditated murder.

433
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:10,467
The trip began at sunrise. Steven ran
a video camera much of the time,

434
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:14,241
documenting what should have been
amusing but banal preparation.

435
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:22,387
Locus, you wanna do a blurb?

436
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:23,249
Yeah I'll do it.

437
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:30,992
What do you mean the back light's
killing my face?

438
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,066
Why don't you adjust it?
What you mean you can't adjust it?

439
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:43,165
Hey... I'm trying get this on
camera...

440
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:56,690
The trip, guided by Jim took, them
into the loneliest of areas, on a

441
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:02,695
lonely cold day. A stop at a gas
station, was the last obvious

442
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,130
land mark, before they moved into
the unidentifiable roads of

443
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,062
the Pine Barrens.

444
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:14,874
At a certain point, at Jim's request,
they stopped, parked, and started

445
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:18,673
walking into the woods... following
the psychic visions of Suerd.

446
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:23,811
No... What I'm saying is... if he's
gonna do it, this is part of the show.

447
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,909
We've gotta do it in a place he thinks
is right. Because if we're going to

448
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,580
find something I mean... yeah we
could fake it, but I don't go for that. I

449
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,716
think we should go for real and he's
off doing his thing.

450
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,827
That's why we got him here.

451
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,125
I'm just getting cold

452
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,602
Well we knew it.. We knew that we
were going to be out here.

453
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,530
Here he comes.

454
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,147
Where did you get this guy from
anyway? Psychics R us?

455
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,379
I think this is a pretty good idea.
Us waiting around and his

456
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:05,117
finding the spot, and then taking
the stuff over to it.

457
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:10,897
We still gotta go back to the oar and
get stuff. I don't think he knows that.

458
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:12,157
He's not volunteering much.

459
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:16,403
Yeah, well he's not carrying too
much but you know what he said

460
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,904
about that. It's a vibe thing.

461
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,667
Tension increase, as they work
further into the forsaken pines-.

462
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:28,539
And then, a key point in the
prosecutions video arrives...

463
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:35,183
Jim... are you a psychic...
or a psycho?

464
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,696
I'll see you back at camp man...

465
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:50,202
Approximately one hour later,
judging from the sun, a camp is

466
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:55,400
being built. Discussions are already
being had about Suerd. Suerd is not

467
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,670
helping. He is keeping to himself.

468
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,380
For the next two hours, the video of
the group is a mixture of promotions

469
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:08,386
for future cable shows, the camera
frequently left on between takes.

470
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:12,857
This is Locus reporting from the Pine
Barrens and I'm with Rein,

471
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:16,028
our sound man. Gee Rein I sure
am parched.

472
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:17,128
I sure am too.

473
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:21,261
Wow. ls that Mulberry natural spring
water?

474
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:22,368
Yes from Mueller's.

475
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:27,565
Wow. I wish I could have a sparkling
glass of that.

476
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:30,205
Boy. I'm telling you. and in a
gallon jar.

477
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:31,240
<i>Jug</i>

478
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:32,276
The mood is good.

479
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:33,135
Let's do that again.

480
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:37,707
Jim doesn't join in, instead staying in
the tent on IRC.

481
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:48,289
I don't really feel like I'm being taken
seriously, by really, any of you.

482
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,021
I'm taking you seriously.
We set up here.

483
00:38:54,702 --> 00:39:00,402
I'm doing what I do and I don't
appreciate being laughed at.

484
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:07,075
Well, it's just a stress thing, you
know? We're going to be going on

485
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,309
in a bit. Do you think you're going to
come out for the show?

486
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:22,252
I think that I'll probably stay in
here... stay on IRC.

487
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:24,628
Okay.

488
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,663
At 10PM in what will be, The Last
Broadcast, Fact or Fiction goes live.

489
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:34,569
This is Johnny

490
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:35,407
and Locus

491
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:39,512
and we are live in the pine barrens
where tonight we are doing a first

492
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,944
ever internet broadcast, cable, ham
radio broadcast

493
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:55,996
Jim has been on IRC for <i>2</i> hours and
30 minutes. A surveillance camera

494
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,897
records the camp to vhs tape. It runs
for <i>2</i> hours before shutting off.

495
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:07,239
At 1:00 am, the last tape in the series
of <i>22</i> tapes shot by Locus Wheeler

496
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:10,133
and Rein Clackin reaches it's end.

497
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:18,048
Hey what the hell...man this thing's
still on... what's going on here?

498
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,784
Oh I must have left it on. We should
change tapes. Did you change tapes?

499
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:24,290
Here I'm going to change tapes.

500
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:29,358
There is no indication that this is
done. No other footage exists.

501
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:54,044
The tapes show a group of men,
going through a wide range of

502
00:40:54,188 --> 00:41:00,855
emotions, seemingly enjoying their
jaunt into the pine barrens. The tapes

503
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:05,194
show the brooding nature of one man
who does not share in the frivolity.

504
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:10,467
The tapes do make clear the
maladjusted nature of Jim Suerd.

505
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,240
Though Suerd maintained his
innocence,

506
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:17,938
the facts were indisputable.

507
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,310
Four people went into the Pine
Barrens. Only Jim returned.

508
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:27,786
Blood of all three was found on Jim's
shirt. His pushing Rein showed a

509
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:32,917
potential violent streak. The angle
and depth of the cuts and lacerations

510
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,525
matched somebody of his height and
weight, and more importantly,

511
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,976
ambidextrous nature. The number,
which closely matched the date of

512
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,301
the murders appearing through ashes
on his arm was deemed to be a good

513
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:47,864
case for premeditated murder.
The tape showing the four walking

514
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:52,442
further and further into the woods,
virtually guaranteed a seclusion from

515
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:55,345
civilization that would make the
killing easier.

516
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,251
The defenses one victory was
getting the third charge of murder

517
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:05,788
against Avkast dropped. Though a
body is not needed to prove murder,

518
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,455
the prosecution had more than
enough evidence with the

519
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,131
two bodies that were found.

520
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:19,101
On July 161996 Jim Suerd was
to two life sentences

521
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,041
to be served consecutively.

522
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:47,091
I think the whole trial was a
kangaroo court of sorts, a pig circus.

523
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:55,599
The police obviously didn't do their
homework. They're not investigating

524
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:59,646
this to the best of their ability,
because their has to be some

525
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,411
evidence indicating something else
or someone else.

526
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:18,123
The case they built up against him; it
was all circumstantial. I mean they

527
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:22,531
didn't have any actual evidence that
he did this, but they didn't have

528
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,865
anything else or anyone else
to go on.

529
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:27,940
I don't consider having the blood of
murdered victims all over your

530
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:31,272
clothes as circumstantial. That's
pretty hard evidence as far as I'm

531
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:36,077
concerned. You don't get blood on
your clothes from a murder victim

532
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:41,649
from out of the air. You have to be
there, conducting those murders, to

533
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:44,986
get that blood on your clothes. I don't
consider that circumstantial.

534
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:54,963
I can't explain that, why there would
be blood on my shirt.

535
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,869
Would you agree it looks bad?

536
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:58,470
Excuse ma?

537
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:01,140
Would you agree that it doesn't look
very good for you right now?

538
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:07,982
The way that you're telling me it
doesn't look very good, but I can't

539
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,675
understand where this evidence
came from.

540
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,444
The evidence of blood on Jim's shirt
was a strong point for the

541
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:19,186
prosecution. DNA tests showed
indisputably that it was the blood of

542
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,988
the three that had gone into the
woods with Suerd. As I look at the

543
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:28,568
images of DNA patterns and pools of
blood, I wonder though if perhaps

544
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:33,071
the jury, anxious not ignore DNA
evidence as had happened in other

545
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:38,475
trials, perhaps looked too closely.
Through the magnifying glass of the

546
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:42,708
prosecution's microscope, the
evidence was solid, however a

547
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:47,515
macroscopic view begged another
question. Could the master of this

548
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:50,955
orgy of violence have walked away
from his work, with merely the

549
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:54,892
equivalent of 17 eyedrops of blood
on his shirt... and nothing else?

550
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:01,293
Every piece of evidence they would
get, they would use in a way like

551
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:07,098
instead of "Gee does this have
anything to do with the case"?

552
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:13,010
They would go like "How could
Jim have used this"? It was like

553
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:21,113
building a house of cards.
Eventually they had enough to

554
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:24,353
get a case against him.

555
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,427
I wasn't really monitoring their
conduct outside of cam p.

556
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:32,488
What were you doing?

557
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:33,665
I was on IRC.

558
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:34,434
In the tent?

559
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:35,130
Yeah

560
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:35,799
All night?

561
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:36,566
All night.

562
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:39,135
About what time did you start on
IRC?

563
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:45,778
Probably around 8:30

564
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,614
When we interviewed the individuals
that Suerd claimed to have been

565
00:45:52,753 --> 00:46:00,753
talking with on IRC that evening,
and we've looked at their logs, their

566
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:09,028
chat logs from their computer and
we have determined there was a

567
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:15,700
45 minute gap in time from when
Suerd made one comment to the

568
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:21,373
time he made another comment. And
45 minutes is an awfully long time to

569
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:24,452
not be responding to other people on
the internet.

570
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:30,489
They say that the connection
dropped out and that was when Jim

571
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:33,788
killed them... I guess that's possible.

572
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:40,158
It is possible yes. You don't have to
be a world class sprint runner to

573
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:45,128
cover that amount of ground in
45 minutes.

574
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:23,139
I have to raise doubts about just one
guy doing all that to these bodies.

575
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:31,977
They were darlings of the media.
That was one of the reasons they

576
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:38,955
jumped on this thing so quickly and
had to come up with a conclusion of

577
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:43,293
what happened. It was their very
own.

578
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:49,299
As professionals in law enforcement,
we do not feel the pressure from

579
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:53,532
outside sources, be it the media or
otherwise, to conduct our

580
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:58,272
investigations. We conduct them to
the best of our ability at all times.

581
00:47:59,747 --> 00:48:03,581
There were no other suspects to
apprehend, to interview or to

582
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:08,212
consider. All the evidence pointed to
the fact Mr. Suerd was the only

583
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:14,022
suspect and therefore all we had to
do was gather the evidence to prove

584
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:17,706
Mr. Suerd's guilt. We didn't have to
gather evidence to gather other

585
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,174
Mr. Suerd's guilt. We didn't have to
gather evidence to gather other

586
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,722
suspects.

587
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:31,074
On January 2nd, 1997 an event
occurred that forced me to rethink

588
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:35,979
the making of this documentary, the
very thesis with which I had begun

589
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:41,681
this journey. Jim Suerd was found
dead in his jail cell of undetermined

590
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:42,254
causes.

591
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:49,190
On January 3rd, a package arrived at
my door, which I think in

592
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,595
no way was coincidental with the
death of Jim Suerd.

593
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,749
The acquiring of mysterious
videotape has changed the mood

594
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:14,013
behind the making of this
documentary. Gone is the attempt at

595
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:18,216
pure objectivity with which we
started. Now we question who gave

596
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,593
us this tape, and more importantly,
what, if any, information does it hold

597
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:27,099
that was never brought up in the
trial? Going to the authorities with

598
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:31,795
this new tape is pondered, but
rejected. To them, the case is closed

599
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:37,767
and with Jim's death, appeals are a
moot point. Nothing is ruled out. The

600
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:43,715
tape could be a hoax. I am conscious
of one thing though; Our search for

601
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:47,811
the truth behind the Fact Or Fiction
murders has in some way become

602
00:49:48,022 --> 00:49:49,148
part of the story.

603
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:54,425
There was this discussion on the last
\ tape that they were going to change

604
00:49:54,595 --> 00:50:01,797
tapes, but whether that ever
happened or not, I don't know... I

605
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:09,206
never saw any other tapes and from
what I saw of the camera it was

606
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:15,305
pretty damaged, so if there was any
tape I doubt it could ever be played.

607
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:27,120
My name is Michelle Monarch. I'm a
magnetic media data recovery

608
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:32,028
specialist. The particular tape I was
given was mangled almost beyond

609
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:40,199
recognition. I digitized sections of
this particular video and am now

610
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:46,403
reconstructing the actual picture
frame by frame. I have to guide the

611
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:51,849
computer to complete these pictures.
There were some that were easy, and

612
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:56,513
some that were unrecognizable and
I'm rebuilding them now at this time.

613
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:08,462
As the tape is reassembled by Shelly,
it becomes apparent that some

614
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,297
sections are rather viewable.

615
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:31,522
And I'll say, "I'm hunting for the
Jersey Devil.

616
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,456
And I'll be like "Ahh shut up"

617
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,361
Yeah, you can be like "I don't see
him"

618
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,792
No we better not do that because
we've got to deliver on this

619
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:39,899
show...this is the big one.

620
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:04,083
I don't care if you here this or not on
camera. This is never going to make

621
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:07,216
it to anything but the cutting room
floor as they would say in Film days

622
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:09,352
from what Sam was saying.

623
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,091
I don't want to be a bitch all night.

624
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:16,665
Let's see how this works

625
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:24,205
I'm going to walk out into the woods,
scout out the location, I also kind of

626
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:32,114
have to go to the bathroom but get
on the trumpet, do some sound

627
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:35,916
Yeah, but Newark is doing it's thing.

628
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:41,192
Yeah, I know the airplanes are loud,
but we got only one machine going...

629
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,859
I want to see that reel to reel going, I
want to see you on that trumpet... I

630
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:46,090
want to see you working for the
reason that you're out here...

631
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:53,135
and Locus IR144xx is waiting
do some work man.

632
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:56,201
Whatever you say big guy.

633
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:03,211
I'm going to get going here. I'll be
back in a couple of minutes.

634
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:14,992
There goes the little tyrant.

635
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:21,258
Here come on. I got the camera
rolling. Do a little Steven imitation.

636
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,615
No I'm talking about Steven being a
pussy, not Jim

637
00:53:41,922 --> 00:53:45,290
Jim's one psycho mother fucker...

638
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,694
Here let me get that on camera.

639
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:52,126
That thing isn't running is it?

640
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,363
Of course it's running We're
supposed to record everything.

641
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,904
Here do that imitation of when Jim
pushed you what were you thinking?

642
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:21,153
I was. a little bit... I don't know it
was weird. I didn't expect him to be

643
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:29,261
violent... I thought he was one of
these peace fucking meditation

644
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:30,879
dudes... I didn't think they did that.

645
00:54:30,904 --> 00:54:33,032
Dudes... I didn't think they did that.

646
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:38,034
Following these recorded moments,
a large portion of the tape is

647
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:41,376
smashed. It is a section that Shelly
will attempt to restore.

648
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:47,517
The next section that is immediately
viewable happens somewhere in the

649
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:48,520
middle of the tape.

650
00:54:56,797 --> 00:55:00,665
The first thing that is apparent is that
this is tape shot by Locus and Rein.

651
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:04,570
Steven is nowhere to be seen. They
are searching for him.

652
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,667
On her third day of restoration,
Shelly makes another discovery.

653
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,478
The anonymous tape is not from one
but two cameras.

654
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:17,240
Both Rein and Locus took cameras
into the forest.

655
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:25,555
Here we are. We can't find Steven.
Here we are in the pine barrens on a

656
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:31,324
trip he drug us out here for. We did a
webcast, cable-cast cast simulcast,

657
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:35,260
which frankly was pretty poor if you
ask me, but that doesn't matter

658
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:41,473
because our host, Steven - Johnny, is
gone.

659
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:46,071
He's missing and we can't find him.
All I want to do is drink some beer

660
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:51,877
this is for you Steven. Even though
we don't know where you are,

661
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:55,522
because you told us to record
everything... shoot shoot everything

662
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,227
In the 6th day of her work, Shelly
puts together a stunning piece of

663
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:14,034
tape. It is a moment in time that
proves so much.

664
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:22,045
Footprint. I think it goes off this way.

665
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:26,945
Do you see anything over there?

666
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:28,351
Do you know what time it is?

667
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:37,091
It's late. It's... 2... 45

668
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,260
2:45?

669
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:45,137
Rein and Locus were alive and
speaking the time, when they were

670
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:49,334
supposed to be being killed. And
they're alive. and they're saying the

671
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:54,107
time on video. To me that proves
absolutely that Jim couldn't have

672
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:58,378
been killing them at that time.
Jim's an innocent man. And this was

673
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:03,787
not investigated in any way shape or
form. It was overlooked.

674
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,455
So many details were overlooked.

675
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:11,524
Also, if he's an innocent man
there's a killer on the loose.

676
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:18,005
Shelly's work slowly gives voices to
the dead, ghosts caught on video.

677
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:08,080
The processing of the tape is quickly
becoming more difficult for Shelly.

678
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:12,521
Now only bits and pieces tell the
story of what happened in the woods.

679
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:15,504
On February 5, Shelly presents a
section of video tape that is nothing

680
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:18,624
On February 5, Shelly presents a
section of video tape that is nothing

681
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:24,000
short of horrifying. It intensifies the
question of who the killer is.

682
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:19,022
On February 7, Shelly finds what she
thinks is the moment in time from

683
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:24,791
Locus's camera. It cannot however
be viewed. She remains hopeful as

684
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:27,924
she begins the process of trying to
reconstruct a lost video.

685
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:31,833
The computer needs me to direct it.
It doesn't know how to

686
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:37,775
reconstruct a circle. Maybe it'll have
an opening at the side, and I have to

687
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:42,941
teach it to continue the circle. I'm a
guiding factor.

688
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:49,518
While Shelly begins the process of
attempting to restore video, I will

689
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:52,593
attempt to find a truth within the
videos I have already shot.

690
00:59:54,995 --> 01:00:00,024
You know, sitting there, waiting for
these video images to render, I did

691
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:06,903
wonder about it myself. I mean...
sometimes I wonder if I'm doing the

692
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:13,640
right thing. Did this guy do it... it
seemed from what I saw that it was

693
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:19,084
pretty likely that he did it. You had
the blood evidence, stuff like that.

694
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:23,213
But then there was that one guy...
they never found his body...

695
01:00:26,093 --> 01:00:27,492
Could he have done it? I don't know.

696
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:30,139
It is an obvious question; a question I
had presented to all the people

697
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:32,929
It is an obvious question; a question I
had presented to all the people

698
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:37,766
interviewed. The tape restoration is
showing Locus and Rein searching

699
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:41,064
for Steve, which only makes the
question more relevant.

700
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:48,772
What happened to Steven Avkast?
By process of elimination, I proceed.

701
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:55,681
We did some blood. and of course
the infamous Johnny hat that was

702
01:00:55,789 --> 01:01:03,789
found. We were never able to find
any more remains of that person so

703
01:01:04,932 --> 01:01:06,195
we don't know if he's dead or alive.

704
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:14,834
They never found Steven - Johnny's
body, but they found his hat- It just

705
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:18,877
seems weird that the only thing left
is... a hat?

706
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:37,556
We don't think Mr. Avkast would be
able to setup Mr. Suerd because the

707
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:42,226
amount of blood that was found of
Mr. Avkast's is so great that he

708
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,895
would have bled to death trying to
set Mr. Suerd up.

709
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:09,322
We... what's that...
It's Steven's his light... Steven?

710
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:15,295
In finding that Jim's alibi holds up,
we have to attempt to answer the

711
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:20,703
question raised... who killed these
people? The likely suspect would

712
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:26,109
appear to be Steven. As I watch these
frames though, I see no recognition

713
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:32,311
from Locus's face. I see Locus, a
man, larger than Steven, turn tail and

714
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:38,222
run as does Rein. Steven Avkast
being the culprit of the horrendous

715
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:41,727
massacre that took place in the
minutes that follow this tape, is

716
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:46,060
impossible to believe. Along with
the amount of blood that belongs to

717
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,533
Steven Avkast this makes me believe
that he also was murdered in the

718
01:02:50,638 --> 01:02:56,202
Pine Barrens. I am now also of the
belief that the killer was somehow

719
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,971
something more horrendous than
possible to imagine.

720
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:08,150
What could have killed three
healthy men?

721
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,286
What would have left no foot prints?

722
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:14,487
What would have torn the men
into forty seven pieces,

723
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,627
leaving no evidence of a struggle?

724
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:21,926
We could tell by what was left of the
infliction of the wound that

725
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:23,434
it was a serrated type weapon.

726
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:31,802
There were no knife fragments or
any evidence of the actual weapon

727
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:33,872
used other than the cuts themselves.

728
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:47,836
We're a rural county, people here are
not greatly educated. Rumor and

729
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:51,855
folklore is common. I put no
credence in anything of that nature.

730
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:54,592
I go by the facts that the police were
able to ascertain.

731
01:03:55,603 --> 01:04:00,040
A monster? Yeah. I think this person
is a monster. I don't believe

732
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:07,844
Fact or Fiction. I don't believe the
Fiction. I think this is a person and

733
01:04:07,982 --> 01:04:12,010
I'm going to find out who it is. I'm
going to reconstruct... do my job to

734
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:16,785
recover what has been lost. The
facts.

735
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:22,427
It is as though the Jersey devil is a
monster reborn in a digital age,

736
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:27,563
reborn on the Internet. A demon
captured on IRC logs, mangled

737
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:32,238
video, whispers in the dark. It is to
these that I look.

738
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,152
It's totally anonymous. You can't
trace a call. You don't know if it's

739
01:04:36,177 --> 01:04:37,941
man woman old young.

740
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:46,451
You don't know anything, so in one
way... I don't know why the oops

741
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:50,114
didn't try to figure out the suggestion.
Who made that idea?

742
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:51,415
Who came up with that suggestion.

743
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:57,556
Why don't you do a show about the
Jersey Devil?

744
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:02,291
We have this show, Factor Fiction...
it's a paranormal variety show.

745
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:12,807
Station so what we thought we'd
make a little excursion. There was

746
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:16,347
this suggestion via IRC. There was a
suggestion via IRC to

747
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,286
Well and also from the Mailbag.
That guy D...

748
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:36,795
Well one of the things about IRC is
that it really is hard to trace it... It's

749
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:42,601
not like you know the phone number
that they're calling from. This could

750
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:48,004
have shanghai where they writing
this message from. You just don't

751
01:05:48,415 --> 01:05:50,509
know. That's the beauty and the evil
of it.

752
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:05,627
It is amazing to be so near, yet so far
to the possibility of knowing who the

753
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:08,268
killer is. D something?

754
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:11,837
Have guests come on. Well things
have been a little slow at the station

755
01:06:11,939 --> 01:06:13,873
so what we thought we'd make a
little excursion. There was this

756
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,304
suggestion via IRC

757
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:23,313
Well and also from the Mailbag.
That guy D...

758
01:06:23,884 --> 01:06:30,517
It's just not practical to keep that
stuff. I get so much email. It would

759
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:37,757
just clog up my system. Once a point
was done... I erased it as I went. I

760
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:45,965
mean there were some emails at the
and, but nothing illuminating.

761
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,749
Mean there were some emails at the
and, but nothing illuminating.

762
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:30,776
It gets harder and harder to stick
with your original gut feeling.

763
01:07:38,692 --> 01:07:44,961
Because of the media and the
attention that the whole case got, and

764
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:50,666
how lopsided the whole thing
was. After a while you wonder...

765
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:56,636
maybe he did do it...Maybe there's a
side of Jim that I don't know...

766
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,806
That was capable of such an atrocity.

767
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:07,478
As this journey nears it's end, I
begin to fully understand the essence

768
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:11,718
of what this is about. The media
upon which these events were

769
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:15,318
recorded, the media that should have
been able to provide a truth more

770
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:20,763
pure than ever before, has somehow
become the story. This has become

771
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:24,027
more than a search for the truth
behind the fact or fiction murders.

772
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:28,672
It has become an indictment of truth
and how it is viewed through the lens

773
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:29,241
of the media.

774
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:34,136
Pretty exciting moment here because
the Fact or Fiction Logo is on screen,

775
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:43,649
which means that we are actually
getting our signal feed, to the station.

776
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:52,492
Reality television, the news, the 60
second clip of truth have made even

777
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:53,964
the strongest of doubters wonder

778
01:08:54,234 --> 01:08:56,168
Are you a psychic or a psycho?

779
01:09:06,947 --> 01:09:08,278
What did you say to him...?

780
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:14,187
What does he mean he's going to be
at the camp?... this is the whole

781
01:09:14,288 --> 01:09:15,778
fuckin thing. where the hell is the
camp?

782
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,018
Well we're losing him.

783
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:20,424
Well go find him. I'm not going to go
anywhere near him.

784
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:22,092
What a fuckin asshole.

785
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:25,790
Just out the damn camera.

786
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:32,528
I mean what is the truth? The editing
process is like sifting that stuff out.

787
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:41,914
Not always with these legal videos
but with a documentary film,

788
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,394
ultimately it's what the filmmaker
perceives as the truth.

789
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:46,386
Ultimately it's what the filmmaker
perceives as the truth.

790
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,749
I mean, don't you think? That's what
you're trying to do. Right?

791
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,658
The mistakes that were discovered
on this journey were stunning.

792
01:09:54,028 --> 01:09:56,963
Shoddy police work and a
judgmental video presented the

793
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:59,726
world with a person, guilty before
ever being tried.

794
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:05,904
I know Jim is not guilty. I know that
the truth is still at large, potentially

795
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,534
closer than anyone can realize. It is
as though the real killer planned a

796
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:14,147
media event so amazingly cunning
that it could be thought of as

797
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:18,946
scripted. A Kill ready for prime time
so to speak.

798
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:22,588
Perhaps the demon we call the Jersey
devil did kill them in the

799
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,728
Pine Barrens, but if so, the Jersey
devil is the electronic image.

800
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:32,395
The sound, the communication to the
masses, somehow twisted into

801
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,532
a surrealist electronic world.

802
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:41,265
I always asked the question last... do
you think Jim did it? And with the

803
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:45,209
exception of authorities directly
accountable to the answer, I have felt

804
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:49,749
that the answer given has been "it
doesn't matter... the truth is what

805
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:53,844
time has made of this event. It has
been good for business;

806
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:55,546
often murder is.

807
01:10:56,657 --> 01:10:59,957
So many involved have benefited
from this event. The inevitable book

808
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,562
deal is being replaced with a career
in the business of image control.

809
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:07,198
And most of the people interviewed
are ready to em brace it.

810
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:14,771
I guess it's a grim irony, as these
post-its can attest, that when we have

811
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:23,776
some real dead bodies that the sharks
start circling. It's strange that an

812
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:32,919
incident like that would be a prelude
to a new phase in my career.

813
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:38,292
Well it's interesting. After the
case...with all the publicity,

814
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,871
I started getting phone calls for a
couple job leads, so in one way this

815
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,168
might have helped me outta here.

816
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:49,905
How long will it to process the
entire tape?

817
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:55,339
It's not my intention to process the
whole tape. I don't need to do that. It

818
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:59,613
could take hours, it could take days. I
need to process a particular piece of

819
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,281
this tape that could potentially reveal
a killer.

820
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:08,337
Shelly continues to extrapolate
information from a frame while I

821
01:12:08,362 --> 01:12:08,828
Shelly continues to extrapolate
information from a frame while I

822
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:12,832
will reenact the events of
December 15, 1995

823
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:19,265
This is one of the stops that the guys
had made on their way to the

824
01:12:19,406 --> 01:12:23,070
Pine Barrens. I know this from the
extensive documentary footage they

825
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:28,479
had taken. I don't know what good
this will do. I think it's to keep

826
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:32,041
myself clear of what happened, the
order of events.

827
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:35,851
Strangely the weather is almost
identical to the way it was that day.

828
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:10,785
I'm now traveling an access route
that I know Steven and Locus had

829
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:14,657
taken for the Jersey Devil project.
We're in the heart of the

830
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:22,795
Pine Barrens. I'm using this video
camera as a matter of convenience.

831
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:35,478
Using film out here would prove to
be logistically too difficult.

832
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:40,714
Hopefully we'll show you the area of
the campsite. And really

833
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:48,763
demonstrate the intrepid nature of
Steven and Locus.

834
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:21,285
I feel with some more work, that I
will find the killer.

835
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,360
I will see the face of the killer.

836
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:08,036
This site is a very close
approximation of the one used by

837
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:12,773
Steven and Locus on the night of the
Jersey devil episode. They'd chosen

838
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,444
a clearing like this for the base camp
of the telecast before venturing into

839
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:22,250
the pine barrens with their cameras.
They would never return alive again.

840
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:27,427
The documentary footage generated
that evening proves irrevocably that

841
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:31,088
Jim Suerd was not responsible for
their murders; that Locus Wheeler

842
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,428
and Rein Clackin were actually alive
at the time when they were

843
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:36,969
ostensibly being murdered and that
the police case was shoddy at best.

844
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:42,531
What is the Jersey Devil? It's a man
wandering into the Pine Barrens,

845
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:46,044
never to be seen again. It's an animal
found mangled on one of these

846
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:49,514
access roads, or perhaps its
something that rests within our own

847
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:53,952
psyche and that we'll never fully
understand. I've been on this project

848
01:15:54,088 --> 01:15:56,614
for months now and haven't come to
a clear definition of what actually

849
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,349
happened or who was responsible.

850
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,059
All I know is it's a mystery and may
permanently remain so.

851
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:09,560
What is the Jersey Devil?

852
01:16:41,168 --> 01:16:42,829
I'm now outside of Shelly's studio.

853
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:45,500
All the media

854
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:47,968
All the interviews

855
01:16:50,077 --> 01:16:51,909
The truth finally comes down to one
frame.

856
01:19:05,613 --> 01:19:08,981
I have determined that this is no time
to be distracted or set aside in the

857
01:19:09,116 --> 01:19:13,485
course of the events that I have set
into motion. My next step will be

858
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:17,182
going into the Pine Barrens for a
reenactment of the trip of Steven

859
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:21,387
Avkast, Locus Wheeler, Rein
Clackin, and Jim Suerd. I am as

860
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:25,329
strong in my resolve as before in
proving that Jim had nothing to do

861
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,197
with the murders... that he had
neither the intellect nor the logical

862
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:32,396
capacity to carry them through. I
think the replayment of our events

863
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,637
be quite compelling in
roving Jim's innocence

864
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:52,508
This site is a close approximation to
the one used by Locus and Steven on

865
01:21:53,414 --> 01:21:54,779
