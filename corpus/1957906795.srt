You know?

349
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:25,156

magic.

- Magic?
- Yeah.

But if I was...

357
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,007
I would probably do things
slightly differently,

358

considering that I'm a big buyer
and all.

to pitch me on this place?

to tell me, of course,

00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,066
how I can do my job better.

364
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,985
He says to me that I could
use more passion

and Christmas spirit and more
conceptual visual thinking

366

and less demographics, building
codes, and square footage talk.

00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,707
It just started working again
a couple days ago.

697
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,669
Maybe that's Santa's gift
to you.

698
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,253
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

699
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,921
I must've jostled it and a gear

700
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,216
got knocked into place
or something.

701
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,345
Hey, can you help me with this?

702
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,475
So, how long have you been
at Optima?

703
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,976
Just over a year.

704
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,520
Wow. They must really like you

705
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,480
if they're giving you
your own projects.

706
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,482
Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying
my best.

707
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,526
- Trying not to mess it up.
- [LAUGHS]

708
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,110
I hear that.

709
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,656
And, uh, what do you like
about the job?

710
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,992
Well, there's always a new
adventure around the corner.

711
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,786
Meeting new people,
hearing about their...

712
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,122
Magical family heirlooms?

713
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,083
Yeah. Yes, yes.

714
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,502
That and hearing about
their lives.

715
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,753
But you want to know
what I love?

716
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,837
What's that?

717
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,673
Exploring.

718
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,550
There's always a certain
<i>je ne sais quoi</i>

719
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,093
when you go into a small town.

720
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,678
A certain level of magic.

721
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,432
Hmm. Right. Magic.

722
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,392
Hey.

723
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,436
You got a little something
in your hair.

724
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,522
Oh, um. Did I?

725
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,942
- Do you mind?
- No.

726
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,288
[LAUGHS]

727
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,587
I guess this is it.

728
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,674
Yeah. We put another ornament
on this guy,

729
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,551
and it's going to topple over.

730
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,969
- For sure.
- For sure.

731
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,763
- Mm-hmm.
- [LAUGHS]

732
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,349
- You ready?
- Yeah.

733
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,310
Three, two, one.

734
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,019
See?

735
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,647
- Magic.
- [LAUGHS]

736
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,939
You know what
this reminds me of?

737
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,733
- What's that?
- That warm...

738
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,402
feeling I get when
I'm at your family's inn.

739
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:25,157
It's so cozy and beautiful.
It's so nice and...

740
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,703
And not for sale!
Julian, you're relentless.

741
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,080
- [PHONE DINGS]
- Oh um.

742
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,503
Oh. It's my dad.

743
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,713
- He says he needs me.
- Okay

744
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,799
I will no longer be
a distraction.

745
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,176
I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00?

746
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,679
- You got it.
- OK.

747
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,221
And hey.

748
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,516
Thanks.

749
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,935
Yeah.

750
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,356
At Optima Getaways
we aim to please.

751
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,504
Hey Dad.

752
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,131
Is everything okay?

753
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,801
I got your text message
and tried calling but...

754
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:28,136
Oh yeah, sweetie. Sorry.

755
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,055
I guess, I left
my phone upstairs.

756
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,891
[LAUGHS]
So, what's going on?

757
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,353
Well, I just...

758
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:41,525
I wanted to take you up
on your offer.

759
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:45,487
Have a serious conversation
about selling the inn.

760
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,114
- Oh.
- I think this could be good for us.

761
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,950
A fresh start, no debts.

762
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,078
Emotional or otherwise.

763
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,665
[SIGHS HEAVILY]

764
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,041
Okay.

765
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,959
Okay?

766
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,422
Yeah.

767
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,718
Because I really do think this
is what your mother would want.

768
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,178
But are you sure?

769
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,390
I know taking care of the inn
has been difficult for you

770
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,728
since... well since she passed.

771
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,396
Oh Dad, I've been selfish.

772
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,815
No. You've got enough going on.

773
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,276
No, no, I have. It's...

774
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,111
It's a silly little dream
to think

775
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,905
that I could take care
of the inn the way Mom did,

776
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,365
and it's not practical.

777
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,158
I like being a realtor anyhow.

778
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,160
It's not a silly dream.

779
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,706
Dad, you've been delaying your
retirement because of me.

780
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,125
It's not fair to you.

781
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,877
So...

782
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,378
[SIGHS]

783
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,338
You're right.

784
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,676
Just only to the right buyer.

785
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,555
To the right buyer.

786
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,521
[BONNIE] Are you going
to tell Julian?

787
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,356
That my dad wants to sell
the inn?

788
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,983
I don't know.
I doubt it.

789
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,485
Hear me out.

790
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,781
The job of the real estate
agent is to...

791
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:15,076
I know what the job is.
But trust me,

792
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,204
- Julian is not the right buyer.
- Why not?

793
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,667
Well, I did some research
on his company last night,

794
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,044
and Optima's smallest property
can house dozens of guests.

795
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,546
Most of them a lot more.

796
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,841
My parents' inn can house 14.

797
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,550
You know, maybe
they could expand.

798
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,594
Add a couple of buildings.
There's enough acreage.

799
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,639
Expand? The inn is beautiful.

800
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,475
Why would you want to do that,
even if you could?

801
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,894
See? See?

802
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,814
People come for the historical
beauty of the building

803
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,399
and to enjoy the land.
It's about...

804
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,194
the hiking trails
and snowshoeing and the animals.

805
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,446
It's not just square footage
for some developer

806
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,156
to fill to capacity.

807
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:57,327
So, you want someone to come in
but not change anything.

808
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,997
Well, not anything.
Of course not.

809
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,918
But I would like someone to be
careful with what they change.

810
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,045
Julian seems pretty careful.

811
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,255
Hmm, Julian is careful about
not messing up

812
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,424
his first solo project.

813
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,677
He's only been at Optima
for a year.

814
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,055
So you're getting
to know each other.

815
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,682
[LAUGHS]

816
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,517
No!

817
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,477
I mean maybe a little bit.

818
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,270
- A smidge?
- A little bit.

819
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,815
And yes, I'd like to find
a buyer

820
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:32,195
who'll want to maintain
what my parents built.

821
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,531
Someone who's going
to want to see it last.

822
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,449
I wish it could just stay
in the family.

823
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,743
Me too.

824
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,160
You know as well as I do

825
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,120
that that's just not feasible
right now.

826
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,164
Or maybe you could tell the new
owners your great ideas,

827
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,084
and they could help keep the
legacy of your family alive.

828
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,921
A very good family legacy it is.

829
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,589
Thank you, Malcolm.

830
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,508
That's not a bad idea.

831
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,135
Like I've had so many ideas
over the years,

832
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,470
social media for one.

833
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,931
My parents never
got the hang of it.

834
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,807
You've seen my dad's Instagram,
right?

835
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,225
It's just pictures of snow.

836
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,561
Yeah, I've seen them.
Very snowy.

837
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,687
So much snow.

838
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,146
[LAUGHS]

839
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,775
And I'd open the dining room
to the public,

840
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,526
not just to guests, and...

841
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,319
I'd want to partner up with
some of the local businesses

842
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,947
to have these branded
experiences,

843
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,865
especially during
the holiday season.

844
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,409
Like, um, a Halloween
cooking class

845
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,995
or sleigh rides through
hiking trails,

846
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,249
or maybe even some
Christmas dinner theater.

847
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,834
That's amazing.

848
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,045
It is amazing.

849
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,213
Bonnie, I have an idea.

850
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,307
[NIA]
Don't wear heels to a farm.

851
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:47,771
Okay. So, I want you to keep
an open mind to this.

852
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,523
Okay. I'm officially scared.

853
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,902
And.. voila.

854
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,862
It's a barn.

855
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,948
It's a barn theater.

856
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,577
Or at least it used to be,
and now it can be all yours.

857
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,329
It's a barn.

858
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,583
It's a renovated barn
that has had many additions

859
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,293
over the years,

860
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:17,216
and most importantly,
it's warm and cozy and woodsy.

861
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,260
You know what it really
reminds me of?

862
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,637
What's that?

863
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,723
The Pine Valley Inn.

864
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,851
Yeah. It looks exactly like
the Pine Valley Inn.

865
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,435
- Right?
- Minus the...

866
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,187
beautiful period building.

867
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,648
The fireplaces, the rooms.

868
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,192
What is that, an outhouse?

869
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,777
Yes, but that's not the point.

870
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,989
You have to consider the
location and the landscape

871
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,199
and just the overall feeling.

you'd like to say?

Yeah. I can't believe you just
did that.

You're the one who lied to me.

No, I didn't. It's more
complicated than that.

No, it's not.

it was for sale,

you specifically told me
it wasn't.

- Yeah, a spa.

- Well...

of my head.

- Mm-hmm?

1215
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,011
I saw it on Nia's watch.

1216
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,763
Is it like a town symbol
or something?

1217
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,599
Ah, Nia's watch, huh.

1218
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,309
Funny thing is,
that's where I got the idea

1219
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,436
for the pattern
in the first place.

1220
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,771
Nia's watch is famous?

1221
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,606
Oh, yeah.

1222
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,191
[SIGHS]

1223
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,528
A family heirloom with
a whole lot of history.

1224
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,196
Here we go.

1225
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,991
So, the story goes that her
great-great grandmother

1226
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,409
received it as a Christmas gift

1227
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,203
from her fiancé
before he went off to war.

1228
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:25,123
But later that year she got news
that he died.

1229
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,127
And on that day,
the watch stopped working.

1230
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,380
Wow.

1231
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,341
But then the following
Christmas Eve

1232
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,301
there was a big snowstorm
that came in.

1233
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,554
A whiteout type of blizzard,
okay?

1234
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,474
And while everyone was safe
inside in front of their fires,

1235
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,143
a mysterious carriage
made its way through town

1236
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,438
and headed towards the inn.

1237
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,566
And so her door blew open. Okay?

1238
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,026
And there he was.

1239
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:56,154
The love of her life
survived after all.

1240
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,868
And legend has it that the watch
started working again

1241
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,746
at that very moment.

1242
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,624
Wow.

1243
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,876
Love story for the ages.

1244
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,639
And as always, coffee and snacks
in the kitchen.

1245
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,475
I think you're going
to love it here.

1246
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,477
I think you're right.

1247
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,357
- Oh.
- Oh.

1248
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,028
- Well, you're here late.
- Yeah, I... I am.

1249
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,196
What's going on?

1250
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:43,494
- Nothing. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1251
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,461
Bonnie let me in early.

1252
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,754
Wow.

1253
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,380
Since we both had dinner,

1254
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,549
I figured we could use
a little dessert.

1255
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,885
- A little?
- Yeah.

1256
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,350
[LAUGHS]

1257
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,060
I wasn't sure what you like
so I got us both

1258
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,728
apple pie and cherry pie.

1259
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,605
It was a little too late
for Santa scones,

1260
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,233
so I got us some gingerbread
cookies from the store.

1261
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,361
Oh, that's so sweet.

1262
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,822
And if you're feeling
adventurous,

1263
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,199
Christmas movie mix from
Sean and Michelle's house.

1264
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:27,746
That looks very interesting
but very thoughtful of you.

1265
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,205
Thank you.

1266
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,625
Oh, and just to be clear,
the only reason

1267
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,628
why I came earlier
to set this all up

1268
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,964
was so that we could be
efficient in our meeting.

1269
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,423
Yes, of course.
Of course.

1270
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,135
And for the sake
of total transparency,

1271
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:47,099
I also came ready with this.

1272
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,643
- Your dad's peppermint bark.
- [LAUGHS]

1273
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,520
I saw the way you were
looking at it.

1274
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,564
You mean the way that
I was scarfing it down.

1275
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,649
I might have noticed.

1276
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:59,737
And some hot cocoa
to wash it down.

1277
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,114
Mm-hmm.

1278
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,034
Looks like we have enough sugar
here to keep us up all night.

1279
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,369
And tomorrow night.

1280
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,582
Thank you so much for all
of this and making me laugh.

1281
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,292
It's been really nice going
around town getting to know you.

1282
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,170
- Mm-hmm.
- It's been fun.

1283
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,296
I didn't realize how much
I needed to laugh.

1284
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,217
- And sing.
- And sing, yes.

1285
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,385
[LAUGHS]
Yes.

1286
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,180
And um...

1287
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:31,227
And I also realized how
much the inn means to me.

1288
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,855
I'm so sorry, Julian.

1289
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:38,192
I can't let my dad sell the inn
to a big corporation.

1290
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,318
Nia...

1291
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm not here to throw
a wrecking ball

1292
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,822
through your family's business.

1293
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,407
No. I know you're not.
But can you guarantee

1294
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,409
that Optima won't do
whatever it wants

1295
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,245
once it owns the inn?

1296
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,124
No.

1297
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,964
But I can try my best.

1298
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,550
Look.

1299
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,472
[SIGHS] Look, the honest truth
is this, okay?

1300
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,307
The inn is one of the last few
real connections

1301
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,310
I still have with my mom.

1302
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,730
So, I feel like I need
to be particular

1303
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,024
with who takes it over.

1304
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,277
Does your dad know?

1305
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,613
Why not?

1306
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,865
Well...

1307
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,534
I'm sure he'd be reasonable.

1308
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,664
If I told my dad how I felt,

1309
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,958
he would never sell the inn
and retire.

1310
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,294
And he really deserves to.

1311
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,880
He's worked so hard
his whole life for us.

1312
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,258
For me.

1313
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,220
So, if you need to find someone
else to help you find

1314
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:52,266
a property to buy
then I totally understand,

1315
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:57,313
but I can't sell the inn
to Optima.

1316
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,232
- Okay.
- Okay?

1317
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,318
We can find somewhere else
for the resort.

1318
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,903
You don't want another
real estate agent?

1319
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,115
No! Why would I do that?

1320
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,701
I've got the best realtor
right here.

1321
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,828
But your job?

1322
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,370
This can't be good
for your career.

1323
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,789
Listen.

1324
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,457
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself

1325
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,585
if I built a career off
taking your home.

1326
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,629
To be honest, I'm torn.

1327
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,507
Sure, it's great developing
these prestigious properties.

1328
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:30,346
But after coming here
and meeting you,

1329
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,181
I've remembered why
I got into this industry

1330
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:33,974
in the first place.

1331
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:37,228
To revitalize communities
through thoughtful restoration.

1332
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,688
If I can't do that
with your family's inn,

1333
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,357
we can find another place.

1334
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,483
Thank you for understanding.

1335
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,820
[CHUCKLES]

1336
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:50,324
You know, I misjudged you.

1337
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,159
You did?

1338
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,994
Yeah.

1339
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,497
You're one of the good ones,
Julian Thompson.

1340
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,635
Thank you so much.
I love Santa scones.

1341
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,637
They're amazing.

1342
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,807
Robyn?

1343
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,560
[LAUGHS]
Hello there.

1344
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,481
I was just about to call you.
Have a seat.

1345
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,361
Aren't these delicious?

1346
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,987
We have to get these
for the resort.

1347
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,073
Sure.

1348
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,533
And you're here because?

1349
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,162
It's almost Christmas, and you
still haven't closed on the inn.

1350
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,830
Oh.

1351
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,665
I just don't think that's
the right property for us.

1352
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,377
Are you kidding me?
It's perfect.

1353
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,837
Okay. Look.

1354
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:50,717
I've spoken to the realtor, and
they've decided not to sell.

1355
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,010
Did you start by
lowballing them?

1356
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,971
Oh, classic rookie mistake.

1357
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:58,100
No. They just changed
their minds.

1358
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,477
I actually think we could
find some better properties.

1359
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,937
Such as?

1360
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,398
Well, I'm looking at several
properties today.

1361
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,066
Give me 24 hours.

1362
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,778
[SIGHS] Okay.

1363
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,571
But if you don't find something
by the end of the day tomorrow,

1364
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,073
I'm going to have to step in

1365
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,700
and make them an offer
they cannot refuse.

1366
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,328
Right.

1367
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,543
Oh! Hey, sorry I'm late. I was
just going to grab a...

1368
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,837
- Coffee.
- Yeah.

1369
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,006
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1370
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,966
- I wouldn't mind grabbing a...
- Scone.

1371
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,426
To eat.

1372
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:35,762
- Got that as well.
- Great.

1373
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,556
- Hey, are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1374
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,352
I'm just uh, eager to get going.
Is that your car?

1375
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,646
Yeah. It hasn't changed
since yesterday.

1376
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,315
Let's go.

1377
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,573
[NIA] Wow, this is great.

1378
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,701
[JULIAN] Ah. It's perfect.

1379
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,455
Oh. I guess it's...

1380
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,040
Not so perfect.

1381
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,916
No.

1382
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,836
Okay um, well,
we have 30 minutes

1383
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,629
until our next appointment.

1384
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,839
So uh...

1385
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,590
I've gotta tell you something.

1386
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,510
If we don't find something soon,

1387
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,054
Robyn is going to put in
an offer for the inn.

1388
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,180
A big offer.

1389
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,973
But aren't you on a budget?

1390
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,475
I'm on a budget.

1391
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,769
She is the boss and she
doesn't like to lose.

1392
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,232
So, so much for my
independent project.

1393
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,607
I'm sorry.

1394
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,235
Working with me
is really getting you

1395
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,903
into trouble, isn't it?

1396
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,446
Maybe we...

1397
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,283
What? What's wrong?

1398
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:42,954
You said independent, right?
Independent. I have an idea.

1399
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,889
Oh, Mrs. Hahn.
Enjoying your stay?

1400
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,641
Very much so. You have
a lovely place.

1401
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,520
Thank you. I'm going to miss it.

1402
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,855
Miss it? Are you leaving?

1403
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,441
Finally retiring.

1404
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,984
This is my last Christmas
at the inn.

1405
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,529
Really? Good for you.

1406
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:19,199
You know, I haven't properly
introduced myself.

1407
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,452
Let me give you my card.

1408
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,498
[ROBYN] We should talk.

1409
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,637
Here we are.

1410
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,681
Pine Valley Independent.
You weren't kidding.

1411
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,809
Nope. It's the oldest newspaper
in the region.

1412
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,019
Almost as old as
Pine Valley itself.

1413
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,147
They've just moved into another
building, and you know,

1414
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,191
I never thought to present it
to you because it's downtown

1415
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,777
and you had been saying
woodsy and rustic.

1416
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,531
But then it dawned on me.

1417
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,659
This building, it has some
real local...

1418
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,077
Character.

1419
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,497
I was going to with magic.

1420
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,748
And look, I know it doesn't
have the acreage

1421
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,001
that you were looking for.
However...

1422
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,794
I think with a really
smart renovation

1423
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:16,047
it can be a self-contained
resort.

1424
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,343
I mean, we are right around
the corner from Main Street.

1425
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,262
- Part of the action.
- Exactly.

1426
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,847
It's still just an office
building.

1427
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,265
Yes. But it's an office building

1428
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,393
that is antique-y and classic

1429
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,770
and has some real local charm.

1430
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,024
Come on, let me show you inside.

1431
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,652
This property has been on the
market for a number of months,

1432
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,654
so I'm sure we can get
a great deal on it.

1433
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,031
I mean, currently it's just
being used for little events

1434
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:46,453
like birthday parties, baby showers,
Christmas get-togethers, I guess.

1435
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:51,667
But what I love about it is
that there is so much space.

1436
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:56,213
Like I was thinking maybe
you could put reception here,

1437
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,507
maybe put the dining room
over here,

1438
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:02,302
and then you can even put
a ballroom over here.

1439
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,721
There's so much space.
The world's your oyster.

1440
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,224
Right? And then I was thinking

1441
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,268
the guest rooms
can be downstairs.

1442
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,231
You know, I think this might
actually work.

1443
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,941
And it's not too far away from
Sean's new high-tech campus.

1444
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,445
Really? That would be
a steady source of clientele.

1445
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,155
I'm sure your boss
would love that.

1446
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,741
Maybe I could get Sean to write
a letter of intent.

1447
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:25,825
That's a brilliant idea.

1448
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,202
Yeah.

1449
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,954
Wait till you see outside.
Come on.

1450
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,711
So, just beyond these trees
over here

1451
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,796
is the most incredible view
you've ever seen.

1452
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,465
This could really work.

1453
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,427
- Right?
- With the right amount of effort

1454
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,387
it could be quite romantic.

1455
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:48,432
And I was thinking
just around the back

1456
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,642
you could develop an outdoor
lounge space.

1457
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,478
Something with uh,
maybe a gazebo,

1458
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,191
a beautiful outdoor fire-pit,
maybe a little dance floor.

1459
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,569
- What are you doing?
- May I?

1460
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:02,237
- No, I don't do photos.
- Why not?

1461
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,363
Julian! Stop it!

1462
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,740
What's wrong with it?

1463
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,575
Come on, I need it
for the scale.

1464
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,910
[LAUGHS] Scale, right.
Yeah, sure.

1465

Photography 101.

1466
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,996
You can't get a true scale
of a place

1467
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,416
unless you get a stunning
real estate agent

1468
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,418
standing in the center
of the frame.

1469
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,547
[LAUGHS] Oh, listen to
the lyrics. Stunning, huh?

1470
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,633
Come on. It's stunning.
You're beautiful.

1471
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,302
- You're gorgeous.
- Okay, that's enough.

1472
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,595
- No, no. I'm not going to stop.
- Stop it.

1473
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:27,804
I will not stop.
I need to see

1474
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:28,972
some pearly whites.
Come on,

1475
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,140
you gotta sell the place.

1476
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,101
[GROANING] Fine. Fine.

1478
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:36,896
Yeah.

1479
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,565
Okay, my turn.

1480
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:39,941
Oh, no, no. We don't want
to do that to anybody.

1481
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,318
I'll take a photo with you then.

1482
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,570
- Okay. That's cool.

Um...

1489
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,216
You see, the thing
about my job is

1490
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:10,013
once I make the deal someone
else handles the details.

1491
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:14,559
So, sooner or later I will
no longer be your client.

1492
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,189
That's an excellent point.

1493
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,734
But you're an up and comer

1494
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,737
and you'll be onto
your next adventure.

1495
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,904
Yeah, but...

1496
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,574
Probably somewhere more exotic.

1497
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,410
In the middle of nowhere.

1498
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:36,540
In search of more local magic.

1499
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:41,670
You see, the thing about
magic is it's very rare.

1500
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:46,299
And if you find it,
you'd be a fool to let it go.

- We should probably go.
- Mm-hmm.

1506
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,361
All of our other
niche properties

1507
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,822
are located in the countryside,
remote.

1508
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:11,157
This would be great for lovers
of Americana.

1509
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,659
Like history buffs.

1510
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,786
We could decorate it
just like this place.

1511
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,831
The old pictures and articles,

1512
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,875
old printing press
in the basement.

1513
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,378
Think "themed bar."

1514

You're a smart and creative guy,

1515
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,383
and I... I love your passion.

1516
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,843
But it's just not as good
as the inn.

1517
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,261
- Robyn...
- I've already talked

1518
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,846
- to the owner.
- You spoke to the owner?

1519
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,557
Yes, and I have to say
I'm a little confused.

1520
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,267
You said he refused to sell,

1521
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,728
but Patrick himself is saying
quite the opposite.

1522
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,146
He changes his mind a lot.

1523
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,316
He's looking to retire.
Seemed pretty motivated to me.

1524
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,068
Okay, here's the thing.

1525
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,112
He and his daughter, who's also
his real estate agent,

1526
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:53,074
are very concerned that we'll
go in there and change the inn,

1527
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,702
make changes to the grounds.

1528
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:59,330
Based on the occupancy level,
it just doesn't make sense

1529
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,500
unless we go in for
an expansion.

1530
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,796
Is this his real estate agent?
Adorable.

1531
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,339
It's not like that.

1532
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,674
Whatever, Julian.

1533
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,426
Just tell them what they
want to hear.

1534
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,053
Give them 20 points
above their asking price,

1535
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,640
and good old Patrick will be
too busy enjoying his retirement

1536
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,433
to even care.

1537
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,645
The fine print in the deal
will let us do whatever we want.

1538
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,899
- That's no way to do business.
- We do it all the time.

1539
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:29,653
You yourself have helped work
on deals like this all year.

1540
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,530
Yeah, but it's not a big
corporate entity.

1541
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:36,660
It's a small mom and pop inn.
They have roots here.

1542
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,704
Julian, word of advice,

1543
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,582
learn to separate the business
from the personal.

1544
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:47,337
It will serve you well in your
very promising career.

1545
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,756
Now, Patrick knows you've been
working with his daughter,

1546
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,716
so he wants to make sure
you're the one to do...

1547
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,802
How about I loop in Nia?
She's their agent.

1548
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,428
No. No, no, no.

1549
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,597
You're going to deal
with the father directly.

1550
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,435
I have laid the groundwork.
I just need you to close it.

01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,897
Julian, I know how
these things work.

01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,132
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, good afternoon.

1556
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,467
Mr. Thompson.

1557
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,093
Please, call me Julian.

1558
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,804
All right Julian.

1559
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,597
You coming to the party
tomorrow night?

1560
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,307
Nia said it was just family
and friends.

1561
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,142
Any friend of my daughter's,
a friend of mine.

1562
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,811
So, you've got to come.

1563
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:46,730
Okay. Thank you.

1564
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,900
Listen I uh, I came here
to talk to you about the inn.

1565
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,235
I know you spoke to my boss,
Robyn.

1566
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:55,530
Oh, yeah. Nice lady.
I like what she had to say.

1567
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,448
Yes. She's very good
at her job.

1568
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,451
Sounds like your company will
take good care of the place.

1569
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,704
Uh, yeah. I mean, I would
do my very best

1570
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:05,331
to ensure that Optima respected
what you've built here,

1571
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:09,085
but I can't guarantee
we won't make any changes.

1572
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,754
Well, of course you would.

1573
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,965
The back porch could sure use
a new coat of paint.

1574
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,260
But I'd think twice about
any big changes.

1575
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:20,931
My wife always said
this place is...

1576
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:24,225
close to a historical landmark.

1577
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,186
I'll make sure the powers
that be understand.

1578
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,439
Why don't we go in and chat?

1579
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,859
Maybe some hot cocoa will
help us figure things out.

1580
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,027
You got hot cocoa?

1581
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:35,570
And some little marshmallows.

1582
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:36,780
Okay. Don't say any more.

1583
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,240
Come on. Say no more.

1584
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:44,079
Oh, come on.
Look at this one.

1585
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,247
[LAUGHS]

1586
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,707
Oh yeah, we were so cute.

1587
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,668
We were so darn cute.
Well, I was anyway.

1588
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,088
[NIA SIGHS]

1589
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,756
No word from Julian?

1590
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,092
No. He should've emailed me
by now to let me know

1591
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,804
his boss agreed to the sale.

1592
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,098
Hey, thanks for pulling
those photos of the inn.

1593
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,058
I guess, we're going to have
to list it now

1594
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,476
that my dad needs
a new buyer, huh?

1595
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,185
I can't believe
he still wants to sell.

1596
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,438
I know, right?

1597
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,399
Oh, this is from
that awful ice storm.

1598
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,443
I think we were like eight.

1599
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,988
Oh, remember everyone complained
about the power being out,

1600
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,697
but we loved it?

1601
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,742
You know, living by candlelight
for a few days.

1602
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:27,789
The ice made the inn sparkle
in the woods like a fairy tale.

[SIGHS]

1604
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,460
He should've called by now.

1605
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,046
No news is good news?

1606
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,798
I don't know.

1607
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,851
Thank you, sir.

1608
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,186
I guess we have ourselves
a deal.

1609
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,647
A deal?

1610
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,483
What deal?

1611
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,361
We're selling the inn
to Julian's company.

1612
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,988
What?

1613
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,406
Dad, you can't sell the inn
to Optima Getaways.

1614
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,658
You promised.

1615
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,742
If you would let me explain...

1616
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,536
Don't worry, sweetheart.

1617
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,288
We had a nice long talk,
and he'll take good care of us.

1618
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,915
But he's not...

1619
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,168
Dad, how could you make
this decision without me?

1620
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,587
Because no buyer would ever be
the right buyer.

1621
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,090
For once I need to do
the sensible thing.

1622
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:22,343
I just wanted to rip the
Band-Aid off and do it, you know?

1623
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,303
But is it the sensible thing?

1624
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,430
They're making a very
generous offer.

1625
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,018
Money I can actually retire on
in comfort.

1626
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,562
We talked about this.

1627
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,567
I need to talk to you outside.

1628
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,409
[CRYING]
How could you do this?

1629
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,911
I didn't have a choice.

1630
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,829
Robyn didn't like
the news building,

1631
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,706
and she was about to make
the offer with or without me.

1632
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,957
But at least this way I can
still try and protect the inn.

1633
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,500
No.
Why didn't you tell me

1634
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,169
you were making the deal
with my dad?

1635
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,461
You went behind my back.

1636
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,255
No. No, no, no.

1637
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:02,341
I was just trying
to fix it first.

1638
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,885
Come up with a solution.

1639
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,220
If you'd hear me out,
I've got...

1640
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,932
Maybe I didn't misjudge you.

1641
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,850
I've included some provisions
to try to protect...

1642
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,602
[TEARFULLY]
Try? To try and do what?

1643
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,354
What does that even mean, huh?

1644
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,023
You're the one who told me
you do the deal

1645
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:18,399
and someone else handles
the detail.

1646
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,400
I'm trying my best here.

1647
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,818
This is your best?

1648
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:27,117
Julian, I trusted you.
I trusted you.

1649
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:31,121
You got what you wanted.
I think you should go.

1650
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,998
Really?

1651
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,015
I didn't realize it would be
like this, Nia.

1652
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,768
I wanted to make the decision
so you didn't have to.

1653
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:59,107
No, it's not your fault.
Julian, these developers...

1654
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:02,610
they can be very charming
when they need to be.

1655
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,029
Let's go on in and whip up
some dinner and talk it out.

01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,530
Maybe you'll have one
of your brilliant ideas

1657
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,033
that'll make this work
for everyone.

1658
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,203
It's a done deal, Dad.

1659
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,747
It's... [SIGHS]

1660
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,625
It stopped again.

1661
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,045
It did.

1662
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,556
She wouldn't even let me
get a word in.

1663
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,434
She's just disappointed
right now.

1664
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,270
All right, just playing
devil's advocate,

1665
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:39,981
but how bad of a resort
would Optima build?

1666
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,232
They're liable to make it
look like

1667
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,067
a cartoon Swiss ski village.

1668
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,195
That wouldn't even look good
in Switzerland.

1669
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,155
It's not what's right
for the inn.

1670
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,990
What is right?

1671
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,159
I mean, we could expand

1672
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,703
while still respecting
what's already there.

1673
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,579
Nia's big on the surrounding
landscape.

1674
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,248
She doesn't want to add
more buildings,

1675
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,042
so we could just build out
from the main house.

1676
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,418
By "we" you mean you and Nia?

1677
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,005
We follow the roofline,
add some more rooms upstairs,

1678
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,967
add a solarium next to the
restaurant on the sunset side.

1679
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,303
Wow, you've really thought
this through.

1680
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,889
I guess, I have.

1681
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,473
Then you need to make it happen.

1682
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,642
It'd be a shame not to.

1683
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:20,396
Yeah, I know.
But it's not my job.

1684
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,481

the place and move on.

01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,524
Not get all...

01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,236
What? Settled down?

01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,154
Let me tell you, Thompson.

all my business here.

Right.

01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,585
Yes. There's a spark.

a great idea.

1694
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:48,299
I got a great idea,
but it's going to cost you.

1695
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:51,552
It's going to cost me?

affects a community.

Bonnie, there's no way I'm going
to be able to come up

1702

with that kind of money.

1703
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,655
I would be willing to buy
you out of your half

Thank you. That's really
kind of you,

but I don't think
it'll be enough.

01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,414
Maybe there's a... a loophole,
you know?

1708
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,457
We're not seeing.

1709
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:22,917
I doubt it.

what to do.

This was my mom's favorite
picture frame.

01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,770
I remember when she bought it
at the antique store

just down the road.

- What do you mean? What is it?
- I don't know.

It's probably
an old price tag or something.

Oh.

1723
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:20,557
It's an application to get
the inn heritage certified?

Well, thank you for
your history lesson,

what a heritage building is.
