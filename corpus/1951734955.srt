00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
25.000

2
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,874
Keep her straight...
level.

3
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,251
It's your first time up, so
don't do anything interesting.

4
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,336
- Who me?
- Yeah, you.

5
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,505
Remember, she stalls out
at about 100.

6
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,009
Keep the air speed up,
otherwise you'll be drifting all over.

7
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,888
- If the ailerons start to shimmy...
- I've flown a plane or two.

8
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,349
Not like this one.
This one's a handful.

9
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,603
You sneeze and you'll end up
upside down in a field.

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,566
- That's fresh paint, damn it!
- Do you want me to crash?

11
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,361
Gum ain't gonna keep
your butt in the air.

12
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,577
Treat her nice, Clifford. She's gonna
take us all the way to the nationals.

13
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,165
- Let's make some history.
- Yeah.

14
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:09,219
Crank her up, Goose!

15
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,809
- Make her hot!
- Hot and brakes.

16
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,801
Watch this, Peevy!

17
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,810
[Cheering]

18
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,816
National air race
is our next stop!

19
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:44,416
[Sirens]

20
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,965
[Gunshots]

21
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,929
You tryin' to save ammo?
Nail 'em!

22
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:00,140
I can't get a clean shot.
Wish that black-and-white
would get out of the way.

23
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:11,443
Careful what
you wish for.

24
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,310
[Engine Sputtering]

25
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,902
[Fitch] This is the 3rd car
in a month. Hoover'll be spittin' nails.

26
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,904
The heck with Hoover!

27
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,756
- Outta my way. I can't see.
- Keep drivin'!

28
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,599
Quit movin'. You're
ruining my shot!

29
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,018
Get back.
Get...

30
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:39,413
Let's go, Lenny.
We can't get caught with...

31
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,583
Lousy feds!

32
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,178
Somethin' ain't right.

33
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,770
- [Sirens]
- Sorry, Lenny.

34
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,620
He's gettin' away.

35
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,977
Get it off!

36
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,939
- Get him out!
- Peevy!

37
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,817
Hit the latch!
Hurry!

38
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,070
Get the hell
outta there!

39
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:55,447
Where you goin'?
Cliff!

40
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,244
You all right?
You okay?

41
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,879
Well... that's
the end of that!

42
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,801
- All right, get it outta here.
- [Peevy] Wait a minute.

43
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,595
You chase crooks
across our runway,

44
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,764
crash into my pilot,
and it's our fault?

45
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,184
No offence, pops, but we
got more important things...

46
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,770
- than get all sweaty
about whose fault it was.
- Listen, buddy,

47
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,815
building that plane took three years
and every cent we had.

48
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,192
File a claim with Uncle Sam.
You could get lucky.

49
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:36,613
And wait six months... a year?
We made a livin' with that plane.

50
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:39,658
Well maybe it's time
to get a real job.

51
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:45,789
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Relax! Relax!

52
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,916
You got that one
free, kid.

53
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,627
- One more and you'll be
eatin' soft food for a month!
- Yeah?

54
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,838
- Relax.
- That fly boy hangs one...

55
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,965
on my kisser and
you let him waltz?

56
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,302
Maybe you
had it comin'.

57
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:03,724
- We need a word with the patient.
- In private.

58
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,521
Your buddy's getting fitted
for a pine overcoat.

59
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:14,485
If you make it to County General,
Alcatraz is your new digs.

60
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,904
Spit it out, Wilmer.
Where's the package?

61
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,616
Blown to hell.

62
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:23,285
Why don't you
go look for it?

63
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,748
- Get him outta here.
- Hey, Fitch?

64
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,588
- Take a look at this.
- [Whistle]

65
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:38,926
[Wooly]
That must be the gizmo, all right.

66
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,053
Okay, button it up.

67
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:44,723
- Call 'im, Wooly.
- Why me? I called last time.

68
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:48,310
- But he likes you.
- [Sigh]

69
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,565
There's no mistake
about that, Wooly?

70
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,069
- [Wooly] I'm afraid not.
We got what's left of it.
- I see.

71
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,114
- It was damn sloppy.
- It could've been worse.
We got the gizmo.

72
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,451
- Yes, it could have.
- We'll take it down to headquarters.

73
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,621
Was that Wolinski?

74
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:11,458
They chased it to an
airstrip in the valley.

75
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,461
There was a wreck
on the runway.

76
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,339
The X-3 was destroyed.

77
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,800
Better lost than
in the wrong hands.

78
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:25,270
- How soon can you rebuild it?
- Rebuild it?

79
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,356
Not a chance.

80
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:31,151
My people in Washington will have
something to say about that.

81
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:35,489
Your people in Washington want to turn
anything that flies into a weapon.

82
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,616
Apparently someone else
had the same idea.

83
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,953
I'm afraid
we must insist.

84
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,414
I don't work
for the government.

85
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,875
I cooperate
at my discretion.

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,920
Two of my best pilots were
killed during the test phase.

87
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:53,507
God knows how many more men
would have died if it had flown.

88
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:57,261
No, gentlemen.

89
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,097
I'm sorry I ever dreamed
the damn thing up.

90
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,351
Sir, I wish
you'd reconsider.

91
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,187
What do we tell
the president?

92
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:11,817
Tell him
the dream is over.

93
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:15,988
Tell him
Howard Hughes said so.

94
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,409
[Peevy]
What's this 300 gallons here?

95
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,703
We don't burn that much fuel
in two years!

96
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:27,166
You burned it in two seconds when my
fuel truck went up. It's all itemized.

97
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,127
I didn't blow up your truck.
The guy in the car did.

98
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,337
After bouncing
off you.

99
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:35,007
Pilots are responsible
for a safe landing.

100
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:38,469
Where we gonna get this kind of dough?
We've gotta sell the Gee Bee for scrap!

101
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:42,139
I'm sorry. I hate to
kick you when you're down.

102
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:46,560
But business is business.
I'm out of pocket here.

103
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,272
Of course, I could always
use the old clown act.

104
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,108
We don't do the clown act
no more.

105
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,194
Peevy, it's worth
fifteen bucks a shot.

106
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:58,947
10 bucks a shot;
5 bucks goes toward your bill.

107
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,826
Think it over. See it my way
or see me in court.

108
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,746
The clown suit is
in the storeroom.

109
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:09,374
First show's at nine.
Don't be late.

110
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,129
Lousy nickel-nurser.

111
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:17,007
Clown act!

112
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:20,844
Good thinkin', Clifford!
You just set us back four years.

113
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,640
Plus which "Miss Mabel" here
is a flying coffin.

114
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,102
She never let us down before.
I'll go real easy on her.

115
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:32,815
Number five piston is shot,
nothing left but spit and wire.

116
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,733
I could fly a shoe box
if it had wings, Peev.

117
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,237
- Ouch!
- What's the matter?

118
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,739
There's somethin'
under this seat.

119
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:45,244
[Grunting]

120
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:48,330
That's my
duffel bag.

121
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:52,209
- What've you got in there?
- I don't know, but it's heavy.

122
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:55,629
- Peev, clean that table off.
- All right.

123
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,347
Open her up.

124
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,648
[Gasp]

125
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,777
Oh, my!
What've we got here?

126
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,779
Take the bag.

127
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:24,950
[Grunting]

128
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:30,289
- That's a piece of work, isn't it?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,750
What do you suppose it is,
a bomb or somethin'?

130
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,918
Too complex
to be a bomb.

131
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,796
I don't see
any moving parts.

132
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,132
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

133
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,660
- The housing's still cool.
- Huh.

134
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:12,998
[Sniffing]
Runs on alcohol.

135
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,542
What's the damn thing for?

136
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,337
- Hold it, Peev.
- Huh?

137
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,339
Hold it!

138
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,951
[Sawing]

139
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,789
[Cliff]
Tip her over. Tip her over.

140
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,791
- Easy, easy!
- I got it.

141
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,670
Watch it.
[Grunting]

142
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:03,389
What's goin' on, Sinclair?
Lenny is dead.

143
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,517
Wilmer's wrapped up like
a mummy in County General.

144
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,646
You didn't
play straight with me.

145
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:15,150
I'm sorry about your boys,
Eddie... truly.

146
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:19,863
- What went wrong?
- It's the feds that went wrong.

147
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,701
This was supposed to be
a simple snatch-and-grab.
What the hell is going on?

148
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,203
I didn't say
it'd be simple.

149
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:29,665
Snatch-and-grab is what
you're supposed to be good at.

150
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:32,251
That's what I pay you for.

151
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,378
Now where's the package?

152
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,463
Nothing's gonna happen
until you tell me...

153
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,216
why this merchandise is
so important to the feds.

154
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:46,557
Send me a cheque.

155
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:50,102
- Let's get out of here, boys.
- It's a rocket.

156
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:55,190
A rocket?

157
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:00,904
Yeah...
Like in the comic books.

158
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,994
- What happened to it?
- I don't know.

159
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,830
Wilmer knows. He's in
the hospital surrounded by cops.

160
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,666
- In a couple of days...
- We don't have a couple of days.

161
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:18,130
- What room's Wilmer in?
- [Laughing]

162
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,593
Mr Movie Star!

163
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:26,472
He's gonna walk in with a smile
on his face and a handful of posies.

164
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,558
He's gonna charm
the feds to death.

165
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:32,519
[Laughing]

166
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,356
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

167
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:39,234
Who cares what
you had in mind?

168
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:42,529
You don't need
my services any more.

169
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,990
You can take it from here.
I'll tell you what.

170
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:48,160
You pay me what you owe me
'cause you're half lunatic.

171
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,706
Yes, shoot!

172
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:58,128
I want that rocket, Eddie, not
next week, not tomorrow... now.

173
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,756
We have a deal?

174
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:13,644
You bring me that rocket
and I'll double your price.

175
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:26,990
You'll triple my price.

176
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:37,835
What's a movie star
need a rocket for anyway?

177
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,844
Bloody amateurs!

Yes.

181
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:16,290
[Sinclair] Lothar,
I've got another job for you...

182
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:19,209
a condolence call.

183

184
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:32,222
[Cliff]
Come on, Peev.

185
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:44,735
[Peevy]
Here goes.

186
00:18:56,253 --> 00:19:00,007
[Peevy] Well, I'm lookin' at it
but I don't believe it.

187
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,639
- Peevy... the stake!
- Get down!

188
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,767
That thing'll
cut you in half.

189
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:24,907
We lost it.

190
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,368
I told you I should have
tested it myself.

191
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:32,331
Yeah, you'd be halfway
to Kansas by now, chowder head!

Turn her off!
Turn her off!

194
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:04,571
That must've woke up
the whole valley.

195
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,573
Pick her up.
Let's get out of here.

196
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:14,623
- Peevy, you'd pay to see
a man fly, wouldn't you?
- Ha!

197
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:18,794
- You've gotta be outta your mind.
- I'm talkin' about making real money.

198
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:23,048
Not just 10 bucks a show but
enough to get us back on our
feet and into the nationals.

199
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:27,302
Are your eyes painted on?
This thing is like strapping
nitroglycerine to your back.

200
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,639
- The feds are mixed up in this.
- I don't want to keep it.

201
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:33,100
I just want to borrow it
for a while.

202
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:36,395
When you borrow something and don't
tell nobody, they call that stealing.

203
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,482
As soon as we can afford
a new plane, we'll give it back.

204
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,402
Did you see what
this thing did back there?

205
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:47,656
You're always telling me what
a genius you are! Fix it.

206
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:51,744
We're gonna need
one hell of a lawyer.

207
00:20:56,707 --> 00:21:00,377
I think we're gonna
need a helmet.

208

sweet little headache #

209
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:07,384
# But you are
lots of fun #

00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:10,596
- [Honking]
- Whose is it?

211
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:13,140
Yours.

212
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,659
'Evening, Miss Pye.

213
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:34,745
You know my rules;
no gentlemen after 6:00 p.m.

214
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,707
- Well, I'm no gentleman.
- You can say that again.

215
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,127
- Hello.
- Hi.

216
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:44,880
- Good night, Mrs Pye.
- Have a good time.

217
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:48,092
If he tries anything, deck him.
Don't forget the curfew.

218
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:52,888
- I lock up at 11:00 sharp.
- [Cliff] Yes, warden.

219
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:55,599
Guess what?
I think I got the part.

220
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:58,018
- That's great.
- I won't know for sure 'til tomorrow,

221
00:21:58,102 --> 00:22:00,562
but the director said he
liked my reading the best.

222
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,857
- You have lines this time.
- Just one.

223
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:07,111
- But it's to Neville Sinclair.
- Okay!

224
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:09,446
Let's hear it.

225
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,699
"Oh, my prince.

226
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:16,120
Would that you'd
drink of my lips as deeply."

227
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:19,081
And then he kisses you?

228
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,167
No. He's too busy
killing someone.

229
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,379
- Now you tell me.
- What?

230
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,424
The maiden voyage.
How'd she fly?

231
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:32,136
She flew great.
Landing had a few bumps.

232
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,597
We'd better scram if we're
gonna catch this Cagney movie.

233
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,766
Uh-uh-uh.
It's my turn to pick.

234
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,768
Uh-oh.

235
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,770
There's a new
Neville Sinclair movie.

236
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:43,939
Oh, Jen, you know
Cagney's better.

237
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:47,109
You won't catch Cagney
lounging around his penthouse,

238
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,987
walking poodles in the park,
or doing any of...

239
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,781
Or getting shot down
behind enemy lines?

240
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:55,207
- What are you talking about?
- The movie,

241
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,418
"Wings of Honour."

242
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,087
- Neville Sinclair?
- Uh-huh.

243
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,089
Oh, brother.

244
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,508
This I gotta see.

245
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:09,096
[Announcer]
Hitler assures the western powers he is
not massing troops at the Czech border.

246
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,390
Here comes the Fuehrer's latest
symbol of German progress,

247
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,810
the airship "Luxembourg,"
beginning its American tour...

248
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,021
- to promote world peace.
- [Cliff] World peace!

249
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,106
What he means is
a piece of the world!

250
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,150
Excuse me.

251
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,403
...on the first stop
of their goodwill tour.

252
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,615
- Their last goodwill tour
buried half of Europe.
- Shh.

253
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,201
Though filled with
explosive hydrogen...

254
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,414
Your Gee Bee could fly
circles around that thing.

255
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,586
After the short visit, it was
into the clouds to continue a journey...

256
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,297
that will carry the "Luxembourg"
to Chicago, St. Louis,

257
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,467
across the Rockies...
and finally to Los Angeles.

258
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,094
Look us up, boys,
when you get to Hollywood.

Okay, okay!
Ease off!

269
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,792
I pulled a switch. I got
the package stashed real good.

270
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,212
It's at the airfield, hangar 3.
It's in some old plane.

And then,

276
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,596
get this, fellas,
at the end of the movie...

277
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,641
he flies over enemy trenches
and drops a bottle of champagne.

278
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,728
And let me guess. It hits the general
and we win the war.

279
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,855
It was symbolic.
He was being chivalrous.

280
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,441
Where'd he
get the champagne?

281
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:11,987
- They didn't have liquor stores
at the front, did they?
- Not that I recall.

282
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,114
[Jenny]
It doesn't matter where he got it.

283
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,909
That's not the point.
It's just...

284
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,662
Forget it.

285
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,999
Malcolm,
the wheel came off.

286
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,670
Oh, let me see,

287
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,631
Sure, we'll fix her up.

288
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,050
Did I ever tell you about the time
I got shot down by the Red Baron?

289
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,597
No?

290
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,850
There I was flying over
the Ardennes on patrol...

291
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,187
when he comes screaming
out of the sun, guns blazing.

292
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,066
And then, smack!

293
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,947
- Bull's-eye, ace.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.

294
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,199
It's okay, Malcolm.

295
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,245
Thanks, Cliff.

00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,748
You know, Cliff,

297
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:09,134
it wouldn't hurt to try someplace new...
away from the airfield.

298
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:12,680
Like where? The Copa?
The Brown Derby?

299
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,848
Why not the South Seas Club
while you're dreamin'.

300
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:17,810
Okay, how 'bout this.

301
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:20,354
We'll go have a real night
on the town...

302

after you win

303
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,360
[Cliff] Yeah, swell,
after I win the nationals.

304
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:29,280
You gonna fly
in the nationals after all?

305
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:31,991
Glad to hear it after
that landing today.

306
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:36,036
[Millie]
How about a warm-up, Malcolm?

307
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,205
You said there were
a few bumps.

308
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,376
Boy, I'll say. She folded like a kite
when she hit the runway.

309
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:45,879
We thought Cliffie's number
was up, with the fire and all.

310
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,054
I was gonna tell ya.

311
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,392
I didn't want to ruin
your evening.

312
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:01,979
It's very thoughtful of you.
You'd rather make a fool of me?

313
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,566
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,861
I don't want you
to be sorry.

315
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:13,240
I want you to stop treating me
like... a stranger.

316
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,160
When something goes wrong,
I should be the first to know.

317
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:19,121
I shouldn't be
the last.

318
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:22,249
Everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.

319
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,587
I had an audition.

320
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:28,589
It was important to me.

321
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:30,925
I understand.

322
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,093
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.

323
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:36,639
You got a big part. You stood
behind Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.

324
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,770
Good night, Millie.
Thank you for the soup.

00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,690
[Millie]
Well,

326
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,109
go after her,
you dope.

327
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,948
Jenny!

328
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,455

329
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,416
Cliff,
I, uh...

330
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,004
- I'm sorry, I really stuck...
- Malcolm, it's okay.

331
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,507
It's not your fault.

332
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:34,571
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:37,700
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear.

334
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:41,078
We'll call it the end
of a perfect day.

335
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,959
What're you two
scrappin' about this time?

336
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,961
I don't know, Peev.

337
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:51,297
I just can't figure
this girl out.

338
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,341
She hangs around with
this Hollywood crowd all day,

339
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,136
talkin' about movie stars
and nightclubs...

340
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,471
That's her work. She don't care
about them phoney-baloneys.

341
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,473
She cares about you.

342
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:04,852
I want her to think
I'm makin' something of myself,

343
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,730
Not that I'm just
an out-of-work pilot.

344
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,149
You got a good thing
goin' with that girl.

345
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,234
If she flies the coop,
I'm tellin' you...

346
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,863
it's gonna be
your fault.

347
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,699
What do you know
about women, Peev?

348
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:22,953
You haven't had a date
since 1932.

349
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,748
Flora Maxwell.

350
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:30,169
There was no point
in datin' nobody after her.

351
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,853
[Rooster Crowing]

352
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,245
He's got to be kidding!

353
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,628
- [Grunting]
- Ha, ha, ha.

354
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:24,563
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were a sporting man.

355
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:29,235
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.

356
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,955
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

357
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:45,084
- Why wait?
- [Gasp]

358
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:47,836
Good heavens!
It's Sir Reginald!

359
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,881
None other!

360
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,060
Oh, my prince,

361
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,813
would that you'd drink
of my lips as deeply.

362
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:10,985
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Back to first positions.

363
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:18,075
Good lord! How many times
are we gonna have to do this?

364
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:22,121
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.

365
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:26,542
- So act... but don't act
like you're acting.
- All right.

366
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,924
Is she a block of wood!
Your audition was better.

367
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:38,137
Everybody's was better! Does it matter
when you're the producer's niece?

368
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:41,432
She gets a scene with Neville Sinclair
and we play scenery.

369
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:44,977
- I love Hollywood.
- Everybody, positions.

370
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,688
Let's try to get it
right this time.

371
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:51,150
"Laughing Bandit,"
scene 114, take 28.

372
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,694
[Director]
And... action!

373
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:56,697
[Sinclair]
Ha-ha-ha.

374
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,620
[Sir Alec] What?
Kill me as I stand?

375
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,705
I thought you were
a sporting man.

376
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,001
[Sinclair] I'd hate to stain my legend
on a villain such as you.

377
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:14,715
[Sir Alec]
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

378
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,719
- Why wait?
- It's Sir Reginald!

379
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,682
[Sinclair]
None other.

380
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:31,523
Oh, my prince, would that
you'd drink of my lips as deeply.

381
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,699
[Screaming]

382
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,252
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Jenny Blake.

383
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:54,588
Oh, Jenny...
Jenny Blake.

384
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:59,009
Does anyone know
a Jenny Blake?

385
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,636
Cut.

386
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,763
- I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr Sinclair?

387
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:05,140
Give us a hand
with this flat.

388
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:10,020
- You okay, Mr Sinclair?
- I'm fine.

389
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:14,275
Never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.

390
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,237
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!

391
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,782
Charlie!

392
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,909
Charlie.

393
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,870
Forgive me, Charlie.
I had no idea.

394
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,915
Did you think I was
stealing the scene?

395
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,459
Don't talk.
Don't even move.

396
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,963
Get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.

397
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:39,091
Gladys, ride with him. I'll have
my personal physician meet you.

398
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,677
Victor, come here.

399
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:45,264
This is supposed to be
a closed set... no visitors!

400
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,934
I want that... Jenny
banned from the lot.

401
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:54,106
[Cliff]
Jenny, I said I'm sorry.

402
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:57,318
- I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.

403
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:01,071
Something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.

404
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:03,616
Me and Peevy
found something...

405
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,951
that's gonna get us
back on our feet.

406
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:09,538
- What do you mean, found something?
- It's an engine...

407
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:12,082
[Cliff]
But you strap it to your back...

408
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,877
and it makes you fly
without wings.

409
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:19,006
[Jenny] You knocked down half
the castle to tell me about an engine?

410
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,592
You're always saying
you're the last to know.

411
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:24,793
Cliff, I meant
the important things.

412
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:27,646
- This is important.
- So is this acting job.

413
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,316
- Acting?
- Yes, acting.

414
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,068
Honey, you're walking
through the scenery.

415
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:35,404
That's not fair.
This is a good job.

416
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,615
The director thinks
I'm talented.

417
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,783
What's this?

418
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,286
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.

419
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,748
- You know this is a closed set.
- I have to go.

420
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,667
Come on. You know
what a closed set means?

421
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:03,557
Hey!

422
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:30,834
- Where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.

423
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:43,430
Hello.
I'm Neville Sinclair.

424
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:47,726
- You must be...
- Jenny Blake.

425
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,898
I... I'd hate
to think...

426
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:57,111
that I may have been... I'm responsible
for your having been dismissed.

427
00:36:57,236 --> 00:37:01,532
- Will you stay?
- But it's... really my fault.

428
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:06,704
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?

429
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:08,747
No.

430
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:12,042
I think you might be
wonderful in the role.

431
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:15,754
I'll see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.

432
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,717
I've got a table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the club.

433
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:24,054
- I'd love to Mr...
- Neville.

434
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,390
- Neville.
- Tonight then.

435
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:31,437
[Director] Let's get all the
atmosphere over here.

436
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:39,737
Ladies in waiting?
We're waiting! Let's go.

437
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,574
[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

438
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:47,912
the Travelair Mystery Ship
has taken over the lead.

439
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:51,665
We have clocked him at
192 miles per hour.

440
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,085
Programmes!
Five cents!

441
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:58,214
- Here you are.
- Malcolm.

442
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:01,217
- I sold seven.
- Good. Here's more.

443
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,594
Programmes!
Programmes!

444
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:07,056
[Announcer] As you can see,
Miss Los Angeles is trailing badly.

445
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,099
She was down with some
mechanical problems...

446
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:13,270
- and she may be in trouble.
- Park it away from the runway.

447
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,898
- What's wrong with that kid?
I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.

448
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,359
If he ain't in the air
in 5 minutes, find a new hangar.

449
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:22,029
[Announcer]
Howard in the Great Lakes Biplane...

450
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:25,533
is really pouring it on...
runnin' 3rd but movin'!

451
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,952
This could end up
in a three-way heat.

452
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:32,122
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.

453
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:35,626
There's an old plane
but the only thing in it was this.

454
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:39,463
- That's it?
- We searched this place
from hell to breakfast.

455
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:42,841
I want you to start over.
Turn it inside out, upside down.

456
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,511
Keep your eyes open
for this dame.

457
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:48,973
She might be the one who knows
where this guy is who found our package.

458
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:51,308
Okay, Eddie.
Let's go.

459
00:39:01,652 --> 00:39:05,406
[Announcer] To dazzle you
with an exhibition of skills...

460
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,868
is Cliff Secord, the Fearless Freep.
And there he goes!

461
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,673
That's not
the routine!

462
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:25,384
What the hell is
Secord trying to pull?

463
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:30,639
- I'm two minutes late.
Who'd you put up in Miss Mabel?
- Five cents!

464
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:35,067
- Get your programme!
- That's gotta be Malcolm.

465
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:38,988
Flag that biplane
down now!

466
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:45,327
He hasn't been behind the stick
in 25 years. What's he doin'?

467
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:49,748
Tryin' to save your job.
If he drifts into those race
lanes he's gonna kill somebody.

468
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:54,044
[Sputtering]

469
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,921
Oh, no.

470
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,011
The rocket's in
the tool chest?

471
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,597
Yeah, why?

472
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:15,733
[Announcer]
We have an emergency.

473
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:18,694
We have an emergency!
Please clear the field.

474
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,405
- Please clear...
- You outta your mind?

475
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,369
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had you fooled for a minute.

476
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,830
But it's all part
of the show.

477
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:39,298
Stay in your seats.

478
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,885
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like? Give me a hand.

479
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,387
No, Cliff, no!
We haven't tested it enough.

480
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:49,391
- Look what she did to...
- Cut it out!
I'm scared enough as it is.

481
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:53,270
[Screaming]

482
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:57,525
I reworked the throttle, so just
squeeze her like a gas pedal.

483
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:01,695
- If you want to stop,
mash down hard and let go.
- Okay.

484
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:04,657
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

485
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,619
A little luck.

486
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,460
- How do I look?
- Like a hood ornament.

487
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:36,772
[Screaming]

488
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,279
Look at that!

489
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:47,741
- Tell me you're gettin' this.
- I don't know what it is,
but I'm gettin' it.

490
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:55,499
- Malcolm!
- Aaah!

491
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:57,960
[Engine sputtering]

492
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:04,466
[Grunting]
Malcolm?

493
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,137
Malcolm,
wake up.

494
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,974
It's me, Cliff.
Wake up! Come on!

495
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:16,812
Ohh! Whoa!

496
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,151
Don't worry, folks.
It's all part of the show.

497
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:38,083
Oh, nooo!

498
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,679
Malcolm, wake up.

499
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:52,890
Wake up!

500
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,685
Get up!
Get out of here.

501
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:09,824
It's all part of the show.

502
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:25,714
Ohhh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

503
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,592
He's going west!
He's going west!

504
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:32,137
- [Honking]
- Go, go, go! Get out of the way!

505
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:41,355
- Get off the phone!
- You heard me... a flying man!

506
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:45,699
- Hold the front page!
- I said... a rocket man!

507
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:08,264
Oh, no!

508
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,065
Whoa! Aaah!

509
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,903
Whoa!

510
00:44:30,744 --> 00:44:32,621
Watch it!

511
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,712
Big gopher.

512
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:43,466
Oh, no!

513
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,492
- Cliff!
- Huh?

514
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,748
[Gasping]

515
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:21,921
I like it!

516
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:24,131
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

517
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:26,467
Are you trying
to kill yourself?

518
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:30,179
We don't know how long this thing
stays up, how much fuel's in her...

519
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:34,350
If you wanna look around
you gotta use your eyeballs.
This thing's got a rudder.

520
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:37,812
If you turn your head,
you change course. Hear what I'm sayin'?

521
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:41,982
You banged that up good. I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to fix that.

522
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:45,152
Peevy, you can
fix anything.

523
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:49,448
Well... uh-oh! We got company.
Must be the news boys.

524
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:52,701
- You put on quite a show.
- They can't find out who we are.

525
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:54,745
Whoever owns this is
gonna want it back...

526
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,997
and I'm just gettin'
the hang of it.

527
00:45:57,123 --> 00:45:59,500
[Engine Cranking]

528
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,964
- Put it in neutral.
- What?

529
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:09,176
Put it in neutral!
You steer, I'll push.

530
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:30,072
Get in the car.

531
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:32,366
[Reporter] How 'bout
some background on the flyin' man?

532
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,410
- Yeah, give it to us.
- What's his name?

533
00:46:34,535 --> 00:46:37,580
Sorry, boys. It's a trade secret...
all part of the mystery.

534
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:40,040
- Why don't you call him Rocket Boy?
- That's lousy!

535
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,169
- What about Rocket Man?
- That's worse.

536
00:46:43,252 --> 00:46:45,504
- What about Missile Man?
- That stinks.

537
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:47,423
Come on, Bigelow,
give us a better name.

538
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:50,342
How about
Rocketeer?

539
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:53,846
- Bingo!
- That'll work. Rocketeer it is.

540
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:56,182
Extra, extra!
Man flies without plane!

541
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:58,225
Extra!
Read all about it!

542
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,312
[Girls]
- It's so romantic.
- Bet he's handsome.

543
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:03,606
I wish he'd
rescue me.

544
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:05,733
Extra, extra!

545
00:47:07,276 --> 00:47:12,448
Ready on the set.
Let's go. Let's shoot.

546
00:47:12,573 --> 00:47:16,202
[Hughes]
Congratulations, gentlemen.

547
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:18,788
Thanks to the diligence
of the FBI,

548
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:21,957
this vacuum cleaner
will not fall into the wrong hands.

549
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,261
Mr Bigelow, FBI.
We'd like a word with you.

550
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:50,611
- Must be the maid's day off.
- Somebody's been lookin' for something.

551
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:02,838
Give me some light.

552
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,301
[Gasp]

553
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,303
Mother of mercy!

554
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,597
He's been
folded in half.

555
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,351
Looks like he was
writin' something.

556
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,944
1635...

557
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,072
Palm Terrace.

558
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,623
[Peevy] If the vertical thrust
is 1-28 inches per second...

559
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,502
- [Squeaking]
- Cliff?

560
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:07,528
- [Glass breaking]
- [Peevy] What do you want?

561
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,239
- What are you doin' here?
Get out of here.
- Peevy!

562
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,828
Cliff, get me out!

563
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,998
Peevy!

564
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,678
Aaah!

565
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,766
Slats, Murphy,
come with us.

566
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,894
Murph, wait here
for the high sign.

567
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,731
Where is it?

568
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,402
Where's what?

569
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,031
The rocket!

570
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,952
Sure you got
the right house?

571
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:01,082
Secord, Peabody!
Open up! FBI.

572
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,129
Get down!

573
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,049
Let 'em have it, boys.

574
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,267
Cliff?
Cliff!

575
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,481
Cliff?

576
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,067
- Clifford!
- Peevy!

577
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,931
## ["When They
Begin The Beguine"]

578
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,123
- Hello, Neville.
- Hello, Clark.

579
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,963
# When they begin #

580
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,300
# The beguine #

581
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,802
# It brings back
the sound #

582
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,473
# Of music so tender #

583
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:46,896
# It brings back the night
of tropical splendour #

584
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,191
# It brings back
a memory #

585
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,319
# And a dream #

586
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:57,156
[W.C. Fields] Neville...
you old scalawag!

587
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,451
Hello, Bill.
How are you?

588
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,205
Fallen off any
chandeliers lately?

589
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,589
Let me introduce you.
Miss Jenny Blake,

590
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:08,883
- Mr W. C. Fields.
- Charmed, my dear,

591
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,012
doubly-charmed.

592
00:52:13,137 --> 00:52:18,601
- Jenny... what a
euphonious appellation.
- Jenny...

593
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:23,064
Excuse me for a moment.
I won't be long. Bill, look after her.

594
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:26,650
I thought you'd
never ask. Scram.

595
00:52:26,734 --> 00:52:31,155
My little kumquat,
I'm fully prepared...

596
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:33,282
to listen to
your life story.

597
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:35,785
Okay, I'll
tell him.

598
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:39,163
Spanish Johnny... he's checking
on the diner where the flyers hang out.

599
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:41,665
All right, Stevie.
Make me a Bromo, will you?

600
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,044
What do you want?

601
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:47,254
Everything okay?
We treatin' you good?

602
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,256
Get to the point.
I'm busy.

603
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:51,675
- Have you found the rocket?
- Busy, huh?

604
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:53,886
My guys are tearing up the
town looking for that rocket...

605
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:56,055
and you're busy...
romancin' some dame.

606
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,517
- That dame... happens to
be Secord's girlfriend.
- Good.

607
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,685
She'll tell us
where Secord is.

608
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,648
My boys'll get the truth
out of her in two minutes.

609
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:10,319
Valentine... we're gonna do
what I think is necessary.

610
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:13,906
And that includes breakin'
one of my men in half?

611
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:17,868
Next time you go after one of my men,
I'll kill you.

612
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:21,539
Don't threaten me.
Just do your job.

613
00:53:21,622 --> 00:53:24,875
Hey, Sinclair,
if the feds get me...

614
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:28,838
I'm takin' you with me.
I'm gonna tell 'em everything.

615
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:31,173
Who do you think
they'd believe?

616
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:35,094
A cheap crook or the number 3
box-office star in America?

617
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,763
Number 3 jerk!

618
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:47,606
[Radio Announcer] The helmeted mystery
man disappeared into the hills...

619
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:51,527
moments after the rescue
and has not identified himself.

620
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,072
But air circus owner, Otis Bigelow,
promises his bird man will return.

621
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:58,617
Los Angeles is buzzing.
Who is the Rocketeer?

622
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:02,079
Now, back to our programme
of dance band favourites.

623
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,795
Okay.
Here's the plan.

624
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,049
We call the FBI...
get rid of this thing.

625
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:15,259
The FBI's gonna
lock us up.

626
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:18,512
They think we were shooting
at them. What do you think
was going on at the house?

627
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:22,975
House? We don't got a house.
We got a gazebo.

628
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,228
Between the FBI and
that King Kong gentleman,

629
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:29,065
we're gonna get ourselves
killed over this thing.

630
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:32,234
[Knocking]
Peevy?

631
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,570
Open up.

632
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:39,533
We just come from the airfield.
It's Bigelow.

633
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:42,495
- What about him?
- His office is crawling with cops.

634
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,331
Somebody tore up his place
like they were looking for something.

635
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,958
- Yeah, so?
- They killed him.

636
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:52,296
[Millie] Cliff,
what's going on?

637
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:54,298
I'll make the call.

638
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:29,825
[Telephone] FBI, Los Angeles.
Agent Morris speaking.

639
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,410
Hello?

640
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:35,705
- I'll be home soon, honey.
- Who is this?

641
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:38,583
- I love you too.
- Okay, wise guy.

642
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:45,966
What can I do
for you gents?

643
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:50,929
Madam, we're looking for a pilot
by the name of Cliff Secord.

644
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:54,349
Does anybody here
know him?

645
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:56,810
Haven't seen him
around.

646
00:55:56,935 --> 00:56:00,313
We need a flier
for a real special job.

647
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:02,482
There's a lot of lettuce
in this.

648
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:07,279
What do you say...
we lay out a finder's fee?

649
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:09,698
How 'bout it, dad?

650
00:56:09,823 --> 00:56:11,992
Secord!
Oh, yeah, I know him.

651
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:14,327
Short fella,
gimpy leg.

652
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:16,580
Didn't he move
to Cincinnati?

653
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,708
Cincinnati.

654
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,131
How 'bout you, bub?
You know this Secord?

655
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:29,759
If you boys aren't ordering,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

656
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,345
We'll order!
Let's see.

657
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:37,350
How 'bout those pies?
They look good, huh, boys?

658
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:41,062
Mmm! Betcha
they're home-made.

659
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:47,736
Don't interrupt
his meal.

660
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:50,530
Yeah, I like coffee
with my pie.

661
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:53,825
You know, it's funny.

662
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,369
I don't like music
while I'm digesting.

663
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:04,044
Listen, friend,
we don't know where he is.

664
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,631
Okay, pop, maybe we
can refresh your memory.

665
00:57:10,008 --> 00:57:13,159
Come on.
Follow me.

666
00:57:16,078 --> 00:57:18,080
Take a good look...

667
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,458
'cause you're next.

668
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:24,879
- Talk, dad, or get a facial.
- Drop dead, you weasel.

669
00:57:24,962 --> 00:57:28,633
- I don't know where the hell he is.
- Yeah?

670
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,093
[Millie]
Leave him alone!

671
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:33,721
- Naughty boy.
- [Groaning]

672
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:37,475
Please leave him alone.
Stop!

673
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,560
[Rusty]
Startin' to smoke, old timer.

674
00:57:39,644 --> 00:57:41,354
[Spanish Johnny]
Hold it.

675
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:53,241
Jenny.
Lookie here, boys.

676
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:55,159
Lady Luck...

677
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:58,287
left her phone number.

678
00:57:58,412 --> 00:57:59,997
[Dialling]

679
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:03,000
- [Phone Ringing]
- Mine!

680
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:06,295
- Hello?
- Hello.

681
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,965
This is the florist.

682
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,592
I've got a lovely bouquet
of flowers for Jenny.

683
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,928
Who sent her flowers?

684
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:16,264
Cliff Secord.

685
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:18,891
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

686
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:20,893
Well, he's too late.

687
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:24,480
She's gone to the South Seas
Club with Mr Neville Sinclair.

688
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:28,484
Hello?

689
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:30,319
Hello?

690
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:32,321
Come here.

691
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:39,579
- You're not gonna believe this.
Guess where the dish went.
- Where?

692
00:58:39,662 --> 00:58:42,206
With the limey to
the South Seas Club.

693
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:45,334
[Rusty] Do you think fancy-pants
is pullin' a fast one on Eddie?

694
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,588
I don't know,
but I don't like this.

695
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:51,799
Jeff, you and Mikey stay and
watch who walks into this joint.

696
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,218
- Boys, been a pleasure.
- I'll call from the club.

697
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:57,138
[Jeff] All right, Johnny.
We'll take care of it.

698
00:58:57,263 --> 00:58:59,682
Everybody,

699
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:03,811
relax and take it easy.
We're gonna be here a while.

700
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:07,231
Mom, how 'bout
a fresh pot of coffee?

701
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:13,321
Swell outfit, dad.

702
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:21,329
Hey!

703
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:23,414
Here's Mr Ketchup Bottle!

704
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,881
Hey, that's quite
a dish you got there.

705
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,967
Wait a minute.
That's Lady Luck!

706
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,303
[Cliff]
Get the gun!

707
00:59:37,386 --> 00:59:39,680
[Peevy]
I got it.

708
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:47,897
I'm sorry about all this.
I'll fix everything.

709
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:51,776
[Peevy] Clifford,
what's the deal? Are you nuts?

710
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,947
Cliff, no!
Not again.

711
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:58,783
Peevy, half the city
is looking for us.

712
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:02,286
- I can fly to that nightclub
in five minutes.
- Take a cab.

713
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,957
The only place this is going is back
to the feds. We had an agreement!

714
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:09,085
Look!
Peev, I'm sorry.

715
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,171
I should've listened to you,
but Jenny's in trouble.

716
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,216
That girl means more
to me than...

717
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,718
I love her, Peev.

718
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:21,681
- Does she know that?
- She's gonna find out.

719
01:00:21,764 --> 01:00:24,767
Promise me when she's safe
this thing goes back!

720
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:28,354
You got my word.
I'm sorry I laid eyes on this.

721
01:00:29,689 --> 01:00:31,899
You might want this.

722
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:34,735
I'll meet you
back here.

723
01:00:34,819 --> 01:00:37,905
Hold it, you're leaking
like a sieve.

724
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:41,659
If you'd hit that button,
we'd be all over the map.

725
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:43,744
- Can you fix it?
- If I had a couple of hours.

726
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:48,291
We don't have a couple of minutes!
We need something quick.

727
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,628
Let's see if our luck's
still holdin'.

728
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:54,422
Go on!

729
01:00:54,505 --> 01:00:58,050
- Peevy, stand clear.
- What was that?

730
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:10,563
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

731
01:01:12,023 --> 01:01:13,941
It's so elegant.

732
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:17,862
You make it so.
Here's to you...

733
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:23,474
and to the extraordinary way
your face catches the light.

734
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:34,443
You must let me have
this dance.

735
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:37,112
There's no music.

736
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:39,573
Really?

737
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:45,871
I hear music.

738
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:58,133
That's Neville Sinclair.

739
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,825
One day, Jenny,

740
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,245
a man will look into
those eyes and he'll drown...

741
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,456
and never be saved.

742
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,961
## [Big Band]

743
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:34,521
## [Big Band]

744
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:18,107
# When you're alone #

745
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:21,777
# Who cares
for starlit skies #

746
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:26,198
# When you're alone
the magic moonlight dies #

747
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,951
Hey.

748
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:35,290
- Is it something I said?
- No, it's nothing.

749
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:38,585
Oh, Jenny, I know
that look all too well.

750
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:42,422
- Is it your boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, Neville.

751
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:45,926
It's just that Cliff and I
talked about coming here.

752
01:04:46,009 --> 01:04:49,263
Tell me about him.

753
01:04:49,346 --> 01:04:52,891
At least give me a chance
to know the competition.

754
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:54,893
Well...

755
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:57,813
he's a little rough
around the edges.

756
01:04:57,938 --> 01:05:00,107
He can be thoughtless
sometimes.

757
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:04,236
And then he can be the
sweetest guy in the world.

758
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:08,115
He gave me these little
oranges when we first met.

759
01:05:08,198 --> 01:05:11,160
- How nice.
- My family has a small farm.

760
01:05:11,285 --> 01:05:15,539
- Cliff was coming through,
dusting the groves.
- He's a flier?

761
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:18,375
Yeah. He flies
racing planes like this one.

762
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,878
At least he did
until yesterday.

763
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:23,464
- He was almost killed.
- What happened?

764
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:28,385
We didn't order anything.
Go on.

765
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:32,287
[Cliff] Yes, sir.
A fan of yours sent some soup over.

766
01:05:32,412 --> 01:05:35,331
You were saying?

767
01:05:35,457 --> 01:05:37,500
It was very silly.

768
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,919
He completely
missed the runway.

769
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:43,089
I don't know why the
real pilots let him fly.

770
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,634
I see. At least I'm feeling
better about the competition.

771
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,307
Have you
worked here long?

772
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:56,811
Oh, yes.
I waited on you last time.

773
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:59,606
So... um...

774
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:06,070
where is he now?

775
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:09,824
He's probably hatching
some harebrained scheme.

776
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:12,786
Now he has an engine.
You strap it on...

777
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,788
I'm sorry.

778
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,706
- You idiot!
- How clumsy of me.

779
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:20,376
Go and get something
to clean this up.

780
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:25,048
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- Will you just excuse me for a minute?

781
01:06:25,173 --> 01:06:28,551
- Please stay. Sit down.
- I'll be right back.

782
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,395
[Gasp]

783
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,065
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

784
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,818
- Listen to me.
- You're jealous.

785
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:48,446
I'm not jealous!
Jenny, Bigelow's been murdered.

786
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,406
Murdered?

787
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,575
Remember the rocket
we found?

788
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,703
The people that are looking for it
murdered Bigelow to get to me.

789
01:06:55,787 --> 01:07:00,208
Now they're after you. They have
your picture, the one from the Gee Bee.

790
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:04,796
Jenny, prepare yourself
for a shock.

791
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,382
I'm the Rocketeer.

792
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:11,511
- The rocka-who?
- For cryin' out loud!
Haven't you read the papers?

793
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:15,223
- No, I've been working.
- It's them!

794
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:17,392
The guys
with the snapshot.

795
01:07:17,475 --> 01:07:19,686
You gotta get out
of here.

796
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,397
Get in a cab,
go to your mom's in Redlands...

797
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:25,024
and stay there
until you hear from me.

798
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:29,195
Give me one good reason
why I should believe this?

799
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:34,909
If anything ever happened
to you, I'd go out of my mind.

800
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,580
Oh.

801
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:07,609
Go on, get out of here.
And don't let them see you.

802
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:32,175
Thank you.

803
01:08:42,227 --> 01:08:45,146
Taxi!

804
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:58,701
That's him.
Now go get him!

805
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:00,870
Cutting in.

806
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:06,668
Thank you!

807
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:32,360
[Rusty]
He's in the laundry room.

808
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,198
[Growling]

809
01:09:37,282 --> 01:09:40,349
Hit it!

810
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:47,690
The laundry chute!
Get him! Get him!

811
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,711
- It's the flying man.
- It's the Rocketeer.

812
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:25,394
[Screaming]

813
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:37,114
- Lock the doors.
We'll trap him like a fly.
- Right.

814
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:15,611
He's heading
for the door.

815
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:28,040
[Growling]

816
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:42,805
Get the rocket!

817
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:09,707
[Gasp]

818
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:13,627
Don't go, Jenny.
Our evening's just begun.

819
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,936
Welcome
to my home.

820
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,316
Here.

821
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,079
It's the chloroform.

822
01:14:31,163 --> 01:14:34,833
The effects will pass
in a moment.

823
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,881
Do you have to drug all
your women to seduce them?

824
01:14:41,006 --> 01:14:45,052
You're part of this.
You kidnapped me.

825
01:14:45,177 --> 01:14:50,474
Against my will, believe me.
I'm as much a victim as you.

826
01:14:50,557 --> 01:14:55,604
They're blackmailing me.
These are ruthless men.

827
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:57,773
Neville, I'm scared.

828
01:14:57,856 --> 01:15:01,985
Oh, there, there.
Don't be frightened.

829
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,656
Tonight
when we danced,

830
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,702
I felt something
move inside me.

831
01:15:10,827 --> 01:15:13,705
I felt it tear loose
and take flight.

832
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,875
You said that
to Greta Garbo...

833
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,336
in "Napoleon's Mistress."

834
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:23,882
You'd have been a fantastic
Lady Catharine.

835
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:29,096
If you'd put yourself...
completely into my hands,

836
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:34,017
I could teach you, mould you
into a leading lady;

clay... in the hands
of the master sculptor.

838
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:41,691
"Moonlight on Broadway."
Carole Lombard.

839
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,820
The scene on the top
of the Empire State Building.

840
01:15:44,903 --> 01:15:47,489
Yes.

841
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:51,410
You can't be comfortable
in that gown.

842
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,809
They're beautiful.

843
01:16:30,615 --> 01:16:33,410
What am I doing?

844
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:36,163
You kidnapped me.

845
01:16:36,288 --> 01:16:38,582
I'm so confused.

846
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,251
I don't know
what to think.

847
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:46,089
Do you want me
to try this on?

848
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:48,925
Desperately.

849
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,104
Neville?

850
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:03,815
Could you come in here,
please?

851
01:17:07,778 --> 01:17:10,655
Can you help me?

852
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:29,758
I finally played a scene
with Neville Sinclair.

853
01:18:55,742 --> 01:18:58,828
Hello? Hello!
Can anyone hear me?

854
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:01,748
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me?

855
01:19:01,873 --> 01:19:05,376
[Radio] Sinclair?
Sind sie das?

856
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:09,672
Warum rufen sie an?

857
01:19:09,756 --> 01:19:12,967
My God!

858
01:19:13,092 --> 01:19:16,471
Neville Sinclair is a...
[Gasp]

859
01:19:20,141 --> 01:19:22,185
A what?

860
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:24,562
Spy?

861
01:19:24,645 --> 01:19:27,440
Saboteur?

862
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:30,443
A fascist?

863
01:19:30,568 --> 01:19:33,112
All of the above.

864
01:19:33,237 --> 01:19:36,240
Lothar.

865
01:19:37,116 --> 01:19:39,452

866
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:43,623

01:20:04,143 --> 01:20:06,062
[Whispering]
Millie?

868
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,948
Peevy!

869
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,285
Hey, Peev?

870
01:20:21,411 --> 01:20:23,204
[Patsy]
Hey, Cliff!

871
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,248
Aaah!

872
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:27,959
Are you okay?

873
01:20:28,084 --> 01:20:33,297
- Patsy, you scared the livin'...
heck outta me.
- Sorry.

874
01:20:33,423 --> 01:20:35,425
[Telephone Ringing]

875
01:20:39,262 --> 01:20:42,056
- Peev?
- Wrong. This Secord?

876
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:46,269
- Wanna talk to your girlfriend?
- She's safe out of town.

877
01:20:46,394 --> 01:20:48,563
- Cliff?
- Jenny, where are you?

878
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:51,566
That's enough. Just to let
you know we're serious.

879
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:54,110
You wanna see your girlfriend,
bring us the rocket.

880
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:57,655
Write this down. Griffith Observatory,
4 a.m., by the statues.

881
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,075
Come alone or we're gonna
have to kill the girl.

882
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,252
[Patsy]
What's happening?

883
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:13,421
- What are they doing to Jenny?
- Quiet!

884
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:16,257
I gotta think.

885
01:21:19,302 --> 01:21:21,471
Patsy, I'm sorry.

886
01:21:21,596 --> 01:21:24,015
I didn't mean
to yell at ya.

887
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:27,602
Remember the guy
who saved Malcolm today?

888
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:32,023
- The Rocketeer?
- He's gonna help me find Jenny.

889
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:34,734
Freeze!
FBI.

890
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:40,698
[Chuckle]

891
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:43,201
Remember me?

892
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:50,666
[Peevy]
All I did was bypass the pressure valve
and that solved your throttle problem.

893
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:54,837
But adding a rudder to the helmet...
that was ingenious.

894
01:21:54,962 --> 01:21:58,383
Nothin' to it, Howard.
Just basic aviation.

895
01:21:58,508 --> 01:22:01,010
[Wooly] We're gonna make
your life miserable.

896
01:22:01,135 --> 01:22:03,221
Good to see you, son.

897
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:06,474
- You too, pal.
- This is all he had on him.

898
01:22:06,557 --> 01:22:09,310
There's no sign
of the rocket.

899
01:22:09,394 --> 01:22:12,461
He must've ditched it,
but he ain't talkin'.

900
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:19,843
Wooly, take off
the handcuffs.

901
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:27,685
- You know who I am?
- What pilot doesn't, Mr Hughes?

902
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,979
I designed the Cirrus X-3,
the rocket pack.

903
01:22:31,063 --> 01:22:33,524
It was stolen
from my factory.

904
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:36,527
I didn't take it.

905
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:40,656
I told him everything and he
believed it. Give the man his rocket.

906
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:44,660
- I can't. Not yet.
- We agreed to give it back...

907
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:47,413
to its rightful owner.
That's him.

908
01:22:47,538 --> 01:22:50,207
[Hughes] I don't think
you know the game you're playing.

909
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:52,543
Go ahead, roll it.

910
01:22:57,423 --> 01:23:01,719
The German prototype had
the same problem as our first design.

911
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:05,472
The combustion chamber
would overheat and explode.

912
01:23:05,597 --> 01:23:07,516
My boys figured it out:

913
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:11,061
A double-walled chamber
into which the fuel is pumped,

914
01:23:11,145 --> 01:23:13,439
cool the chamber and preheat
the fuel at the same time.

915
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:16,066
The German experiment
didn't seem...

916
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,569
like much
to worry about.

917
01:23:18,652 --> 01:23:21,447
But when we got our hands
on this next film,

918
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:23,657
we realized the scope
of their plan.

919
01:23:23,782 --> 01:23:27,619
Keep watching, kid.
It cost a man's life...

920
01:23:27,745 --> 01:23:30,289
to get this
out of Germany.

921
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:28,472
Where's my rocket pack,
Secord?

922
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:31,767
You gotta let me use it
one more time.

923
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,811
I'm tired of
square dancing with you.

924
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:38,107
I could slap you with grand theft,
espionage, and that's my short list.

925
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:41,735
- Wooly, give me the cuffs.
- They got my girl.

926
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,240
- Oh, God, Cliff, no!
- They set up a rendezvous to
swap Jenny for the rocket.

927
01:24:46,365 --> 01:24:49,284
I understand how you feel,
but let us handle this.

928
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:51,578
I gotta go alone or
they're gonna kill her.

929
01:24:51,704 --> 01:24:55,916
I'll give you your rocket
back tomorrow. I swear.

930
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:58,002
Those guys are
playing for keeps.

931
01:24:58,127 --> 01:25:00,337
- I can handle Valentine.
- The Valentine gang is hired muscle.

932
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,549
They're working
for a Nazi agent,

933
01:25:03,674 --> 01:25:06,677
someone we think is highly
placed in Hollywood society,

934
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,015
someone our intrepid G-men
have been unable to identify.

935
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:14,810
- Neville Sinclair.
It's Neville Sinclair!
- What?

936
01:25:14,893 --> 01:25:17,521
- Come on!
- It makes perfect sense.

937
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:21,608
That's why he was bossing Eddie's men
and why he has Jenny.

938
01:25:21,734 --> 01:25:25,821
Nice try. We're taking him
downtown and locking him up.

939
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:29,700
We'll take it from here.
Let's go, kid.

940
01:25:33,787 --> 01:25:36,123
No guns!

941
01:25:51,555 --> 01:25:54,641
The son-of-a-bitch
will fly.

942
01:26:26,488 --> 01:26:30,325
- Here. Put this on.
- I'd rather freeze.

943
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:34,579
You're right.
I prefer you like that.

944
01:26:41,836 --> 01:26:44,756
Cheer up, Eddie. You're about to
make yourself a fortune.

945
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:48,843
That's good 'cause I got a club
to repair and an ulcer to plug.

946
01:26:48,968 --> 01:26:52,681
Hey, boss!
Here he comes.

947
01:27:39,394 --> 01:27:41,730
Jenny, you okay?

948
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:44,190
She's fine!

949
01:27:44,316 --> 01:27:47,319
I wasn't talkin' to you.

950
01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:52,324
Take the rocket off...
carefully.

951
01:27:58,371 --> 01:28:00,749
First you let her go.

952
01:28:09,507 --> 01:28:11,384
[Gasp]

953
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:15,555
The rocket, Secord!

954
01:28:19,559 --> 01:28:23,271
Come on, kid, hand it over
so we can all go home.

955
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:26,566
What's it like working for
a Nazi, Eddie?

956
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:31,404
He pay you in dollars
or Deutsche Marks?

957
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:34,783
- What's he talking about?
- I got it straight from the feds.

958
01:28:34,908 --> 01:28:37,285
Nazi spy ring, flying commandos,
the works.

959
01:28:39,329 --> 01:28:43,041
Kid's been flying
where the air is too thin.

960
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:47,045
Ask him about the secret room
and the Germans on the radio.

961
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:50,548
- Relax, Frankenstein.
You ain't bullet proof.
- [Eddie] Talk fast, Sinclair.

962
01:28:50,674 --> 01:28:53,134
- You tell him, Eddie.
- Shut up!

963
01:28:54,969 --> 01:28:57,555
Come on, Eddie,
I'm paying you well.

964
01:28:57,639 --> 01:29:00,058
Does it matter
who I work for?

965
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:03,895
It matters to me.

966
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:07,482
I may not make an honest buck,
but I'm 100% American.

967
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:10,235
And I don't work
for no two-bit Nazi.

968
01:29:10,318 --> 01:29:13,488
Let her go.

969
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:21,496
Sturmabteilung!

970
01:29:21,621 --> 01:29:23,999
Angreifen!

971
01:29:24,124 --> 01:29:26,710
Los, los!
Achtung!

972
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,431
It's your move, Eddie.

- Ergreif die rakete. Schnell!
- Jawohl!

01:30:18,178 --> 01:30:21,348
Haltet sie in schach.

976
01:30:21,473 --> 01:30:24,476
Goodbye, Eddie.

977
01:30:27,645 --> 01:30:29,481
Happy Valentine's Day.

978
01:30:35,092 --> 01:30:37,970
This is the FBI!
Throw down your guns.

979
01:30:38,095 --> 01:30:39,555
- Shoot him!
- No!

980
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:50,149
Lousy krauts!
Let 'em have it!

981
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:00,910
Careful.
He's got the girl!

982
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:05,122
Watch out for that Zeppelin.
It's full of hydrogen.

983
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:07,625
One bad shot,
we'll all fry.

984
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,845
Come on, boys.
We got 'em on the run.

985
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:28,104
Aaah!

986
01:31:42,076 --> 01:31:45,329
- Mein herr...
- Get this ship out of range.

987
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:47,873
- Schnell!
- Klar.

988
01:31:47,957 --> 01:31:50,084
Sie haben die rakete nicht?
Antworten sie mir!

989
01:31:50,209 --> 01:31:52,044
Where's the rocket?

990
01:31:52,128 --> 01:31:54,297
We've got the girl.

991
01:31:54,422 --> 01:31:57,216
The rocket
will come to us.

992
01:32:36,631 --> 01:32:39,759
We're losing 'em.

993
01:32:42,595 --> 01:32:44,889
Maybe not.
Look!

994
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:48,351
Up on the dome.
It's him!

995
01:32:48,476 --> 01:32:51,270
It's the Rocketeer.

996
01:32:56,484 --> 01:32:58,778
Go get 'em, kid.

997
01:33:39,026 --> 01:33:41,988
- Stimmt was nicht?
- Das ruder.

998
01:33:42,071 --> 01:33:45,825
- Irgendwas ist los mit dem ruder hier.
- Lieber gott!

999
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:48,494
Also was?
Wo ist er?

1000
01:33:48,577 --> 01:33:50,496
Spinnst du, Sinclair?
Was ist mit dem fraeulein da?

1001
01:33:50,579 --> 01:33:53,040
Halt die fresse!

1002
01:33:53,165 --> 01:33:56,836
Du ignorierst mich.
Ich habe meine stelle.

1003

Do not worry,

1004
01:34:49,328 --> 01:34:51,705
My pilot is the
finest in Germany.

1005

We are in capable hands.
He will not let us down.

Nooo!

01:35:13,727 --> 01:35:16,063
Das ist deine schuld!

1009
01:35:16,146 --> 01:35:19,816
We are losing altitude.
We must drop some weight.

1010
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:23,362
You, you...
actor!

1011
01:35:28,325 --> 01:35:31,244
For the fatherland.

1012
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,913
Ja.

1013
01:35:32,996 --> 01:35:35,290
Komm!

1014
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,252
Beeil dich!
Da oben ist der mann.

1015
01:35:39,336 --> 01:35:41,838
- Los!
- Ja.

1016
01:35:45,467 --> 01:35:47,886
Herr Sinclair...
[Grunting]

1017
01:35:55,978 --> 01:35:59,398
I've had a bellyful of you
and your cheap heroics.

1018
01:35:59,481 --> 01:36:04,111
Hand over the rocket or I'll
blow her brains... all over the cabin.

1019
01:36:04,236 --> 01:36:07,030
[Jenny] Don't give it to him.
Cliff, you can't!

1020
01:36:07,155 --> 01:36:09,408
I have to.

1021
01:36:10,993 --> 01:36:12,995
Herr kapitaen!

1022
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:21,044
Slide it.

1023
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:36,310
If she moves,
kill her.

1024
01:36:47,529 --> 01:36:50,324
Oww!
Aaah!

1025
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:54,828
Where's your stuntman?

1026
01:36:58,582 --> 01:37:00,584
I do my own stunts.

1027
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,339
[Jenny]
Stop!

1028
01:37:49,591 --> 01:37:52,719
No! No!

1029
01:38:04,523 --> 01:38:08,568
For God's sakes, Sinclair.
Help us get these flames out.

1030
01:38:08,694 --> 01:38:13,740
Goodbye, Jenny.
I wish I could take you with me.

1031
01:38:13,865 --> 01:38:16,785
Everything about you
is a lie.

1032
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:21,581
It wasn't lies, Jenny.
It was acting.

1033
01:38:30,966 --> 01:38:34,303
I'll miss Hollywood.

1034
01:38:34,428 --> 01:38:37,973
I don't think so.

1035
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:40,183
[Wicked Laugh]

1036
01:38:47,065 --> 01:38:49,276
Aaah!

1037
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:07,650
Jenny, this thing's full of hydrogen.
When the fire hits...

1038
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,403
I love you, Cliff.

1039
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,559
Run, Jenny!

1040
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:48,483
Steady as she goes, Howard.
We're only gonna get one pass.

1041
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,836
- Drop the ladder.
- Right.

1042
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:14,717
Jump for it, Clifford!

1043
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,724
Let's get outta here!

1044
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:49,043
- Hi, Millie.
- Morning, how you doing?

1045
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,546
Morning, boys.

1046
01:40:53,715 --> 01:40:56,301
"Film fans were saddened
by the news...

1047
01:40:56,426 --> 01:41:00,138
"that actor Neville Sinclair
was killed in the tragedy...

1048
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:03,099
when flaming debris fell on
his touring car."

1049
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,476
That's terrible.
That was a nice car.

1050
01:41:05,602 --> 01:41:10,315
You look awful blue for a guy
who pretty much saved the world.

1051
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,859
I got the cracked ribs
to prove it.

1052
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,904
You got me.

1053
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:26,456
[Engine]

1054
01:41:45,892 --> 01:41:48,436
[Cliff]
She's a beauty, Mr Hughes.

1055
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,438
Isn't she?

1056
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:53,775
In another month, she'll
be ready for the nationals.

1057
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:59,280
- Miss Blake, will you excuse us
for just a moment?
- Of course.

1058
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:09,999
I've been meaning to ask you,
what was it like strapping...

1059
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:13,461
that thing to your back and
flying like a bat out of hell?

1060
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:20,969
It was the closest I'll ever
get to heaven, Mr Hughes.

1061
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:24,138
Well...
maybe not.

1062
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:34,691
See you around,
Rocketeer.

1063
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:39,904
Oh... don't ever
fly her without this.

1064
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:09,748
Isn't it pretty?

1065
01:43:09,873 --> 01:43:11,959
I didn't even get
a chance to thank him.

1066
01:43:12,042 --> 01:43:16,380
You don't have to, son.
He saw the look on your face.

1067
01:43:16,505 --> 01:43:18,424
Cliff,

1068
01:43:18,549 --> 01:43:20,759
I have something
for you too.

1069
01:43:20,884 --> 01:43:24,722
Actually...
it's for Peevy.

1070
01:43:27,057 --> 01:43:29,602
Oh, no!

1071
01:43:29,727 --> 01:43:33,480
What was that line again?
"Oh, my prince..."

1072
01:43:33,564 --> 01:43:36,525
- "would that you'd drink of my lips..."
- Thanks.

1073
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:39,361
I don't mind
if I do.

1074
01:43:42,031 --> 01:43:44,867
Clifford, take a look
at this here.

1075
01:43:44,992 --> 01:43:47,703
I bet if we increase
the manifold pressure...

1076
01:43:47,786 --> 01:43:50,372
and switch the
fuel-to-air ratio...

1077
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:53,167
just favouring the fuel...

1078
01:43:54,835 --> 01:43:57,880
Hey, Goose!
You wanna take a look?

1079
01:44:04,929 --> 01:44:07,890
Rocketeer
to the rescue!
