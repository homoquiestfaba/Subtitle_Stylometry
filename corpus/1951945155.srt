1
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,320
I shouldn't be doing this,

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,800
but it's dangerous out here.

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,920
You said it, mister.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't know what worries me more...
running out of water

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,360
or running into the Drifter.

6
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,240
The, uh, Drifter?

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,920
You never heard
of the Death Valley Drifter?

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
No.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Killed dozens
out here in the desert.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,520
Kinda funny, huh?

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Death Valley.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,920
You get it?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Death Valley.

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,600
Uh, at the, uh,
filling station up ahead,

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,960
I'll let them know
you need a ride.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a sad state of affairs

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,720
when a man can't trust
a fellow man.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
Damn it.

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,480
Okay, I can do that.

20
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
I sell supplies
to machine shops.

21
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
I used to be a welder myself,

22
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,840
but it's much more
exciting on the road.

23
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,520
If I had stayed in the shop,

24
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,760
I would have never earned
such a colorful nickname.

25
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,240
I know.

26
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm getting to it.

27
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,000
They always say
practice makes perfect.

28
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Freeze!

29
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
On your knees!

30
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
You have the right
to remain silent. Anything...

31
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,120
anything you say can...

32
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Help.

33
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
I need backup.

34
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
What's your 20?

35
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,000
At the old Shrader Ranch Road.

36
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
- John's at the school.
- Now!

37
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,160
I've caught
the Death Valley Drifter.

38
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
You have the right to remain...

39
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,400
Deputy!

40
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,240
They tell me
my work here is done.

41
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm yours.

42
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,920
His parents were victims
of unsolved murders.

43
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,320
He served in Vietnam.

44
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
He had the highest
enemy body count in his division.

45
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
His not-so-positive record
refers to him

46
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,320
as an unpredictable
killing machine.

47
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Do you enjoy killing people?

48
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Do you enjoy analyzing people?

49
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
- It's a job.
- Exactly.

50
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,320
It's a job.

51
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,040
But it's not a job
if you don't have a boss.

52
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,360
What about the voices?

53
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,880
Voices?

54
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,440
What do these voices say?

55
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,440
Killing in this world is practice

56
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,120
for my afterworld calling,

57
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,760
that I serve
at the universe's discretion

58
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,640
until my earthly body
is completely decayed

59
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
and I can kill no more.

60
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,760
How would you feel

61
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
if I told you that
these voices aren't real?

62
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
You think you know
what's real?

63
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
Nobody knows shit.

64
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,360
The only given in this world...

65
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
everyone has to die.

66
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,640
Can't say how proud we are
that you're the new sheriff.

67
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,960
We owe this to you...
a true hero.

68
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,720
Do you really think
he heard voices?

69
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,840
Or do you think he was
just angling for an insanity plea?

70
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,560
It sounded like
bullshit to me.

71
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,360
So are you really buying
a home in North Dakota?

72
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,520
Well, I always said
I wanted to retire where it's cold.

73
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
It would be nice
to freeze my ass off for once.

74
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,280
We're gonna miss you, Sheriff.

75
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,400
Thanks, darling.

76
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Mmm.

77
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,600
You are exactly
as Mom described you.

78
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,320
Your mother doesn't know me.

79
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,160
She didn't know me
when we were married,

80
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,960
and she sure as hell
doesn't know me 40 years later.

81
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
- Top you off?
- Whoa whoa whoa.

82
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,280
Can you give me
another cup, please?

83
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
I get a balance going
with the creamers and the sugars,

84
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,520
- and they always... they mix it up.
- Yeah.

85
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Whenever there's a new girl,

86
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,760
I park my spoon
right on top of my cup,

87
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,160
but you'll learn soon enough,

88
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,160
won't you, dear?

89
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Whatever you say, Sheriff.

90
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Is she new?

91
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
Yeah, she's from LA.

92
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
You two have
something in common.

93
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,880
Wow, we're both from
the second-largest city in the United States.

94
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
- Amazing.
- Out here, you take what you can get.

95
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,640
- Asshole.
- Hey, that asshole is the new sheriff.

96
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,920
What is that smell?

97
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm cleaning the grease trap.

98
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,440
Did someone take
a shit in the grease trap?

99
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
You've got
a mouth on you.

100
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,200
I say it how I see it.

101
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,800
Excuse me,
the toilet's clogged.

102
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,360
It was already clogged
when I went in there.

103
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,520
- Of course it was.
- It's gonna be one of those days.

104
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,040
Going? It already is.

105
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,880
Shouldn't we be doing something?

106
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,280
- Look, son...
- Harris.

107
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
- Harris, it's a different pace out here.

108
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,840
You'll get used to it.

109
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,680
It's just... first day on the job,

110
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
and catching up with
a father I hardly know,

111
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,080
- it's all a little...
- Overwhelming?

112
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,200
Yeah.

113
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,880
You take the lid off the tank

114
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,760
and check the float.

115
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Make sure it doesn't stick.

116
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
You want me to fix it?

117
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,320
And be sure
to wash your hands.

118
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,680
You might need this.

119
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm afraid to ask what
you were doing with it in the kitchen.

120
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,960
Well, then don't.

121
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,680
There was a bloody shirt.

122
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,960
- That's all?
- "That's all?"

123
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Well, we are the only
public bathroom in 100 miles.

124
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,480
You'd be surprised
what you find.

125
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
Well, surprise me.

126
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

127
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
- Do you have a strong stomach?
- Yeah.

128
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,320
- A shoe...
- So?

129
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,040
...with a foot in it.
- No.

130
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,840
Oh!

131
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Come on.

132
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,320
Come on.

133
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,920
You all right?

134
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Fuck!

135
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,800
- Did the bleeding stop?
- No, my t-shirt was soaked.

136
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,520
- We've gotta get him some help, man.
- I'll be okay.

137
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
- Okay okay.
- No, really.

138
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Come on, man.
We gotta get him to a hospital. Let's go.

139
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,600
Stick to the plan.

140
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,120
- Did you put 40 in the pump?
- Yeah.

141
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Fuck.

142
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,480
I cleared out the corner office.

143
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
What do you say
we get you moved in?

144
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh, before I forget,

145
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,640
I got a call about
a missing man... Indian.

146
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,920
Family said
he wandered away from home

147
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,520
a couple of nights ago.
He had been drinking. Keep an eye out.

148
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,680
- One second.
- Armed men stormed the casino,

149
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,640
ordering patrons to their knees.

150
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,320
While the customers were held
at gunpoint, one of the men barricaded...

151
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,160
Well, that's not surprising.

152
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,000
The only thing standing
between all that money

153
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,480
and anybody that
wants to take it

154
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,680
are a couple rent-a-cops
clocking minimum wage.

155
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,640
...suspects in this
brazen daytime robbery.

156
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,520
The suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.

157
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
They were last seen in a blue
four-door sedan. Any information...

158
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,120
Maya.

159
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,200
What are you doing here?

160
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Maya, I need your help.

161
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,680
- You always need something.
- This is serious, all right?

162
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
And cheating on me
with my sister wasn't?

163
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,960
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

164
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,600
I do appreciate whatever pull you had
in helping me get this job.

165
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,880
Well, everyone deserves
a second chance.

166
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,920
What is it?

167
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,000
- I don't wanna see you.
- Look, Maya, listen to me.

168
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
I have a friend in the car
who needs to get to a hospital.

169
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,760
I'm gonna leave him here.
When I do, you call 9-1-1.

170
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
- All right?
- What's going on?

171
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Oh, shit.

172
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,120
Get back... back.

173
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,720
Nick, I need a physical description

174
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,200
- of the casino robbery suspects.
- Copy that.

175
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Three males... two Latinos,

176
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,120
one has a shaved head.

177
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,360
All right, we have a visual.

178
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
I need you here
at 6 Corners for backup.

179
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,960
- How many of them?
- Just get your ass over here.

180
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
We're gonna let them go.

181
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,480
We'll pull them over
on the highway

182
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,240
- away from the civilians.
- We don't want to let them out of our sight.

183
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,080
- Let's move right now.
- Hey, get back here.

184
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
I am still the sheriff here.

185
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
It's my last day. It's my call.

186
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
- Where the fuck are you?
- There's a problem... 2:00.

187
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,280
No, don't...
don't look right now.

188
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,240
Freeze!

189
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
Where's the keys? Shit.

190
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
All right, against the car.
Hands on your head.

191
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,320
Whatever I'm about
to say, I'm lying.

192
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't move.

193
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
Let him go.

194
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
She's dead if you don't.
I swear to God.

195
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Let him go.
Please, just let him go now.

196
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,080
He's lying. Shoot him.

197
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,920
Look, our friend is dying.
We don't want to hurt anyone, I swear.

198
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
We just need
to get him some help.

199
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm a doctor.
I can help your friend.

200
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,040
We just wanna get out of here.
Nice and easy.

201
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
You can take me instead.

202
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
Keys.

203
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Help me.
Where are you guys?

204
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,040
- Fire!
- Run, go!

205
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
- In here!
- I've got you, buddy.

206
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,200
- Harris, leave him!
- Help!

207
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,840
Nick, where are you?

208
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,320
I need you here now.
Officer down.

209
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,240
Send medical and fire.

210
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,040
Let's go! Come on!

211
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,280
- What was that?
- Earthquake. Come on!

212
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,240
Hurry up! Let's go!

213
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,840
- I couldn't save him.
- You were out.

214
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,200
You tried.

215
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,080
We left Carlos
in the car to die, man.

216
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,040
- He was gonna die anyway.
- You said the guards were unarmed.

217
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Look, don't go blaming me!
I didn't do this alone!

218
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,520
Because you said
no one would get hurt!

219
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,120
If we didn't have to stop
and see your girlfriend,

220
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,680
- we wouldn't be in this shit!
- What did you do?

221
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,640
- We've gotta disappear.
- Our car.

222
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
I'll find another one!

223
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,720
What did you do this time?

224
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,480
I just hope the epicenter's near us,

225
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,160
because if there are
any casualties in the city,

226
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
it'll be a long time
before we get any help.

227
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
- Where are the fugitives?
- They ran behind the diner.

228
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,160
- With the waitress?
- Yeah.

229
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,680
We have a hostage situation.

230
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,400
Hello? Is anybody there?

231
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,240
Do you read?

232
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,240
I think we should make sure
everyone else is okay.

233
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,440
I'm gonna go find a landline.

234
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,480
No no no, just sit tight. Sit tight.

235
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,520
We don't want
to get ourselves killed here.

236
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,240
Backup will be here
at any moment.

237
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,840
- I should just walk away.
- Fine, leave!

238
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,760
It's what you do when things
get tough, you leave. Go!

239
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,920
- Adios.
- See you around.

240
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't think so.

241
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
We've got a cop car
or a grey four-door.

242
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
The grey four-door is hers.

243
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
Well, what are
we waiting for? Keys.

244
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,040
Tell him where
the keys are, Maya.

245
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,640
My purse, in my locker, inside.

246
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,160
You go with her.
I'll make sure we're not followed.

247
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,640
They should have
been here by now.

248
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,600
Look, there's a hostage
in there, okay?

249
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
And there's other injured parties
in there possibly.

250
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,640
It doesn't help
anybody if we hide.

251
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah, well, it doesn't help anyone
if we don't have a plan.

252
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,560
Look, let's all move together
to the back door

253
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,280
and we'll make
a call on the landline.

254
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,160
Nobody.

255
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,600
Phone's static.

256
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,280
Should we go check the motel?

257
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah, let's go.

258
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Where did all the people go?
Where's Ravi?

259
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Out of here,
where we're going.

260
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,280
Hey, you smell that?

261
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,080
What?

262
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,880
It's rotting flesh.
You don't smell it?

263
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,880
I have anosmia...
no sense of smell.

264
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,360
- There's such a thing?
- Blind people, deaf people...

265
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,360
- they get all the attention.
- Well, I guess if I had a sense to lose...

266
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,640
People and animals
with no sense of smell are twice as likely

267
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
to die prematurely.

268
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,640
Bad smells are nature's warning.

269
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,920
Nature's sure as hell warning us.

270
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,560
Are you okay?

271
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,800
Base, there's been
an explosion. Code 13.

272
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,840
It doesn't look good.

273
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,520
I don't see any survivors.

274
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,000
You don't see us
because we're back here.

275
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Hello?

276
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,760
Nick?

277
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,120
Hello?

278
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Nick?

279
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,400
Base?

280
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,760
Anybody.

281
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,920
We're still here.

282
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,960
We're okay.

283
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,720
There should be a body in here.

284
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,160
There's...

285
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
there's no way
he walked out in one piece.

286
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,640
The physics
of an explosion like this,

287
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,560
it's beyond
our comprehension.

288
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
- Maybe it...
- Made him disappear?

289
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
go try the base radio in the car.

290
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,280
- What now?
- We get the fuck out of here.

291
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,760
You're not gonna get away with this.
There's no sunset.

292
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,480
Give me the fucking keys!

293
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,120
If I don't?

294
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,280
You will.

295
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,280
Maya.

296
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,240
What are you gonna do, kill me?

297
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
No.

298
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,520
No, I'm not gonna kill you,
but Binky will.

299
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,520
You wouldn't let that happen.

300
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,480
Well, I guess we're gonna find out,
aren't we? Huh?

301
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,640
Someone wrote out their will
in the guest comment book.

302
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
People who stay here
are obsessed with death.

303
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,440
The few who actually
know how to write.

304
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,280
Doctor Al.

305
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,840
Allison.

306
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm Harris.

307
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,040
Hal's son.
Your wife left you

308
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,760
for your captain.

309
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,040
You roughed him up,
got kicked off the force.

310
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,200
- Word spreads quick around here.
- Don't worry.

311
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
Most people who live here are
running from one thing or another.

312
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,880
And you?

313
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,800
I own a horse ranch
between here

314
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,520
and the Halfway Travel Oasis.

315
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,000
I work at the hospital in the city.

316
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,400
Whoa.

317
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,160
That's still wet.

318
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,480
The other workers...
what do they drive?

319
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,880
The cook lives here
with his wife.

320
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,880
She's in town with their car.
That's everyone.

321
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,480
Maybe we can carjack, huh?

322
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,080
There hasn't been another car
since we got here.

323
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,760
We're in the middle of nowhere!

324
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,080
- What do you want me to do?
- I should put a bullet in you!

325
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,040
Binky, listen to me.
Put the gun down, please.

326
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,560
Put the gun down.
I will find the keys.

327
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,320
I'll find the keys, okay?
I'll find them.

328
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,920
All right?
I'll find them.

329
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,040
That's the spirit.

330
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
The septic tank traps the solids,

331
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,560
lets the water seep
through a bed of gravel.

332
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,800
There's usually
a clean out on top.

333
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes, the one job you kept
for over a week...

334
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,080
Randy Rooter.
So respectable.

335
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,760
And a waitress is what, huh?

336
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,360
A start. I have plans.

337
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,680
You've got plans.

338
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,960
What's this?

339
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,800
It's the clean out.

340
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,400
- This?
- I don't know,

341
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,120
but it's next to the tank.

342
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,560
We're going down.

343
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,400
Oh, it's a bomb shelter.

344
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,120
The tank's on the other side.

345
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,240
Someone's been injured.
Possibly the hostage.

346
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,000
Whoever else was here left.

347
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,200
The tires of my motorcycle
were slashed.

348
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,240
Yeah, well,
they don't want to be followed.

349
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
So you're the little shit
that robbed the casino.

350
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,120
Fuck you!

351
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Oh!

352
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,440
All right.

353
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,080
I ain't doing it.

354
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,240
Ah!

355
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,600
He's gone. We lost him.

356
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,200
What the fuck are you doing?

357
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,480
Help!

358
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,800
It's that.

359
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
It's the purple
rabbit-foot keychain.

360
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,440
Be careful.

361
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,320
Alex?

362
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Asshole.

363
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,760
Not funny.

364
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
Boo!

365
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,080
You were worried.

366
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,080
No no, I heard you.

367
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,400
There's still something there.
You still care.

368
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,680
Yesterday I hit a skunk with my car.

369
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,560
Killed it. I cried.

370
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,840
It doesn't mean
I wanna be with a skunk.

371
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,400
You were still worried.

372
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,480
We keep our eyes on him
until help comes.

373
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,640
If we have an opportunity
to rescue the hostage,

374
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,360
don't you think we should?

375
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,040
What the f...

376
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
What? What do you see?

377
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,360
We're screwed, Maya.

378
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,320
We're never gonna
find those keys.

379
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,840
- You're screwed.
- They could be anywhere.

380
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,560
They could,

381
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,200
but they're not.

382
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,080
What are you talking about?

383
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,080
Psych.

384
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,560
Payback's a bitch.

385
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,320
You didn't.

386
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,160
Look, if this means we're even, l...

387
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,720
We are far from even.

388
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,040
I just swam through
shit for you, Maya.

389
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,800
See, that's where
you're wrong.

390
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,280
You swam through
shit for you,

391
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,480
so you could leave
with your boyfriend.

392
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,320
You have never once
done anything just for me.

393
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,000
I didn't come back
here for your help.

394
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,680
It wasn't supposed to happen,
all right, Maya?

395
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,200
I came back here for you. I did.

396
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,240
I came back here for you.
Look, Maya, please just come with me.

397
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay, I have money now.
We can make a fresh start.

398
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,240
What can I do
to change your mind?

399
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,080
Just go.

400
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:16,880
He couldn't have gone far.

401
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,040
He couldn't have gone far.

402
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,560
Drop the radio.

403
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,840
- Kick it towards me.
- You're not gonna get away with this.

404
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,720
- I already am.
- Freeze!

405
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
Drop the weapon.

406
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,080
- You drop the weapon!
- I said drop the weapon!

407
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,280
I said drop
the weapon!

408
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Guys!

409
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,720
Oh shit.

410
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,600
What did you do to him?

411
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,200
- I was standing right here!
- What about your partner?

412
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,640
He was with me.

413
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
He was running away.

414
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
He was scared of something.
I didn't touch him!

415
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

416
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,760
Hey, he let the hostages go.
It's not worth it.

417
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,040
Are you all right?

418
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,800
Yeah, same story,
different day.

419
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,560
We need help... now.

420
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm walking up to Hertel Ranch.

421
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
- It's two miles up the road.
- No, I'll go.

422
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,520
Hey hey hey, no one is
going anywhere.

423
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
We are the help!

424
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,040
We have listened
to you enough already.

425
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,120
You have lost control
of this situation.

426
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,680
Doc, go check out the old man.

427
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
Look, backup is on the way.

428
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,560
- We cannot count on them.
- We have no choice.

429
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,200
They are not coming!

430
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,800
It is no surprise
you spent your life alone.

431
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,640
Who could put up with you?

432
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,920
You don't know
anything about me.

433
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,560
Whose fault is that?

434
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,120
Now why don't you just throw
your little handbook out the window

435
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,040
and start trusting yourself?

436
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,680
What are you so afraid of?

437
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,320
Take plenty of water.
Be back by sundown.

438
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,280
Hey, take this.

439
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,040
This is Mr. Anderson.

440
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,360
He was scheduled
for surgery today.

441
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,120
Surgery?

442
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,520
He wasn't expected
to survive.

443
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,360
How did he wander
all the way out here?

444
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,640
You know, there's a precise nature
to the wounds.

445
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,840
It looks as if they were made
with surgical tools.

446
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
It's just strange that
someone would kill him this way.

447
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,920
How's that?

448
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,400
He was scheduled
for open-heart surgery.

449
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,960
- What's wrong with you, man, huh?
- You stink.

450
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,720
Hey, you know what?
I got the keys, didn't I?

451
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Pull over.

452
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Oh, come on, Binky.
What now, all right?

453
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,160
Stop the car.

454
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,400
I could take a shower, all right?
I'll take a shower.

455
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,240
Stop the car and get out.

456
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,320
- What are you doing?
- I'm starting over.

457
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,360
Are you okay?

458
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,920
Did you see that?

459
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,120
What?

460
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,880
You really didn't see that?

461
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,600
God.

462
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
You haven't made
any weapons?

463
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,280
You don't know
where you're at, do you?

464
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,240
6 Corners Travel Stop.

465
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,080
Almost.

466
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,200
My people tell the story
of an evil darkness

467
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,560
that lurks in the space
between the light and the dark.

468
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
That's where we are.

469
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,600
If you do not go peacefully

470
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,320
when Mother Nature
calls you back home,

471
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,520
this darkness will come

472
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,400
and take you by force.

473
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,760
Are you Leonard Eaglesmith?

474
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,840
That's me.

475
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
Yeah, your family called in
and said you were missing...

476
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,240
wandered away from home.
You had been drinking.

477
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,360
Something terrible must
have happened to me.

478
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,920
All right, all right.

479
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,360
Look, why don't you
sleep it off, huh?

480
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
We'll set you up
a room here at the motel.

481
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,680
You'll feel better
in the morning.

482
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,240
I can fight back,

483
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,080
and I will not die lying down.

484
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,600
Well, I mean,
I can't make you stay.

485
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,760
You haven't broken
any laws,

486
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,880
but I think
you should consider

487
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,840
waiting with us
out of the elements.

488
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,000
I warned you.

489
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,400
What is going on?!

490
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,000
# I tried to scold you #

491
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,920
# But yesterday
you had already gone #

492
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,600
# You know, you move so fast #

493
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,960
# You're a solitary breed #

494
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,400
# Yeah, everybody loves you #

495
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,240
# That's a solitary... #

496
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,560
"You are trapped between
light and dark, night and day."

497
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,320
That's what Eaglesmith said.

498
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,760
Where are you going?

499
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,040
To find him.

500
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,040
What's wrong with you?

501
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,320
Binky, your head, man.

502
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,640
What? What?!

503
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,000
What? What?

504
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,960
Maybe you should lie down
a little bit, you know?

505
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,280
I don't want to lie down!

506
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,080
- What did I hit?
- I don't know.

507
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,760
Something doesn't
want us to leave.

508
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,080
What's going on, Binky?

509
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,400
Here.

510
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,040
Well, don't leave me.

511
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,320
Eaglesmith!

512
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,040
Eaglesmith!

513
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,360
Don't be an asshole.
Slow down!

514
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,920
You wanna know what
the problem with me is?

515
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,960
You. Ever since
I met you, you...

516
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,600
Look, this is not the time!
I'm freaking out here!

517
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,520
Come on, man.
I need you now, more than ever.

518
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,920
Oh yeah, look who's being nice
now that they don't have a face.

519
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,240
What the hell
is wrong with you?

520
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,840
Hot!

521
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,800
What the... water! Water!

522
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,280
Don't just stand there. Water!

523
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,200
- Water? I don't have any water.
- We've gotta do something.

524
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,040
Just...

525
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,360
Come on, help.

526
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,000
Are you kidding?

527
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,720
- I can't do it on command!
- Just try!

528
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,440
- Don't look at it.
- I wasn't.

529
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,320
I hope that's not my share.

530
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,960
- Carlos?
- What happened to you?

531
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,720
Badass black thing's chasing me
around with a flame-thrower.

532
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,880
- Black thing?
- It's hunting everyone here, man.

533
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,520
- Hunting?
- Watch your backs.

534
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,840
You smell that?

535
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,800
I have a cold.

536
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,480
I don't have a nose.

537
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,360
I wouldn't stick
around here if I was you.

538
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,920
Carlos. Carlos, wait! Carlos!

539
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,840
I think he's in trouble.

540
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,760
I found these.

541
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,920
He's probably
passed out somewhere.

542
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,600
You could smell the booze
from a mile away.

543
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,440
If any of the prophecies
are correct,

544
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,240
we're not the first to face this,

545
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,640
- and we won't be the last.
- That's just a lot of hogwash.

546
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,000
"An evil darkness lurks"?

547
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,200
Listen to her. She's right.

548
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,880
Any luck with the phone?

549
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,280
Couldn't get to it.

550
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,200
Oh, there's just a little matter
of an invisible wall

551
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,320
that's keeping us
all trapped here.

552
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,200
That and a smelly ass
Grim-Reaper-looking thing

553
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,920
performing lipo on an Indian man
in a shack off old 13.

554
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,320
Eaglesmith.

555
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,840
See?

556
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,840
"See?" She says "See?"

557
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,280
Now I was hoping that
you would think I was out of my mind,

558
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,640
at the very least sarcastic.

559
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,800
I would pour you a coffee,

560
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,840
but I think you need this.

561
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,160
Thanks.

562
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,840
"Rotting flesh.
The smell of death.

563
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,320
Beware the Reeker."

564
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,440
Whoa whoa whoa,
let's not jump to conclusions.

565
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,640
Well, what about
the old man then?

566
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,320
Well, call me crazy,

567
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,600
but I would tend to believe

568
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,160
that the armed robbers
were responsible,

569
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,960
not some ghost
with a hygiene problem.

570
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,840
Add up the clues.

571
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,160
- It's called detective work.
- Where are you going?

572
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,640
To protect us.

573
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,560
Will you come on?

574
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,520
Come on.
What, you're worried about the cash?

575
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,200
- What about your face?
- Yeah, right.

576
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,200
Now I got nothing. I can't even
afford to buy a new fucking face.

577
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,040
You can buy a face?

578
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,240
Well, for the right price,
they can make a man into a woman...

579
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,920
filet and fold your penis
right up inside. Why not?

580
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,360
How could you even be alive?

581
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,240
Well, chickens live
with their heads cut off.

582
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,640
Yeah, for a few seconds,
but they don't talk

583
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,040
and they sure don't walk.

584
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,400
I swear, if I get out of this,

585
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,360
I am never doing
anything bad again.

586
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,120
I'll volunteer.
I'll sing for the needy.

587
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,760
- Oh, check it out.
- What?

588
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,440
It's clean, it's green and it's mine.

589
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,960
I'm not sticking around.

590
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,720
Freeze!

591
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,080
Okay, don't shoot.

592
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,840
Please take me to jail.

593
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,760
Okay?

594
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,000
Please take me to jail.

595
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,480
Look, I give up. I surrender.

596
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,720
Okay?

597
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,000
You saw him,
didn't you?

598
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,560
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
I saw him.

599
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,120
Down on your knees!

600
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,440
Now!

601
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,960
I don't think
he's going anywhere.

602
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,960
There's a problem
with the world... it ends.

603
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,840
- Now! Now! Hands behind your head.
- Okay okay okay.

604
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,560
We could use the help.

605
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,120
He's not gonna be much help

606
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,600
when he's under arrest.

607
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,640
Look, I just think
we should stick together.

608
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,320
Armed robbery,
attempted murder, resisting arrest.

609
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,880
You have a sworn duty
to enforce the law, kid.

610
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,680
I told you there was no sunset.

611
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,360
Maya, make sure they protect you.

612
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,320
Maya, please.

613
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,040
- Maya, don't ignore me.
- Keep on moving.

614
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,440
Maya!

615
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,600
Look, he had half
of his head missing, okay?

616
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,720
Now I don't know
much about science,

617
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,840
but I know that when your brain's
showing, and part of it's missing,

618
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,560
that, you know, you should be dead,
not walking around.

619
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,400
This all happened in a car accident
with an invisible wall?

620
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,920
- I swear. I swear to God.
- Sheriff.

621
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,200
Clues.

622
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,960
That's not what killed him, you guys.

623
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,560
It was this... this black ghost

624
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,560
with a flame-thrower
of all things.

625
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,720
I swear to God.

626
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,000
He's responsive
with normal reflexes.

627
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,960
He doesn't appear
to be drunk or on drugs.

628
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,520
- It's incredible.
- What?

629
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,120
Your heart...
it's beating, but it's so slow.

630
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,240
You should be
in a coma or dead.

631
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,680
You're the doctor.

632
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,160
All of us.

633
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,480
It's like we're in
some sort of walking coma.

634
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,360
We're not quite alive

635
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,440
and not quite dead.

636
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,120
We're in between?

637
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,720
Well, we can't hurt ourselves.

638
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,920
The only thing
that can hurt us is... this death.

639
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,360
We need to make a plan.

640
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,160
Yeah, well...

641
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,760
my plan is to have a good meal

642
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,720
and take a nap

643
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,520
in one of these lovely rooms.

644
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,920
- Sheriff.
- Listen, hey.

645
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
No, don't leave me
here alone!

646
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,360
Please.

647
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,560
I'll stay.

648
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,920
I like it when fish fuck.

649
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,880
Excuse me?

650
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,000
I said I like it
when fish fuck.

651
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,400
Are you serious?

652
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,920
Why lie?

653
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,920
Either all of this
isn't real,

654
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,920
or we're gonna
die soon anyway.

655
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,800
Whichever it is,
all bets are off.

656
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,680
We might as well be honest
with each other, you know?

657
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,200
Under water?

658
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,480
No, in a bed. Yes.

659
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,480
I saw two dolphins doing it
in an aquarium once.

660
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,120
It was... it was hot.

661
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,800
Not that I would want to fuck a fish.
You know what I'm saying?

662
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,280
I just... something about it.

663
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,960
It was... you know?

664
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,400
I mean, it was...

665
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,080
I once stole
a quadriplegic's wallet.

666
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,000
I needed new shoes.

667
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,160
Hello?

668
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,640
Hello?

669
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,800
I thought we were being honest
with each other, right, Deputy?

670
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,720
Listen, Deputy,
I was kidding, all right?

671
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,400
Deputy?

672
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,400
Deputy?

673
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,320
Deputy.

674
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,400
Deputy!

675
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,000
Hello?

676
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,920
Help me.

677
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,760
Hello?

678
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,520
In here.

679
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,280
Someone, please help!

680
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,080
Hey, Deputy.

681
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,520
There's so much blood.

682
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,840
Help.

683
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,160
I can help you.

684
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,520
You can't.

685
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,200
Thanks for trying.

686
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,000
Look out!

687
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,440
You know, if there was
a radiation accident at the power plant,

688
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,160
it could have messed
with the electronic transmission.

689
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,680
Have you seen the people
who stay here?

690
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,280
I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait to be proven wrong.

691
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,040
I'm with you, Sheriff.

692
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,560
There's no Tooth Fairy,
no Santa Claus

693
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,720
and, on my life,
no soul collector.

694
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,240
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

695
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,640
Hello?

696
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,480
Hello?

697
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,000
Hello?

698
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,800
What?

699
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,400
- Is everybody okay?
- Ravi?

700
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,120
Deputy.

701
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,640
Who is there?

702
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,480
Is there somebody there?

703
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,280
Who is it?

704
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,960
Your worst nightmare.

705
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,520
Hello?

706
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,280
Hello?

707
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,880
Everyone has to die.

708
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh my...

709
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,560
Deputy.

710
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,400
It's cool.

711
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,760
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

712
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,160
It's cool.

713
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,240
Somebody help!

714
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,160
Help me!

715
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,440
He just dropped. He fell.

716
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,800
Come on.

717
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,160
Okay, lie still. Lie still.

718
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,920
This thing threw me.

719
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
Threw?

720
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,680
It was trying to kill me.

721
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Okay, you have a fractured skull.

722
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,560
It's a serious injury.

723
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,400
I need you not to move.

724
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,520
Lie still.

725
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,920
I'm gonna go get
some ice to stop the swelling.

726
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,440
You... I need you
to keep an eye on him.

727
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,480
- Yell for me if he stops breathing.
- No no no no.

728
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,320
- What do you mean "no"?
- No.

729
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,560
- Why not?
- What?

730
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,640
What the fuck was that?

731
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
This is a taser gun.
It fires an electrical current.

732
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,200
It'll temporarily disable your victim.

733
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,880
Look, hey,
how about a gun for me, huh?

734
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,800
Don't press your luck, pal. Here.

735
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,520
What have you got here?

736
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,280
Answers.

737
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,240
What else
do these voices tell you?

738
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,960
They need good killers
in the in between

739
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,680
to collect errant souls.

740
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,560
How does that make you feel?

741
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,240
I'm one of the chosen.
I don't feel.

742
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,680
I'll work till I rot away,

743
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,400
then someone else
will replace me.

744
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,040
They will always be
training new killers.

745
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,000
It's always been
and will always be that way.

746
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,600
Have you even considered that
what you are doing is wrong?

747
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,760
Never.

748
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,040
This was a big deal.
You never talk about it.

749
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,800
I thought he was insane.

750
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,760
But the voices
he heard were right?

751
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,480
I don't... I don't get it.
This thing is a serial killer?

752
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,880
Was.

753
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,040
Was.

754
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,800
Whatever it is now,

755
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,080
it's also trapped here,

756
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,280
working for...

757
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,280
death, I guess,

758
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,760
taking people's lives

759
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,760
who are supposed to die

760
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,360
but don't wanna die.

761
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,720
What are you writing?

762
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,440
I'm making sure other people
know who we're up against.

763
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,040
Well, what about us, now?

764
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,280
Well, if there's nothing left of him,
he can't hurt us.

765
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,640
We have to completely
destroy him.

766
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,160
Hey.

767
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,800
What do you say
we do now, Sheriff?

768
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,960
Kill him.

769
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,120
We need a timer.

770
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,440
Well, there must be a clock
around here somewhere

771
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,000
that we could use
to reconfigure.

772
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,320
We need a trigger that's gonna release
the gas at a steady rate

773
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,040
- to create vapors.
- Follow me.

774
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,880
We fill the tank with gas.

775
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,480
- When it swishes around the bowl...
- Vapors.

776
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,200
This will give us about 15 seconds

777
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,800
before the vapors in the bowl ignite.

778
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,080
Perfect.

779
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,240
I... never actually caught him.

780
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,440
Who?

781
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,800
If it had been up to me,

782
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,800
he would have gotten away.

783
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,800
I ran.

784
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,240
I'm no hero.

785
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,040
So?

786
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,920
So...

787
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,520
I lived a life I didn't earn.

788
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,200
I was always afraid that you

789
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,960
or everybody would find out
what a fraud I was...

790
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,720
so I pushed people away.

791
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,720
It would have been nice
to have you around,

792
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,080
- hero or not.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

793
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,600
Look, I know I've never been much
of a father to you...

794
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,480
and I'm not sure
I can ever make it up to you,

795
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,800
but I want you to know

796
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,440
that I'm gonna try.

797
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,120
There will be time.

798
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,200
I really hope so.

799
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,000
But if there isn't,

800
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,960
I just wanted you to know

801
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,040
who your father really was.

802
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,720
Yeah.

803
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,280
I'm gonna go
help the kids with the gas.

804
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,960
Dad.

805
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,680
Yeah?

806
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,040
Be careful.

807
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,480
Thanks... son.

808
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,760
Sheriff?

809
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,240
Harris!

810
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,640
Sheriff!

811
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,760
Yeah?

812
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,240
Sorry, I was getting
our pilot light.

813
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,720
- Is my dad not with you?
- No.

814
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,440
- He didn't help you?
- I didn't see him.

815
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,040
Stay here.

816
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,960
Hey!

817
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,280
Hey, asshole! I'm back!

818
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,320
Did you hear that?

819
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,000
No.

820
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,640
Hey, any luck?

821
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,880
- There it was again.
- What?

822
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,120
It's another explosion.

823
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,160
Oh dear God.

824
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,800
He's breathing.

825
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,240
Heart's beating... barely.

826
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,080
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- No kidding.

827
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,280
But we can't help
him if we die.

828
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,720
Come on.

829
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,600
Your time will come.

830
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,600
Nick, where are you?

831
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,360
I need you right now.

832
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,760
Officer down. Send medical.

833
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,200
Send medic...

834
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,560
You made this town safe.

835
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,440
Copy that.
What's the 20 on the suspects?

836
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,160
Sheriff? Sheriff.

837
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,440
Hey, come here.

838
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,120
Don't worry, okay?
I've got your back.

839
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,640
It's all right.

840
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,760
What are we doing?

841
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,720
When he gets close,

842
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,560
we open the propane valve,
we flush,

843
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,280
we dive in
the bomb shelter

844
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,000
and it's "Goodbye, asshole."

845
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,440
No.

846
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,640
I mean, what are we doing?

847
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,440
Us.

848
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,280
Living in the moment.

849
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,160
If we're actually living.

850
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,960
- Anything?
- I'm not sure.

851
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,720
Do you see that?

852
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,440
- No.
- Lights.

853
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,120
- No, what?
- A cop car.

854
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,440
- No, hey, Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya, wait!
- Hey!

855
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,200
Help! Help!

856
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,680
Come on.

857
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,680
Come on!

858
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,640
Maya, in the shelter now!

859
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,360
Hey!

860
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,960
- What are you doing?
- I am not letting you die here alone.

861
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,000
What, are you crazy?

862
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,680
Maya, don't!

863
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,720
Take me instead.

864
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,600
Come on. I'm easy.

865
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,960
Psych. Payback's a bitch, isn't it?

866
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,840
Copy that.

867
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,960
So what's the 20
on the suspects?

868
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,200
Sheriff? Sheriff.

869
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,600
Hey, there's been
an explosion. Code 13.

870
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,440
It doesn't look good.

871
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,240
I don't see any survivors.

872
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,760
All units respond
to 6 Corners Travel Stop.

873
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,360
We need fire,
EMTs, coroner stat.

874
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,520
Miss, don't move.

875
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,920
Help is on its way.

876
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,840
He didn't make it
through surgery.

877
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,960
I told you.
It looks like you owe me 20 bucks.

878
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,560
There has been an explosion
at the 6 Corners off the old 64.

879
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,080
Two survivors en route.
Tag them and bag them.

880
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,920
Yeah, we got a male
Native American deceased.

881
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,600
It looks like the vultures and the coyotes
beat us to the punch here.

882
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,200
Log your coordinates
and run.

883
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,400
Report to the 6 Corners.
Officer down.

884
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,360
You're the little shit that robbed
the casino, huh?

885
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,600
If you weren't toast already,
I'd kill you myself.

886
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,480
Oh, he's gone.
We lost him.

887
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,480
Too bad.

888
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,200
You've got a punctured lung
and a couple broken bones,

889
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,240
but you're gonna be all right.

890
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,600
He saved your life.

891
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,960
- He did?
- Yeah.

892
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:44,080
Listen, honey, do you remember
anything about what happened?

893
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,400
There were gunshots.

894
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,200
The gas pump exploded.

895
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,840
We ran, and we were fine.

896
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,760
And then I blacked out.

897
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,520
Never mind.

898
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,000
I found the rest of him.

899
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,080
He has massive head injuries.

900
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,520
My father... did he make it?

901
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,920
He would have wanted
you to have this.

902
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,280
I was using the restroom.

903
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,800
When I heard the big boom,
I call for help.

904
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,240
That's when I heard
the second big boom.

905
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,640
- You say there were two explosions?
- Yes.

906
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,320
In here!

907
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,600
Harris, leave him!

908
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,040
Nick, where are you?
I need you here now. Officer down.

909
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,880
Come on, hurry up!

910
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,760
The thing threw me.

911
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,840
Copy that.
What's the 20 on the suspect?

912
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,920
Sheriff? Sheriff.

913
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,440
- Where is the babysitter?
- You know.

914
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,880
You told me.

915
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,040
I told you what?

916
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,360
What to do with her.

917
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,920
- No, I didn't.
- Someone did.

918
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,520
Someone did?

919
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,400
To practice.

920
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,007
The voices said it was my duty.

921
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,480
Voices.

922
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,360
Where is she?

923
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,080
Exercising.

924
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,240
