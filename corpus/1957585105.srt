I was just wondering if you might

want to join me out on the ice today.

45
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,730
Give me a call as soon as you can.

Yeah, I'm looking for Billy, is he there?

50
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,823
Oh really, on a Saturday?

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:00,430

- Geez, Willaby, you scared me!

60
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,910
- Ooh, it looks like you
picked a fine lure there, Tony.

61
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,313
- [Tony] Yeah, can you help
me get this thing out of here?

62
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:36,451
(Tony laughing)

63
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,284

64
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,985
Give me the see.

66
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,528
- Sorry about that.

67
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,362
- That's all right.

68
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,200
- Tell you one thing, you got good taste.

69
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,890
That is an expensive lure.

70
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,350
- I don't want the lure Willaby,

71
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,130
I just came in for some minnows.

72
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,150
- Well, I've been selling them like crazy.

73
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,983
Follow me.

74
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,450
(Tony sighs)

75
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,470
How many you want?

76
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,373
- Oh, a couple dozen ought to do it.

77
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,566
Hey, have you heard where they're biting?

78
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,310
- [Willaby] Everywhere,
where have you been?

79
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,800
Perch are punching holes
through the ice from underneath,

80
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,843
just to escape.

81
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,520
(Tony laughing)

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,147
You'll be doing them a favor.

83
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,730
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,690
- Man, these little
beauties are guaranteed

85
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,913
to drive them crazy.

86
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,090
Big ones too.

87
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,590
- Well, that's what I'm after.

88
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,147
(sighing)

89
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:46,980

90
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,026
the lure

91
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:51,385
and the minnows

92
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,130
comes to $8.60.

93
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,683
- I don't want the lur ... nevermind.

94
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,360
- So you out by yourself today?

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,070
- Yeah, but that's okay.

96
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,830
I was supposed to go to my mother-in-law's

97
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,670
for a birthday deal,

98
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,153

100
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:09,940
- So you're still that bad, hey?

101
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,580
- Could be sick all weekend for sure.

102
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,083
At least till this afternoon
when the party's over.

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,733
Hey, I love those things.

105
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,410
Give me a couple, would ya?

106
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,243
- Yeah.

107
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,803
- And make it four, I'm having a pang.

You are the Wolfgang Puck
of the pickled egg world.

112
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,130
- That'll get things moving.

113
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,940
That's 10 bucks to you.
- Mm.

114

(Tony grunts)

115
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,730
You know I watched a
fishing report this morning,

116
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,453
they said conditions are
supposed to be perfect today.

117
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,750
- I don't know how they can figure that.

118
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,650
- It's the barometric pressure,

119
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,483
stuff like that.

120
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,450
See you later Willaby.

121
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,900
Oh, if anyone asks, I wasn't here.

122
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,020
- Who wasn't here?

Jeez.

130
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,260
Hello?

131
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,020
- You can't park here.

132
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,260
Get your piece of crap out of here!

133
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,770
- I always park here.

134
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,400
- The space needs to be clear.

135
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,233
Move it!

136
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,525
- (laughing) All right, already, Jeez.

137
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,053
(hand slams on the window)

138
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:07,248

147
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:46,929
- Norgard!

148
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,030
- Ah Stormy, you are just in time.

149
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,160
Can I get a ride?

150
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,183
- Hang on, man.

151
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,016
Whoa!

152
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,480
- Hey, I heard the fish are cooperating.

153

- You heard right.

154
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,870
- All right.

Giddy up!

(sled crunches)

164
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,960
- See you've got a zebra
theme going this year?

165
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,510
- Actually, it's an homage to Ted.

166
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,900
- The Nouge?

167
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,278
- Motor city madman.

168
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,426
- Yeah!

169
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:38,529

171
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,820
Man, I love it out here.

172
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,293
- No place I'd rather be.

173
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:49,896

00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,588

(door clatters)

176
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,290
- My bait broke last night.

177
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,890
- No kidding, it only got to 15.

178
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,723
- I know.

179
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,490
So can I borrow some of your minnows?

180
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,743
- Oh, I don't know, I only got two dozen.

181
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,363
- Oh, these are beauty.

182
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,153
Hey I'll er,

183
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,050
I'll trade you some jerky for 'em.

184
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,093
- Jerky?

185
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:39,130
- Jerky.

186
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,363
- From Max?

187
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:41,809
- Where else.

188
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,754
- All right, I can
spare a couple, I guess.

189
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,554
- I'll be right back.

190
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,336
(door slams)

191
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:49,888
- Okay, let's see here.

192
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,305
(upbeat wild west music)

193
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,547
(Tony sighs)

194
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,241
(Tony sighing)

195
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,074
Bastards.

196
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,252
(line spinning)

197
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,612
All right.

198
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:58,612
Wherever you are, I'm
gonna get ya. (laughs)

199
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:06,344
(phone ringing)

200
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,688
(zip scraping)

201
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,481
Oh.

202
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,930
(Tony coughs dramatically)

203
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,114
Hello.

204
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,743
(coughing) Oh, hi Lila.

205
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,063
Ah, a little better, I guess.

206
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,730
(fishing line squeaking)

207
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,660
Well, aah, thanks for calling,

208
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,410
but I don't really want to keep ya.

209
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:31,358
(boxes crashing)

210
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,764
Oh, nothing, just something
fell off the bed. (laughs)

211
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:35,597
How's mother?

212
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:37,860
Oh, that's great. (coughs)

213
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,250
Please tell her I send my love.

214
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,180
Yeah,

215
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,690
uh huh.

216
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,605
Oh I'll try to call it
four, like you said.

217
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,650
(coughing and sniffing)

218
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,650
Okay.

219
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,163
You too. Bye.

220
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,150
Ahh.

221
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,063
Oh, come on.

222
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,770
(he sighs)

223
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,108
(door clattering)

224
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,840
- (laughs) Jerky as promised

225
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:12,864
und (mug bangs on the wood)

226
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,520
(Stormy makes slurping noises)

227
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,860
- Excellent!

228
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,532
- Yeah.
- Help yourself.

229
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:21,850
- Thank you, sir.
(Tony sighs)

230
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,853
Oh beautiful.

231
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,850
- Oh, I had a nice bite.

232
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,880
- Yeah?

233
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,120
- Yeah, it had to be a walleye or a piker.

234
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,570
You know, maybe it was a jumbo perch.

235
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,300
Yeah, whatever it was, it was big.

236
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,620
I could tell by the way it was fighting.

237
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
- Could be man, they're biting all over.

238
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,053
- Oh,

239
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,854
man, this jerky is

240
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,743
awesome!

241
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:51,076
- (laughing) All right.

242
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,720
- You know, there's a hole
there for you if you want it.

243
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,680
- Oh, um thanks man but

244
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,630
I'm sat next door.

245
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,720
You got a nice deal here though.

246
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,400
- Well, thanks, I like it.

247
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,740
It's a little stuffy though.

248
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,350
Cold, but stuffy.

249
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,267
- Mmm, you.

250
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,992
(water splashing)

251
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,110
Norgard,

252
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,943
bless you.

253
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,040
- I'm going to see if I can get

254
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,340
that big boy to come back.

255
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:19,561
- You know,

256
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,408
I have a good feeling about today.

257
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,241
- Me too.

258
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:29,209
(bluesy guitar and harmonica music)

259
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,378
Ahh!

260
00:17:58,442 --> 00:17:59,745
Oh,

261
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,578
oh God!

262
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,328
(water splashing)

263
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,796
- Norgard, are you okay?

264
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,804
- Aw, I had 'im.

265
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,637
(Stormy laughing)

266
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,670
It was a jumbo perch, for sure.

267
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,020
- Oh, the same one?

268
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,377
- Probably, jumped back in the hole.

269
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,823
- I hate when that happens.

270
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:29,530
- Oh man, I love the hunt.

271
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,015
- Yeah.

272
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,215
- [Tony] It's so primal.

273
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,733
- An age old challenge.

274
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,343
- Man and beast.

275
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:39,866
- Hmm.

276
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,266
(bluesy music)

277
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:50,353
- Oh, slime, ah.

278
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,425
- [Wolowski] Right small.

279
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,527
- [Sam] Are you kidding me?

280
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,236
- [Wolowski] Uh-ah.

281
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,903
- That little thing?

282
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,760
I've had pimples bigger
than that poor little thing.

283
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,483
- Now that doesn't surprise me.

284
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,563
- All right, wait, wait,
wait, let me try that again.

285
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,303
Here's the deal.

286
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:20,550
You're never going to catch one

287
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,437
like the dude that I
caught out here last year

288
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,270
and that's that.

289
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,950
That fish was four foot long.

290
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,210
- I was there.

291
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,260
For the record, it was three years ago

292
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,800
and that thing was 30 inches tops.

293
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,240
I've caught bigger ones since.

294
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,655
Hell, everyone's caught
bigger ones than that.

295
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:35,865
- Bosh!

296
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:36,698
(Tony sighs)

297
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:37,531
- Hey, what's up Tony?

298
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,815
- Hey, just enjoying
some of this paradise.

299
00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:42,470
- (laughing) Hey, your old
man not out here today?

300
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,110
- Nah, he had to go to a birthday party.

301
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,567
- Birthday party? (laughs)

302
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:52,567
Go party! (laughing)

303
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,433
- Excuse me.

304
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,600
- Hey, sure.

305
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,700
Birthday party! (laughing)

306
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,154
- March it.

307
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,105
(can crunching)

308
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:03,190
(man growling)

309
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,540
- Need to lose some weight.

310
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,517
- Hey, what are you doing here Pop?

311
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,560
- What do you mean,
"What am I doing here?"

312
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,610
What are you doing here?

313
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,970
- Aren't you supposed to
be at a birthday party?

314
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,343
- It's not till two.

315
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,160
It's only half past
10, I got tons of time.

316
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,970
- Well actually the party's at four.

317
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,070
- There you go, better yet. (laughs)

318
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,670
Now, what's your excuse?

319
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,210
- Well, if you must know,

320
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,037
I wasn't feeling that well last night

321
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,687
and I thought it would be
better if I rested up some,

322
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,700
but come this morning, I felt fine.

323
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,200
Go figure.

324
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,110
- That's pathetic.

325
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,765
- Hey, I'd go,

326
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:49,320
but I might still be
contagious or something.

327
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,460
- Whatever. (laughs)

328
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,293
Don't you have a

329
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,480
shanty around here somewhere?

330
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
- Yeah, it's over here.

331
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,293
Why don't you join me?

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,673
Come on, Pop.

333
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:01,453
It's warm, I got fresh jerky.

334
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:05,269
- Lead the way.

335
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,602
(Pop sighs)

336
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,230
So what's new?

337
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,710
- At school?

338
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,750
- Whatever.

339
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,993
- Ah, the kids are a bit of a pain,

340
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,800
but they're a good bunch.

341
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,090
- You're still teaching gym?

342
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,610
- Athletics, Pop.

343
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,530
- Ah.
- Yeah.

344
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,970
- Well school never did much for me,

345
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,650
ha, especially that athletics, ha,

346
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,550
going naked in the shower, ooh.

347
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,420
- That's not that big a deal.

348
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,060
- Well, it was for me,

349
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,160
I wasn't that big a jock,

350
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,993
then.

351
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,210
- Ha, no kidding.

352
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,830
Hey, I know how you feel, Pop.

353
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,453
- Yeah, better you than
me, yeah boy. (laughs)

354
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,783
Hey, ha ha, would you look at this.

355
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:52,870
What is it, a new coop?

356
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,770
Pretty snazzy boy.

357
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,220
- Bought it off old man Peterson,

358
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,045
fixed it up over the summer.

359
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:58,878
Do you like it?

360
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,793
- Yeah I do, I do.

361
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,460
(shivers)

362
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah.

363
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,750
- What have you got for bait?

364
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,890
- Bait?

365
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,890
- Yeah, you know,

366
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,900
minnows, wigglers, wax worms?

367
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,150
- Well actually, I didn't
stop off at the store today.

368
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,350
- Well, what the heck
are you going to use?

369
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,230
- Well, there's plenty
of bait hanging around.

370
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,853
Matter of fact, I was
thinking of going down there

371
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:24,530
to old man Flanagan
Shannon, you know. (laughs)

372
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,834
He's always got high
hopes and too much bait.

373
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:32,834
(Frank laughing)
(Tony sighs)

374
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,370
All right, so what have you got?

375
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,203
- Minnows.

376
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:39,890
We might have to go get more.

377
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,830
- What for?

378
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,080
We'll just split 'em.

379
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,250
- Well sure, Pop.

380
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,520
But Stormy took some.

381
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,410
Well, there's got to be 16 left.

382
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,820
You can have eight.

383
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,140
- No, no, then listen.

384
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,380
Just split 'em and you, you, you,

385
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,660
they make 'em, make 'em
last longer, that's all.

386
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,058
- In half?

387
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,193
- Yeah!

388
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:59,200
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

389
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,219
- Why not? A lot of guys do it.

390
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,215
- Er, what other guys?

391
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,260
- Besides, what the
hell is a fishing hole?

392
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,130
- Yeah, but some fellas use marshmallows

393
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,900
or peanut butter or beans.

394
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,670
That doesn't mean it works.

395
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,490
- Ah well, hey, (laughs)

396
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,520
suit yourself.

397
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,680
- Yeah, I'm not doing it.

398
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,780
You can have whole minnows.

399
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,330
- All right.

400
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,163
Ahh,

401
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,763
here we go.

402
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:22,144
Here we go.

403
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,153
You know,

404
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:29,560
there's only three
regrets in a man's life.

405
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,200
- Yeah, what's that, Pop?

406
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,030
- When he proposes,

407
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,290
when he doesn't propose

408
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,997
and when he isn't fishin'!

409
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:39,640
(they laugh)

410
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,520
- That's not even funny.

411
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,613
- It's not supposed to be. (laughs)

412
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,232
- Salut!
- Here we go.

413
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:48,711
- Ahh.

414
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh boy.

415
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,559
Give me one of them fish there with a ...

416
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,923
That's it.
- There we go.

417
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,300
- That's it, you got it.

418
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,690
You got it, all right.

419
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,161
Put it right on there, like I taught ya.

420
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,020
(laughs)

421
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,623
- There you go.

422
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:07,624
- All right, hey, all right.

423
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:08,624
There we go.

424
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,950
Yeah, so how's Lila?

425
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,120
- Oh, she's fine.

426
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,030
- Yeah?

427
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,503
- I had to borrow her car.

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,877
- You brought her car
down here to the Lake?

429
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,401
She's gonna be PO'd, boy.

430
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:24,234
- Yeah, I know.

431
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:26,888
But she took my truck,
what was I supposed to do?

432
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:28,430
- Man, you got guts.

433
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,090
- That ain't the half of it.

434
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,680
I already backed it into a truck

435
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,253
and busted out the tail light.

436
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,123
- You gotta be kidding.

437
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,920
Well, how are you going to explain that?

438
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,213
- Oh, I haven't really
thought that through yet.

439
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,253
- Well, good luck.

440
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,060
Hey, have you got your license?

441
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,117
You always forget it, you know.

442
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,933
- Yeah, I got it.

443
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:56,410
- (laughs) Yeah, a little
fishy in the brook,

444
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,790
Papa catch 'im on the hook,

445
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,896
- [Both Singing] On the fly and in the pan

446
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:05,896
Baby, even like a man. (they laugh)

447
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,920
(jaunty music)

448
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,794
(Pop snoring)

449
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,628
(Pop burping)

450
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:27,461
- Well.

451
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,633
(loud snoring)

452
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,403
(water splashing)

453
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,797
(fishing rod clattering)

454
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:10,898
(men snoring)

455
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:17,338
(loud rock music)

456
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:20,171
(people shouting)

457
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:24,562
(engine revving)

458
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:28,994
(people shouting)

459
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:53,719
(rock music)

460
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:14,530
(engines roaring)

461
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,840
- Surprised that thing even made it!

462
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,190
- Jack, what are you talking about?

463
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,993
This thing's running great.

464
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,641
- Yeah?
(metal slams)

465
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,640
How great?

466
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,080
- Great great.

467
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,542
- How about down to North
Bay Point and back, huh?

468
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,380
- You're on!

469
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,321
(helmets clash)

470
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:31,081
(upbeat racing music)

471
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,771
(engines roaring)

472
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:36,604
(people cheering)

473
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,695
(engines roaring)

474
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:49,423
(dramatic music)

475
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,976
(Tony sighing)

476
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,258
(ice crunching)

477
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,834
(can clinking)

478
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,283
- What the hell?

479
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,380
Where's my fishing pole?

480
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,683
- I dunno, mine's gone too.

481
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,823
- Now that's odd.

482
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:58,899
- Hmm.

483
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,232
(fast orchestral music)

484
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,281
(riders laughing)

485
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:14,031
(metal snapping)

486
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,849
- [Rider] Get out of the way!

487
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:20,599
(rider shouting)

488
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,679
(engine droning)
(rider screaming)

489
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,577
Look out!

490
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:33,410
(wood shattering)

491
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,834
- What the Sam Hill?

492
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,087
Come on.

493
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,599
- Nice move Mario!

494
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,432
- You jerk!

495
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:46,265
You can't race anybody.

496
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,167
- You don't know how to do these.

497
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,000
- C'mon let's get it back over there.

498
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,450
- The brake is on the left!

499
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,550
- What are we locked in here for good now?

500
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,559
- Hang on, hang on!

501
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,719
(men grunting)

502
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,552
- Oh man!

503
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:00,362
- Hey!

504
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,268
- What the hell's going on out here?

505
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,187
What is this, some kind
of dream or something?

506
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:10,543
- No, this is the real deal, Pop.

507
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,708
(Stormy laughing)

508
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,541
- It's like you finally got

509
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,067
that ventilation problem fixed

510
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,823
you were talking about. (laughing)

511
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:22,200
Man, you guys catch anything?

512
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,270
- Nothing but Zzzs.

513
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,650
- I am doing great.

514
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,483
Perch mostly,

515
00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:28,423
but some big ones and they smelt ugh.

516
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:31,360
(teeth crunch)

517
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,490
Mm.

518
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,417
- Stormy, what are you doing?

519
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,410
- Mm, we take the smell

520
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,243
from the beer can,

521
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,580
leave a little bit of beer in there,

522
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,280
put it over the heater.

523
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,363
Takes awhile, but.

524
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,990
- [Tony] Oh, it looks terrible.

525
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,330
- Mm, kind of an acquired taste.

526
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,347
- Somebody stole our fishing poles.

527
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,890
- Why?

528
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,033
- Don't ask me why, somebody
stole them, that's all.

529
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,060
- Man, those sleds are
gonna need some work.

530
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,537
- Yeah, this isn't the first
time this has happened.

531
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,770
(glove whacks the man)

532
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,980
- My brakes gave out.

533
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,120
Man, I, I'm sorry about your shed.

534
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,940
We'll, we'll come back
in a little while and,

535
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,500
and and, and fix it, okay?

536
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,970
- All right, sure, sure, sure.

537
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,345
Come on, let's get back to work.

538
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:15,178
- All right, hey.

539
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:16,011
- Go, get 'em Frank.

540
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:17,333
- It's no big deal, okay.

541
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,933
Don't worry about it.

542
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:21,600
(Stormy laughs)

543
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,390
- You know, fishing is so good that er,

544
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,600
I'm almost out of bait.

545
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,430
- Yeah, well, don't look at me.

546
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,263
- Aw, come on.

547
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,510
(Tony laughs)

548
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,460
Fine, I'll head in and reload.

549
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,983
- Hey, if you're going, get
some for us too, all right.

550
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:36,816
- Will do.

551
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:42,486
- Oh man.

552
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:48,422
(whistling music)

553
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:51,235
(head bangs on wood)

554
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:52,790
Phwa, hand me a pole.

555
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,690
- Where?

556
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,790
Oh here.

557
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,120
- Thanks, Pop.

558
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,516
This is my last pole.

559
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,343
Ha, I had a whole bucket
full of these things.

560
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,720
(Pop sighing)

561
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,553
Ha, ha.

562
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,283
Hello, baby.

563
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,290
There you go.

564
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:25,717
- Oh, I'm freezing in here.

565
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,117
- Ah, the heater's still on.

566
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,048
What are ya doin'?

567
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:35,881
- Ah God, sorry, Pop.

568
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:36,714
There we go.

569
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,823
- What are you doing?

570
00:32:41,823 --> 00:32:42,663
- Just watch.

571
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:48,850
(whistling music)

572
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,483
- I kinda liked the fresh
air in here. (laughs)

573
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,802
- Hey, you got something.

574
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,135
- Hey, hey, hey.

575
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:03,380
Come on there, come on.

576
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,213
- All right.

577
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:05,046
Now we're getting somewhere.

578
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:06,286
- Ha, ha!

579
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,119

580
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,024

581
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:11,814
- I told ya. (laughs)

582
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:13,135
Come on, sweetheart,

583
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:14,806
come on, come on.

584
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,615
Come on, baby, come on, come on.

585
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:18,615
There we go.

586
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:21,257
Get out of there, there we go.

587
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,090
Ha ha ha.

588
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,578
- Get outta that.

589
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:29,085
- Dinner.

590
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:30,957
Whoa, one bucket.

591
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:31,874
- Ahh.
- Oh!

592
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:36,058
(Pop laughing)

593
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,033
Come on, baby.

594
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,987
Come on, don't go back in the water.

595
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:41,563
Oh, daddy. (laughing)

596
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:45,600
(they both laugh)

597
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:48,394
- Whoo, ha.

598
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:51,723
- That one's coming in the back ...

599
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,925
- Come on, baby, come on.

600
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,646
Come on, baby, come on, come on, come on.

601
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:56,837
- Ahhh.
- Come on, baby.

602
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:57,670
All right.

603
00:33:58,749 --> 00:33:59,582
It's okay.

604
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,921
(laughing)

605
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,247
(knuckles rapping on the door)

606
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:07,830
- Yeah, come in.

607
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,663
- Afternoon, gentlemen.

608
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:10,260
- Oh hi, how are ya?

609
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,420
- What can we do for ya?

610
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,120
- Oh, I'm just checking in.

611
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,530
How's it going fellas?

612
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,670
- Oh, pretty good.

613
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,860
Mostly.

614
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,740
- Can I see your license?

615
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,713
- Sure.

616
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,980
Let's see.

617
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,110
Gotta be in here somewhere.

618
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,343
- There, here's mine.

619
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,083
Thank you.

620
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,283
Ha, ha, Doug, come on baby.

621
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,300
Hell, take your time.

622
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,783
- I wonder if I left it in my glove box?

623
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,760
(Pop laughs)

624
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,560
I, (laughs) I don't have it with me.

625
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,370
- Can I see your driver's license?

626
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,233
- Okay.

627
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:57,000
(sled zooms past)

628
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,230
Anthony Norgard.

629
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,380
Is this your current residence?

630
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,950
- Yeah.

631
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,157
- You know, you're supposed
to carry the license with you.

632
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:06,990
- Told ya.

633
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,010
- I could probably give out

634
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,660
over a thousand dollars worth of

635
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,140
tickets out here today, but

636
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,080
I'm in a good mood.

637
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,650
You come by with your license

638
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,260
around the DNR office on Monday.

639
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,910
I'll forget all about it.

640
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,310
- Oh thank you, you're a saint.

641
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,020
- But you're gonna have to quit fishing

642
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,853
in the meantime.

643
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:30,920
- Oh, come on.

644
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,500
- I could vouch for him, sir.

645
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,700
I know he has the license.

646
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,230
- It doesn't really matter.

647
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,750
No license, no fishing.

648
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,717
- No, can't I just finish out the day?

649
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:42,300
- Norgard, Norgard.

650
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,153
Is that your little red
Probe over by the boat ramp?

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,540
- It's my wife's actually.

652
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,440
Why?

653
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,920
- I just put a ticket on the windshield.

654
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,030
- Oh, come on.

655
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,980
- Parked illegally.

656
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,590
(Tony sighs)

657
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,840
Next time you go fishing,

658
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,740
bring your license.

659
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:09,719
- Well, there you go, ha.

660
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,353
(Pop speaks German)

661
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:16,634
- Hell, he's probably not
coming back here today.

662
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,490
There are 500 shanties out here.

663
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,841
- Yeah.

664
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:20,674
(door crashes)

665
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:21,884
- Oh, by the way,

666
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:23,020
I think you might wanna know,

667
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,460
there's a tow truck pulled up

668
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,450
next to your

669
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,610
little car.

670
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,929
- What?

671
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:28,762
(door clatters)

672
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:29,595
Oh!

673
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,030
I can't relax out here.

674
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,360
I'll see you later, Pop.

675
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,320
- Okay.

676
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,740
Oh wait, where's that drip
you with talking about?

677
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,670
- Oh, it's over there
on the shelf in a bag.

678
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,710
Help yourself.

679
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,543
- Thank you.

680
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:44,850
- Hey!

681
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,400
Untie it, untie it, what are you doing?

682
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,100
You're gunna rip that thing apart.

683
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,840
- That yours?

684
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,293
- It's my wife's.

685
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,930
- I heard that's the first car for women

686
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,173
designed by women.

687
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,423
- Really?

688
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,170
- Either you do it or I do it.

689
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,880
One way or another,

690
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,993
gotta come outta here.

691
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:16,646
(Tony sighs)

692
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,653
- All right.

693
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,733
Be gentle.

694
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,233
- You bet.

695
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:30,364
(rock music)

696
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:47,563

698
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,008

(door handle rattles)

700
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,036
- Shit.

701
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,353
(jaunty music)

702
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:05,356

704
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:12,529
(sighing)

705
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:13,362
Okay.

706
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:15,600
C'mon, ahh.

707
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,148
(device boings)

708
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:23,089
Oh, come on.

(voices chattering)

720
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,276
- [Lila] They look pretty different.

721
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:53,108
(voices chattering)

722
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:54,068
Yeah, okay.

(voices chattering)

724
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:55,734

(voices chattering)

726
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:57,746
Wait a minute.

727
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,188
(women laughing)

728
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,697
You know it should be.

729
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:03,868
(voices chattering)

730
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:06,368
Holy cow, d'ya think we could?

731
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,999
Yeah, but you had the
other special dish for it.

732
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,639
I'll look good on the table.

733
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,306

00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:59,912
(springy music)

746
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:22,924
(wheels rumbling)

747
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:26,417
(Tony sighs)

748
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:29,084
(birds singing)

749
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:41,205
(Tony sneezes)

750
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:42,852
(tires bursting)

751
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:45,235
(brakes screeching)

752
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:48,040
(air whooshing)

753
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,873
(traffic zooming)

754
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,442
(door clattering)

755
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,224
Oh.

756
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:08,100
(Tony sighs)

757
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,714
(Uptempo weird music)

758
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:28,923
(fly buzzing)

759
00:44:28,923 --> 00:44:31,590
(radio playing)

760
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:35,518
(hands clapping)
(bell ringing)

761
00:44:35,518 --> 00:44:36,535
- Damn files on me,

762
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:37,474
where they come from?

763
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,010
- Hey, Willaby, I need more minnows.

764
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,569
- Oh, you must be pulling 'em in.

765
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,219
- (laughs) We're doing all right.

766
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:48,261
(Tony sighs)

767
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:50,013
- Where's your bucket?

768
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:51,513
- Aw, I left it in the shanty.

769
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,280
- I keep these bags around.

770
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,290
How many?

771
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,640
- Two dozen ought to do it.

772
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:03,391
(laughing)

773
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:06,224
(water splashing)

774
00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:14,987
(Elvis singing on the radio)

775
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:20,441
- There you go.

776
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,200
Saw Lila a little while ago.

777
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,280
- What are you talking about?

778
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,540
- She was at the market.

779
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,760
I stepped out for some lunch,

780
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,000
bought a couple of those ham
and provolone croissants.

781
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I love those things.

782
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,120
- Did you talk to her?

783
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,560
- Just to say hi,

784
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,210
- You didn't tell her you saw me, did you?

785
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,040
- Actually I asked her where you were,

786
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,624
being Saturday and all.

787
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:39,745
(they laugh)

788
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:40,578
- You did not!

789
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:41,788
- Did so.

790
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:43,450
- What did she say?

791
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,593
- Said you were still
home in bed. (laughs)

792
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,660
Said she had to get
back to her mom's house.

793
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,493
(Tony laughs)

794
00:45:51,493 --> 00:45:52,904
Party an' all.

795
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:54,245
- Willaby, you got guts.

796
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:57,377
(Willaby laughs)

797
00:45:57,377 --> 00:45:58,717
- So, $2.50.

798
00:45:58,717 --> 00:45:59,717
- All right.

799
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:05,407
♪ There ain't nobody ♪

800
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,080
- Hey, some guys stopped
in a little while ago,

801
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,060
said they thought they'd hooked

802
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,520
a monster pike or something,

803
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,718
then that thing busted off.

804
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:15,720
- I thought they caught
that thing last year.

805
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,450
- Na, they said this one's bigger.

806
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,605
- Oh yeah, they all say that.

807
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:19,610
(Willaby laughing)

808
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,974
Hey, what time is it?

809
00:46:20,974 --> 00:46:22,360
- It's, er almost two.

810
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,610
- Oh well, I got some fish to catch.

811
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,396
Thanks Willaby.

812
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:29,563
(uptempo weird music)

813
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,818
God,

814
00:46:36,818 --> 00:46:37,651
shit.

815
00:46:38,654 --> 00:46:42,236
(car tires rumbling)

816
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:45,522
(Tony groaning)

817
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:48,105
(jaunty music)

818
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,520
(sleds zooming)

819
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:09,249
(weird music)

820
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,893
- Hey.

821
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,350
- Ah, got more minnows

822
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,733
and I found my license.

823
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:30,040
- (laughs) They're not biting on minnows.

824
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,183
- Oh yeah? What?

825
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,490
- Ha, they're turnin' up on
my light green sprinter jig.

826
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,350
Hell, I ran out of
minerals over an hour ago.

827
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,778
- Way to go, Pop.

828
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:41,462
(Pop laughing)

829
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:42,560
- Oh but it's starting to happen here.

830
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,713
Got another one, aha boy.

831
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:46,884
Hey, come on in, baby.

832
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:49,580
Hey, looka here, looka here, looka here.

833
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,664
(Pop laughing)

834
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,470
You know, old Stormy next door,

835
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,410
she caught a 28 inch walleye.

836
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,520
- Well, now that you
got the fish fired up,

837
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,220
they're gonna love these beauties.

838
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,500
- Na, na, na, na.

839
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,470
Here, here's the dead wood
of the future right here.

840
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,130
- Baa.

841
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,382
- Come on, sweetheart, there you go.

842
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:12,353
That's it.

843
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:17,486
Okay.

844
00:48:19,116 --> 00:48:23,616
(Pop sings nonsense words to himself)

845
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,034
- What are you doing?

846
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,180
- Ssh.

847
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,231
- Oh, for crying out loud.

848
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,564
(Pop continues singing)

849
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:50,761
(Pop laughing)

850
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,594
Oh Jeez.

851
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,275
- There you go.

852
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:56,858
(Pop laughing)

853
00:48:58,976 --> 00:48:59,809
- Wait.

854
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:05,884
- Got one!

855
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:11,443
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

856
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:13,287
Hold it, hold it.
- Holy crap,

857
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,270
these fish are too big
to pull through the hole.

858
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,470
Hand me that flashlight.

859
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:20,493
(groaning) Here, hold it.

860
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,066
- [Pop] What are you crazy?

861
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:26,899
Look at this.

862
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:28,470
Your minnow swam into my lure.

863
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,800
- That's not possible.

864
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,970
- What do you mean it's not possible?

865
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,956
Look at this, look at this.

866
00:49:33,956 --> 00:49:34,808
Look at this.
- All right,

867
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:35,930
so they're tangled.

868
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,546
Hand me that knife.

869
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:38,716
(Pop groans)

870
00:49:38,716 --> 00:49:39,573
- Here, hold onto that rod.

871
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:43,834
Now be careful down there.

872
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,417
- Okay.
- All right.

873
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:50,760
You see it?

874
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,284
- Yup.

875
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:53,676
- Ahh, boy.

876
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:54,509
- Got it.

877
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:03,347
Look.

878
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:06,800
There we go.

879
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,633
What?

880
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,090
- That was a $7 lure.

881
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,243
I bought it in Minnesota in 1969.

882
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:16,455
- Come on, Pop.

883
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:18,143
You got a tackle box full of those things.

884
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,453
- Not light green ones!

885
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,153
- Sorry, Pop.

886
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:26,340
(Pop sighs)

887
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,810
Oh, come don't just sit there.

888
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,090
Try another lure.

889
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,160
Use the middle, I got plenty.

890
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,993
Here.

891
00:50:34,222 --> 00:50:36,639
(Pop groans)

892
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:41,905
- Yeah, let me try.

893
00:50:45,597 --> 00:50:48,516
Yeah, I'll try this one.

894
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:49,816
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

895
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,453
There we go.

896
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,663
- [Pop] That's about as big

897
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:02,433
as the bait you're usin'. (laughs)

898
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:12,250
- Oh, okay, get back
in there little buddy.

899
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,333
Come on, go on, swim home to mommy.

900
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,200
Okay, time to swim home.

901
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,710
Come on little fish, you go home to mama.

902
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,890
Come-

903
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,744
(water gushing)
(Tony yelling)

904
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:25,560
Crap almighty, what was that?

905
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,830
Pop, did you see that?

906
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,418
- Ssh.
- Pop!

907
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,316
(Pop sings nonsense song)

908
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:35,676
Pop!

909
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,568
(someone shouting outside)

910
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:41,318
(doors slamming)

911
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,574
- Oh, son of a bitch!

912
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:47,680
- Stormy, are you all right?

913
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,327
What happened?

914
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:51,420
- (breathing heavily) I'm in my shanty,

915
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,890
I'm brushing away the ice from the hole

916
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,155
and all of a sudden this,

917
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,860
this, this thing comes up
and (makes gushing noises).

918
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,441
- He visited me too.

919
00:51:58,441 --> 00:51:59,610
- You saw it? You saw it?

920
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,820
- No, I didn't see him, but he went after

921
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,320
this little perch that I was throwing back

922
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,050
and splash, like hell,
look, I'm still all wet.

923
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:05,883
- Jeez.

924
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:07,758
God it hurts.

925
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:08,978
- Ooh.

926
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:10,490
(Stormy groans)

927
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,938
You need to see a doctor.

928
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:13,822
- (sighs) Good Lord, what was that?

929
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:14,655
It was like all teeth!

930
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:15,782
- I don't know.

931
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:16,615
It was like a pike or something.

932
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:17,448
It was very aggressive.

933
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:18,730
- Tell me!

934
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,660
- [Pop] Are you guys
gonna be quiet out there?

935
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,960
- He thinks that the
fish can hear us up here.

936
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:26,150
(Stormy sighing)

937
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,480
Hey Stormy wait, where are you going?

938
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,410
You gotta see a doctor.

939
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,510
- Screw that, I'm going
to catch that thing.

940
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,093
- Not if I catch it first.

941
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,853
- Ooh.

942
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,520
(door slamming)

943
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,283
- That is the perfect parking spot.

944
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,580
- These fish do not like yellow.

945
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,560
- The fish are colorblind, Pop.

946
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,420
- They weren't so colorblind when I had

947
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,470
my light green spinner jig

948
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,560
that I had since 1969.

949
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,142
(Tony sighing)

950
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,180
What are you after now?

951
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,550
- Oh, I'm going to
catch that monster pike.

952
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,328
You should've seen what it
did to Stormy's fingers.

953
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:09,176
Man.

954
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:11,000
- You know, it kind of reminds me

955
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,740
when I was canoeing down
south of here one time.

956
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,940
Ha, there was a little duck,

957
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,890
it must've been sleeping, you
know, going down to the river.

958
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,060
And then I followed along

959
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,336
and I came right up behind him, you know,

960
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:23,380
and I didn't want to scare him away.

961
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,420
So I'm goin' along, goin'
along, easy does it,

962
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,920
and then right up alongside of him

963
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,150
and I touched him with my paddle

964
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,830
and he was dead.

965
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,310
And I flipped 'im over

966
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,810
and the whole underside
had been bitten away,

967
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,360
probably some muskie or a pike.

968
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,480
- That's why I don't
go swimming over there.

969
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,023
- Oh, that's probably smart.

970
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,540
Well, I think I've had it for today

971
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:56,260
(groaning) if I can get
this thing outta here.

972
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,477
There we go.

973
00:53:57,477 --> 00:54:00,880
All right, that's enough of that.

974
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,160
Whoo, I got a whole mess load to clean.

975
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,928
Oh man, we're going to
have a meal tomorrow.

976
00:54:05,928 --> 00:54:07,170
(hands clapping)
(Pop laughing)

977
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,018
Wanna come over?

978
00:54:08,018 --> 00:54:08,870
- Oh yeah!

979
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,718
- Oh, no, no, you'll be sick though.

980
00:54:09,718 --> 00:54:10,551
- Oh, I might be better by then.

981
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,030
- Well, all right.

982
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,440
Hey, what time are you goin'?

983
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,640
- I don't know, let me
check the cell phone.

984
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,730
Quarter after three.

985
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:20,580
- Oh, I'm late, I'm late.

986
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,284
Give me a hand there will ya?

987
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:23,180
- Sure thing, Pop.

988
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,940
- Maybe you ought to come
with me to that party.

989
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,950
You know, there's going
to be all kinds of trouble

990
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,520
If Lila finds out that you were at,

991
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,720
out here all day.

992
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,600
Nobody's gonna know or care.

993
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,100
I attended tons of those things.

994
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,240
- Yeah?

995
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,722
Well it's going to be fun to
see you wiggle out of this one.

996
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,794
(Pop laughing)

997
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:44,552
Yeah, now we're all set.
- Right down,

998
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:45,385
there you go Pop.

999
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:46,510
- Okay.

1000
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,460
You sure you won't come, eh?

1001
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,360
I'd have to take Lila's car anyway

1002
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,990
and I gotta get that thing home.

1003
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,915
- Hey, when you get to be my age,

1004
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,480
you'll know which battles to pick.

1005
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,570
See ya later, sonny boy.

1006
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,670
- It was a good day, Pop.

1007
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,123
- All right. (laughs)

1008
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:06,119
(jaunty music)

1009
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,110
- Hey, guys.

1010
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:20,943
- Howdy.

1011
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,368
- Oh, hey.

1012
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:23,201
Have you guys run across

1013
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:25,073
the seriously big pike around here?

1014
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,100
- We have, why?

1015
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,657
- That thing almost ripped my
face off and it bit Stormy.

1016
00:55:32,657 --> 00:55:34,360
(equipment clatters)

1017
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,310
- It bit Stormy?

1018
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,143
Where's your shanty?

1019
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:37,976
- Right over there.

1020
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:39,710
- Mind if we join ya?

1021
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,110
- That thing's been on
our list for a long time.

1022
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,050
- Oh, that thing did that?

1023
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,430
- Last year, right out here.

1024
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,230
I figured either it had been caught,

1025
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,420
(can rattling)
or died off by now.

1026
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,550
- Well, if that's not him,
then it's his twin brother.

1027
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,383
- Sure you don't mind?

1028
00:56:00,383 --> 00:56:01,510
- Not at all, let's go.

1029
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,018
- C'mon.

1030
00:56:08,018 --> 00:56:10,601
(jaunty music)

1031
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,000
- Tell me about the pike.

1032
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,200
- I saw it right there.

1033
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,560
- What were you using for bait?

1034
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,780
- Minnows, but it went
after a small perch.

1035
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,613
- That's good.

1036
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:29,670
(Tony sighing)
(friend laughing)

1037
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,647
Check this out.

1038
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,723
(men laughing)

1039
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,470
- Oh, I've seen those in the catalogs.

1040
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,720
Does it work?

1041
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,183
- Surprisingly well.

1042
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:56,639
(men laughing)

1043
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,123
- Aw, that is so sweet!

1044
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,700
- Ah, that looked like a perch.

1045
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,210
- I'd love to see that thing.

1046
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,570
- The pike?

1047
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,100
- [Friend] Yup.

1048
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,453
- Oh man, what time is it?

1049
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,770
Four or five, okay.

1050
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,967
Can you guys be real quiet?

1051
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:22,120
(can slamming on the floor)

1052
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,539
Okay.

1053
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:26,730
(equipment clattering)

1054
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,753
Oh!

1055
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:30,053
(water splashing)
Crap, crap, crap!

1056
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,400
Oh man, I just got that thing.

1057
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,123
I knew I should have got
the insurance. (sighs)

1058
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,323
Do one of you guys have
a cell phone I can use?

1059
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,370
- Here, sure.

1060
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,203
Here.

1061
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,483
Don't drop it.

1062
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:51,917
- All right, shh.

1063
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,593
(man giggling)

1064
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,690
(coughing) All right, mom.

1065
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,560
Happy birthday.

1066
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,563
Oh, I wish I could be there.

1067
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,110
(coughing) Did Lila bake you a cake?

1068
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,393
Oh, that's great.

1069
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,238
Yeah, (coughs) oh, I'm
fine, I'm just resting.

1070
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:15,071
(friends start coughing)

1071
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,460
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,550
Oh, er Lila, no I just really-

1073
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,896
Hi Lila.

1074
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,800
(friends coughing)

1075
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,633
Yeah.

1076
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,473
Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:27,470
It sounds like mom's having
a great birthday party.

1078
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,303
Yeah.

1079
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,170
Did dad, did dad make it?

1080
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,003
No?

1081
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,630
I thought he was, nevermind.

1082
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,750
Well I should probably,

1083
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,370
what?

1084
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,203
Oh, the number?

1085
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,620
Oh, (coughing) I borrowed
a phone from a friend.

1086
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,650
He came over to visit.

1087
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,300
Sam, you remember Sam?

1088
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,133
What?

1089
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,733
Oh, really, what does it say?

1090
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,613
Alvin Thompson?

1091
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:56,088
Well, that's a friend of
Sam's, yeah. (coughing)

1092
00:58:56,088 --> 00:58:57,080
Well I actually probably let you go.

1093
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,150
I don't want to use up all
of Sam's, Al's minutes.

1094
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,552
So yeah.

1095
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:02,210
All right, I love you too.

1096
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,740
Bye.

1097
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,023
What, what, why the what?

1098
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,003
Oh great.

1099
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,203
Well, what time can I expect you?

1100
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,950
Oh, wonderful.

1101
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,783
Yeah.

1102
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:18,310
Hey, (coughs) could you
stop by on the way home

1103
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,110
and pick me up some of that
Mackinac Island fudge ice cream

1104
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,423
that I like so much?

1105
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,790
Oh, thanks. (coughing)

1106
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,690
Yeah, you too.

1107
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,220
Bye.

1108
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,673
Who's Alvin Thompson?

1109
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,353
- That's his uncle.

1110
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,570
- [Tony] Oh, hey.

1111
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,270
That's old man Woodgates' old snowmobile.

1112
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,791
- It's gotta be a classic.

1113
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:45,624
(they all laugh)

1114
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,913
- Oh, hey, there's my phone.

1115
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,930
Oh, I wonder if that thing still works.

1116
00:59:52,951 --> 00:59:54,864
(phone ringing)

1117
00:59:54,864 --> 00:59:57,113
(laughing) That's amazing.

1118
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:58,140
- [Friend] Wow.

1119
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,007
- What the ...

1120
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,333
(they all scream)

1121
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,166
Holy crap!

1122
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,980
That sucker ate my phone!

1123
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,880
- That fish had to be four feet long.

1124
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,713
- More like six.

1125
01:00:07,713 --> 01:00:08,670
- What was it?

1126
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,790
- I'd say it was the biggest pike

1127
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,030
this state has ever seen.

1128
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,523
- You think that's what's been
jumping up through the holes?

1129
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,573
- Maybe.

1130
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:19,520
(door bangs)

1131
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,510
- Come in.

1132
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,270
- What's going on in here?

1133
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,446
Where's your dad?

1134
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:24,346
- He had to leave.

1135
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:31,090
- Are you guys the Wolowskis?

1136
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,610
- He is, I'm Idelman, Sam Idelman.

1137
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,700
- Sam Idelman.

1138
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,620
Oh I'm sorry, I'm Stormy.

1139
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,060
It's,

1140
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,323
well, it's an honor to meet you both.

1141
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,730
You guys are legends around here.

1142
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,090
- You're the one that got bit by the fish?

1143
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,410
- How do you hear about that?

1144
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,703
- We've been talking about it.

1145
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,010
- That fish did that to you?

1146
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:11,843
- Last year.

1147
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,460
- We've got to get that thing.

1148
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,460
- That's what I say.

1149
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:23,183
- Whoa, what'd you got there?

1150
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:24,310
- Oh, I got that for Christmas.

1151
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,616
Pretty cool, isn't it?

1152
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:28,180
- (laughs) Yeah, Tony dropped
his cell phone down the hole.

1153
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,300
We got a great picture of it.

1154
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,920
Framed up perfectly.

1155
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,210
- And then that fish came
by and scooped it up,

1156
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,110
like it was a piece of meat.

1157
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,590
- Unbelievable.

1158
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,150
Wait, wait, actually that is unbelievable.

1159
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:39,983
- No, it's true.

1160
01:01:39,983 --> 01:01:41,900
- I saw it with my own eyes, Stormy.

1161
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,020
- We gotta get that thing.

1162
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,370
- How are we gonna do that?

1163
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,830
- I don't know exactly.

1164
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,070
- Well, listen, I only got an hour,

1165
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,200
so fellas let's get at it.

1166
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,333
- [Wolowski] Yeah, sure.

1167
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,593
Oh.

1168
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:58,262
(they all laugh)

1169
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,713
- They love the cheese.

1170
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:14,585
(snowmobile rumbling)

1171
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,980
- So the thing came over the hill

1172
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,830
and I could tell it was
frothing at the mouth.

1173
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,023
Threw down my riser, come on.

1174
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,820
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

1175
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,540
- I swear on my mother's grave.

1176
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,118
- Sh, well, what happened then?

1177
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,750
- Oh, I managed to get
it into a head lock.

1178
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,977
He wrestled around for a little while.

1179
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:40,876
- That was the eight pointer?

1180
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:42,353
- 10.

1181
01:02:42,353 --> 01:02:43,340
- Aww!

1182
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,890
- I'm not kidding, the thing
was enormous, it was huge.

1183
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,010
So finally used an old jujitsu move

1184
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,050
my dad taught me when I
was in the Marine Corps.

1185
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,363
Got it on my hip, flip the thing around.

1186
01:02:54,363 --> 01:02:56,710
Then my entire family all went around

1187
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,453
that magnificent beast.

1188
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,470
- How did I know that was exactly

1189
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,960
what you were going to say, yeah?

1190
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,987
- 'Cause it's true.

1191
01:03:03,987 --> 01:03:06,000
- Ha, ha, hey!

1192
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,910
Did Wendell here actually ever kill

1193
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,283
a ten point buck with his bare hands?

1194
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:13,030
(woman sighs)
- See.

1195
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,840
- That was no kind of an answer.

1196
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,450
- Oh, Oh, Oh then,

1197
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,697
14 point comes over the hill.

1198
01:03:18,697 --> 01:03:20,633
- Cut the bull stories, will ya!

1199
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,150
- Yeah all right, but someday

1200
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,653
you will ask me to tell you that story.

1201
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:25,773
- Ho, ho, sure.

1202
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,710
Hey, Stormy.

1203
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,543
- Hey, Frank.

1204
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:30,550
- Wanna beer?

1205
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:31,400
- Ah, sounds good.

1206
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,210
- Ah barkeep, one draft please.

1207
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,160
Hey, how's the finger?

1208
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,920
- Uh, I'll live.

1209
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,930
Thanks Dave.

1210
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,580
- Oh, I bet I know what happened.

1211
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:41,940
- No you don't.

1212
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,190
- Yeah, it was a fish, wasn't it?

1213
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,380
- How do you know?

1214
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,960
- Same thing happened to
me last weekend, look.

1215
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,793
- [Stormy] Oh!

1216
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,113
- What have we got?

1217
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:52,940
Some kind of Jaws out here?

1218
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,773
- I'm telling you what,

1219
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:55,040
people are talking about it.

1220
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,980
I saw Idelman and Wolowski
out at Tony's shanty.

1221
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,400
- I'm listening.

1222
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,150
- They saw it on their video thing.

1223
01:04:03,103 --> 01:04:05,600
- Well, you know, that Tony had something

1224
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,410
jump out of his fishing hole

1225
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,810
and, and I thought maybe

1226
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,430
it was a muskie or a pike or something.

1227
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,630
- Right, well they said,

1228
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,800
they said they saw it swallow Tony's phone

1229
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,240
after he dropped it in the lake.

1230
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,590
- Are you on the level?

1231
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,320
- Why would I make this up?

1232
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,553
They're out there trying
to catch it right now.

1233
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:22,893
- Yeah I hope they do.

1234
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,823
That fish is a nuisance.

1235
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,000
- Wendell?
- Mm?

1236
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,230
- I bet you could feed your entire family

1237
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,730
a whole winter on that magnificent beast.

1238
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,870
- Ooh, I don't know,

1239
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,620
that thing's been down
there an awful long time.

1240
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,440
I got a feeling it's pretty tough.

1241
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,980
- Ha, well, whoever brings
it in, if they bring it in,

1242
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,970
it's gonna be one big deal.

1243
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,262
That's for sure.

1244
01:04:44,262 --> 01:04:45,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1245
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,563
Hey, to the fish.

1246
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,703
- To the fish.

1247
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:51,804
- Arrr.

1248
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:52,880
- Och.
- Bare hands.

1249
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,025
- To the fish.

1250
01:04:54,025 --> 01:04:55,420
(glasses chink)
- Oh, oh good.

1251
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,190
- Why don't you believe,
you never believe-

1252
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,831
- No! Never!

1253
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:01,998
(gentle guitar music)

1254
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,840
- Oh crap, I gotta get out of here.

1255
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,673
What time is it?

1256
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:13,430
- 6:30.

1257
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:14,840
- All right, here.

1258
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,918
Sorry guys, shanty's closed.

1259
01:05:16,918 --> 01:05:19,263
- Come on, it's still early.

1260
01:05:21,177 --> 01:05:22,163
- Listen, if I don't get home right now,

1261
01:05:22,163 --> 01:05:23,640
(can splatters)
I'm in big trouble.

1262
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,473
Come on, you guys,

1263
01:05:24,473 --> 01:05:26,860
there's gotta be a
bazillion shanties out here.

1264
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,090
- Please, Tony, take it easy.

1265
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,533
We'll close it up for you.

1266
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,800
- Okay.

1267
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,160
Sam, put those minnows over by you.

1268
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,133
I'm gonna put 'em to good
use, hopefully tomorrow.

1269
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:41,903
- No problem.

1270
01:05:41,903 --> 01:05:43,403
We're using bigger stuff, anyway.

1271
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:47,890
- Oh, Let's see.

1272
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,403
- Good luck
- Thanks.

1273
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,401
(door banging)

1274
01:05:58,401 --> 01:05:59,824
(Sam sighing)

1275
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:02,407
(jaunty music)

1276
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:25,942
(sighs) What the?

1277
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:29,784
Oh,

1278
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,403
freaking comedians.

1279
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,193
Figures.

1280
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,380
- Hey, look who's here.
- Tony!

1281
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,660
- What are you doing here, Pop?

1282
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,930
You missed the party.

1283
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,750
- Is it that late already?

1284
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,830
- What's with all this,

1285
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,300
ooh can't wait to see how you're going to

1286
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,345
wiggle your way outta this one stuff.

1287
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:05,178
(they laugh)

1288
01:07:05,178 --> 01:07:08,070
- Salut. (laughing)

1289
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,890
- So, to what you're
hangin', did they catch it?

1290
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,700
- No, and they're not gunna, either.

1291
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,970
Idiots are fishing with cheese.

1292
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:14,803
Legends?

1293
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,683
- The man lost digits, Tony.

1294
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:20,493
- (laughs) Okay,

1295
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,423
so where's my car?

1296
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,750
- What are you talking about?

1297
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,570
- You know dang well
what I'm talking about,

1298
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,670
where is it, out back?

1299
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,180
- I never touched your car.

1300
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,260
- Oh, come on.

1301
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,180
You guys, this is really
funny and everything,

1302
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,690
but I gotta be back home by eight o'clock

1303
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,140
and that car has to go with me.

1304
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:37,973
Cough it up.

1305
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,360
- I haven't seen it since this morning

1306
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,370
when you parked it between those trees.

1307
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,690
Hey Tony, how'd you
manage to do that anyway?

1308
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,573
- C'mon guys, enough is enough.

1309
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:47,590
- Wait, wait, wait.

1310
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,610
You guys really don't
know anything about this?

1311
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:50,443
- [Pop] No.

1312
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:51,500
- Okay, I don't either.

1313
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,350
Where's the last place you parked it?

1314
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:00,951
(Stormy chuckles)

1315
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,926
- Where?

1316
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:03,876
I was sure it was right here someplace.

1317
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:07,188
Shanty's over there, this
was the perfect spot.

1318
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:08,992
(Pop sighing)

1319
01:08:08,992 --> 01:08:10,770
- Hey, didn't there used
to be a spring around here?

1320
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,263
- Oh God, somebody stole it.

1321
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,640
- No offense, Tony,

1322
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,170
but who around here is gunna want to steal

1323
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:18,910
your wife's Probe?

1324
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:22,223
Truck maybe, ATV, snowmobile, tricycle.

1325
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:24,304
(Pop laughs)

1326
01:08:24,304 --> 01:08:25,137
- Er, fellas.

1327
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,423
It wasn't stolen.

1328
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,838
- [Wendell] Looks like you're
pretty well screwed, Tony.

1329
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:38,171
(gentle rhythmic music)

1330
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,770
- Here's what we're gonna do.

1331
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:48,203
Somebody gets me home, right now.

1332
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,540
I lock the garage door.

1333
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,870
That way Lila can't park my truck inside.

1334
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:55,090
She won't know her car is missing.

1335
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,883
I'll get through tonight, somehow.

1336
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,410
Then tomorrow I'll have it hauled out,

1337
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,990
cleaned up and everything'll be fine.

1338
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,890
That car needed a little work, anyway.

1339
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,790
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

1340
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,500
My advice is go home and confess.

1341
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,993
Lila will get over it,

1342
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,160
someday. (laughs)

1343
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,820
- Your dad is right, I totally agree.

1344
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,770
- So you guys, I think
I can pull this off.

1345
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,990
All I gotta do is keep
Lila out of the house

1346
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,850
all day tomorrow while the car gets fixed.

1347
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,950
Come tomorrow night, everything is normal.

1348
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,290
- I'm not married like you, but

1349
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,400
my guess is that's a pretty terrible plan.

1350
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:40,680
(Tony's knees crash on the snow)

1351
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,513
- What?

1352
01:09:41,513 --> 01:09:43,469
- You guys are right.

1353
01:09:43,469 --> 01:09:47,000
(Stormy laughing)

1354
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,823
She has to forgive me, right?

1355
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,150
I got to feeling better, right?

1356
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,060
I had to go fishing, right?

1357
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,500
- [Pop] Right.

1358
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,430
- What was I supposed to do?

1359
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,330
Sit around all day?

1360
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,665
- [Pop] Of course not.
- [Stormy] No.

1361
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,783
- All right.

1362
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:03,616
(Wendell laughing)

1363
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,612
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

1364
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:07,522
(Pop laughs)

1365
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:09,189
She's gonna kill me.

1366
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:14,309
- You might've deserved this one.

1367
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:16,761
(people laughing)

1368
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:19,511
(dramatic music)

1369
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:26,023
- (sighs) I am so stupid.

1370
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,210
- Well, that's just something
she won't forget for a while,

1371
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,043
that's for sure.

1372
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:32,770
- Do you wanna come in with me?

1373
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,210
- Oh, you quivering little pup.

1374
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,030
Take it like a man.

1375
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,830
So okay, you made a couple of bad moves.

1376
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:42,150
Go in and say you're sorry
and get it over with.

1377
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,840
- Yeah, you're probably right.

1378
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,290
- Ah, besides it's not like it's

1379
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,168
coming out of left field, you know,

1380
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:49,268
you've made plenty of stupid moves before.

1381
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,383
- Gee, thanks Pop.

1382
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,110
- You're welcome.

1383
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:57,753
(jaunty music)

1384
01:11:06,906 --> 01:11:11,906
(Tony sighs)
(car door slams)

1385
01:11:15,823 --> 01:11:20,823
(garage door rattles)
(dog barking)

1386
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:29,913
- Hi, sweetie.

1387
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,350
- What did you do to my car?

1388
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,980
That thing's all beat to crap,

1389
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,020
smells like rotten eggs,

1390
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,400
what the hell happened?

1391
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,704
- I'm really sorry, Lila.

1392
01:11:39,704 --> 01:11:41,908
Did you have a nice time with your mom?

1393
01:11:41,908 --> 01:11:42,741
(hand whacks Tony's face)

1394
01:11:42,741 --> 01:11:43,574
- I am so mad at you.

1395
01:11:43,574 --> 01:11:45,608
You are gonna fix that
car, every last thing.

1396
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:47,448
What is the matter with you?

1397
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:49,198
You're just like him!

1398
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:52,210
Idiot! (growls)

1399
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:54,010
- Wait a second.

1400
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,500
How did you get the car back here?

1401
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,530
- I came home early,

1402
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,150
saw that my car was missing,

1403
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,963
you weren't around, two plus two.

1404
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,390
- So you went out to the lake?

1405
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:08,070
I drove your truck out to the lake,

1406
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,720
saw my car parked on the ice,

1407
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,154
traded back my sweet
little car and came home.

1408
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:14,443
I can't believe you did this.

1409
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,560
So why didn't you drive your truck home?

1410
01:12:22,519 --> 01:12:23,352
- Oh man.

1411
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,558
(Lila growls)

1412
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:36,070
- Okay mom, you're welcome.

1413
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:37,270
I love you too, bye.

1414
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,103
Happy birthday.

1415
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,810
Mom says stick it in your ear.

1416
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,280
- She did not.

1417
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,113
She should've.

1418
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,670
(Tony sighs)

1419
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,527
So what are you going to do?

1420
01:12:50,953 --> 01:12:53,620
- I don't think I can get a
wrecker out there till Monday.

1421
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,720
- Well, maybe you need a day off.

1422
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,553
- Very funny.

1423
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,673
Hey,

1424
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,320
why don't you let me
take you and your mom out

1425
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,640
to Sunday dinner tomorrow?

1426
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,440
They got that new
restaurant in Prudenville,

1427
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,650
it's supposed to be really nice.

1428
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,474
- That's a cheap shot.

1429
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:15,653
- Yeah, I know, but I'm just so sorry.

1430
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,180
I guess I thought maybe in some way

1431
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,533
this might help you and
your mom forgive me?

1432
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,343
- Whatever.

1433
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,203
- So I'll meet you around two?

1434
01:13:29,977 --> 01:13:30,827
- (giggles) Sure.

1435
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:33,670
(phone ringing)

1436
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,503
Hello?

1437
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,233
Sure, just a minute.

1438
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,520
It's the sheriff.

1439
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,820
He wants to talk with you.

1440
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,283
- Hello?

1441
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,963
Yeah.

1442
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,683
Oh, you're kidding me.

1443
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,800
Oh, no, don't worry.

1444
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,590
I'll have it out of
there by then for sure.

1445
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,423
Yeah, thanks.

1446
01:13:56,423 --> 01:13:58,020
Oh, hey, hey,

1447
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,160
you wouldn't happen to know somebody

1448
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,810
who could snag that
thing for me, would ya?

1449
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,450
Really?

1450
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,241
All right, hold on.

1451
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,991
(phone clatters)

1452
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:10,780
You there?

1453
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,613
Go ahead.

1454
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:14,844
7613.

1455
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,403
Alright, thanks.

1456
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,483
Yeah, I know.

1457
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,490
Hey look, I really
appreciate all your help.

1458
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,932
All right, bye.

1459
01:14:25,932 --> 01:14:28,599
(phone beeping)

1460
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:35,120
Hello?

1461
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,770
Yeah.

1462
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:40,243
I had my truck go through
the ice on Houghton Lake.

1463
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:45,110
Yeah, well it's a ways out
there, that's for sure.

1464
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,270
Yeah, but.

1465
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,103
Okay.

1466
01:14:49,103 --> 01:14:50,190
Do you think there's any way

1467
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,740
we could get that thing out tomorrow?

1468
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,190
Really?

1469
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,840
Oh no, that's great.

1470
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,420
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

1471
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,273
All right, bye.

1472
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,182
(Tony sighs)

1473
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:03,230
What do you suppose the odds of me

1474
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,343
borrowing your car tomorrow morning are?

1475
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,930
- After church?

1476
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:10,370
- Well, since the sheriff gave me 24 hours

1477
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,770
to somehow get that thing out of there,

1478
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,770
I kind of think I need all
the daylight I can get.

1479
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,320
- I agree with you on that one.

1480
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,120
I can get a ride to church, take it.

1481
01:15:20,003 --> 01:15:21,463
- You're the best.

1482
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:25,340
- So what's this little
rescue going to cost?

1483
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,120
- He didn't exactly say.

1484
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,021
- Sure you have time for a Sunday dinner?

1485
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:31,854
- Oh yeah.

1486
01:15:31,854 --> 01:15:32,730
No, I'll go over first thing.

1487
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:34,400
We'll have it out by noon, easy.

1488
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,530
- Okay, I'll call mom.

1489
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,710
- I'll meet you guys at the restaurant.

1490
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:39,543
- Whatever.

1491
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:45,483
- (sighs) What a day. (laughs)

1492
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,060
I'm beat.

1493
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,060
I'm gonna go to bed.

1494
01:15:51,466 --> 01:15:52,466
- Goodnight.

1495
01:16:03,704 --> 01:16:06,287
(spooky music)

1496
01:16:39,287 --> 01:16:42,120
(water splashing)

1497
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:47,242
(boards rattling)

1498
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:51,317
(exciting music)

1499
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,870
(crashing and banging)

1500
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:18,084
(water splashing)

1501
01:17:19,437 --> 01:17:22,020
(spooky music)

1502
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,720
- I sure do appreciate
you coming outta here

1503
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,430
on a Sunday an all.

1504
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:36,000
Have you pulled stuff
out of the lake before?

1505
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,013
- Couple of times.

1506
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,273
Hey,

1507
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,600
you that guy with a red Probe?

1508
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,333
- That's my wife's car.

1509
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,790
- Thought you looked familiar.

1510
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,870
- I still don't know how that thing

1511
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,040
got between those two trees.

1512
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,510
Somebody's messing with me.

1513
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:52,410
- Yeah, that was a tight fit for sure.

1514
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,130
- Well, it's right here.

1515
01:17:56,947 --> 01:17:59,114
(sighing)

1516
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:04,244
(rod splashing the water)

1517
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:13,476
(water splashing)

1518
01:18:13,476 --> 01:18:14,309
10,

1519
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:16,177
20,

1520
01:18:17,215 --> 01:18:19,067
30, there it is.

1521
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:20,970
Ah, it's down there.

1522
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,580
That's er, too deep for me,

1523
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,410
you might have to wait till spring.

1524
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:25,920
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

1525
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,270
The sheriff was very clear.

1526
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,922
He said I have to have
the truck out by today.

1527
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:31,410
- (laughs) Well I don't
see that happening.

1528
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,383
- Oh, come on.

1529
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,010
You look like a clever guy.

1530
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,287
How would you do it?

1531
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,960
- You're screwed.

1532
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,410
(Tony sighs)

1533
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:45,504
So listen, I got a lot of other stuff

1534
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:46,754
I need to be doing so er.

1535
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,860
- If you think of something,
will you give me a call?

1536
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,693
- Yeah, sure.

1537
01:18:54,574 --> 01:18:55,407
- Hey.

1538
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,521
(pole whacks on the snow)

1539
01:19:00,521 --> 01:19:03,688
(jaunty guitar music)

1540
01:19:08,782 --> 01:19:12,282
(snowmobile engine roars)

1541
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,127
(Stormy sighs)

1542
01:19:20,183 --> 01:19:21,870
- Did you hear the latest about the fish?

1543
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:22,703
- What now?

1544
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:25,610
- Something

1545
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:27,770
got into the shanties last night,

1546
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,510
ate up all the bait.

1547
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,410
- Are you serious?

1548
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,960
- No sign of entry.

1549
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,800
Even emptied out the lock hoops.

1550
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,430
- You know, I was thinking
about this last night.

1551
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,220
My grandpa used to tell a story like this.

1552
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,990
It's happened around here before.

1553
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:45,770
It turns out it was this big smart pike

1554
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:47,680
or maybe it was a muskie, I forget.

1555
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,543
- See, I've been here for years.

1556
01:19:49,543 --> 01:19:51,153
I've never heard anything
like it until last night.

1557
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:54,463
- [Both] Crazy.

1558
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,740
- So did you figure out
how to raise the Probe?

1559
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,783
Listen to this.

1560
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,930
Turns out Lila came out here last night

1561
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,193
and brought my truck and traded with me.

1562
01:20:10,049 --> 01:20:11,234
Yeah, that's right.

1563
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:13,320
That's my truck underneath the ice.

1564
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,033
- Holy, what are you gonna do?

1565
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,543
- Actually, I'm still working on that.

1566
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:21,404
- Hm.

1567
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,788
- Might as well go check out my shanty.

1568
01:20:24,788 --> 01:20:26,603
- Yeah. (laughs)

1569
01:20:26,603 --> 01:20:29,982
(rapid guitar music)

1570
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:32,732
(engine purring)

1571
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,671
- Hey, Stormy?

1572
01:20:49,671 --> 01:20:50,523
- Yeah.

1573
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:53,360
- I always wanted to ask you something.

1574
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,100
- What?

1575
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:58,554
- I don't know.

1576
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:04,283
I see ya out here all the time, alone.

1577
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,633
I've always wondered,

1578
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:11,263
do you have any family
around here or anything?

1579
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,150
- It's always just me and my dad.

1580
01:21:17,091 --> 01:21:18,213
You know, he worked for the railroad.

1581
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,543
He died when I was 14.

1582
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,960
He always used to take me fishing.

1583
01:21:31,129 --> 01:21:32,212
I don't know.

1584
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,913
Now I work at the ER, it's just crazy.

1585
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:40,803
(sighs) I like,

1586
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,123
I like the alone time.

1587
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,785
I like how simple it all is.

1588
01:21:48,785 --> 01:21:51,285
(brass music)

1589
01:21:55,063 --> 01:21:57,063
(sighs)

1590
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,560
And I like to watch the people.

1591
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:14,866
- Well er,

1592
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,090
I'm glad to know ya.

1593
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,986
- Glad to know you too, Norgard.

1594
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:37,149
(Tony laughs)

1595
01:22:38,235 --> 01:22:41,735
(melancholy string music)

1596
01:22:55,085 --> 01:22:57,515
(door clattering)

1597
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:58,348
- Oh.

1598
01:23:00,261 --> 01:23:01,428
- Holy smokes.

1599
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:06,398
Whoa.

1600
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,830
- This thing was full of minnows.

1601
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,103
- Crazy, huh?

1602
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:23,140
- (gasps) I'll bet it's that same

1603
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:26,247
son of a B that ate my cell phone.

1604
01:23:26,247 --> 01:23:27,620
(can clatters on the ground)

1605
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,923
- And tried to ruin my Frenchies.

1606
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,740
- So he's going from
coop to coop at night,

1607
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,953
stealing food.

1608
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:37,778
(Stormy sighs)

1609
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:42,730
Oh man, this jerky was the Cajun-flavored.

1610
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:45,030
He's got an appetite,
he cleaned me right out.

1611
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,463
You know,

1612
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,870
I swear I still had a pickled egg or two

1613
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:52,780
lying around here someplace.

1614
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,250
- I talk to everybody.

1615
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,483
It's the same story.

1616
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,773
He's eating everything in sight.

1617
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:01,906
(door clatters)
(they both gasp)

1618
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:02,910
- Hey!

1619
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,115
- What the?

1620
01:24:04,115 --> 01:24:06,728
- Oh, hey Pop.

1621
01:24:06,728 --> 01:24:09,380
(door clattering)

1622
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,213
Hey, look at this Pop,

1623
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:12,090
we had a bait burglar, cleaned me out.

1624
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,559
- Well, gentlemen, I have a fish to catch.

1625
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:18,483
- [Tony] (laughs) Hey, take care.

1626
01:24:18,483 --> 01:24:21,669
- Good luck, see ya Stormy. (laughs)

1627
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:24,143
Uh,

1628
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,670
You know, I'm kinda surprised
to see you out here today.

1629
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:30,440
- Oh, I had to meet the
guy with a tow truck.

1630
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,250
- Oh yeah, and?

1631
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,540
- He's no stinkin' help.

1632
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,130
He only likes the easy ones.

1633
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:35,980
- That's natural.

1634
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:40,430
Ha, so how's Lila taking all this.

1635
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:42,472
- Oh, she's cool.

1636
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:43,305
- [Pop] Yeah?

1637
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:44,180
- I'm taking her and her mother

1638
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,400
out to dinner this afternoon.

1639
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,090
Sorta make up for yesterday.

1640
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,060
- Ha, that's nice.

1641
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,680
It's a start anyway. (laughs)

1642
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,833
Hey, you mind if I use the shanty today?

1643
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,663
- Oh, go ahead.

1644
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:56,496
(Pop laughs)

1645
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:58,580
I can't stay out here long, anyway.

1646
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,940
I still got to figure out
a way to get that truck.

1647
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:01,773
- Okay.

1648
01:25:01,773 --> 01:25:03,780
- Well, let's see here.

1649
01:25:06,825 --> 01:25:09,000
So, what have you get there?

1650
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,963
- Ah, last night, I got to
thinking about that big pike.

1651
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,180
So I put the strongest line
I had over here, you know?

1652
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,762
And I said, right go
out there and catch him.

1653
01:25:18,762 --> 01:25:20,010
Well, I don't know.

1654
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:23,570
I had the, the odds
were against me in that,

1655
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:26,990
besides I like to fish for
the small fish anyway, so.

1656
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:27,840
- Well, you know,

1657
01:25:29,277 --> 01:25:31,200
I'm sort of leaning towards the big fella.

1658
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,530
- Ah
- Can we trade?

1659
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,537
- Nah, that's.

1660
01:25:33,537 --> 01:25:34,963
- Oh, come on Pop.

1661
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,090
- Well, okay, but listen,

1662
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:40,300
I found another one of these last night,

1663
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,433
so don't lose it.

1664
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:43,300
- **Don't worry, not with this stuff.

1665
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,683
It's like steel.

1666
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:48,767
- Er,

1667
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,740
you know, it sounds kind of crazy

1668
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,435
that there's something
in this lake that comes

1669
01:25:56,435 --> 01:25:58,970
jumping up out of these holes

1670
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,930
and thrashing around all these shanties,

1671
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,210
looking for things to eat,

1672
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,783
and then jumps down in that hole again.

1673
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,440
Sounds crazy.

1674
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,930
- [Tony] Nature's wonder.

1675
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:13,439
- Eh, hey, maybe it's a
big old mud puppy huh?

1676
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:15,089
- Do they still have mud puppies?

1677
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,833
- Ahh.

1678
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:24,226
(Pop grunts)

1679
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:29,677
Oh all right, get in there baby.

1680
01:26:29,677 --> 01:26:30,677
There we go.

1681
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:39,116
(Pop sings a nonsense song)

1682
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:55,801
(Tony joins in with the nonsense song)

1683
01:27:08,534 --> 01:27:11,263
(they both shout and cheer)

1684
01:27:11,263 --> 01:27:13,040
- Aww, mine got lost.

1685
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,061
There's something to this
system of yours though, Pop.

1686
01:27:16,061 --> 01:27:18,844
- Ah, ha ha.

1687
01:27:18,844 --> 01:27:19,677
Ha, ha.

1688
01:27:19,677 --> 01:27:21,130
- Hey and this line is thick,

1689
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:23,418
it hardly wants to stay on a reel.

1690
01:27:23,418 --> 01:27:26,483
- That's why I like the
small stuff. (laughs)

1691
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:31,480
(they both sing a nonsense song)

1692
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,040
You know, I remember the time,

1693
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,240
well Uncle Charlie and Verne, his buddy

1694
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:42,107
came down to do some fishin'. (laughs)

1695
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,480
And old Verne was a little bit too lazy

1696
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,104
to be cutting a big hole in the ice.

1697
01:27:48,104 --> 01:27:51,393
So he brought along a stick
a dynamite. (laughing)

1698
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:57,130
Well, it went over there
and he threw that dynamite

1699
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,140
just as far as he could throw it.

1700
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,500
But he forgot that Uncle Charlie

1701
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,370
had his big old black Labrador and like

1702
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:04,130
in the truck, you know.

1703
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,950
The dog saw that dynamite go, man,

1704
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,400
he said, "Hey that's a stick."

1705
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,270
Wham, he went after it. (laughs)

1706
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:12,040
And they just stood there and they could,

1707
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,100
could, "No, no, no, come back Erin."

1708
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,387
And the dog went over and got that,

1709
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:17,260
and started bringing it back.

1710
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,550
And he went right underneath the truck.

1711
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,040
Well these, you know,
they started running, man.

1712
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,873
They ran like a son of a gun, (laughing)

1713
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,777
and the dog started
chasing them, thinking,

1714
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:31,067
"You know, hey, after all,

1715
01:28:31,067 --> 01:28:32,680
"they're leave me behind, right?"

1716
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,017
And they're screaming and hollering,

1717
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,160
"No, no, no, no!"

1718
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,440
(Pop laughing)

1719
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:41,230
Just about that time
the dynamite went off.

1720
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:42,800
It was under the truck.

1721
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,820
Blew old Charlie's truck off

1722
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:48,440
to hell and gone. (laughs)

1723
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,218
- I've heard that story 100 times.

1724
01:28:51,218 --> 01:28:52,140
I still don't.
- Why did you

1725
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,780
have me say it then?

1726
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,222
- I still don't.
- Oh! Hey!

1727
01:28:55,222 --> 01:28:56,182
Hey, hey, hey.

1728
01:28:56,182 --> 01:28:57,547
Hey, wait a minute, I'll use the bucket.

1729
01:28:57,547 --> 01:28:59,732
Don't move, I've had practice.

1730
01:28:59,732 --> 01:29:01,020
- Ahh, holy crap!
- Put it down, now.

1731
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,911
- This thing, it's huge!
- Put it right down.

1732
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:03,744
Ease it, ease it,

1733
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,477
Put a drag on it.
- I'm trying, Pop!

1734
01:29:05,477 --> 01:29:06,683
- Yup, easy does it.

1735
01:29:06,683 --> 01:29:08,284
Don't let 'im take too much throw in.

1736
01:29:08,284 --> 01:29:09,190
He'll just pull it first.

1737
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,715
- I know, I know!

1738
01:29:10,715 --> 01:29:11,907
- Let me get this out
of the way over here.

1739
01:29:11,907 --> 01:29:14,013
All right, good, easy does it.

1740
01:29:14,013 --> 01:29:16,050
- Come on, come on, think I'm gettin' it.

1741
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,430
- Easy, easy baby, easy.

1742
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,760
Whoo, hoo.
(Tony grunting)

1743
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,327
No, no, no, that's right.

1744
01:29:21,327 --> 01:29:22,160
- Oh!
- No, No!

1745
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,258
There he is, there he is, keep it going.

1746
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:26,187
Oh, he's just playing possum.

1747
01:29:26,187 --> 01:29:28,730
(reel spinning)

1748
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,930
Don't let him take too much slack.

1749
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,590
He'll rip that, that whole reel off.

1750
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,900
- I'm tryin' Pop!

1751
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,170
- Okay, you're trying, at a boy.

1752
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,003
Keep goin'.

1753
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:36,836
- Come on.
- Keep it comin',

1754
01:29:36,836 --> 01:29:38,279
keep it comin'.

1755
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:40,262
Keep it coming at a boy.

1756
01:29:40,262 --> 01:29:41,434
(Tony sighing)

1757
01:29:41,434 --> 01:29:42,590
Come on, come on.

1758
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:43,423
Pull it in, baby.

1759
01:29:43,423 --> 01:29:44,256
- Get it, oh.

1760
01:29:44,256 --> 01:29:45,089
- C'mon.

1761
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:45,922
- No, he's off this time, Pop.

1762
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,780
- Oh, he's playin' possum, come on!

1763
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:50,520
- Oh God, that was a huge fish too.

1764
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,990
God it was some kind of record, maybe?

1765
01:29:52,990 --> 01:29:54,445
- I bet it's the same one that took my-

1766
01:29:54,445 --> 01:29:55,811
- What the hell?

1767
01:29:55,811 --> 01:30:00,811
(Pop shouting)
(Tony yelling)

1768
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,390
(Pop laughing)

1769
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:08,065
(fish growling)

1770
01:30:08,065 --> 01:30:09,612
- Stay with him, stay with him!

1771
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:10,445
Watch out.

1772
01:30:10,445 --> 01:30:11,278
Watch out, that's his bite.

1773
01:30:11,278 --> 01:30:12,986
Watch the teeth.

1774
01:30:12,986 --> 01:30:15,069
Watch out for his teeth.

1775
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:17,736
(Tony groaning)

1776
01:30:18,974 --> 01:30:20,461
Watch out, watch out.

1777
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:22,202
Let me take a picture.

1778
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:23,035
I can't see his face.

1779
01:30:23,035 --> 01:30:26,243
(fish whacks on the wall)
(Pop yelling)

1780
01:30:26,243 --> 01:30:27,410
Oh, beautiful.

1781
01:30:29,016 --> 01:30:30,296
(camera clicking)

1782
01:30:30,296 --> 01:30:31,129
I got it!

1783
01:30:32,404 --> 01:30:34,404
- Wait until Sam and Bruce see this!

1784
01:30:34,404 --> 01:30:36,654
It's the biggest pike I've ever seen.

1785
01:30:36,654 --> 01:30:38,512
- (laughing) It's a world record.

1786
01:30:38,512 --> 01:30:39,345
(they both laugh and whoop)

1787
01:30:39,345 --> 01:30:41,750
Oh boy, I got this.

1788
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,583
(phone ringing)

1789
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:43,416
Whoo!

1790
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,716
(both laughing)
(phone ringing)

1791
01:30:45,716 --> 01:30:49,356
Hey, I keep hearing a telephone ringing.

1792
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:51,050
- (laughing) It's mine.

1793
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:53,640
It's probably Lila, oh crap!

1794
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,890
What time is it?
(phone rings)

1795
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:55,900
- It's almost three o'clock.

1796
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,510
- Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.

1797
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:58,343
I gotta go, Pop.

1798
01:30:58,343 --> 01:30:59,748
Take the credit.

1799
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:00,581
- I don't want 'im, no.

1800
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:02,260
I won't clean that thing, no ways.

1801
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,869
- Please, I promised Lila.

1802
01:31:03,869 --> 01:31:05,619
- What the hell!
- No.

1803
01:31:06,496 --> 01:31:07,966
- The beast!

1804
01:31:07,966 --> 01:31:10,292
Tony, you caught the beast!

1805
01:31:10,292 --> 01:31:11,554
Holy crap!

1806
01:31:11,554 --> 01:31:13,609
- Stormy, Stormy, you
can have it, I gotta go.

1807
01:31:13,609 --> 01:31:14,442
- What?
- I gotta go.

1808
01:31:14,442 --> 01:31:15,773
I promised Lila I'd be there.

1809
01:31:15,773 --> 01:31:18,350
- I can't take him, Tony, it's yours.

1810
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,610
You were meant to catch it.

1811
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,020
- Hell, I didn't catch it.

1812
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,623
It jumped right into my lap.

1813
01:31:25,257 --> 01:31:28,674
(energetic string music)

1814
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:51,944
(car door clicks)

1815
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:09,940
(bell rings)

1816
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,773
- Can I help you?

1817
01:32:10,773 --> 01:32:11,606
- Hi, yeah.

1818
01:32:11,606 --> 01:32:13,000
I'm looking for two women
who were waiting for me,

1819
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,740
mother and daughter deal.

1820
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,860
- (huffs) You must be Tony.

1821
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,570
- Yeah, that's right.

1822
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,760
- Yeah, they just left.

1823
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,593
- What?

1824
01:32:19,593 --> 01:32:20,610
- Oh, you just missed 'em.

1825
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:21,443
- Oh great.

1826
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,350
You don't happen to know
which way they went, do ya?

1827
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:25,183
- Sorry.

1828
01:32:25,183 --> 01:32:26,156
- Thank you.

1829
01:32:29,874 --> 01:32:32,707
(energetic music)

1830
01:32:33,828 --> 01:32:36,578
(engine buzzing)

1831
01:32:42,019 --> 01:32:42,852
C'mon.

1832
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:50,736
(brakes screech)

1833
01:32:54,979 --> 01:32:58,277
(engine revs)

1834
01:32:58,277 --> 01:33:01,110
(energetic music)

1835
01:33:24,261 --> 01:33:26,678
(door slams)

1836
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:34,609
(gentle guitar music)

1837
01:33:38,067 --> 01:33:40,817
(door squeaking)

1838
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:55,403
Hey, baby.

1839
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,350
These are for you.

1840
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,920
- What?

1841
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,530
Do they explode or have the plague

1842
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,550
or are they infested with headlice, what?

1843
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:09,657
- Oh, come on, Lila just take 'em.

1844
01:34:16,357 --> 01:34:17,950
You are not gonna believe what happened

1845
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,922
out on the ice today.

1846
01:34:19,922 --> 01:34:21,270
- Oh.

1847
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:24,190
- I caught the fish, the
big one, the monster one.

1848
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:25,420
- That's great, Tony.

1849
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,430
So how's the truck project coming?

1850
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,933
- Forget about the truck.

1851
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:30,150
- That is not going to be that easy to do.

1852
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,723
- Well, it turns out that it's going to be

1853
01:34:31,723 --> 01:34:33,400
a little harder than I originally thought.

1854
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,910
- Isn't that a surprise?

1855
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,140
- I'll find someone to
get it out of there.

1856
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,990
Where's your mom?

1857
01:34:39,528 --> 01:34:40,393
- She's in the bathroom.

1858
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:45,883
- I am really, really,
really sorry about dinner.

1859
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:49,790
Did you have a nice time?

1860
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:53,100
- Yes, we did.

1861
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,990
- Well, how much was it?

1862
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:55,940
I wanna pay for it.

1863
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,373
- With the tip, it came to $40.

1864
01:34:59,799 --> 01:35:02,632
(notes crumpling)

1865
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,352
Actually it was $26.

1866
01:35:06,352 --> 01:35:07,973
I'll keep the change.

1867
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:13,410
- Hey, come on.

1868
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,040
You gotta see this fish.

1869
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,080
- You've got it here?

1870
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,360
- Oh yeah, it's outside.

1871
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,307
I bungee corded it to your car.

1872
01:35:19,307 --> 01:35:20,807
- Why should that surprise me?

1873
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:32,350
(tongue licking)

1874
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:33,640
- Hey!

1875
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,360
Get outta there!

1876
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,460
What do you think?

1877
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,330
- I think you've got
some work ahead of you.

1878
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,060
- Yeah, I know.

1879
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:43,639
I'll get that car back to
normal in no time, I promise.

1880
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:46,472
(toilet flushing)

1881
01:35:50,346 --> 01:35:53,013
(wind escaping)

1882
01:35:55,594 --> 01:35:56,427
Hi mom.

1883
01:35:56,427 --> 01:35:57,670
- Hey, Tony.

1884
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:01,120
Well, you've had a busy
weekend, haven't you?

1885
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,018
- Yeah, it's had its ups and downs.

1886
01:36:03,018 --> 01:36:06,020
(Mom laughs)

1887
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:06,863
How was dinner?

1888
01:36:07,993 --> 01:36:09,790
- Oh, we had a very nice time together.

1889
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:10,623
- Oh, that's great.

1890
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:11,913
Hey, check out the fish I got.

1891
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,210
I haven't measured it yet,

1892
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:17,233
but it's got to be a five footer.

1893
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,340
Might be a world record.

1894
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,680
- That's nice, Tony.

1895
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,653
Is it bleeding on my driveway?

1896
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,173
- No, I don't think so.

1897
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,905
- Who would've thought?

1898
01:36:30,905 --> 01:36:32,020
- It's pretty cool, huh?

1899
01:36:35,157 --> 01:36:35,990
(Tony sighs)

1900
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:38,320
- Did you get your truck back?

1901
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,010
No yet, mom.

1902
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:41,163
Still working on that.

1903
01:36:42,617 --> 01:36:45,200

1904
01:36:46,248 --> 01:36:49,094
(crowd cheering)

1905
01:36:49,094 --> 01:36:51,769
All right, the lake is now safe!

1906
01:36:51,769 --> 01:36:54,519

1909
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,417
Willaby!

1910
01:37:21,451 --> 01:37:22,284

1911
01:37:23,127 --> 01:37:24,825
(people shouting)

1912
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:26,325
- We're all right.

1913
01:37:29,947 --> 01:37:31,280
- Good one Tony.

1914
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:33,714
- Twenty.

1915
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:35,916

1917
01:37:51,844 --> 01:37:52,844
- Hey, Tony!

1918
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:59,313
That's my boy, you know. (laughs)

1919
01:37:59,313 --> 01:38:00,563
- You must be very proud.

1920
01:38:01,633 --> 01:38:03,923
- Hey, c'mon. (laughs)

1921
01:38:03,923 --> 01:38:04,756

1922
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:10,643

1948
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,790
- [Director] Okay, let me
see your face here, dubber.

1949
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,186

- Sassy thing.

1954
01:39:33,555 --> 01:39:35,808
- [Director] I don't see you anywhere.

1955
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,558

1959
01:39:45,089 --> 01:39:45,922
there's a couple of dead ones.

1960
01:39:45,922 --> 01:39:47,473
Can you get them?

1961
01:39:47,473 --> 01:39:48,319
Oh, they're all dead.

1962
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:49,184

1964
01:39:50,933 --> 01:39:52,280
