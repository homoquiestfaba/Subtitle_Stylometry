Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,512
Chew carefully, I'm missing an earring.

3
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:16,317
Eh, I'll roll the dice.

4
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,721
Hey, everybody.

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:20,924
I have some big news..

6
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,221
- I'm moving out.
- You're what?

7
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,550
What do you mean you're moving out?

8
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:26,299
I am moving in with Emmett.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,805
His parents promised him an
apartment when he turned 18.

10
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:32,375
They had a party for him, gave him a
cake and drove him to the new place.

11
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:35,616
All in like 20 minutes.

12
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,992
P.J., I'm not sure about this.

13
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,382
Mom, it totally makes sense.

14
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:42,452
I'm about to start Community College and
the apartment is right near campus.

15
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,007
That is a good point.

16
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:49,492
Blah blah blah. All I'm hearing
is that I'm getting my own room.

17
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:53,273
Let's get you packed. Come on.

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,073
Bob, are you sure PJ's
ready to live on his own?

19
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:02,254
Well, he is 18, honey.

20
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:09,294
Oh, it sounds like somebody's
experiencing empty-nest syndrome.

21
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:15,551
Well, the good news there is that
our nest is still very very full.

22
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:20,913
In fact, the challenge is to avoid
having any more little birdies.

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,413
It just went by so fast.

24
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:25,963
It seems like just yesterday
that P.J. was tripping

25
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:30,866
over his shoelaces and
we were wiping his nose.

26
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,627
It was yesterday.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,001
<i>Today's all burnt toast
running late and Dad jokes.</i>

28
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:43,262
<i>"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"</i>

29
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:44,829
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite.</i>

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,565
<i>Grab a ride, laugh out loud.</i>

31
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:50,049
<i>There it is up on the roof.</i>

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,942
<i>I've been there, I survived.</i>

33
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:56,183
<i>So just take my advice.</i>

34
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,848
<i>Hang in there, baby
things are crazy.</i>

35
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:02,681
<i>But I know your future's bright.</i>

36
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>Hang in there, baby
there's no maybe.</i>

37
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,854
<i>Everything turns out all right.</i>

38
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:11,244
<i>Sure life is up and down.</i>

39
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:15,140
<i>But trust me, it comes back around.</i>

40
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:19,821
<i>You're gonna love who
you turn out to be.</i>

41
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:23,234
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

42
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:32,747
- Oh, my Mom's here.
- Aw.

43
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,843
Hello, Teddy. Spence, you ready?

44
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:42,762
I left my coat downstairs.
I'll be right back.

45
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,780
Would you like to come in?

46
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:48,101
Oh no, that's okay. I'm fine, thanks.

47
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,295
So it's been awhile. How have you been?

48
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,259
I'm good. Thank you.

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,500
- And you?
- Good good.

50
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:10,124
So how about that weather?

51
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,450
It's like it's not too hot, not too cold.

52
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,917
- Temperate, you might say.
- Yes.

53
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,899
Temperate.

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,120
Temperate.

55
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,836
Oh, Spencer's back.. Yay!

56
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,612
Hey, it wasn't there.
I must have left it in the backyard.

57
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,370
- I'll just..
- No no.

58
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:34,698
You can get it next time. Out you go.

59
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,639
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

60
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,697
Temperate? What..?

61
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:52,616
Bob, would you take Toby upstairs
and put him down for his nap?

62
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:55,088
Uh.. Up.. Up.. Upstairs?

63
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,934
That's uh..

64
00:03:56,935 --> 00:04:00,380
It's kinda lonely up there, isn't it?

65
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:04,295
Would you take Toby upstairs
and put him down for his nap?

66
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,925
Hey, you know what?
Have him nap right here.

67
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,332
Bob, he's six weeks old.

68
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:13,193
Never too early to learn how to couch-nap.

69
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,630
Okay, fine. I will take him upstairs.

70
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:23,029
And you better get real
comfortable on that couch.

71
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:27,102
- What was that about?
- What?

72
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,770
Not wanting to take the baby upstairs.

73
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:30,916
I mean, that's lazy..

74
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,351
Even for you.

75
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:35,566
What? I just didn't feel like it.

76
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,952
That's all.

77
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:40,283
No, there's something going on with you.

78
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:43,068
Since when did you become
so interested in me?

79
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,429
Since the cable went out.

80
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,826
Man, this place is great.

81
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,554
We should really call
your Dad and thank him.

82
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:59,231
We can't. Part of the agreement about
the new apartment is that I never call.

83
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,533
This is so awesome.

84
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,786
We can eat whatever we want.

85
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,153
Stay up past our bedtime.

86
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,605
Dude, there is no bedtime!

87
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,527
Yay, we're adults now!

88
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,448
Yeah!

89
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:12,977
Dude, I'm gonna go check out the view.

90
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,676
Hey, look at this clown.

91
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,779
Oh, it's an actual clown.

92
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,148
You're not still afraid of clowns, are you?

93
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,949
No.

94
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,394
You know what the best part

95
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,550
- about this place is?
- Huh?

96
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,080
Our moms aren't around
to tell us what to do.

97
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,881
Ah.

98
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,611
It's your Mom.

99
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,339
Hi, guys! Brought you some lunch.

100
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,375
Lunch.. Awesome.

101
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,511
Except for we don't have any plates.

102
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,684
Or forks.

103
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:51,069
Hey, why don't you go see if
that clown next door has any?

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,648
I'm on it.

105
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,870
Sweetheart, that's not nice.

106
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,642
We don't call our neighbors clowns.

107
00:05:55,643 --> 00:06:00,863
Well, if I knew his
professional name I'd use it.

108
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,803
So what do you think of the place?

109
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:05,845
- It's nice!
- Yeah.

110
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,235
Yeah, it's a little small maybe.

111
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,566
Call it cozy.

112
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,856
Kinda drafty.

113
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:13,286
We call it inside breezy.

114
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,315
That's Emmett's bed and that's mine.

115
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,930
Oh, Emmett's a little messy, isn't he?

116
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,942
Yeah. Well, that's Emmett.

117
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,874
Honey, just because it's Emmett's apartment

118
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,774
doesn't mean you should let
him walk all over you.

119
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,489
If you don't like the mess, say something.

120
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,921
Mom, stop worrying, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

121
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,282
We're grown-ups now..

122
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:43,326
Ugh, it was just so awkward and
I kept saying "temperate".

123
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,530
And I never say temperate.

124
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,771
You just said it twice.

125
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,070
Does your Mom like me?

126
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,112
Hey, of course she likes you.

127
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,757
I mean, does your Mom like me?

128
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:59,699
Let's keep it on your Mom.

129
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,692
Hey Teddy, look, my Mom
likes you, all right?

130
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:04,852
That's just how she is.
You know, she's reserved.

131
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,058
Well, I want us to have
a good relationship.

132
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,454
So tell me some stuff about her.

133
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:12,152
Okay, um, what do you want to know?

134
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:15,132
I want to know who is Lynn Walsh?

135
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,337
What's her favorite color,
her favorite food?

136
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:21,527
Who would play her in
the movie of her life?

137
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,310
Do you know that stuff about your Mom?

138
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:27,451
Purple, lasagna and Reese Witherspoon.

139
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,819
Oh, um..

140
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,602
All right, well, there's
one thing I can tell you..

141
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,412
She likes orchids.

142
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:34,569
- Orchids.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,736
Good, okay. So what else?

144
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:41,219
Uh, oh, she likes going to this one
fancy place downtown for high tea.

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,460
Great. Okay, keep going.

146
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:47,531
That's all I got.

147
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:48,593
That's it?

148
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,822
Hey look, I think it's pretty
great I came up with that.

149
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,649
Okay, I just had an awesome idea.

150
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,866
I'm gonna take your Mom out to tea
and we're gonna talk about orchids..

151
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:03,027
And tea.

152
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,894
That's great.

153
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:09,155
I don't have to come to this, do I?

154
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,393
I just need you to watch
the baby for a sec..

155
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:21,434
Whoa!..

156
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,061
No!

157
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,157
No!

158
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,021
Oh ow!

159
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:33,882
Mmm.

160
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:43,644
Nobody tells Mom!

161
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,462
- What are we not telling Mom?
- What?

162
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:48,346
What?

163
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:51,331
Dude, you just yelled "nobody
tells Mom" in your sleep.

164
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:54,205
I mean I'm in, I just want to
know what we're not telling her.

165
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:55,776
No.

166
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:59,528
No, I was just dreaming about
that time I dropped Charlie.

167
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,329
Oh.

168
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,918
I remember that day.

169
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,759
That was a really good sandwich.

170
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,586
Now I'm worried I'm gonna
do the same thing to Toby.

171
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,087
I can't stop thinking about it.

172
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,719
So that's why you didn't want
to carry him up the stairs.

173
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,229
I don't want to carry him
down the stairs either.

174
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,361
- What are you gonna do, Dad?
- I don't know!

175
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,701
But I can't drop Toby like I did Charlie.

176
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:24,879
- You did what?
- I did wh.. Hey!

177
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,233
Hey hey, Sweetie.

178
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,311
No no no no, Daddy didn't drop you.

179
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:32,472
It was more.. It.. It..
It was more like a toss.

180
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:35,143
And then you flew a little!

181
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:37,239
Bad Daddy.

182
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,718
But Daddy caught you.

183
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:41,119
Lucky Daddy.

184
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:50,241
Thanks for buying plates and forks, Emmett.

185
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,722
Too bad we're having soup.

186
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:57,851
Hey, would you mind picking that up?

187
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:00,472
I will, just let me finish
my plate of soup first.

188
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,706
- It'll take one second.
- I don't have a second.

189
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:07,365
Soup gets cold really fast
when it's on a plate.

190
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,644
How long does it take to
pick up a piece of trash?

191
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,980
Okay, well, wait. What's your problem?

192
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,423
My problem is my roommate is a slob.

193
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,624
- I'm a slob?
- You're a slob.

194
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,717
- You take that back!
- I will not.

195
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,830
You know, I hate when you get like this.
I'm going to my room.

196
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:25,211
All right, well, I'm going to my room.

197
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,366
You better not be looking at me.

198
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:31,267
You better not be looking at me.

199
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,675
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

200
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,610
- No, you stop it! Turn around.
- You.. Okay.

201
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,592
You want something to look at?

202
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,813
Try this.

203
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,481
Ha! See, that doesn't bother me.

204
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:42,885
- Now you're the clown.
- No, you're the clown.

205
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,216
- You're the clown.
- You're the clown.

206
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,490
You don't think you're a clown?

207
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:46,506
- What me to prove that you're a clown?
- Fine!

208
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:49,327
Look at your bed!

209
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,927
Yes hi, um..

210
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:58,792
I'm just double-checking a
reservation for Duncan?

211
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:01,724
Yes yes, I know I called five minutes ago.

212
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,522
It's just..

213
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,289
It's a.. It's a very important reservation.

214
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,430
See, it's with my boyfriend's Mom..

215
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,752
Yes, the one who likes orchids.

216
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:17,626
Oh, okay, she's here.

217
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,009
Okay, I have to go. I'll..

218
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,610
I'll call you from the car.

219
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,211
- Hello!
- Hello.

220
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:28,992
- Come in, sit.
- Oh, love to.

221
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,436
You look lovely.

222
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,777
So do you.

223
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,995
- Shall we?
- Sure.

224
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:03,955
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, P.J. what are you doing here?

225
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,526
Oh, Emmett and I had a big fight.

226
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,067
Really?

227
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,750
That's terrible.

228
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,701
Oh, you know what? Gabe put a lock on your
bedroom door but I'll get the bolt cutters.

229
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:18,071
No, Mom, Mom, no! Mom, I'm not moving back.

230
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,712
We worked it out.

231
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:21,244
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

232
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,511
I got mad because he was
messing up the place.

233
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,988
He got mad because I got mad.
Then we got tired of being mad.

234
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:30,536
He agreed to stop being a slob
and we made chocolate toast.

235
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:33,840
Oh. Well, good for you,
standing up for yourself.

236
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,981
- Mmm.
- And I'm sure Emmett

237
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,985
will live up to his promise
of not being a slob.

238
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:41,420
I mean you know what they say.

239
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:44,061
"People change".

240
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:48,134
Or is it that people never change?

241
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:54,165
Doing great, big guy.

242
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,575
I don't know if I can do this.

243
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:01,556
- Just keep coming.
- No, my knees are wobbling.

244
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,684
Yes!

245
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,253
Okay, all right.

246
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,356
So you made it down with a
roast, a ham and a chicken.

247
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,426
You wanna try some side dishes?

248
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,267
I'm ready to carry a real kid.

249
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,683
What are you looking at?

250
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,693
- Hi.
- Hi!

251
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,494
Hi.

252
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,739
Okay uh, two questions..

253
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,431
Why are you carrying Gabe and..

254
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:41,394
Why does that chicken have a face?

255
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh, you know why?

256
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,341
We're playing a new game.

257
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,581
We're playing a new game called uh..

258
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,914
Chicken drop.

259
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:54,815
And he who drops the chicken must
carry the victor down the stairs.

260
00:13:56,153 --> 00:14:00,173
We're still working out the kinks.

261
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:09,780
- May I help you?
- Hi.

262
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:14,370
We have a reservation.
Duncan, party of two.

263
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:18,091
Sorry, I don't have you down.

264
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:20,891
What? But, um..

265
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:24,364
I confirmed the reservation
and then I reconfirmed..

266
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,087
And then I reconfirmed the reconfirm.

267
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:29,861
Which is basically just a long way
of saying that I put a lot of

268
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:35,762
work into this reservation so I
want my table and I want it now!

269
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:39,453
Oh, here it is, "Duncan".

270
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,928
Shall we?

271
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:51,794
So who are you again?

272
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:56,696
I'm the Window Inspector from the
Department of See-through Services.

273
00:14:56,697 --> 00:15:01,604
Okay, I've been a building manager for 25
years, and I have never heard of that.

274
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:05,221
Well, you're hearing about it now.

275
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:08,187
All right, let's see what we got here.

276
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:10,330
Oh yeah.

277
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:14,941
P87, single pane.. We see a lot of these.

278
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:17,618
Okay, for the final part of my inspection

279
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,537
I'm gonna need you to vacate the premises.

280
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:23,716
I can't do that. I take the security
of my building very seriously.

281
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:28,937
- I have a candy bar.
- Lock up when you're done.

282
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,252
P.J.!

283
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,172
Unbelievable!

284
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,573
He promised.

285
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,811
Oh!

286
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:25,634
Oh, so "the clown next door"
meant the clown next door.

287
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,702
So how's your tea?

288
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,720
Actually it's a little cold.

289
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:42,375
Well, I can fix that.

290
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,952
Um, excuse me, her tea is cold.

291
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,742
Could you get her a fresh cup?

292
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:51,243
And make sure it's hot, like piping hot.

293
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:56,578
I hear that you like orchids.

294
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,467
I used to and then my Mother passed away.

295
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,500
Orchids were her favorite too.

296
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:04,248
And now I can't even look
at one without crying.

297
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,649
Oh my gosh.

298
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,997
Are you okay?

299
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:12,658
Yes. Oh, my hand fell asleep.

300
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,855
Darn it.

301
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:21,219
Thank you.

302
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,699
- Ah ah!
- What, what's wrong?

303
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,739
I burned my tongue.

304
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,137
Ice ice! We need ice!

305
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:32,298
Ah, ice.

306
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,756
Is that helping?

307
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,097
I'm stuck.

308
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,808
You're what?

309
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,149
I'm stuck!

310
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:50,024
You're a duck? Could you sound it out?

311
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:54,755
How is everything over here?

312
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,168
Well, Mom, I'm moving back home.

313
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,773
Oh no.

314
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:10,554
It's such sad, unexpected news.

315
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,448
I came back home today and
the place was a mess.

316
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,927
What was it? Unmade bed?

317
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,041
Potato chips everywhere?

318
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:21,185
How do you know about the chips?

319
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,406
I don't.

320
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:28,162
Man. And after he promised me he
was going to keep the place clean.

321
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:29,630
I'm never talking to that guy again.

322
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,497
Hey, once you get over this, you
guys will be best friends again.

323
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:37,726
I don't think so. I mean, really I
could have dealt with the mess..

324
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:43,403
But he looked me right in the
eye and said he didn't do it.

325
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:46,580
Best friends don't lie to each other.

326
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,915
I'm gonna go put my stuff away.

327
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,316
P.J., wait.

328
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,480
Emmett didn't mess up your apartment.

329
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,819
I did.

330
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,740
What?

331
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,982
Why would you do that?

332
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:10,883
Because I thought you weren't
ready to live on your own. And..

333
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,089
The truth is..

334
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,099
I'm the one who's not ready.

335
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,858
But, Mom, I'm 18.

336
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,905
I'm an adult now.

337
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:23,746
But you're still my little boy.

338
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:27,698
You'll always be my little boy.

339
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,215
You're a good Mom.

340
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,304
I know.

341
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:41,128
A good Mom who broke into my
apartment and trashed it.

342
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,229
I know.

343
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,647
How you feeling, Dad?

344
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,928
Good good.

345
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:58,719
- Yeah!
- Yes, I did it!

346
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,333
- I did it!
- Nice! What were you so worried about?

347
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,934
I don't know. It was a piece of cake.

348
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,759
- Where are you going?
- To get a piece of cake.

349
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,417
A guy's gotta celebrate.

350
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,516
Oh hey, thank you..

351
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:15,497
So much for getting me through this.
You real..

352
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,465
No!

353
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,377
No!

354
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,765
Hey, honey..

355
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,386
You dropped the baby
again, didn't you, Bob?

356
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:50,307
What?

357
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,922
Well, Charlie, um, I went
to tea with Spencer's Mom.

358
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,167
And we had so much fun..

359
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,496
We decided to keep that party going..

360
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,617
In the emergency room.

361
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,418
Yeah, I don't think Mrs.
Walsh will be talking to me anytime soon.

362
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,939
Or to anyone.

363
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,372
What..

364
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:19,960
Dad, what are you doing?

365
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,670
Taking Toby for a walk.

366
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:25,892
That doesn't really look like a walk.

367
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:28,217
No, it will be eventually.

368
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:32,418
Well, don't you need the diaper bag?

369
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,933
Aw, man!

370
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:44,812
Well, you survived him for three
years, all you need is 15 more.

371
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:47,693
Good luck, Charlie.

372
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,576
Hi, Bob Duncan here with
another amazing product

373
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:55,268
that is going to make your life easier.

374
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,829
You have stairs, do you have a baby?

375
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,128
Well, how many times has
this happened to you?

376
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,049
Whoa!

377
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,229
Well, those days are gone.

378
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,734
Because the next time
your baby goes flying,

379
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:13,306
he won't end up crying, thanks
to the new ultra-cute..

380
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,647
Baby Chute!

381
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,002
That's right!

382
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:22,049
Your home is going to be
more safe and more fun!

383
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,166
And if you act now, we will
also throw in the ultra-cute..

Woo!

386
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:35,094
So what are you waiting for?
Pick up that phone and call.

387
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,486
