1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,274
You have called for me, Zeus.

2
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,036
Lang, we have some
troubling business to attend to.

3
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,795
You are the most powerful warrior
under my leadership.

4
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,316
But / altered another man before you:
Kan Fung.

5
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,358
He underwent the same
genetic modifications as you...

6
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,876
...but unfortunately, he has escaped.

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,353
Where?

8
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,039
/'ve been tracking him
through several countries.

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,911
He's searching for a geneticist to control
the mutating seed / implanted in him.

10
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,757
This is a list of the scientists
you must terminate...

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,673
...before he can contact them.

12
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,079
Interesting.

13
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,353
You and Kan Fung are the
greatest mercenaries ever created.

14
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,479
But Kan Fung has decided to use
his powers for the good of others.

15
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,555
He has become a mask ed vigilante.
Bring him back to me.

16
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,951
Alive.

17
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,799
Same results again? My God...

18
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,833
God had nothing to do with this.

19
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,993
Doctor Ichien.

20
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,798
Who are you?

21
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,959
Ten days ago you received a blood sample.

22
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,590
It's yours?

23
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,192
Why?

24
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,435
I don't trust anyone who wears a mask.

25
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,993
Especially after this...

26
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,957
Four geneticists killed in different countries.

27
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,595
Why did you do it?

28
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,916
These scientists were killed
before I even got to them.

29
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,318
My enemies have a list
of genetic engineers like you.

30
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,871
So they are after me now?

31
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,797
Don't kill me!

32
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,032
- Where's your car?
- Behind the building.

33
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,236
I'll take care of them.
Get out of here.

34
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,717
Here! Quick!

35
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,433
Here! Quick!

36
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,918
Let him go.

37
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,548
He doesn't know anything.

38
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,156
Damn you!

39
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,833
Don't blame me, Kan. You killed him.

40
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,276
If you hadn't been here,
I wouldn't have shot him.

41
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,592
Which would have kept our overhead
down. One less bullet.

42
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,758
You're one of us, Kan! You can run,
but you'll always be one of us!

43
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,672
You're mine!

44
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,035
Ungrateful shit.

45
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,475
B City

46
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,957
12: 12 p.m. Irradiated host cells
have entered stage 5 mutation.

47
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,869
12: 17 p.m. Introducing mutagen
suppressor 154 into cell environment.

48
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,240
12:21 p.m. Structure
of host cells compromised.

49
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,874
Suppressor G-154 is a failure.

50
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,510
What?

51
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,035
Parcel for Dr. Leung.

52
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,312
I think this is for you.
There's no return address, but...

53
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,472
Listen...

54
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,510
I know you've been working
very hard lately, and...

55
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,911
Why don't we go out and relax?

56
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,834
Let's have lunch together?
What do you say?

57
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,150
Come on. Make an exception.
Just once?

58
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,316
Are you happy now?

59
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,913
I thought it wouldn't happen
every time...

60
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,311
Yeah, yeah. Well, now you know.

61
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,758
Why is this blood evaporating?
It's boiling!

62
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,758
That's impossible.

63
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,559
Must be some chemical
reaction with the air.

64
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,235
Phosphorus does that. Not blood.

65
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,677
Maybe it's not blood, then.

66
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,311
Hey, listen, look.
I'm really sorry about all this.

67
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,633
Think you can give me another chance?
Just a tiny little one?

68
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,189
- On one condition.
- Anything.

69
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,636
Disappear.
Think you can do that?

70
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,313
Forever?

71
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,268
Just for 24 hours.
So I can get some work done.

72
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,197
Fair enough.

73
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,279
Marco Leung.

74
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,112
Are you alone?

75
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,397
- Excuse me?
- Are you alone?

76
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,551
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

77
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,319
Bye.

78
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,393
B City is red hot, as wrestling fans
have gathered at the Dome...

79
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,394
Fans have been fighting to get
tick ets for what is sure to be...

80
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,233
...the most sensational
wrestling show of the year.

81
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,311
Good evening,
wrestling fans!

82
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,759
Tonight, the Super World Championship
Wrestling Federation presents:

83
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,196
Smashmouth 2002!

84
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,875
The greatest event
of this and any millennium!

85
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,157
That's right, wrestling fans,
you are about to witness...

86
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,075
...the future of pro wrestling.
A new kind of warrior for a new age.

87
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
Faster, stronger
and badder than anything...

88
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,715
...you've ever seen
kick ass in this ring before.

89
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,758
How's my little Iguana, baby?

90
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,394
I'm so hot I'm on fire.

91
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,872
Make it last long.

92
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,715
All the hardcore fans
are here to see you beat Hellraiser.

93
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,394
I'm gonna give them all I got.

94
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,516
Sexy.

95
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,951
Get a room.

96
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,958
Okay, people.

97
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,239
Are you ready to tumble?

98
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,552
What kind of half-ass
bullshit is that?

99
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,359
I've got 25,000 people out there!

100
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,160
That is.0025 percent...

101
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,630
...of the biggest market
in the goddamn world!

102
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,392
Baby, that's better.
That's what I want.

103
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
I want you to make them go nuts.

104
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,508
I want the girls to whisper
your names when they get laid.

105
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,118
I want the guys to stick your names
on bumper stickers all over the world.

106
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,317
I want you to show them
what wrestling is all about!

107
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,552
I want you to show them who you are!

108
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,711
Now, who are you?

109
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,914
Wolf.

110
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,479
Wolf.

111
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,918
- Snake
- Snak e.

112
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,270
Claw.

113
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,829
Chameleon.

114
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,755
Iguana.

115
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,956
/guana.

116
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,598
Dad!

117
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,194
Hey, there's my little hero.

118
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,960
What's up? How's it going?

119
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,270
I'm okay. You okay?

120
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,432
I'm in great shape.
It's gonna be a great show.

121
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,751
...tonight with
the baddest of the bad, Hellraiser...

122
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,435
...king of the dead!

123
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,116
Dad, are they ever gonna
let you be a good guy again?

124
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,508
Good guy?

125
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,877
Why would I want to be a good guy?
Good guys are boring.

126
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,110
Come on, do you think all those people
up there came to see the good guy?

127
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,716
They came to see the bad guy.
They came to see me.

128
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,036
Last ride powerbomb!

129
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,432
So let's give it up for the new
golden boy of wrestling...

130
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,752
...the master of pain himself,
the Iguana!

131
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,671
Iguana! Iguana! Iguana!
Iguana! Iguana!

132
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,715
They're calling my name!

133
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,673
Hey, Ross.
I've had a change in plans.

134
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,116
- I'm gonna let you win, put you over.
- Are you kidding?

135
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,919
Is this a new script
from King or something?

136
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,435
Honestly, I have no...

137
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,357
Really, Ross. I'm gonna put you over.

138
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,435
We'll do it just like in Tokyo.
You give me some heat first.

139
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,511
And then, instead of my...

140
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,394
They're calling my name.

141
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,830
They're calling my name.

142
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,233
They're calling my name.

143
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,470
Oh, my God!
Did you see that?

144
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,153
...reporting from the stadium.

145
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,313
One wrestler has gone mad and
is rampaging through the aisles.

146
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,630
Police are on their way.
Our crew outside...

147
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,393
The creature is reaching
the outskirts of the stadium.

148
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,109
- I could never stand you guys.
- Mr. Martinez, could you...?

149
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,918
Flash! Flash! Flash!

150
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,828
You want a nice close-up?

151
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,229
Father for lunch...

152
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,072
...son for dinner.

153
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,671
Leave my father alone!

154
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,639
- Freeze!
- Guns down!

155
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,398
Guns down, there's a kid up there.

156
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,710
Most of the crowd has fled...

157
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,475
...Iguana has seriously injured
one wrestler and bystanders.

158
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,509
...doing the impossible, he is scaling
the outside wall with his hands alone.

159
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,879
Dan, no!

160
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,678
Let him go!

161
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,193
He's our friend, Dan!

162
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,799
Want a hostage?

163
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,111
Take me! Let the kid go.

164
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,711
There are two now
at the top of the building.

165
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,793
There are two people going to the side.
One is Iguana, the famous wrestler.

166
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,236
He is fighting with another man.
Who is he fighting with?

167
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,154
Another amazing twist, as an unknown
costumed man enters the scene.

168
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,871
...enters to fight the monster. But who
is the man behind the black mask?

169
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,437
- Grab her!
- Go! Go!

170
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,472
Climb!

171
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,073
Climb up!

172
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,996
We don't have to do this.

173
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,549
Maybe I can help you.

174
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,953
I am not a monster.

175
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,279
No.

176
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,190
What was that? Part of the show?
Who's next? Me?

177
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,318
You told us we would
be able to control the change.

178
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,629
- You lied!
- No, l...

179
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,633
Excuse me, boys.

180
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,472
I swear I didn't...

181
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,113
Oh, God! God!

182
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,110
I swear I didn't lie.
I just told you...

183
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,669
What I told him to tell you.

184
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,517
Mr. King is on a need-to-know basis.
And he almost never needs to know.

185
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,716
You have questions, come to me.

186
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,874
You're venting your anger
at the wrong man, Chameleon.

187
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,951
Mr. King didn't kill Iguana.
The masked man did it.

188
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,436
Dan is dead, Moloch,
because of your little tricks.

189
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,470
There was never supposed
to be a full transformation.

190
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,198
I understand how you feel.

191
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,354
But haven't I always told you emotional
control is what this thing is about?

192
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,674
Iguana never followed my instructions.

193
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,877
Now, he would have made a full
recovery if he'd had the chance.

194
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,352
But the masked man took that
chance away. And I promise you...

195
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,717
...that we will get revenge.

196
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,238
Now, if anyone's scared,
you can leave.

197
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,356
No hard feelings.

198
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,513
Mr. King would like to let you know
what you'll be missing out on.

199
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,838
Yes.

200
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,469
After tonight's tragedy,
our insurance people were horrified...

201
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,518
...but our investors see potential.

202
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,629
A potential windfall,
which would put another million...

203
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,439
...into each of your bank accounts.

204
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,431
What do you say?

205
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,715
That works for me.

206
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,352
Is this our way out?

207
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,355
Let's just hope this
don't lead to a dead end.

208
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,556
You make me puke, King.

209
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,909
Give her time, King.

210
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,589
Nurse Logan, line two.
Nurse Logan, line two.

211
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,150
Dad, watch out!

212
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,958
He's behind you.

213
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,998
Move! Hurry! No!

214
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,595
Here's our little hero.

215
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,193
Dr. Marco Leung?

216
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,753
Poor kid.

217
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,950
Fortunately, he'll make it. I ran some
blood tests. The results were negative.

218
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,953
There's nothing wrong
with his blood.

219
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,314
- What are you checking for?
- Genetic modifications.

220
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,153
Like the wrestler who died.

221
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,830
Do you have a fever?

222
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,355
Maybe you should see a specialist.

223
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
Yeah, I'm looking for one now.

224
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,358
Marco?

225
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,400
- They're waiting for us downstairs.
- Yes.

226
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,076
Let's go.

227
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,036
I'm asking you to dinner.
I'm not asking you to sleep with me.

228
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,553
It's not the '90s.

229
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,316
If it's the '90s or the post-millennium,
this is not happening.

230
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,873
His real name is Daniel Martinez.
Better known as the Iguana.

231
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,117
Huge man.

232
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,874
Well, you haven't seen nothing yet.

233
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,918
Hey, this is a hospital!

234
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,510
We're only talking dinner.

235
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,753
You know what my answer was, is
and always will be.

236
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,672
Look, I know you've got this thing.

237
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,229
You can't stand being touched by men.

238
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,789
Okay, okay, he's dead, but...

239
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,838
Well, that's easy.
All you have to do...

240
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,629
...when you're going out with me,
is pretend that I'm dead.

241
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,032
After five minutes of conversation
I wouldn't have to pretend.

242
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,153
We want our property back.
Give it to me!

243
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,598
Thanks.
Now I'm gonna have fun with you.

244
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,592
Oh, my God, inspector!
They're fighting inside.

245
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,550
I sent you the blood sample.

246
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,076
- Don't...
- No, listen to me. I need your help.

247
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,912
Doctor?

248
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,272
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

249
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,752
Her first patient
out of medical school died...

250
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,229
...while she was giving him
an injection.

251
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,190
The patient grabbed her hand and
didn't let go. That's what happened.

252
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,512
She's got this thing about men
touching her. A phobia.

253
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,195
Therapy for 6 months, and still.

254
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,191
- Questions?
- No.

255
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,431
- Should have a specialist look at that.
- / am looking for one now.

256
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,273
/ sent you the blood sample.

257
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,198
Are you sure you got
the right sample from the doctor?

258
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,271
Positive.

259
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,831
This blood shows genetic abnormalities,
but it's not Iguana's blood.

260
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,236
Someone else out there. Someone
with more advanced technology.

261
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,153
Someone who could be
very useful to us.

262
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,834
Why would you need anyone else?

263
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,672
If my animal DNA strains are injected
into the bloodstream of this individual...

264
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,990
...and successfully form a hybrid...

265
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,553
...then the problems that your friends
have been having can be taken care of.

266
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,314
They're not like you, Thorn. They
need more energy to reach phase two.

267
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,354
That is the solution.

268
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,399
Trouble?

269
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,677
- Don't you ever knock?
- Sorry.

270
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,196
I said no! No camera in my bedroom
or in my bathroom!

271
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,475
- But...
- I said no!

272
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,156
I know this is for my protection, but
this is going way beyond my limits.

273
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,919
I can't concentrate! I'm gonna
go home, take a shower and relax.

274
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,870
Are you a fan?

275
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,073
He's my dad. He might be
in the hospital, but he's the greatest.

276
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,073
Well, I think he's pretty great too.

277
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,559
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

278
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,955
You know, good guy, bad guy.
It's just a game.

279
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,193
Why does everyone treat us like dirt?

280
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,191
Are you hungry?

281
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,118
Are you Black Mask?

282
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,391
- Who is he?
- He saved my life...

283
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,358
...but I never got a chance
to thank him.

284
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,436
- I have a feeling I'll run into him again.
- Means you'll be in trouble again.

285
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,511
Look, thanks for the food, but
I need to get back to the hospital.

286
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,272
Okay.

287
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,956
I'll take you.

288
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,916
Thanks, but we have to stop here.
I have to sneak in.

289
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,071
Well, where are you gonna sleep?

290
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,391
Don't worry about me.
I'll take care of myself.

291
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,558
All right, but just in case,
take your backpack.

292
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,188
I'm sure your dad
left something for you.

293
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,869
The Black Avenger.

294
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,792
Why don't you use " Black Mask"?
That's what the press nicknamed him.

295
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,551
There's a problem.

296
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,713
These nutball superhero wannabes,
they all have hideouts.

297
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,318
Like the " Mask Cave" or something.
So we got to find him.

298
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,917
You're not gonna have any trouble
finding him. He wears a mask.

299
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,914
Who knows who Black Mask is?
We can have as many as we like.

300
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,116
Name doesn't belong to him.

301
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,308
He tries to use it, we got it
copyrighted. We sue him.

302
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,998
Sue him? Then we say
ours is the real thing.

303
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,635
And if he does not win next week's
steel cage death match...

304
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,634
...then my name is not the King!
And remember, kids:

305
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,791
We got toys coming your way.

306
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,317
We got the Black Mask car,
the Black Mask action figure...

307
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,076
...we got the Black Mask winter outfit!
Black Mask!

308
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,628
Take off the mask.

309
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,435
That's what you look like?

310
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,790
Take off the mask.

311
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,275
And sign here.

312
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,195
- I seek an audience with "The King."
- Call my secretary.

313
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,232
Okay, what do you want?

314
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,109
I want my own personal trainer
and my own dressing room.

315
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,233
"The Black Mask.
Star of the S.W.C.W."

316
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,399
How's that sound?

317
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,472
What do you say?

318
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,599
Let me up! Let me up!

319
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,593
Iguana. What did you do to him?

320
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,150
It was Moloch! He used drugs!

321
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,393
He spliced reptile DNA with human DNA.

322
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,630
Just like the others.

323
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,270
- Others?
- Chameleon, the Claw...

324
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,113
Others. The others!

325
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,430
Who is this Moloch?

326
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,678
Let me up. I'll tell you, I swear!
Please! Please!

327
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,874
Now, who is Moloch?

328
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,156
I don't know!

329
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,795
He came to me three years ago...

330
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,270
...when I was managing
a women's mud wrestling...

331
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,676
You're mine.

332
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,511
The drug's working.

333
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,750
Get him!

334
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,471
He got away.

335
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,318
Don't worry. He's one of us now.

336
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,916
Three high-speed cables for the electronic
microscope. Do we have them?

337
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,429
Area 57, clear.

338
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,796
Everyone spread out!
He's around here somewhere!

339
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,555
You doing this!

340
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,070
Okay, you're seeing things again.

341
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,471
Doctor! I need your help!

342
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,957
This man from
the wrestling federation, Moloch.

343
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,477
The one who turned the wrestlers into
hybrids. He did the same to me.

344
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,469
I need your help to find a cure.
Now more than ever.

345
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,993
What should I do?

346
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,797
Marco, look out!

347
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,473
If you don't respond by "three,"
we're coming in!

348
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,119
One, two, three!

349
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,358
- You okay?
- Yeah.

350
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,511
Okay, it's okay. Let's go!

351
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,072
Okay, heads I tell them, tails I don't.

352
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,279
Heads!

353
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,630
- Inspector?
- Yes?

354
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,398
Forget it.

355
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,118
Stupid.

356
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,311
Everyone! Hurry!

357
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,591
I changed my mind.

358
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,110
Hey, hey! Don't do that!

359
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,349
Oh, God!

360
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,757
What's going on?

361
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,989
Your clothes were torn.
Bought you new ones.

362
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,398
Did you borrow these
from a close friend?

363
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,679
- The stores around here, they...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Forget about it!

364
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,708
All right, then, let's get on with it.

365
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,638
Get ready.

366
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,034
I ain't right.

367
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,354
What the hell is going on?
Damn.

368
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,071
I feel weird...

369
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,431
What's happening?

370
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,116
Subject Claw: Terminal mutation
in 46 hours 33 minutes.

371
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,159
Subject Wolf: Terminal mutation
in 34 hours 12 minutes.

372
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,155
Subject Chameleon: Terminal mutation
in 44 hours 7 minutes.

373
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,031
We're damned.

374
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,637
- I can't change back.
- You ain't the only one.

375
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,075
I'm stuck with this damn Wolfman face!

376
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,031
Gonna cost them more than a million
bucks to convince me this is cool now.

377
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,996
Wonderful. The level
of transformation is perfect.

378
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,471
- You're a liar!
- No. No. No.

379
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,031
You gentlemen are right on schedule.

380
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,676
We can't change back!

381
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,832
Wait a minute, you knew
this was gonna happen?

382
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,920
How come you can change back
and we can't?

383
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,834
So, what the hell did you do to him
that you didn't do to us?

384
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,753
It's just a matter of stages.

385
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,237
Thorn, explain it to them.

386
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,193
He used plant DNA on me
and animal DNA on you.

387
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,715
Plants create energy, animals don't.

388
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,440
But he found that
in an animal DNA subject...

389
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,558
...the host can supply itself
with enough energy.

390
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,111
With energy, phase-one transformations
will no longer be unstable.

391
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,717
With the next level no longer affected by
emotions, you will gain complete control.

392
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,713
Stop with the science lesson!

393
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,599
So how long until
we reach the next stage?

394
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,753
To get to the next stage, you need
an injection. To make the serum...

395
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,595
...I need iridium.

396
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,909
I don't have iridium.

397
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,828
But I know a place where we could...

398
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,717
...borrow some.

399
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,193
You are an enhanced human,
Kan Fung...

400
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,638
...who will be sold to the most
powerful corporations in the world.

401
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,874
But if you escape from me,
/ will find you and destroy you.

402
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,589
/ will find you and destroy you.

403
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,992
I think I can slow down the DNA
replication, but only temporarily.

404
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,709
I might need a radioisotope to do it,
but I might not.

405
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,836
We'll just have to see.

406
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,552
I don't like feeling
as if I'm an experiment.

407
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,634
So you want a sample?

408
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,748
What?

409
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,359
No.

410
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,228
You mean, right here?

411
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,351
Of course, right here.

412
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,908
I didn't think a doctor
would be afraid of a little blood.

413
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,192
Right.

414
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,909
You're gonna have to do it yourself
because I can't touch you!

415
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,114
You were talking about a radioisotope.

416
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,272
Something you needed
to make the cure permanent.

417
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,874
Iridium. It's part
of my suppressor experiment.

418
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,316
Coming to B Harbor tonight
as part of a Red Cross shipment.

419
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,314
But it can be used in both ways.
Either as a suppressor...

420
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,914
...or to strengthen a reaction.

421
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,311
- Iridium.
- Wait!

422
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,429
- I said I'm not sure.
- The sample's on the table.

423
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,791
What are you guys looking at?

424
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,998
- ID, please.
- I'll get the papers.

425
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,516
Wolf! Papers!

426
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,635
- Hey, what is this shit?
- Did I forget to sign?

427
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,472
Control, control!

428
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,875
Oh, my God.

429
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,874
Let's put him in the van
and finish this ourselves. He's nuts.

430
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,158
He's gonna get out and go right back
after this elephant.

431
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,959
Why don't we tie him up
and put him in a bag?

432
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,714
He's coming with us.
You keep an eye on him.

433
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,838
- Why me?
- Because I said so!

434
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,878
Because I said so. Come on. Let's go.

435
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,238
- What do you think of this one?
- Not bad. A bit skinny.

436
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,119
The one with the leather suit...

437
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,636
- What is the password?
- Never.

438
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,360
That's voice-activated.
Not a retinal scanner.

439
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,829
Your eyes mean more to you than to me.

440
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,911
What's the password?

441
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,518
- Harvest!
- Enter.

442
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,272
Harvest time.

443
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,830
- Is this it?
- Yeah!

444
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,032
- What is it?
- Hospital-grade iridium.

445
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,431
Just what we need to straighten up
that damn Snake.

446
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,953
Where is Snake?

447
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,474
Next time can we break into
someplace with money?

448
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,200
You never know. Life is long.

449
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,949
Damn! Look at that!

450
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,155
That's gross!

451
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,232
I thought Wolf was watching him.

452
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,836
Spit him out!

453
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,033
You are so getting on my nerves, Snake.

454
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,278
Get ahold of yourself, Wolf!

455
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,275
Shit!

456
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,591
Let's get this sucker, Wolfie!

457
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,152
Get back here! We need the iridium!

458
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,470
Damn freaks!

459
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,638
Don't think we need those nets.
Let's call the cherry pickers.

460
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,149
Come on. Get in there! Go! Go!

461
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,599
Cease fire! Cease fire!

462
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,916
Hey! Black Mask is over here!

463
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,038
Go get him! Go! Move! Move!

464
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,709
This had better work.

465
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,110
Kan? Is that you?

466
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,793
Cure...

467
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,951
Don't touch me. Don't...

468
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,833
Cure!

469
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:06,233
Cure... Now... Losing control.

470
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,518
Mask, you are not gonna die on me.

471
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,552
Mask?

472
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,471
Black Mask. Just when I thought I
lost you and your little doctor friend.

473
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,037
Listen to me!

474
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,750
No time for that.

475
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,875
Don't even think about it!

476
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,275
Stop!

477
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,552
I said stop it!

478
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,474
Get out of the way.
This is between me and him.

479
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,350
No. You did this to my dad.
And I won't let that happen again.

480
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,239
He's a murderer. I loved Dan.

481
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,279
You don't understand this feeling yet!
Don't make me fight you too.

482
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,590
No, you don't understand.

483
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,554
Black Mask saved me from Iguana.
Iguana was trying to kill me.

484
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,120
You're just like him.
You're the murderer.

485
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,796
Do you know what was going on in his
mind when he let go of my hand?

486
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,478
If you keep on like this, one day
you won't be able to turn back.

487
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,990
You'll disappear, just fade away.

488
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,792
Find a cure for yourself
while you still have some control.

489
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,679
Moloch won't help you.

490
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,110
Okay, Moloch.

491
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,399
You kept your promise.

492
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,391
Get some rest, boys.
We'll do some more tests tomorrow.

493
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,916
Welcome to the next stage of evolution.

494
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,794
Kan!

495
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,755
Sorry.

496
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,717
What happened to you?

497
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,791
Well, I saw you down there...

498
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,629
...and then I tried to run down
and go after you, but...

499
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,438
- How do you feel?
- Good. I feel good.

500
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,160
And that's another thing I owe you.

501
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,788
Don't be too optimistic. Without
iridium, my suppressor can't separate...

502
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,952
...normal from abnormal DNA.
You can control it, but...

503
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,951
There's still an animal in me.

504
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,430
Yeah. It's funny the way you put it.

505
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:10,233
Well, it can't be worse than not
feeling anything. I'm not even human.

506
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,436
Did you feel that?

507
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,072
No...

508
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,949
...not exactly. Did you?

509
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,393
No, no. Not a thing.

510
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,758
- We should try again.
- No.

511
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,512
For science.

512
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,195
Okay.

513
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,552
Raymond! Hi.

514
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,712
- What are you doing here?
- That's my partner.

515
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,079
Come on. Why is there
always a sidekick?

516
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,714
And besides, he's underage.

517
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,110
He's quite all right.

518
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,510
You have called for me, Zeus?

519
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,750
Very observant of you, Lang.

520
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,277
You have a chance to redeem yourself.
/ have located Kan Fung.

521
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,237
Where?

522
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,954
These events took place in B city,
in full view of the press.

523
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:28,110
Interesting. What is this thing
he's fighting with?

524
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,478
Obviously an enhanced human.
Primitive job, as you can see.

525
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,633
/ want you to find the man responsible.
See if he can be bought.

526
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,952
We don't want amateurs
interfering in our business.

527
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,037
And if he refuses?

528
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,475
U se the usual method.

529
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,871
- We will leave immediately, Zeus.
- Lang?

530
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,712
Yes.

531
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,235
Kan Fung must not get away this time.

532
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,437
/ don't want him exposed
to the public lik e this.

533
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,558
The prodigal son must return.

534
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,710
Do you question my orders?

535
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,517
- No.
- You and Kan Fung are much alik e.

536
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:14,708
- You also have seeds of betrayal in you.
- I swear to you, Zeus, I do not.

537
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,158
Do not fail me.
This is your last chance.

538
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:32,189
At the Pranaya Military Research Center,
several grams of californium were stolen.

539
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,591
This situation has been judged critical
by several observers.

540
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,351
They say this is an ominous sign
given last night's theft of iridium.

541
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,429
Judged critical, as a simple bullet
made from these unstable elements...

542
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,716
...could create a nuclear explosion.

543
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,235
A 30-meter symbol
of the Shadow Group...

544
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,515
Is that a snake?

545
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,036
No. It's the Greek letter "Z." Zeta.

546
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,390
It stands for "Zeus."

547
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,551
Zeus? Who's that?

548
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,715
Leader of the Shadow Group.
My creators.

549
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,472
Who the hell are you?

550
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,428
I'm a man who thinks you're
wasting your talents, doctor.

551
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,433
Talent I can put to much better use.

552
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,878
Lang and Moloch.
Apocalypse meets inferno.

553
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,436
You have in your possession
a large quantity of iridium.

554
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,876
You lack the element
to do something grand with it.

555
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,953
- This situation has been judged...
- Californium and iridium.

556
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,671
A biochemical catalyst and a radioactive
element. Know where this is leading?

557
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,316
- They're making a bomb.
- A DNA bomb.

558
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,598
They've got enough of that stuff
to turn all of B city into a zoo.

559
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,276
This is Lang's style.
All this just to get to me.

560
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,150
Where are they gonna do this?

561
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,199
If they want me,
it will be the most obvious place.

562
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,429
There.

563
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,029
Done. Iridium and californium.

564
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,919
We'll have a big show
in the arena tonight.

565
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,436
Genetic apocalypse,
and only Black Mask to stop it.

566
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,953
You think he'll show?

567
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,232
Does the dog speak
without the master's permission?

568
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,352
Will he show?

569
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,592
Kan, " Black Mask," as you call him...

570
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,911
...has very little sense
of self-preservation.

571
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,514
He'll come because he thinks
he's needed.

572
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,148
And when he does,
I'll take care of him.

573
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,277
We don't need your tricks.

574
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,429
I hear the dog barking again, Moloch.

575
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,196
Your creatures don't know to be quiet
in the presence of their superiors.

576
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,508
Time's up.

577
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,792
Live or die?

578
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,868
I decide who lives and dies
in this lab, not you.

579
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,029
Let him go.

580
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,437
Now!

581
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,915
Life it is.

582
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,600
Your brain is useful to me.

583
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,035
That's the only reason you're alive.

584
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,952
Do you understand?

585
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,276
Doctor, are you sure you can
get into the system?

586
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,000
Every code can be broken, Troy.

587
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,353
A protection device.

588
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,119
Always full of surprises, Moloch.

589
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,876
- What do we do now?
- Find Black Mask.

590
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,156
That's not gonna be easy.

591
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,115
What about reports that your fighter,
Black Mask, is dangerous?

592
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,316
They are absolutely true.

593
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,438
Black Mask, known as
" Blackie" to his friends...

594
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,036
...is one of the three most vicious
fighters alive today.

595
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,510
Which is why tonight he will be coming
face-to-face...

596
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,638
...with the other two: Claw and Wolf!

597
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,677
I'll murderize them!

598
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,751
He's an imposter!

599
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,192
- How many Black Masks are there?
- There is only one Black Mask.

600
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,998
That man is a fake!

601
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,878
He's the fake.

602
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,358
You've been conned.

603
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:24,316
So go home. There won't be
any show tonight!

604
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,310
Take off that damn mask!

605
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,309
Where are we going?

606
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,149
We're following him. Maybe he can
lead us to the detonator.

607
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,069
Get you, no matter how long
it takes me.

608
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,078
- You did this to him?
- Indeed.

609
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,113
I got rid of the parts that were
useless to me.

610
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,714
All I needed was his brain.

611
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,271
So did you enjoy your energy drinks?

612
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,993
What was in it?

613
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,155
It's a poison that accelerates
your heart rate till it explodes.

614
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,191
Poison?

615
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,277
You poisoned us.

616
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,271
Black Mask is here.

617
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,193
Enough time to get Black Mask.

618
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,712
You do this for me
and the antidote is yours.

619
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,836
I guess so.

620
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,189
Let's do it.

621
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,678
Mask? Where are you?

622
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,759
- Aren't we here to help Black Mask?
- That's not funny, Raymond!

623
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,035
Look.

624
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,270
- Where?
- Up there!

625
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,198
Maybe we can stop that jerk!

626
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,469
Hurry!

627
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,356
Now we have to wait.

628
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,236
Hey, over here!

629
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,435
Ready for some action?
I could take you with one hand!

630
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,990
- Now!
- Got you!

631
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,390
Raymond! Do something!

632
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,638
I was just kidding. You're not after
me, right? You're after Black Mask!

633
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,673
I will terminate all those
who help Black Mask!

634
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,638
Marco? Are you alive? Marco?

635
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,031
Are you okay?
Come on, answer me!

636
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,313
Yes, I'm alive.

637
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,757
I think.

638
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,918
Moloch, what did you do to me?

639
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,190
Remember Iguana.

640
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,358
I will never disappear.

641
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,916
You must hold on.

642
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,558
This time you die.

643
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,517
Now, weren't you supposed
to bring me back alive?

644
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,238
I'm tired of this.

645
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,915
Zeus will understand.
He needs me more than you.

646
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,071
Whatever you do...

647
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,959
...you're still going to die.

648
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,951
This is the end of your journey,
Dr. Lang.

649
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,994
I have to go on with mine.

650
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,359
Dr. Leung!

651
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,398
Dr. Marco! Do you have any comments?

652
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,595
- Hi!
- Hi.

653
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:16,116
- This is my dad.
- Tell Black Mask thanks for everything.

654
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,955
I will. Your son was very brave.
You should be proud.

655
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,439
I am.

656
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,913
Can you give this to him? It's our
address. Hope he can write us back.

657
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,790
He will. I'll make sure of it.

658
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,675
- Dr. Marco Leung.
- Are you alone?

659
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,719
- Yes. Where are you?
- You are not safe yet.

660
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,474
I'm not?

661
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,668
- You're still under my protection.
- I see.

662
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,832
Isn't this a kidnapping?

663
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,879
- No more silly costumes this time, okay?
- Hold tight.
