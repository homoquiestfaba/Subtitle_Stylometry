a bimetallic timer

171
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,503
that responds
to heat changes.

172
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,376

do we do on a cold day?

put this together.

Dennis, help him out. Get over here.

Here we go. Here we go.
We got Team Kearns here!

177
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,519
Yeah, this is hot, this is hot.
So, careful, all right?

178
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,156
That's got a transistor and a
capacitor, and resistors in there.

179
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:23,066
That's as simple as I can get it.
That's when you get real beauty.

181
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,528
Will it work?

182
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,902
It works up here
perfectly.

183
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,568
We got resistors, each one
rated at a different tolerance.

184
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:34,773
And each one should work in a wiper
motor. Where are the meter cords?

185
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,712
Uh, just over there.

186
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,082
Of course, there's a thousand
different combinations.

187
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,820
Our job is to find
the one that works.

188
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,619
And there is one
that'll work in theory.

189

Yeah.

a timing control into the wiper column

so that you could adjust
the time between movements.

Well, why?

238
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,583
Well, because it obviously rains
at different intensity levels.

GIL: Well, Bob wants
to manufacture it.

243
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,294
So from our end, we just put
up the dough for the patents,

244
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,529
research and development, all
of which goes through Kearns,

245
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,334
and we also seed the
money for manufacturing.

And I could be ready
to go very soon.

247

simple deal. The fact is,

more if you're rich.

And Robert's in the next room,
opening a bottle of champagne.

313

Well, I'd never
opened one before.

314
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,178

of champagne before his wedding night.

legs, and I look down and, pow!

right in my eye,

00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,793
and I fall back on the sheets.
I was bleeding.

318
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:24,921
I come out and
start screaming.

turned out okay

336
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,968
Where we can hear
ourselves think.

337
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,238
Go on.

338
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,470
(MAN SINGING)

339
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,881
PAUL: We've got some real
interesting news for you.

340
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:22,153
Paul, when are they gonna
fix that seventeenth green?

341
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,210
I'm tired of playing
on that temporary green.

342
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,985
I'm on it, I'm on it. I took it to
the board. It'll get taken care of.

343
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,787
Bob, you don't play
golf, do you?

344
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,487
Uh, no, no.

345
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,024
So, Bob, we got some really
good feedback on the feelers

346
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,567
we put out for
the Blinking Eye.

347
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:38,194
Yeah, it turns out the concept
isn't as unique as we first thought.

348
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,431
The Big Three have assigned
their windshield wiper teams

349
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,337
to come up with an
intermittent wiper.

350
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,275
That's what they call it.
The Intermittent Wiper.

351
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:48,211
The Intermittent Wiper.
I'll be damned.

352
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,977
No, it's fine. More than anything,
now we know there's a demand for it.

353
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:54,576
Until now, your wiper
seemed like a clever gadget.

354
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:58,646
But they want it. And more importantly,
they haven't cracked it yet.

355
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:02,057
Mercury's been working on one for over
a year and they still haven't beaten it.

356
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,959
So we want to set up
a demonstration.

357
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,088
Now, Ford is very interested
in seeing what we have.

358
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,291
Ford?

359
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:10,930
You didn't mention
anything about...

360
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,527
Are you ready?

361
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,805
Wow, Ford. Wow.

362
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,274
I don't know.
I mean, it needs some more work.

363
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,367
More consistency.

364
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,242
I can assure you we won't
sell it if we don't show it.

365
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, but should we be showing them ours if
they're already working on their own version?

366
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,774
Well, that's
up to you.

367
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:29,309
But maybe it's a good reason
to show it sooner than later.

368
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,518
I don't know, Gil.

369
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,251
Kearns, I'd hate to see
you if you got bad news.

370
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,061
We're not gonna let
anybody take it apart,

371
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,756
especially after the money
we've put into the patents.

372
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,232
We'll just give them a peek.
Cat stays in the bag.

373
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,429
(INAUDIBLE)

374
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,707
Now, Paul's real
excited about this.

375
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,409
In fact, I haven't seen him
quite like that in a long time.

376
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,349
Well, I got
a lot to do.

377
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,650
No, I know, know.
By the way, this is yours.

378
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,186
Mine?

379
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,659
For now. No more
aquariums, Bob.

380
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,324
Just throw the unit in
here and take it to Ford.

381
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:15,992
Sal!

382
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,767
Sal here'll help
you put it in.

383
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,065
Just tell us what you want,
Mr. Kearns.

384
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,664
Okay.

385
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,483
He'll be here.

386
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,986
We're very busy
here, Mr. Previck.

387
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,217
FRANK: This is him, yeah?
GIL: Yeah.

388
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,463
Hiya, Bob.
- Hey, Gil.

389
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,195
Frank Sertin, Vice President
of Research and Development,

390
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,261
meet Bob Kearns,

391
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,705
the inventor of the
Intermittent Windshield Wiper.

392
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,675
(CHUCKLES) Oh, we'll see.
We'll see.

393
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,008
It's a real pleasure.
- Good. Thank you.

394
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,842
All right, Bob, let's
see what you got.

395
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,007
All right.
- And, Bob!

396
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,481
We want you to do it
with the engine running.

397
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:43,250
We've found that the heat can play havoc
with some of the systems we've tried.

398
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,522
Right now?

399
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,458
Right now.

400
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,428
(CLEARS THROAT)

401
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,166
(ENGINE STARTING)

402
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,935
FRANK: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where... Where's he going?

403
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,340
GIL: Bob's real
big on security.

404
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,111
FRANK: Okay.

405
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:12,676
Okay, Bob!
Come on, let her rip!

406
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,776
What's going on?
- I don't know.

407
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,175
Okay.

408
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,342
Bob?

409
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,715
I don't know.

410
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:51,853
(GRUNTING)

411
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:53,749
Okay.

412
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,223
GIL: Bob!
- Yeah?

413
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,287
Oh, here! It's a fuse.

414
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:01,424
It's the fuse.
- It's a fuse!

415
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:04,330
Yeah, we're good.

416
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:17,210
GIL: It'll do that all day,
engine running or not.

417
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,545
Well, that is...

418
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,580
That's good.

419
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,716
We call this
"variable speed."

420
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,316
Variable speed.

421
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,594
"Variable dwell."

422
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,796
That is very
impressive.

423
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,966
Gil, how about giving us a
little look under the hood, huh?

424
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,308
Sorry, Frank,
we can't do that.

425
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,615
He's not doing that
manually, is he?

426
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:53,279
(CHUCKLES)

427
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,044
Bob? Bob!

428
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,448
Uh, would you get
out of the car?

429
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:02,460
They think you might be
manipulating the controls.

430
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:03,995
Well, I am.

431
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:15,534
That is very
good, Bob.

432
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,097
(CHUCKLING)
That is very, very good.

433
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,508
I think we should get
you a copy of our specs.

434
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:22,046
But I can tell you this, though.
At a minimum, at a minimum,

435
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,775
it's gonna have to run a
million and a half cycles

436
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,214
under real-time
conditions.

437
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,149
And operate...
Uh, excuse me.

438
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,244
What's the maximum
temperature under the hood?

439
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,789
ENGINEER: It's, uh...
- Two hundred and seventy degrees.

440
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,085
Mmm-hmm.

441
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,955
(CHUCKLING) If it operates in
the field like it did here...

442
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:39,925
Where'd you get
your degree?

443
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,625
Uh, Case Western.

444
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,794
I'm gonna look
under the hood.

445
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:44,893
Sorry, we'd rather not.

446
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,963
It's nothing against Ford, sir.
I've admired the company my whole life.

447
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,065
No problem.

448
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,508
But I'll get to work right away,
just as soon as I get the specs.

449
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,567
Okay, good, good.

450
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:56,136
Listen, I know that we are
gonna be in touch with you.

451
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,080
Yes, sir.
- Very good. Gil.

452
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,344
Frank.

453
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,480
Dr. Kearns?
Case Western.

454
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,989
That's a...
That's a good school.

455
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,503
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

456
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,980
You did a hell
of a job, pal.

457
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,915
(CHUCKLING)
Hell of a job.

458
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,617
Thank you.

459
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,014
I'll see you.

460
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,961
(WATER RIPPLING)

461
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,462
BOB: Well, there's
a difference between

462
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,330
a good idea and
a good product.

463
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,494
I've had a lot
of good ideas.

464
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,505
Just nothing that's quite
clicked, you know?

465
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:58,067
It makes you wonder what it
is makes a man successful.

466
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,337
Brains?

467
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,273
Talent?

468
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:06,284
Of course, there's a lot of unsuccessful
talents running around out there.

469
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,918
Maybe this is the one.

470
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,623
Maybe this'll get you where
you want to be, you know?

471
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,624
Yeah.

472
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:21,221
But I don't know. I look at you
and I look at us and I just think

473
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:26,568
you're a success.
Don't you feel that way?

474
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,304
Maybe it's some
other thing.

475
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,037
Like luck, timing.

476
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,278
Some intangible
thing like that.

477
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,117
It haunts me a little.

478
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,285
I'm gonna get some more tea.
Do you want anything?

479
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,453
No, I'm good.
- No? Okay.

480
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,627

her, and then she just, like...

481
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,294
Patrick, come on
with that paper!

482
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,997

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,641
Okay, it's Tuesday,

"Wednesday,

Hey, hey, hey.

487
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:09,771

"Friday, partly cloudy and
colder, and a clearing on Sunday."

00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:17,712
BOB: Well, we
need some rain.

491
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,451
Maybe instead of grace, we
should say a prayer, Dad.

492
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,550
DENNIS: Didn't we just say grace already?
- Yeah.

493
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:25,825
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay. Let's do that. Come on.

494
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:27,172
Let's do a little prayer here, huh?

495
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,356
When you say a prayer, you're
supposed to fold your hands.

496
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:33,268
Dear God, thank you for all the
sunshine you've been sending.

497

We know in your
infinite wisdom,

498
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:39,666
you managed to create the elasticity
of rain water different than tap.

499
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,042
If you could see it
in your good graces

500
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:44,549
to, you know,
send us some rain

501
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,346
so that we can test the Blinking
Eye in real-life conditions,

502
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,649
we'd appreciate it.
Amen.

503
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:50,912
ALL: Amen.

504
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,684
Do you think he heard you,

Oh, yeah.

He's staring right at us.

wondering what the heck's going on!

Bob Kearns, winner of the
wiper competition. Congrats.

553
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,794
Bob, I've been going over the reports on your
Intermittent. It looks like you cracked it.

554
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,030
Have you worked up
a unit price yet?

555
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,471
No. Not yet.
I'm hoping to...

556
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,441
Good. And you do want
to manufacture it?

557
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,239
BOB: Yes, sir.
I want to come through for Ford.

558
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:30,475
And we like that. So let's
get a unit price, then.

559
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,416
Frank, have you sent a
working unit to Washington?

560
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:37,387
No, Mack, we haven't.
Bob's... He's not comfortable with that.

561
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,650
Really?

562
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,949
Now, Bob, you do understand
this is a safety device.

563
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:44,427
And before we can install any
safety device on any of our cars,

564
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,555
we have to submit it to
Washington for approval.

565
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,792
And that means we're gonna
need a working unit from you.

566
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:52,667
I understand that. And I understand
I'll need your cars for my wipers.

uh, if we had a...

00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,639
We like to work closely
with our people, Bob.

570
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,768
That's...
That's the deal.

571
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,642
Nothing else would make sense.
I'm sure Gil will tell you that

572
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,273
we have a very close relationship
with Previck Automotive.

That's why we came here first.

574
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,312
He's right, though,
Bob. It does need to be approved.

TYLER: We're interested in offering the
Intermittent as an option on at least

576
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:16,423
one model next year. From there, our
plan is to expand it to the entire line.

577
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:19,931
Now, that means we're working
under a serious deadline.

578
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:23,490
So we're gonna need a unit
from you as fast as possible.

579
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:26,762
Okay. Yeah,
I can do that.

and a wrong way to do this, okay?

The loading ramps are more than
ample for any job you may have.

Sure looks like it
needs a lot of work.

We're concerned about the price.
Is it the best you can do?

608
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,369
Well, we can probably work out an eight
cents per foot improvement, Mrs. Kearns.

What do you think, guys?
- How much is it?

a square foot.

No.

612
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:42,013
No, we were figuring
on a lot less than that.

613
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,571
I think the owners
might come down a bit.

So, these S.D. 25s
are fixed costs?

622
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,742
Yes, we can do a discount
after 400,000 units.

623
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,939
I assume you'll put the Ford contracts up
against costs. They're backing it, right?

624
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,074
Oh, yeah. We're down the road on
all that. My biggest concern is

625
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,515
that you'll be able
to provide us with

and circuits that we need.

Yeah. Yeah. Bob?

say exactly?

Like I said,
they want out.

649
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,575
Out?

650
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:32,384
They're not ready yet, and they're
not gonna make a move until they are.

"It's not the Ford style."

We'll get it back.
- When?

657

I don't know.

658
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,467
I closed on the
operating loan.

Well, don't forget,
I thought you should slow down on that.

660
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:51,766
They're loading
in transistors.

661
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,107
We're gonna figure this out.
All we gotta do is take it to another...

My kids. It's my kids.

665
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:09,088
Ford was our best bet.
We both know that. But we're not done.

666
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,427
Okay, but they... They strung us along,
and they looked at my work.

667
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:13,691
I know.

668
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:15,761
I know.

669
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,301
We had a deal.

670
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,765

go a little softer on the language.

in opposition with one another.

reactance,

with the product

<i>This is my number one priority, Phyllis.</i>
<i>Whatever it's gonna take.</i>

839
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,587
Josh, I'm gonna need at
least 10 new wiper motors.

840
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,316
And some of the
earlier versions, too.

841
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,789
JOSH: Sure, Professor.
Not a problem.

842
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,416
BOB: Good. And
circuit boards.

843
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,484
Yeah, they just trash
the test models anyway.

844
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:46,860
All right, um, where
are we gonna do this?

845
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:50,128
I'll meet you at the first
lab on the second floor.

846
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,361
Okay.

847
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,729
BOB: Where's the
itemization file?

848
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,273
PHYLLIS: All the files
are in here, hon.

849
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,603
You should see a doctor.

850
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,974
Oh, I'm fine.
Let's keep going.

852
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:07,580
Something to bring their attention
that various automotive manufacturers

853
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:11,052
are considering using
electronic intermittent wiper...

854
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:12,146
I don't have it yet.

855
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,056
Considering using electronic
intermittent wiper control...

856
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,491
Do you want to list who?
- Yes.

857
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,223
And that these are in direct
violation of patents jointly held

858
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:23,266
by both Previck and
Kearns Corporation.

859
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,326
As the inventor of the
Intermittent Wiper, I ask, no...

860
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,804
I demand that they take
immediate legal action.

861
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:31,740
"Demand" is too strong.
They're our friends.

862
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,071
What difference
does it make?

863
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:35,112
They're not gonna
read it anyway.

864
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,168
Then why are
we doing this?

865
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,714
Because it makes
me feel better.

866
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:38,840
Does it?

867
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:43,410
What is this file?
What is this?

868
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:49,551
Kathy won it in the swim meet.
She wanted you to see it.

869
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:58,433
DOCTOR: This is a bad
case of psoriasis.

870
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,437
Now, Phyllis, I want you to take
care of yourself. Use the medication.

- Thanks.

872
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,534
And I'm going to write
you a prescription.

873
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:07,099
How long do I
take that for?

874
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,009
Well, just a month.

875
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:14,277
I don't know what's going on with you,
Phyllis, but this is all stress-related.

876
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:17,184
You understand me? You have to
take the stress level way down.

877
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:18,346
I'll be fine.

878
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,227

- Phyllis.

879
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:35,135
How are the kids?
- Good.

Phyllis.

881
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:42,475
Why is Bob
doing this?

882
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,578
He can't stand
being called a liar.

883
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:48,049
Well, nobody's
saying that he is.

884
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:49,883
They might as well be.

885
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:53,754
Oh, for God's sake, Phyllis,
it's Ford. He can't win.

886
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,486
Take care, Jean.

887

Oh! God!

888
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,811
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
Med school gives them to us.

889
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,780
We use them
for crash tests.

890
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,816
You should see it when we
drop them down elevator shafts.

891
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:21,784
It's very instructive.

892
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:24,912
I'll try that sometime.
Did you get the boards?

893
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:27,385
What the hell is this?

894
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,791
I know, it's just motors.
I couldn't get any circuit boards.

895
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:31,919
Why not?

896
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:35,591
They didn't have any extras. Didn't
have any complete units. I don't know.

897
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,190
These are nothing.

898
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:38,758
Hey, man, this is
the best I could do.

899
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,497
This doesn't
help me, Josh!

900
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,663
I'm sorry.

902
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,268
Wait a minute.

903
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,547
Did somebody
talk to you?

904
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,012
Did you have a
conversation about me?

905
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,579
