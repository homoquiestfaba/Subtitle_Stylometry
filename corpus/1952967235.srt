00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,661
[man, narrating]
The surface of the earth...

7
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,029
is 30 percent land...

8
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,532
and 70 percent water.

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,502
A newborn baby is composed
of 70 percent water...

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,736
and 30 percent everything else.

11
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,304
[shouting]

12
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,673
[man, narrating]
I guess this means...

13
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,109
that life and water are inseparable.

14
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,945
A human child at birth undergoes a ritual...

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,849
almost identical to that inflicted
upon a trout at death.

16
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,818
The fish is whacked on the head...

17
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,786
thus putting it out of its misery.

18
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,088
The infant is whacked on the behind...

19
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,856
[crying]

20
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,691
thus initiating it into its misery.

21
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:46,064
Upon my birth, my father
made sure that I was given...

22
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,801
the proud, manly name of Augustine.

23
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,338
And since I was born into
the first family of angling...

24
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,907
it should come as no surprise...

25
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,209
that I was a fishing prodigy.

26
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,078
I caught my first steelhead with my mom...

27
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,515
on a worm when I was four.

28
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,352
I didn't feel any hostility
towards land dwellers.

29
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,489
I just had water on the brain.

30
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,691
The only thing I gave much thought to...

31
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:18,096
was bait versus fly.

32
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,731
On my tenth birthday...

33
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,768
I caught my 180th steelhead with my dad...

34
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,803
on a fly.

35
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,139
By the time high school rolled around...

36
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,575
I was great at attracting steelhead.

37
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,743
Not so great with the cheerleaders.

38
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,479
And when most kids were making college plans...

39
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,514
I didn't bother.

40
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,648
[shouting]
Gross.

41
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,283
Figured the only institution...

42
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,618
my grades would get me in...

43
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,754
was the Oregon State Pen.

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,156
But on water?

45
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,793
I understand the way fish think.

46
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,429
My parents' union...

47
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,298
is one of stubborn, extremely loyal...

48
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,702
hot-tempered,
polar opposites.

49
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,837
Ma is a bait fisher...

50
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,774
an expert plunker of worms.

51
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,877
My father is a writer secondarily...

52
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,615
and a famous fly fisherman primarily.

53
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,750
My brother Bill Bob is different...

54
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,118
than the rest of us.

55
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,255
He was born with a prodigious ability...

56
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,057
to ignore all things aquatic...

57
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,028
which to a massive extent
implies his entire family.

58
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,463
He hates water.
Won't drink it.

59
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,564
[barking]

60
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,165
He wears galoshes and a hat...

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,467
almost every day...

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,801
just to stay clear of the stuff.

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,336
[barking]

64
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,538
Not that he doesn't need a little protection...

65
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,207
from other hazards now and then.

66
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,943
Good thing Ma has native intelligence.

67
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,344
And she always seems to be

68
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,246
in the right place at the right time.

69
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,949

[walla]

72
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,452
My father's battle...

73
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,688
with a giant steelhead he named Nijinsky...

74
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,123
was the stuff of legends.

75
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,727
And the story of that fish
brought him fame, fortune...

76
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,096
and a healthy ego.

77
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,798
Raised by English aristocrats...

78
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,201
he inherited their speech and manners.

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,438
When he autographs a book,
he writes his entire name...

80
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,740
Henning Hale Orviston.

81
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,241
To approach every task--

82
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,077
[Gus, narrating]
I call him H2O.

83
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,512
He's the one person in the world...

84
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,948
who calls me by the name
on my birth certificate.

85
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,983
(Henning)
Augustine...

86
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,287
best get another box from the car.

87
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,123
I just brought in three boxes.

88
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,525
Tell you what, Augustine.

89
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,728
Until you find someone else to employ you...

90
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,498
you might want to do what I request.

91
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,034
[thump]
Yes, sir!
[sarcastic]

93
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,938
Do you have children?

94
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,339
Oh, yeah.

[scoffing and sighing]

96
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,998
[man]
Before I take a few questions...

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,333
let me conclude by saying...

98
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,435
I like to think of this legislation...

99
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,304
as the Worship the Waters Act.

100
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,240
Yes, little lady.

101
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,876
(woman)
Hi . Um, curious.

102
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,713
How can building all those new dams
be an act of worship?

103
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,617
I mean, even if the wild salmon
are lucky enough to survive...

104
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,119
the turbines on their pilgrimage up the river...

105
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,321
their smolt will be swallowed, of course...

106
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,258
by the predators on their way back to the ocean.

107
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,896
Maybe we should call it
the Slaughter the Salmon Act instead.

108
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,532
There may be some collateral damage
to the salmon...

109
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,569
but this will create jobs
and cut taxes, and besides...

110
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,505
we are making great strides
with aquaculture these days.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,907
You'd be amazed what we're doing...

112
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,275
with farmed salmon.

113
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,043
(policeman) There's no smoking here.

114
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,378
You need to put that out.

115
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,079
Of course.
The environment.

116
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,114
Come on.

117
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,482
Certainly.

118
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,951
(policeman)
Let's go. Come one.

119
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,586
There's no evidence...

120
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,088
that consuming farmed salmon poses any threat.

121
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,491
Yeah, you and I can debate that.

122
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,461
But we can both agree that fish
have better places to live...

123
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,163
than pools of their own shit!

My parents argued about a lot of things.

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,723
But it was never a question of who
would have the last word...

135
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,925
merely who would have the next one.

[background arguing]

137
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,563

thinking about leaving home...

[Mom, sighing]

140
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,611
So, Hen...

141
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,782
have you ever been to Royal Lake?

142
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,284
If I have...

143
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,052
the brain cells recollecting it...

144
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:19,291
have been destroyed by this merciful beverage.

145
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,593
So go ahead, Gusser.

146
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,194
Tell him about that record bass...

147
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,030
you and Bill Bob pulled out of there that time.

148
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,331
Ma.

149
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,600
Augustine, you call yourself a fisherman?

150
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,835
I call myself Gus.

151
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,105
Well, Gus...

152
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,408
why were you fishing for bass?

153
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,443
Dutch Hines says that--

154
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,745
Dutch Hines is an idiot.
What does he know? Bass.

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,447
Bass!

156
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,883
(Gus, off)
It's been said that a man with a Bible...

157
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,319
is more dangerous than a man with a gun.

00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,221
lzaak Walton's The Compleat Angler...

159
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,357
was my father's Bible.

"The king of fish,
the trout."

161
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,062
(Gus, off)
And since the time I was a toddler...

162
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,764
I heard it quoted and misquoted daily.

163
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,536
"via the fly rod, the most
aesthetically perfect experience...

183
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,634
who doesn't drool over the sound
of your stupid, suave talk.

184
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,403
The only person you love is yourself...

185
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,538
because you've got your head
so far up your own ass--

186
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,973
All right now, Gus Orviston...

187
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,908
that's no way to talk to your father.

188
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,543
What in hell's gotten into you?

189
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,645
You're a greedy, gloating shrew...

190
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,048
and you don't know shit about fishing or living.

191
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,216
Neither one of you do
because you're just both...

192
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,384
dug so deep in your ruts...

193
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,053
that you've got mud in your ears.

194
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,264

195
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,801
[crashing]

196
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,971
I gotta get out of here.

197
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,207
See this?

198
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,976
[Mom]
No no no, not Nijinsky.

199
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,345
This is the source of all your bullshit.

200
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,118
(Gus, off)
Nijinsky was an honored part of our family...

201
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,354
since before I was even born.

202
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,756
And even though his body...

203
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,825
was stuck over the living room mantle...

204
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,095
his spirit haunted every corner of my life.

205
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,667
What can you say after you've
spontaneously cremated...

206
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,670
your parent's prized fish in the fireplace?

207
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,505
The only thing that came to my mind

208
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,174
was "Good-bye."

209
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,576
[starting engine]

210
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,312
For me, happiness would never be found...

211
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,215
anywhere but on the banks of a river anyway.

212
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,816
So I took the few
possessions I owned--

213
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:32,884
Bye, Gus.

214
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,552
and turned to the river.

215
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,722
And to a new life devoid of
every obstacle between me...

216
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,459
and my beloved art of angling.

[soft cheerful music]

245
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,066
(Gus, off)
There's just nothing like the feel...

246
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,168
of a trout dancing through the river...

247
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,238
making the pole pulse
like a heart in your hands.

248
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,208
It does to your hands...

249
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,477
what dreams of eternity do to your heart.

250
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,713
And yet, I killed the trout.

251
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,649
It's strange to kill your dance partner...

252
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,085
but that's what I did.

253
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,087
I did it because the world is strange.

254
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,190
Because the world does not allow you
to make up your own rules...

255
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,359
based on how you would wish things to be.

256
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,162
Because this is a world
where no matter who you are...

257
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,698
your happiness, your survival...

258
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,934
is based on sacrifice.

259
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,805
Sweet, bleeding sacrifice.

260
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,755

There's one thing you can say about nature.

If you make one lousy rule to describe it...

it has to bust its ass to do so.

And so what?
If anybody ever discovered the real laws of nature...

337
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,715
nature would rear back and strike him dead...

00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,857
The trout I caught on a wet fly.

363
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,226
The corpse I caught on a soggy dry.

364
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,594
Yes, well...

365
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,897
you've done old Abe's family some service...

366
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,365
by collecting his remains.

367
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,302
And since we're all bodily
destined for corpsehood...

368
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,671
and spiritually possessed of immortal souls...

369
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,941
I see no reason to let the proximity
of corpses ruin our day.

370
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,577
If you think we're all possessed
by immortal souls...

371
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,111
I'd sure like to see them.

372
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,315
Maybe you're looking in the wrong places.

373
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,963
For clear vision.

374
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,631
Thanks.

375
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,100
M m-hm.

376
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,837
And uh, thanks for the ride.

377
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,139
[soft guitar music]

378
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,878
(Gus, off)
A fisherman is dead.

379
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,518
Everyone I know will one day be dead.

380
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,453
What can I do about it?

381
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,490
Death is the most natural thing there is...

382
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,226
and we all have a knack for it.
The only question is...

383
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,130
when we'll master it.
Doesn't matter what we do...

384
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,732
or what we don't do.

385
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:56,173
This is no passing thought.

386
00:27:56,307 --> 00:28:00,678
It's a gnawing emptiness
more real than the cold.

387
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,515
[soft sad music]

388
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,332
This is bullshit.

389
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,570
(Bill Bob)
Ma tossed the baby rabbit skeleton...

390
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,372
I had hanging in my closet.

391
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,015
ls that tonight's dreefee?

392
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,416
Yep.

393
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,318
I had to get a new one.

394
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,788
Whatever helps you sleep, Bill Bob.

395
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,956
Gussy?

396
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,792
Bill Bob?

397
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,527
I thought it might make you feel better...

398
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,663
to explain that you've got a garden angel.

399
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,098
You mean guardian angel?

400
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,301
Nah . See, you think
you're alone.

401
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,304
But you're not.
You've got a garden angel...

402
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,740
that's your twin.

403
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,575
(Gus)
It's called a guardian angel.

404
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,077
(Bill Bob)
No. I'm talking about a garden angel.

405
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,314
It's like your shadow.

406
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,032
Dreefee.

407
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,083
(Gus)
Garden angel.

408
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,720
Gussy, garden angels come from the ground...

409
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,388
like carrots.

410
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,423
When they first come out of the ground...

411
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,592
into the garden world, they're very old...

412
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,327
or hurt, or sick.

413
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,029
And the longer the angels live there...

414
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,397
the younger and smaller they grow

415
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,965
and happier and friendlier they get.

416
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,600
When they get little little...

417
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,603
they disappear out of the garden world
and into our world...

418
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,205
and we trade places.

419
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,606
We what?

420
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,942
We trade places with our twin.

421
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,977
We go there and our twin comes here.

422
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,281
We journey up and up
through a long black tunnel...

423
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,017
till we reach the garden angel grounds.

424
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,019
Sprout up like carrots.

425
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,521
Trade back and forth.

426
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,926
Does knowing this make you
feel a little less lonely, Gussy?

427
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,761
Yeah, Bill Bob.

428
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,629
Thanks.

429
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,657
[soft lively music]

430
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,218
[whistling]

431
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,203
Oh, sorry.

432
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,807
Uh, I'm, uh--

433
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,475
[stammering]
Don't get scared.

434
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:03,714
I'm just-- I'm just
a marmless misher--

435
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,917
I just came here to go swimming.

436
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,858
Oops.

437
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,727
I gotta go.

438
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,029
You know, um--

439
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,298
Do not-- Uh.

440
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,433
Bye.

441
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,515
Hey!

442
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,351
You all right up there?

443
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,719
Yeah.

444
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,655
Well, are you hurt?

445
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,325
I-- No-- No!

446
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,662
Can you get down?

447
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,332
No.

448
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,468
Why not?

449
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,370
Just 'cause.

450
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,705
All right, mummy mouth.

451
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,807
If that's all you got for me, good luck.

452
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,743
No, no, no.
Don't go.

453
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,478
Why not?

454
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,280
"No life, good scholar...

455
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,849
"no life so happy and so pleasant...

456
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,318
"as the life
of a well-governed angler.

457
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,320
"So we may say that God never did make...

458
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,690
"a more calm, quiet...

459
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:25,295
innocent recreation
than angling ."

460
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,930
I don't suppose he did.

461
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,267
And now, I think it's time...

462
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,102
for you to repair to your angle rod...

463
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,905
which should not be left in the water
to fish for itself.

464
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,307
Oh, yeah, is that what we've been doing, huh?

465
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,976
Funny, 'cause I thought...

466
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,878
I was trying to catch me a steelhead.

467
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,916
And you, what are you doing here?

468
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,186
I am a fisherman, but I only came here to swim.

469
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,022
If you're a fisherman, where's your gear?

470
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,825
My gear is at home, on the Tamanawis.

471
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:59,429
"But let us say grace and fall to breakfast.

472
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,997
What say you, scholar?"

473
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,833
You can say grace all you want.

474
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,801
Just don't fall to breakfast, please.

475
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,904
Why not?

476
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,040
Because you're gonna break your neck...

477
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,876
before I figure out that lingo of yours.

478
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,414
It's Zizak Waltley.
I mean Zisac Walters--
[groans]

479
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,616
lzaak Walton?

480
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,053
Yes!

481
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,155
And what is your name?

482
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,823
Crawl me Gust.

483
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,326
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's
your name?

484
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,495
[laughs]

485
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,932
Eddy.

486
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,001
Just Eddy.
Nice to meet you.

487
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,705
Eddy, like the swirvles in the river wattle.

488
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,141
I wish.

489
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,076
No.

490
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,278
Eddy like my dad, Edwin.

491
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,483
You got-- You got--
You got a bite.

492
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,018
Hm?

493
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,200
[mumbling]

494
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,036
[grunting]

495
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,949
Where'd you go?

496
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,848
Aiee!

497
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,151
Sacajawea Argeiphontes!
I am wounded.

498
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,319
Titus?

499
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,926
[groaning]

500
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,367
(Titus)
The Sufi Attar has written...

501
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,704
"One tiny fly which entered the ear of Nimrod...

502
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,373
troubled the brain
of that idiot for centuries."

503
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,277
Please, Gus.
Spare me Nimrod's fate.

504
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,313
[sighs]

505
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,714
It's hopeless.

506
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,250
I'll never catch one of those beautiful trout.

507
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,352
Whoops. You just used
one of the two words...

508
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,056
that should be deleted from every
true fisherman's vocabulary.

509
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,990
Hopeless?

510
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,626
No. Always and never.

511
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,895
[groans]

512
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:52,896
How's it feel?

513
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,364
Eerie, thanks.

514
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,498
Don't mention it.

515
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,535
Consider it de-mentioned.

516
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,604
[chuckles]
What's that?

517
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,740
(Gus)
It's a long, dull story.

518
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,509
If I'm not mistaken, I've seen that look before.

519
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,380
ls there a woman in this?

520
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,650
Twice she slipped away now.

521
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,219
She's uncatchable.

522
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,888
Uncatchable as in never?

523
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,025
She's not a fish, Titus.

524
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,527
Maybe not, but it certainly sounds to me...

525
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,629
like you're telling the story
of the one that got away.

526
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,832
Live the rest of my life without ever seeing...

527
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,633
the beautiful fisher girl again?

528
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,337
That's-- that's a pretty
miserable prospect.

529
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,805
[sighs]
Well--

530
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,707
I guess there's nothing left to do...

531
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,210
but just drink till I die.

532
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,215
I'll admit there is no cure
for a soul in your condition...

533
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,185
but there are three consolations.

534
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,921
Okay.

535
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,924
One is hope.
You may find her again.

536
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,659
Yeah, fat chance.

537
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,863
Gus, if she's as beautiful
as you say she is--

538
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,065
She's twice as beautiful as I say she is.

539
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,135
She knows your name.
She knows the river.

540
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,269
She may find you.

541
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,171
Yeah . We may grow wings.

542
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,306
We might.

543
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,711
Okay. What are these
other two consolations?

544
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,114
Well, you've already put down
a healthy dose of the second.

545
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,483
The third, however, requires more aptitude.

546
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,685
What kind of aptitudes?

547
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,187
Philosophical aptitude.

548
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,357
Titus, I know how to philosophize...

549
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,059
as well as you know how to fly cast.

550
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,096
I think you should get plowed tonight.

551
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,467
And tomorrow, we begin philosophizing.
[glasses clink]

552
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,668
I just told you...

553
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,437
I don't know how to philosophize.

554
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,140
Well, and I don't know how to fish.

555
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,075
Okay. So?

556
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,378
So we teach each other.

557
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,947
[chuckling]

558
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,916
What have I got to lose?

559
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,419
Your unhappiness.

560
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,588
Yeah, right.

561
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,994
What is that?

562
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,831
ls that an imitation of a grasshopper?

563
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:14,170
[scoffs]
This is an abstract representation...

564
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,042
of a fat tourist on a golf course.

565
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,378
It's called Bermuda shorts.

566
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,581
Here, fishy.

567
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,717
I like it.
What say we migrate to a watering hole...

568
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,453
a little closer to civilization?

569
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,955
To Portland?

570
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,523
Sure.

571
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,459
The way that goes ahead
often looks as if it went back.

572
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,162
I just want to go ahead and find Eddy.

573
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,330
[soft guitar music]

574
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,798
Come on.

575
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,458
[soft growl]

576
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,497
[barking]

577
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,934
Titus?

578
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,168
[door opens, closes]

579
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,303
Titus!

580
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,072
Yes?

581
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,707
Ah.

582
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,276
This your dog?

583
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,477
Yes.

584
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,179
Well, he's kind of staring at me.

585
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,314
So?

586
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,849
Does he bite?
Can I move? Or--

587
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,150
Why won't he just go away?

588
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,053
He-- He doesn't bite without cause.

589
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,821
But, uh, you should move.

590
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,223
You're in Descartes chair.

591
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,357
[dog, whimpering]

592
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,926
Easy there, buddy.

593
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,796
I'm just gonna move over to the couch.

594
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,932
And then Descartes' silly chair...

595
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,601
will be all fine.

596
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,372
Uh, Titus?

597
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:00,109
The dog's in Descartes' chair now.

598
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,545
And he's rocking.
Should I tell him to get down?

599
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,648
No, you shouldn't.
The dog is Descartes.

600
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,651
Oh.

601
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,253
Well.

602
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,721
This is amazing.

603
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,090
How did you teach him to rock a chair like that?

604
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,693
Don't make a stew about it, Gus.

605
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,162
You'll only confuse him.

606
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,231
Descartes' immediate goal is humanity...

607
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,434
as surely as ours is divinity.

608
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,537
What?

609
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,905
Sorry. I guess...

610
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,374
I'm just from the orthodox school, you know?

611
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:35,712
Fido, Rover, fetch, roll over.

612
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,581
Well, Gus...

613
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,351
are you ready to fish?

614
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,852
Fish for what?

615
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,187
For happiness.

616
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,858
And where do you fish for that?

617
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,828
You believe that stuff?

618
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,397
[scoffing]
I'm not sane, Gus.

619
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,000
I believe in the rivers of living water.

620
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,936
I believe our souls swim in that water.

621
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,940
I believe that Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed

622
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,042
are the savor in that water.

623
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,111
Wish I believed that.

624
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,748
And why don't you?

625
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,783
Bait or fly.

626
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,852
Fried or scrambled.

627
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,220
Jesus or Mohamed.

628
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,721
I mean, does it really make any difference?

629
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,225
Does it really matter?

630
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,761
Where are all these sages
and buddhas holing up...

631
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,897
now when we really need 'em?

632
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,234
Well, would you know one if you met one?

633
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,202
Come on, Titus.

634
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,438
Even lzaak Walton talks about the goodness...

635
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,973
of the God of nature.

636
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,509
I've never seen Him,
and I've fished in ten states.

637
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,911
Whoever, whatever, wherever He is or isn't...

638
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,713
if He really wants me to notice Him...

639
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,015
maybe He should stop being so scarce.

640
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,752
All right.
Why can't a duffer like me catch a fish?

641
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:50,853
[scoffing]

642
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,722
lsn't the answer obvious?

643
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,358
lsn't it because at my present level of skill...

644
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,027
the fish would have to be so damn dumb...

645
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,830
and utterly unelusive
as to be not worth catching?

646
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,598
And how much more elusive...

647
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,268
should a thing as wondrous as a soul be?

648
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,871
Fishermen should be
the easiest of men to convince...

649
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,442
to search for their souls,
because fishing is nothing but...

650
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,143
the pursuit of the elusive.

651
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,114
How can you be so patient
in searching for fish...

652
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,717
and so hasty to write off your soul...

653
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,186
because you can't see it?

654
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,090
[soft guitar music]

655
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,759
[running water]

656
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,319
[soft guitar music continues]

657
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,723
[coins clinking]

658
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,261
[dialing]

659
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,835
Hi.

660
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,838
Yeah . Um...

661
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,774
I was looking for a girl named Eddy...

662
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,376
who works for you.

663
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,546
She-- She worked
at your casting pool...

664
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,484
at that angling fair a couple of months ago?

665
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,553
She got a new job?

666
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,655
Okay. Well,
could you maybe tell me...

667
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,790
you know, where she's working now?

668
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,761
No, because
of privacy issues. Right.

669
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:19,101
Well, is there a supervisor that
I could talk to or something?

670
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,240
[metallic clank]

671
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,545
[hangs up]

672
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,520
[running water]

673
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,896
(Gus)
You must be the only living thing left in here.

674
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,472
[sighing]

675
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,977
I'm thinking about an ant.
That sound good?

676
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,797
[soft guitar music]

677
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,581
(Gus)
Do you think the soul strikes harder
early in the morning...

678
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,916
and late in the evening...

679
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,050
kind of like fish?

680
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,353
Could be.

681
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,988
Okay. So how
do you suppose...

682
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,422
I ought to fish for mine?

683
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,058
With a soul pole, I suppose.

684
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,060
Where do I get one?

685
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,895
Right here's good.

686
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,297
This where you got yours?

687
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,398
I got mine here.

688
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:06,002
You got yours in there.

689
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,871
[walla and soft music]

690
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,311
I still can't figure out
where this soul pole is.

691
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,479
Shall I show you?

692
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,346
Can you?

693
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,848
I can by analogy.

694
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,350
But you'll have to answer a few questions first.

695
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,852
Fire away.

696
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,620
All right.

697
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:28,557
Where is Rodney, your trusty fishing rod...

698
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,692
right now?

699
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,193
At this moment...

700
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,896
he is hanging on my cabin wall.

701
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,464
Who made Rodney...

702
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,233
from an indistinguishable blank...

703
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,036
into the singing rod he is today?

704
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,370
I did.

705
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,672
Yes. And who controls
his destiny?

706
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,441
Decides when he'll hang on the wall...

707
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,276
or ride in the back of the pickup truck...

708
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,644
or cast for trout?

709
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,680
And who will, one day, decide he's worn out...

710
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,083
and consign him to a funeral pyre?

711
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,084
I will.

712
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,252
Excellent.

713
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,121
Can you get me a couple of cues?

714
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,389
Yeah . Two of them.

715
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,426
Now, who do you suppose...

716
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,562
created you...

717
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,998
into the living fisherman you are today?

718
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,132
I wish I knew.

719
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,267
Excellent!

720
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,835
And who controls your destiny?

721
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,370
Wish I knew that, too.

722
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,306
Very good . And who will,
one day...

723
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,742
consign your body to a wormy grave?

724
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,010
I wish I knew that, too.

725
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,011
Perfect!

726
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,312
Why is that perfect?

727
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,015
All I'm saying is,
"Oh, I wish I knew."

728
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,417
Come on . Don't you
want me to say...

729
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,820
"God does it," or,
"My soul does it"--

730
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:34,757
Gus, I'm a philosopher.
I'm not an evangelist.

731
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:38,494
It's the "I wish I knew" that is crucial.

732
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,464
I mean, to say, "God did it,"
and then just leave it at that?

733
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,633
That's to abandon the search
before it's even begun.

734
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,436
Believe me, no one's ever
discovered any truth...

735
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:52,074
by barfing up Sunday school
answers to questions.

736
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,710
Now, you and I agreed, did we not...

737
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,146
that Rodney is oblivious...

738
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,715
to everything save some weight and varnish.

739
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,950
We did.

740
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,419
Therefore, does it follow...

741
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,021
that he is just as oblivious...

742
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,823
to Gus?

743
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,959
Even though Gus is his maker?

744
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,229
Even though Gus controls his destiny?

745
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,763
Even though Gus is--

746
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:18,367
Let's go ahead and call it.
Gus is his essence.

747
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,502
Yes, it follows.

748
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,204
Then therefore, is it possible...

749
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,173
that maybe you and I...

750
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,474
are just as oblivious...

751
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,076
to the presence of a Creator?

752
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,513
Just as oblivious to a controller of destiny?

753
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,415
Just as oblivious to our essence?

754
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,752
An essence that wields you
and I even more deftly...

755
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,020
than you wield Rodney.

756
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,557
Sure, it's possible.

757
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,825
Well, there you have it.

758
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,860
Rodney is to Gus...

759
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,296
as Gus is to his essence.

760
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,765
You name the essence soul and you, sir...

761
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,433
have your soul pole.

762
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,136
Me?

763
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,072
So, no matter how hopelessly stupid I am...

764
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:02,111
in comparison to my essence or my soul...

765
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:06,282
I still have a profound purpose.

766
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,684
I like that, Titus.

767
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,252
I like that.

768
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,620
Thank you.

769
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,424

know any good tales about

If you want to catch a blueback...

804
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:46,909
you're gonna need some lighter gear.

805
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,211
You have any with you?

806
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,719

807
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,220

00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,525
Look at that.

and write this up for tomorrow's paper.

841
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,747

00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,682

The F-F-Fishing Dutchman.

00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,251
You're Dutch Hines.

845
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,287
Yeah . What's your name?

846
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,189
I'm just Gus.

847
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,291
But that's really just a nickname.

848
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,194
So I wouldn't-- I would--
I wouldn't use that.

849
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,730
You know, I'd like to interview you, Gus.

850
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,533
Haven't had
a better day's f-f-fishing...

851
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,637
since I lost nine steelhead
one morning on the Kilchis...

852
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,208
two winters ago.
I was fishing with Fuzz Gramsay.

853
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,277
Yeah, I-- I remember that trip.
You wrote about it 12 times.

854
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:06,782
Yeah ! So, you wanna do
an interview?

855
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:10,586
Um, c-c--

856
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,821
Can I have one second?

857
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,157
Sure.

858
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,297
Dutch Hines wants to interview me.

859
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,100
That idiot's got three-quarter
of a million readers.

860
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,637
He can write about me for weeks
and not be distracted.

861
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,873
Nothing's gonna distract him for months...

862
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,742
'cause he's not gonna catch a fish for months.

863
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,745
He made Fuzz Gramsay rich by endorsing him.

864
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,350
He endorses me...

865
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,453
and I'll have a thousand polers
by the end of the month.

866
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,194
Well, what do you say?
You want to do an interview?

867
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,730

"But he told us this
is just a nickname."

877
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:27,729
Okay. My real name
is Antoine Chapeau.

878
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:32,935
I'm originally from Palm Springs, California...

879
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,736
where I used
to manage a--

880
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,806
[clears throat]
a beauty salon.

881
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,374
And I would spend my whole day...

882
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,412
just looking at women's hair.

883
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,479
But you know what, Dutch?

884
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,881
I thought I was going crazy...

885
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,849
because I'd be looking at a woman's hair...

886
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,286
and I'd be imagining
five-pound tippets.

887
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,690
Or algae or something.
Three-pound leaders.
It doesn't matter.

888
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:58,860
Everything reminded me
of--of the river.

889
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,495
So finally I said, you know what?

890
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,565
Antoine, this can't be healthy.

891
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,801
So I pulled up the stakes.
I moved to Oregon...

892
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,836
and I just started fishing.

893
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,038
All day every day, fishing.

894
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,975
(Titus)
"And fish he does, with a passion and skill...

895
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,043
"he claimed he acquired using a fly rod...

896
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,679
"out in the deserts around Palm Springs.

897
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,382
"This dry fishing, as he calls it,
is what taught him...

898
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:24,286
"both the incredible patience
and the shamanistic approach...

899
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,189
to the sport
that characterizes him today."

900
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,725
(Dutch)
Listen, I gotta get back to the paper. Uh...

901
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,660
what do you say we meet again next week...

902
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,462
and you tell me some more?

903
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:38,100
Okay. But only if you put
a message in the paper for me.

"Will the girl who ran from the guy...

(Kernie)
Gus!
[kids shouting]

915
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,142
We want to go fishing.

916
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,010
It's time for another lesson.

917
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,845
Hey, guys. Can we
do it another time?

918
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,981
I just-- I just don't
really feel like it.

919
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,017
[all chanting]
Fishing. Fishing. Fishing.

920
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,853
Let's go fishing.
[chanting continues]

921
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,655
Let's go.

922
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,223
Here we go.

923
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,673
(man)
Very nice.

924
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,580
Hey, hey.

925
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,648
Gimme.

926
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:00,382
Stop. It's snagged.

927
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:01,516
Gimme.

928
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,584
What?

929
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,352
It's snagged . See?

930
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,387
Oh, man.

931
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,922
Whoa, whoa, hey!

932
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,457
Hemingway, come here.

933
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,591
Come here. Hey!

934
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,493
Do you wanna catch this fish?

935
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,695
[shouting]

936
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,799

937
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:22,704
[soft lively music continues]

938
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,947
Just get right here.
That's the spot, okay?

939
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,317
Just head west.
Just head west, all right?

940
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,253
There you go.
Good luck.

941
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,022
How's it going?

942
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,391
Yeah, I fish out here everyday with 'em.

943
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,626
Those are good.

944
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,567
Good luck.

945
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,969
How's it going?

946
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,773
Uh,

947
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,078
Yeah.

948
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,946
Uh.

949
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,115
Good luck.

950
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,133
[soft guitar music]

951
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,133
[walla]

952
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,139
[soft guitar music continues]

953
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,975
[fire softly cracking]

954
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:56,524
See, I read that I should bring
a loaded gun with me, so...

955
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,628
I took your advice to the letter.

956
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,965
I believe you have my pole.

957
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,535
Right.

958
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,885
And a fish.

959
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,936
Wait, wait, wait.
I--I get the pole and the fish, but...

960
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,407
what's this?

961
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:49,244
The belly reel that goes with the--
the pole.

962
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,851
And how'd you know I'd come for them?

963
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,853
[chuckling softly]
I didn't.

964
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,392
Everything in the world
made me think you wouldn't.

965
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,537
There is something I should tell you.

966
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,741
About that day.

967
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,210
I never ran.

968
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,679
Huh?

969
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,615
I never ran away.

970
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,852
I was barefoot.
So I...

971
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,687
hid in the woods and...

972
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,223
I saw you climb above that pole...

973
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,225
where I hooked the steelhead.

974
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,398
And then, I stepped on an orange...

975
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,601
and this.

976
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,608
See, when you came crashing along...

977
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,877
you came from upstream.

978
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:56,811
Uh--

979
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,179
And the orange--

980
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,983
Huh? And the orange
and this, this telescope...

981
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,120
this telescope were downstream.

982
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,821
Now, I mean, come on.
It doesn't take

983
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,289
Sherlock freakin' Holmes--

984
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,324
Okay.

985
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,458
Okay, okay, okay.

986
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,293
Just listen to me for a second.

987
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,828
Spying on me.
While I was--

988
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,163
Okay, wait,
hu-- Hold-- No--

989
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,464
While I was--

990
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,435
Hold on.
Just give me a second.

991
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:24,372
Okay, I admit that is my telescope.

992
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:30,378
And I'm s-sorry that I was spying on you, but...

993
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,514
really, I was just wandering around...

994
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,383
looking for a place to swim and then...

995
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,620
there was you.

996
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,792
This beautiful girl.

997
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,026
And you were fishing.

998
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,528
And the "here goes nothing" way...

999
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,229
you chucked that hazel pole...

1000
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:51,232
into the water, and the way you dove in
and swam after it, I--

1001
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,436
I just knew that you had some way
of looking at things...

1002
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,538
some way of looking at life and the world...

1003
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,506
which is exactly the way of looking at things...

1004
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,375
that I've been trying to look at things.

1005
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,177
I n my whole life, I've only met two people...

1006
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,245
who have ever looked at things...

1007
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,848
any way close to that way.

1008
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,116
My little brother...

1009
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,884
and a philosopher who talks to his dog.

1010
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:13,321
And with both of them it was
love at first sight, too.

1011
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,429
But I'm not sorry.

1012
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,500
When you see the most amazing...

1013
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,901
beautiful thing you've ever seen...

1014
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,604
you don't think about what's right or polite...

1015
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,440
or tell it to cover up.

1016
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,043
Because you can't stop looking.

1017
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,544
You s--

1018
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,746
You're just helpless.

1019
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,691
[chuckling]

1020
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,730
What's so funny?

1021
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,966
I'm sorry.
[chuckling]

1022
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,237
You.

1023
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,439
I n a tree.

1024
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,742
Spouting off stuff like...

1025
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,211
"Oh, good scholar"

1026
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,781
and that "God never made...

1027
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,385
"a more pure, innocent recreation...

1028
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,754
than angling ."
[chuckling]

1029
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,128
I like that, Gus.

1030
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,268
Can I ask you a question?

1031
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,936
Yeah.

1032
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:38,473
What are you doing here?

1033
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,774
This is my cabin.

1034
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,676
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

1035
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,145
No.

1036
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,582
Not here, here.
I mean--

1037
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,851
Here!

1038
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,187
Here.

1039
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,589
Alone.

1040
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,533
Fishing.

1041
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,504
What are you doing here?

1042
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,776
Here here?

1043
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,379
Here here.

1044
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:22,951
[breathes in and exhales]

1045
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,787
Fishing.

1046
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,525
You know, I saw you in Portland.

1047
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,329
You did?
Where?

1048
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,366
I saw you rescue that trout
from that filthy creek.

1049
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,636
I guess you could say it made me...

1050
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,040
[soft guitar music]

1051
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,108
So, I drove up here...

1052
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,078
to see what I could see.

1053
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,113
And I ran into this little boy...

1054
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,551
who called himself Hemingway.
[chuckling]

1055
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:57,819
And he immediately...

1056
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,754
launched into this epic tale...

1057
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,558
about a giant fish that he caught with help...

1058
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:08,563
from a certain superhero named Gus.

1059
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,199
Who spent seven minutes under water

1060
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,102
before he wrassled the fish with his bare hands.

1061
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:15,270
Bullshit.

1062
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,304
I know.

1063
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,440
That's what I figured.

1064
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,310
But I could see in his eyes...

1065
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,080
what little Hemingway thought of you...

1066
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:30,051
and it made me even more curious.

1067
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:37,225
[crickets, running water and soft guitar music]

1068
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,559
You know, I must have read...

1069
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,762
that Fishing Dutchman's article...

1070
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,665
like, 8000 times.

1071
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,000
I knew it was you.

1072
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,304
And this time I came to see you.

1073
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,443
And you know what happened next?

1074
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:59,080
Yeah.

1075
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,616
You do?

1076
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,818
Yeah.

1077
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:27,875
[soft guitar music continues]

1078
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,650
(Eddy)
You threw his prize fish in the fire?

1079
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,452
(Gus)
It wasn't just any fish.

1080
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,687
He was Nijinsky.

1081
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,127
(Eddy)
That went over real well, I'm sure.

1082
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,464
[Gus, chuckling]
Uh, not really.

1083
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,567
I haven't even spoken to either of them since.

1084
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:57,004
I don't even know why I came out here.

1085
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,574
Guess I just needed to get away.

1086
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,510
Your parents seem like an interesting match.

1087
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:06,247
I nteresting is a kind word for it.

1088
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:16,357
[clicking]

1089
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,863
[reel whirring]

1090
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,532
[lively guitar music]

1091
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:28,536
Bravo, Nijinsky.

1092
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,271
(Gus, off)
There are two stories...

1093
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,806
of how Nijinsky found his way...

1094
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,741
onto my parents' mantle.

1095
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,311
The one that landed my father his book deal.

1096
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,380
And the one that's the truth.

1097
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,849
Both versions begin the same way.

1098
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,284
With an epic struggle...

1099
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,520
between a determined young fly fisherman...

1100
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,722
and a giant steelhead.

1101
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,290
Little did either of them realize...

1102
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,858
that their true nemesis...

1103
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,561
was lurking somewhere down river.

1104
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,156
[soft guitar music]

1105
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,595
[mumbling]

1106
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,773
[whirring]

1107
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,910
[snap, whirring stops]

1108
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,983
(Gus, off)
It was my father's worst nightmare.

1109
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,318
A mere plunker of worms...

1110
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,553
had cost him his prized Nijinsky.

1111
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,455
Whoever this crude interloper was...

1112
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:55,723
he would have to be dealt with.

1113
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:56,757
You--

1114
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,125
(Gus)
Man to man.

1115
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,428
had best refrain from that pole
and defend yourself.

1116
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,430
Because one of us is going in that river...

1117
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,065
in search of my fish!

1118
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,566
(woman)
So be it, slicker.

1119
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,502
But I
guaran-goddamn-tee ya...

1120
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,203
It ain't gonna be me.

1121
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,342
Come on and fight me!

1122
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,044
Come on and fight me!
Come on.

1123
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,120
[reel whirring]

1124
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,122
Oops.

1125
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:39,066
[grunts]

1126
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,570
[splashing]

1127
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,772
(Gus, off)
As my father watched the woman...

1128
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,707
reel in Nijinsky for herself...

1129
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,309
he had no idea...

1130
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,645
that she would become his lifetime adversary.

1131
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:51,913
[thump]

1132
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,748
She would also become my mom.

1133
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,584
[Henning, laughing]

1134
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,702
Looks like you could use a little warming up.

1135
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,876
(Gus, off) My parents came to an understanding.

1136
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,013
The story would be told as maybe
it should have been.

1137
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,748
After all, my father reasoned...

1138
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,217
she did cause his six-pound
tippet to snap...

1139
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,621
and he had spent all that time
tiring the fish out...

1140
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,624
making it easy for Ma to just reel him in.

1141
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,164
So the deal was sealed.

1142
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,932
H2O would have his story.

1143
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,367
But never again...

1144
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,636
would they use anything resembling reason...

1145
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,706
in their discussion of the art of angling.

1146
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,041
Never again would they go fishing together...

1147
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:58,512
and never would their marriage
vows waver or weaken.

1148
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,948
[reel clicking]

1149
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,585
[snap]

1150
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,388
Darn it.
[thump]

1151
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,461
Fly tying is for certain a tedious task...

1152
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:17,832
but there's no need to let it get
to you like that, my love.

1153
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:22,703
Yeah, well,
it ain't the fly that's bothering me.

1154
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,006
Hm . Gus.

1155
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,907
I just can't help but feel...

1156
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,344
like we let him go.

1157
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,679
You can't keep a person...

1158
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,815
in a place he doesn't want to be.

1159
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,551
No, but can't you at least make it a place...

1160
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,221
that they might wanna visit?

1161
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,353
[sobbing]

1162
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,225
Cripes.

1163
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:39,313
Give me the other one.

1164
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,493
[running water]

1165
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,344
What's that?

1166
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:15,049
Um, it's today's dreefee.

1167
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:18,419
What'd you say?

1168
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,554
When you were a kid, didn't you have...

1169
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,356
you know, some stuffed animal...

1170
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,058
or a ratty blanket or something...

1171
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,392
that you just absolutely...

1172
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,994
could not go to sleep without?

1173
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,429
[chuckling]

1174
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,531
I had the grossest pillow...

1175
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,233
that I had to take everywhere.

1176
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,369
Okay. Well,
Bill Bob has dreefees.

1177
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,971
Okay.

1178
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:42,243
A dreefee is a, um...

1179
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,978
it's a carefully selected relic...

1180
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,946
of that day's adventure.

1181
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,349
So there's a different one every night.

1182
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,218
And just as important as the dreefee itself...

1183
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:55,022
is the placement of the dreefee.

1184
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,158
And if that's altered in any way...

1185
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,759
before Bill Bob falls asleep...

1186
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,129
it has the same effect of not having one at all.

1187
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,332
And he doesn't fuss, he doesn't protest,
he just--

1188
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,202
doesn't go to sleep.

1189
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,570
All night long.

1190
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:10,671
M m-hm.

1191
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,139
Wow.

1192
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:15,976
[chuckling]

1193
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,112
There was one time that the dreefee was...

1194
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:22,349
a--it was
a dried-up dog turd.

1195
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,785
And it had just--
It had been bleached white...

1196
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,022
by, you know, the sun and the elements, and...

1197
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:32,126
and it was shaped exactly like
a tiny sleeping polar bear.

1198
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,529
But Bill Bob said that it was a tiny
sleeping polar bear.

1199
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,099
And that it had been eaten by a dog
and then it had proved indigestible...

1200
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,801
and then it had been eliminated...

1201
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,770
and due to its unmentionable...

1202
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,005
experience in the dog, it was in a coma.

1203
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,043
Bill Bob was going to invoke
the powers of the Tooth Fairy...

1204
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:53,314
to bring it back to life.

1205
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:57,551
But Ma just threw the poor polar bear
out the window...

1206
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,520
without a question or even a glance...

1207
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:04,692
at its miraculously sculpted bearness.

1208
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:08,395
She didn't believe his story.

1209
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,565
Guess not.

1210
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,668
And he didn't sleep all night long?

1211
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,937
M m-mm.

1212
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,650
[birds chirping]

1213
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,875
Here we go.

1214
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,011
Where are we going?

1215
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:04,485
Well, I'm going to Portland tonight...

1216
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,521
and you...

1217
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,523
you're staying here.

1218
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:10,658
Come on.

1219
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:11,992
Come on what?

1220
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:16,163
What's the lightest leader you've got?

1221
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,965
Three pound.

1222
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,701
All right, hand me the rod.

1223
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,538
Tie it up and bait it.

1224
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,240
Come on.

1225
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,942
Will it...

1226
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,344
will it mess up your plan if I ask...

1227
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:33,213
what exactly you're doing?

1228
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,748
[splash]

1229
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,116
I'm fishing.

1230
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,217
You do realize...

1231
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,786
there's nothing but Chinook...

1232
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,889
in the water right now, don't you?

1233
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:42,923
I know that.

1234
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,192
Those can weigh fifty pounds.

1235
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,729
I know.

1236
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:50,297
So...

1237
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,999
even if it were possible...

1238
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,235
to hook a Chinook...

1239
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:58,138
on that leader without breaking it

1240
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:02,242
you couldn't land him even if
you played him all night.

1241
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,047
I know that.

1242
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:12,019
But you have to leave before dark.

1243
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,088
I do.

1244
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,957
But you don't, Gus.

1245
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,126
Got to follow through with the plan.

1246
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,212
[suspenseful music]

1247
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,681

There. Come here, Gus.

01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,150
[laughs]
Come here.

1249
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:46,720
Take the rod.
[whirring]

1250
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,223
Keep your tip up.

1251
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,691
Don't fight it.

1252
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:55,295
[whirring and light splashing]

1253
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,498
Play the Chinook.

1254
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,199
What?

[reel softly clicking]

1265
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,015
Aha.

1266
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,422
[soft clicking continues]

1267
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,698

1269
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,624
You heading home?

1270
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,426
[whirring]

1271
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,163
I thought you might be a girl.

1272
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,424
(Gus, off)
As we walked upriver...

1273
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,860
I felt like we were on a primordial journey...

1274
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:30,430
to some forgotten, ancient home.

1275
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,867
The fisherman in me was being unmade.

1276
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,569
With so light a line...

1277
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,170
there could be no question...

1278
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,273
of ever bringing this great fish to bay.

1279
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,542
So there would be no betrayal.

1280
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:45,779
No struggle.
No sacrifice.

1281
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:47,814
No death.

1282
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,416
There was only a Chinook...

1283
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,017
leading an undone fisherman...

1284
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:53,286
deeper into the night.

1285
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,286
[soft music continues]

1286
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,644

[soft guitar music]

1289
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,688
(Gus, off)
As I watched the sun wake the valley...

1290
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:13,026
I felt as though an oldest,
greatest, longest-lost friend...

1291
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:17,163
had come to walk the road, unseen, beside me.

1292
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,199
And just as quickly that feeling left...

1293
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,968
and blended with the sunlight.

1294
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,873
I knew from this point on there was no escape...

1295
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,776
and nowhere to go.

1296
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,279
I was already there.

1297
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:36,082
[music becomes more lively]

1298
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,253

It's Glum Gus.

1327
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,969
His name is...

01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,340
Gus.

(Mom)
Hen?

1330
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,244
(Gus, off)
People often don't know what they're talking about.

1331
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,479
But when they talk about love...

1332
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:37,217
they really don't know
what they're talking about.

1333
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,419
The one sure thing you can say about love...

1334
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:42,322
is that there isn't much you can say about it.

1335
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:43,990
Not that you shouldn't try.

1336
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,625
You can make analogies.

1337
01:37:45,759 --> 01:37:47,560
Love is like a lot of things.

1338
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,363
One thing it's like is a trout stream.

1339
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:53,233
Try to capture a trout stream with a dam...

1340
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,901
and you get a lake.

1341
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,703
Try to catch it in a bucket...

1342
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:58,738
and you get a bucket of water.

1343
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,607
Put some under a microscope...

1344
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:02,075
and you get a close-up look...

1345
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:05,011
at some writhing
micro-cooties.

1346
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:08,882
But a trout stream...

1347
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:11,484
is only a trout stream...

1348
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,288
when it's flowing between its own two banks...

1349
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,658
at its own pace...

1350
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:21,294
in its own sweet way.
