1
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,877
- Hey, fella.
- Huh?

2
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,936
You thinking
of jumping?

3
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,709
- Why, what's it to you?
- Nothing.

4
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,616
- You got any cash?
- Huh?

5
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,847
It's not gonna do you
any good down there.

6
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,583
Oh, for...

7
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:27,085
Much obliged.

8
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,462
Nice watch.

9
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,105
Thank you.
You have a nice day.

10
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,439
Hey, fella,
it's none of my business,

11
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,842
but you really
picked a lousy spot.

12
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,848
- What are you talking about?
- There's too much traffic.

13
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:49,249
You jump here,
a car could swerve, cause an accident,

14
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:50,809
hurt some people.

15
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,822
You'd never
forgive yourself.

16
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:56,019
Oh, I guess
you're right.

17
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:59,688
Thank you.
Where would be a good spot?

18
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,754
There's an on-ramp
over there.

19
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:04,767
I bet it'd be perfect.
I'll show you if you'd like.

20
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,826
Oh, you're
very kind.

21
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,972
See? Isn't this better?

22
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,379
Much better.
Thanks again for your help.

23
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:20,780
My pleasure.

24
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,615
Hey, you mind
if I watch?

25
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,848
I never saw anyone
do this before.

26
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,857
If it bothers you,
just say so.

27
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,086
- I don't mind.
- Great.

28
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,323
I'll just stay over here.
Give you a little privacy.

29
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,211
- Excuse me.
- What?

30
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,378
I got some other things to do today,
if you're gonna be awhile.

31
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,819
No no no no.

32
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,982
I mean, I could go,
and I could come back.

33
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,288
There's no need for that.

34
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,501
I can't do it.
I cannot do it!

35
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,005
Oh, hell,
who needs this?

36
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,009
Wait wait, look,
I have no place to stay.

37
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,034
No place to go.
I'll need some money.

38
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,046
Hey, what am I,
the Salvation Army?

39
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,378
You need money,
go get a job and earn it.

40
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,514
Come on,
I'll buy you a drink.

41
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,226
So why'd you want
to end it all?

42
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:43,528
- Nothing to live for.
- You had a hard life?

43
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,262
Not always.

44
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:49,669
This time last year
I had $10 million.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,765
Oh yeah, sure.

46
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,969
I did.
I had everything.

47
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,070
I had a beautiful home
in Beverly Hills.

48
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:01,743
Beautiful wife
and a beautiful mistress.

49
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,083
A beautiful dog.

50
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,955
Most beautiful of all,
I had a son, Michael.

51
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:13,395
He just graduated from college
and was traveling through Europe.

52
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,522
And I had a lot
of good friends.

53
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,261
Aram, you already got
that full house?

54
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,202
lt'll cost you 10
to find out.

55
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,296
I'm out!

56
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,899
Me too.

57
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,934
Aram, I will...

58
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,572
see your 10

59
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:34,174
and raise you 10.

60
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,948
- Oh, be still my heart.
- I fold.

61
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,614
Now let us see.

62
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,123
He needs a straight
to beat what's showing,

63
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,093
but three eights
were already out.

64
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:48,256
Now does he have
the necessary eight of spades?

65
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,164
Well, it'll cost you
10 to find out.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,430
Come on, come on.

67
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,868
Wait, I have to
do this logically.

68
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,964
Will you notice Harry
is looking me straight in the eye?

69
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:01,101
For 20 years, whenever he looked
anybody in the eye, forget it,

70
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,305
he was bluffing.
When he really had the goods,

71
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,440
he just looked down
at his hand.

72
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,007
But a couple of months ago,
he must have figured I was onto him

73
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,680
because he reversed
himself, and ooh, it worked.

74
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,689
He did pretty good
for a couple of weeks.

75
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,691
But last week I realized
what was going on,

76
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,750
and I took him
for a bundle.

77
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:22,629
So this week, he has
probably reversed himself again,

78
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:25,395
which should mean
he does not have

79
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,835
the necessary
eight of spades.

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,430
Would you please put
your money where your logic is?

81
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,804
All right, all right,
all right.

82
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,571
10 and I raise
you 10.

83
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,376
I will see your 10
and 20 more.

84
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:42,714
I could be wrong,
but a man has to do

85
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,310
what a man has to do.

86
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:46,685
- Did you say 20?
- 20.

87
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,690
20 and I will
raise you 30.

88
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,919
Ooh, Harry, the price
of poker just went up.

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,793
I will see your 30,
and I will raise you...

90
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,855
one, two, three, four,
five... 50!

91
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:59,561
I am going to
raise you 100.

92
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:03,800
100, 100, damn!

93
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,476
I love it.
I love it. I love it.

94
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,845
This could go on
all night.

95
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,180
How could you be sure
he didn't have the eight of spades?

96
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,709
He could have been pulling a double
reverse. He might have had it.

97
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:21,689
That would have
made two of us.

98
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,157
You bastard, you.

99
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,286
Oh, what a night. Good jokes,
good pastrami, I made a bundle.

100
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,231
And ooh, to top it off, I got
to humiliate one of my closest friends.

101
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,394
It doesn't get
better than this.

102
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,332
I had a thriving business.

103
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,364
A business I built up from nothing,
that I was very proud of.

104
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:41,808
I had a dozen stores,

105
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,642
but I treated each
as if it were the only one.

106
00:07:56,592 --> 00:08:00,028
Come in.

107
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,962
Sir, what can
I do for you?

108
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:09,662
Mr. Katourian, you're on another
inspection tour, I see.

109
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,606
No no, Mr. Macrae.
I don't inspect. I spy.

110
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,940
I spy on box boys,
butchers, checkers.

111
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,411
What I spy
with my little eye,

112
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,971
I do not like,
Mr. Macrae.

113
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,450
- Problem?
- Yes, a problem.

114
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,680
A problem with the supervision
of this supermarket.

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,382
Do you follow baseball,
Mr. Macrae?

116
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,550
- A little.
- Strike one.

117
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,583
I asked a clerk
in the vegetable section,

118
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:33,254
"Where are the fresh
chick-peas?"

119
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,821
Without looking up, he said,
"Three aisles over to your left."

120
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,231
In a Katourian market,
when a customer asks

121
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,428
the location of an item,
what should happen?

122
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,869
The employee should personally
take the customer

123
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:46,602
to the desired item.
I tell the staff regularly

124
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,303
- that it's their job...
- Strike two.

125
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:51,836
I had to wait behind five customers
at the checkout counter.

126
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,849
At a Katourian
checkout counter,

127
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,681
what happens when three
or more customers form a line?

128
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,813
Another counter is opened. The
vegetables arrived late this morning.

129
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,256
- I told the staff...
- How are eggs bagged, Mr. Macrae?

130
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,260
Always on top of the bag,
of course.

131
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,262
Staff knows that.
Otherwise, they get broken.

132
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,026
Would you find the eggs
in that bag, please?

133
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,503
Strike three.

134
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,310
Mr. Katourian...

135
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,341
Mr. Macrae I do not procure the finest
organically grown eggs

136
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,218
from the finest organically grown
chickens so that my customers

137
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,986
can find an organically grown mess
at the bottom of their shopping bags.

138
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,324
Go ahead.

139
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,695
- Yes.
- Is Mr. Katourian there?

140
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,098
Yes, he's here.

141
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,126
- Hello.
- Aram.

142
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,502
- Oh, yes, Millie.
- Michael called.

143
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,803
- Oh, he did, Michael called?
- I just talked to him.

144
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,776
- Where from?
- The airport.

145
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,142
The airport here in LA?
He's home?

146
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,204
- Yes.
- Tell him to wait there, I'll get him.

147
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:02,740
- No, he's taking a taxi.
- He's okay? He sounds all right?

148
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,618
- He's fine.
- Good, I'll be right home.

149
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,684
Macrae, keep up
the good work.

150
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,353
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,363
- Good disguise, huh?
- One of your best.

152
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,875
Oh, Michael, oh!

153
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,544
There he is!

154
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,780
Hey, wave at the camera.
Wave at the camera!

155
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,086
- Face the camera.
- Dad! Hi, Dad!

156
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:44,354
- Hi, Dad!
- Still going, still going.

157
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:48,523
There we go.
It's so good to see you, son.

158
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,794
Hey, this is Bob.
Dad, Mom... Bob.

159
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,734
Do me a favor.
Could you hold that camera there?

160
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,706
Get on that side.
Here we go.

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,708
Point it at us.
That's it.

162
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,007
Up a little, I think. Can you see
all three? Okay. There we go.

163
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:09,279
Wonder if Michael gave any thought
to a career while he was away.

164
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,377
Why didn't you ask him?

165
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,388
I didn't want
to pressure him.

166
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,686
You know,
first night home.

167
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,989
I didn't want him to feel like he's
gotta get up tomorrow

168
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,222
and start looking
for a job.

169
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:25,165
Very important decision
what a young man does with his life.

170
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,192
I don't wanna
push him.

171
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,811
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,768
Again, the pool.

173
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,070
He was there when I went to work
this morning.

174
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,344
He didn't spend
all day lying there, did he?

175
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:11,972
No, he had a friend
over and they played some tennis.

176
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:15,575
Tennis, good.

177
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,644
It's funny.
I can't understand it.

178
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,655
I mean,
it's been 10 days.

179
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,657
When I was his age,
I had three jobs.

180
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,659
I was taking
a night course

181
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,661
in business
administration,

182
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,129
knocking myself out trying to get
somewhere in the world.

183
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,360
You should talk to him.
You never talk to him.

184
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,368
Hey, this has
to come from him.

185
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,870
If he wants to try
to make something of himself,

186
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,930
it has to be because
he wanted to do it.

187
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:41,067
And he will.
That I know.

188
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,805
You want him
to be like you, Aram?

189
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,109
No, I don't want him
to be like me.

190
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,776
I just don't want him
to be like him.

191
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,457
Hey.

192
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,485
- Hey!
- Hey, Dad, how you doing?

193
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,759
Fine fine.
How are you doing?

194
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:04,857
- Great.
- Good.

195
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,028
- Good party last night?
- That was the night before.

196
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,595
Went to a concert
last night with my friend Linda.

197
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,506
- Oh, Linda. Rock concert, right.
- Yeah.

198
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,103
Party was okay.
Concert was a little disappointing.

199
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,376
That's too bad.

200
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,280
And a baseball game
tonight.

201
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,683
No no, change of plans. Some friends
are going to The Comedy Store.

202
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,712
- They asked me to go.
- Busy busy busy.

203
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

204
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,084
- Dad, what time is it?
- 6:00

205
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,187
I think I'll go in
and take a nap for an hour

206
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,428
before I get dressed.
Kinda sleepy.

207
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,027
Got to bed late
last night, huh?

208
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,038
Yeah, then Shaggy
woke me up at 6:00 in the morning.

209
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,937
I couldn't get
back to sleep.

210
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:48,034
Yeah, he always barks
when I'm driving away.

211
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,137
- I'll try to keep him quiet.
- Thanks, Dad.

212
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,094
Price check on four,
please.

213
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:24,479
Young man, could you
tell me which melon is the ripest?

214
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,538
I think you'll find
this is the sweet one.

215
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,550
The texture is nice
and rough,

216
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,552
and you can even hear
a little liquid.

217
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:33,487
- It should be just right.
- Thank you. You do your job very well.

218
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,490
Well, thank you,
Mr. Katourian.

219
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,822
- I should have worn the false eyebrows.
- No, I saw you

220
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,829
rearranging the tomatoes
when you thought no one was looking.

221
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,956
I'd heard stories about you.
I put two and two together.

222
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,728
- What's your name?
- Steve Harrison.

223
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,134
Steve, you're a very
bright young man, Steve.

224
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,435
I think maybe you're ready to handle
a more responsible position.

225
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,465
- The Northridge branch...
- That's very kind of you.

226
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,671
But I'm leaving next week.
I'm going back to school.

227
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,680
I just took a semester off
to earn some money.

228
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:00,944
- What are you studying?
- Architecture.

229
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,042
Oh, architecture,
that's a wonderful field.

230
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,883
Well, I'm sure you'll succeed
at whatever you do.

231
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,946
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Steve.

232
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,791
I'll bet your parents are very
proud of you.

233
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,887
I hope so.

234
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,830
Price check from produce,
please.

235
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,578
What's he doing?

236
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,911
Michael?
He's by the pool.

237
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,916
What could be going on
in the boy's head?

238
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,918
He's been out of college
for six months.

239
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,216
There's not been
one word about a job.

240
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,848
What's he wanna be,
a bum all his life?

241
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,858
I have to speak
to him, don't I?

242
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,053
Yes, Aram,
you really should.

243
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,495
God, it's so hard.

244
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,225
We get along
so well,

245
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,359
and I am terrified
of spoiling that.

246
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,734
God, I love that boy
so much, Millie.

247
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,740
He loves you too,
and he won't stop loving you

248
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,004
just because you tell
him how you feel.

249
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,409
Probably.

250
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,654
- Thank you so much.
- Good night.

251
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,462
Dad, you would have been proud
the way I got it out of that sand-trap.

252
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,935
- Why get in the sand?
- It was there.

253
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,029
- This is great, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

254
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
Mom was gonna have
an early supper

255
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,770
before she joined her bridge group.
I said, "Oh, no.

256
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,837
No no no, Michael and I, thank you,
are gonna eat out."

257
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:42,146
We'll have a real
boys' night out, huh?

258
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,175
- Right.
- Yeah.

259
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:48,752
This reminds me of that commercial.
I know you've seen it.

260
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,726
I think it's a beer commercial.
Anyhow, the father and son,

261
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,228
they're sitting at a table
in a restaurant like this,

262
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,231
and they're
celebrating something.

263
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,792
Yeah, like, the son
got a great new job.

264
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,804
He passed the bar exam.
It was something like that.

265
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:06,205
It had a nice warm
feeling to it, you know?

266
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:09,005
And they were eating
these big thick juicy steaks,

267
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,171
and they were each
holding a mug of beer.

268
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:14,944
- Hi, can I get you something to drink?
- I'll have a Heineken.

269
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,008
I'll have a pina colada.

270
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,043
Okay.

271
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,995
Your mother asked
me the other day,

272
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,463
do I know anything
about your plans for a career.

273
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,092
- Oh, yeah?
- Mothers mothers mothers.

274
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,695
They always gotta
worry about something, don't they?

275
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,139
I said, "Hey, Millie,

276
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,768
he's gonna make his
own mind up in his own time,

277
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,301
and then he will go out
and he will do it.

278
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,644
And there is no need
to even discuss it."

279
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,547
That's what I told her.

280
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,677
I told her.

281
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,146
One thing I do want
you to know, though.

282
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:58,285
Whatever you do
decide on, I am behind it 100%.

283
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,454
- Thanks, Dad.
- Here you go.

284
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,293
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

285
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,856
I'm not one of those
fathers that says,

286
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,267
"Hey, you have to follow
in my footsteps," or any of that.

287
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,567
Whatever you want
to do, you know?

288
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:14,406
You want to be, a what,
a lawyer, a stockbroker,

289
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:17,037
a deep sea diver?
Okay, whatever.

290
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,013
That is what
I want for you.

291
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,572
You're your own man.

292
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:30,154
I was wondering about
one thing, though,

293
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,219
and that is if you were leaning
in any particular direction.

294
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:37,130
I know you've given this a lot
of thought, and if maybe you might

295
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,997
have narrowed
it down a little,

296
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,867
like business as opposed
to a profession.

297
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:45,340
- No, not really.
- Not really, no.

298
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,842
Well, I just wanted
to get a general idea,

299
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,436
you know, or like,
medicine, let's say.

300
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:54,006
You know, a veterinarian
or a psychoanalyst, a surgeon.

301
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,540
- Anything like that?
- Nothing like that.

302
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,213
Do you remember in biology
when I had to dissect a frog?

303
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,415
I threw up right
in the middle of the class.

304
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:05,722
It could be that you're just not cut
out for the healing arts.

305
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,023
I don't think so.

306
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,088
Ever give any
thought to law?

307
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,293
Oh, what a magnificent
profession.

308
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,599
I don't know.
I hate the idea of taking sides.

309
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,680
- Advertising, advertising.
- Advertising?

310
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,149
Your Uncle Sam
has a lot of agency contacts.

311
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,152
I'm sure he'd be glad to help
you get started.

312
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:34,417
Getting people to buy things they
don't want, don't need and can't afford?

313
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,447
I couldn't live
with myself.

314
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,627
After that I spent a few
days near Lake Balaton.

315
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,427
It's in Hungary.
It's truly magnificent.

316
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,491
You should go
when you have a chance.

317
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:49,402
That sounds very nice.

318
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:54,171
- Let's see, 15% of $52.
- About eight bucks.

319
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,473
Accounting. You were
always good at math.

320
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:58,342
Not really.
Only compared to my other grades.

321
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,473
Besides, being cooped up
in an office all day

322
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,779
helping rich people
cheat on their taxes...

323
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:06,083
Well, maybe you'd rather work outdoors.
There's nothing wrong with that.

324
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,181
A lot of our people are still in
the wine business around Fresno.

325
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:11,522
Nah, just doesn't
interest me.

326
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,552
Come on, Michael. Now there has
to be something in this world

327
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,827
that you want
to do, something.

328
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,734
I guess I'm doing it.

329
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,479
Yeah yeah.

330
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:45,220
- Still awake?
- Yeah yeah, I'm up. I'm up.

331
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,057
Good.

332
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,586
I have to talk
a little bit more.

333
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:52,862
These past months,
see, I was assuming

334
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,461
that you were trying
to figure out what sort of career

335
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,132
you wanted to pursue,
which was fine by me.

336
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,573
You take all
the time you need.

337
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:03,908
It never occurred to me that you might
be considering no career at all.

338
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,312
I mean, that's hard
for me to take in.

339
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,340
I can't conceive
of life without work.

340
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,409
I have to work.

341
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,354
Dad, I guess if you
have to, you have to.

342
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:17,552
Well, it's not just a matter of having
to work, you see?

343
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,220
The fact that I
started with nothing

344
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:23,026
and through hard work
was able to achieve what I have,

345
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,625
can you imagine
what a satisfaction,

346
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,897
what a joy
that is to me?

347
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,631
Sure.

348
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:33,232
Someday I want you
to feel that joy, too.

349
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,743
How can I?

350
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,938
- What do you mean?
- Thanks to you,

351
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,608
I'm starting
with everything.

352
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,917
Dad.

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,224
The light.

354
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,769
Uh-huh.

355
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,468
Yes, okay.

356
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,636
Well, we've just gotten
the initial reports

357
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,270
on the over-the-counter
dealings in New York.

358
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,146
- What happened?
- Well, do you remember

359
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:16,150
when you first approached
my firm about handling

360
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,448
the initial public
offering of Katourian stock?

361
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,421
I told you then I thought that
the first day it was listed

362
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:23,947
it would rise a little,
close around 41, 411/8.

363
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,517
- Yes.
- Well, I'm afraid I was wrong.

364
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,257
It just closed
at 443/8.

365
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:31,356
443/8.

366
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,631
Mr. Katourian, on the shares you hold,
you made a profit today

367
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:37,399
- of approximately...
- Never mind approximately.

368
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:42,138
That's $2,231,250.

369
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:44,304
You're very good
with numbers.

370
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,473
Not numbers, just dollars.
Come here, Mark.

371
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,507
Stuart told me that
you were a very bright young man.

372
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:53,647
Now if you don't mind
my asking, how did you get started

373
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:56,350
in your profession?
Was your father in finance?

374
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,155
- No no, he wasn't.
- Ah, what did he do?

375
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,094
What did he do?

376
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,893
Well, my father was
a thief and a drunk.

377
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,264
And when I was 10,
he ran out on my mother and me

378
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,531
and left us
without a cent.

379
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:13,804
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

380
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:22,315
- Hello, Millie.
- Hi. You're late.

381
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,444
Hurry and change.
We have the arthritis benefit tonight.

382
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,115
Oh, no,
we have to go?

383
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,124
I'm on the committee.

384
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,524
You're on the committee.
Okay, dear, okay.

385
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,995
Everything all right?

386
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,622
Yes, fine.

387
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,498
Oh, fine. We made
a public offering of our stock today.

388
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:43,300
It sold out in one hour.
I made over $2 million.

389
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,273
Isn't that nice?
Do you like these?

390
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,243
Yeah, they're lovely.
Yeah, they're lovely.

391
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:51,768
Hey, didn't we go
to an arthritis benefit just last week?

392
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:53,781
No, that was
multiple sclerosis.

393
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,283
Rodney Dangerfield
entertained, remember?

394
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,343
I thought Rodney Dangerfield
was leukemia.

395
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,822
No no, Barry Manilow
was leukemia.

396
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,849
I could have sworn
that Rodney Dangerfield was leukemia.

397
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,726
Last year Rodney Dangerfield
was leukemia.

398
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:10,629
This year he's
multiple sclerosis.

399
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,758
What is it?
Is it Michael?

400
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,599
No, not just that.
I was thinking of something else.

401
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,901
Like what?

402
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:20,203
Well, like, you remember
when we were first married,

403
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:23,336
living in that dingy
little apartment in Hollywood, huh?

404
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,471
- Oh yeah.
- You remember that I worked

405
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,846
at my uncle's dried-fruit stand
during the day,

406
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,080
and I sold insurance
at night, trying to get ahead

407
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,020
- and make ends meet.
- I remember. You worked very hard.

408
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,547
When I would sell a policy,
and I'd make, what, $70, $80,

409
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,459
do you remember how
we would celebrate? Huh, huh?

410
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:43,089
I'd call you up, and I would say,
"Hey, don't cook."

411
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:46,532
I'd pick up Chinese food
at that little joint on Western Avenue.

412
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,162
I'd bring it home, and we'd lie down
on the living room floor,

413
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,172
watch "Bewitched"
on television

414
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,674
and we'd eat
the Chinese food.

415
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,199
Then we'd make love.

416
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,212
Oh, God, do you
remember how good

417
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,407
that $70 or $80
made us feel?

418
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:02,040
I remember.

419
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,984
Today, I made
$2 million.

420
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,251
And when I told you
about it, you said, "Isn't that nice?"

421
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,259
Well, I was busy
getting ready.

422
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:13,989
I think it's wonderful
what you did with the stock thing.

423
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,997
- The stock thing.
- We're late.

424
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,158
I'm not criticizing
your reaction, Millie.

425
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,361
God, it's perfectly
natural.

426
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:22,734
"Isn't that nice?"

427
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,739
It's not even nice.
It's just numbers.

428
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,638
You know, numbers
in a bank account.

429
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:30,975
That $70, $80.
That really meant something.

430
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:33,310
A pair of shoes,
a new dress.

431
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,782
Down payment
on a refrigerator, huh?

432
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,785
Oh, God, the $70, $80.

433
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,720
That wasn't nice.
That was wonderful.

434
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,848
And that made Millie
proud of me, you know?

435
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:46,292
- Made her want me.
- Want you?

436
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:49,422
You know the last time
that Millie and I made love?

437
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,627
I don't think I was there.
I probably would have remembered.

438
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,431
Four months ago.

439
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,132
We've done it maybe 12 times
in the last two years.

440
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,141
And even then,
it's like a ceremony, you know?

441
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,735
Just going through
the motions.

442
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,768
God, Irene, I wish
I could tell you

443
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,782
how good Millie
used to be at sex.

444
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,047
- Even better than you.
- Oh, that good?

445
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,418
Aram, you really
think your money

446
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,548
has anything to do
with Millie's sex drive?

447
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,353
Absolutely.

448
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:20,190
You've heard the phrase
"Power is an aphrodisiac."

449
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,196
It applies to marriages,
especially.

450
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,996
A poor man has tremendous
power over his wife. She needs him.

451
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,899
Without his support,
her, the kids,

452
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:30,427
they're gonna starve.
She humps the hell out of him.

453
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:34,374
The richer a man is, the less
his wife is dependent upon him,

454
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:36,707
the less power he
has over her,

455
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:40,237
and the less sexy he becomes to her.
It's a law of nature.

456
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:44,685
Horniness equals dependence
times poverty squared.

457
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,313
Oh, God.

458
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,880
When I'd bring that
$70, $80 home, Irene,

459
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:52,119
I was so happy.

460
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,493
I mean, I knew what I was working for.
I knew what I wanted to get.

461
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,022
Aram, you wanted to
get where you are now.

462
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,592
Yeah yeah.

463
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,604
I wanted to get
where I am now.

464
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:07,165
I struggled
to get there

465
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,336
and it was a noble,
worthwhile struggle.

466
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,711
Now I'm there.

467
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:16,114
I'm there, but all I can
think of is how good

468
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,245
that Chinese food
used to taste.

469
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,914
You see what I mean?

470
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:24,891
My life was screwed up.
My son's life, screwed up.

471
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,793
My relationship
with my wife, screwed up.

472
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,593
Everything screwed up
because of my money.

473
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:33,157
Yes, I see your problem.

474
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,726
Boy, I wish I had it.

475
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,705
Why make more money?

476
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,106
Money was my enemy.

477
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,839
Manager to register four, please.

478
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:56,579
The answer was obvious.

479
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,320
Everything?
You wanna liquidate everything?

480
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:02,558
Sell the entire business.
All my shares, everything.

481
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,497
Why? You love this business.

482
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:06,124
I didn't think you'd retire
if you lived to be 100.

483
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,727
- I'm not retiring.
- Are you sick?

484
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,238
- I've never felt more alive.
- Well, why?

485
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,400
I have my reasons, Stuart. I want
everything sold within in one week.

486
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,410
A week?
No, can't be done.

487
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,004
You try and unload all those shares
that fast, the bottom will fall out.

488
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,537
Just sell for whatever price
you can get.

489
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,982
- It's all going to charities anyway.
- Charities?

490
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:25,611
And, Stuart, not one
word to anybody.

491
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:27,951
Those are my instructions.
Just sell everything

492
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:31,618
and one week from today, I want to see
a cashier's check on my desk.

493
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:35,026
- It won't be your desk anymore.
- Exactly.

494
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:46,173
- Michael.
- Dad.

495
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:48,539
- Yeah.
- You're up late.

496
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,879
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine. Nice party?

497
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,940
Yeah, okay.

498
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,748
That's good. I was just standing
here thinking about

499
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,381
your great-grandfather
Albar.

500
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,391
I wish you had
known him.

501
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,359
- Me too.
- Yeah.

502
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:09,386
He was about your age
when he left his village in Turkey.

503
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:12,059
Everybody thought
he was crazy.

504
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,035
They said those rumors
of what's happening to other Armenians

505
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,697
in the other villages,
that couldn't possibly be true.

506
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,469
No no. Murdering
an entire people?

507
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,477
Oh, that's impossible.

508
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,003
That man knew that in this world
anything is possible.

509
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,209
Every situation
is different.

510
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,219
A man has to size up
each individual situation

511
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,380
and then act
accordingly, right?

512
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:36,720
And no matter what
anybody else thinks.

513
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,852
He took his wife
and his two small children

514
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:42,419
and he got out.

515
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:45,262
One month later,
that village didn't even exist.

516
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,359
Smart fella.

517
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:49,199
Yeah.

518
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,296
Well, he liked
to think things through.

519
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,137
If he hadn't,
you and I wouldn't be here.

520
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:58,271
A man has to think
things through for himself.

521
00:29:58,313 --> 00:29:59,803
Right.

522
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:03,306
Well, this man is thinking
he ought to get some sleep.

523
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,876
Gotta get up early.
Tennis date at 11:00.

524
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,686
Oh, yeah, well,
you sleep well, my son.

525
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,593
- I love you, Michael.
- I love you, Dad.

526
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:17,496
- And they love you, too.
- And I love them. Good night.

527
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,163
Oh, Albar,

528
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:28,835
you saved this
family's life.

529
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,868
I'll save its soul.

530
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,382
Most of the money
I gave to various charities.

531
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,917
Some I decided to dispose of in a more
personal manner.

532
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,441
It's for you.

533
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:14,512
You were that guy who came around
here giving away that money?

534
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:17,081
- Yeah.
- I know people who got some of that.

535
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,116
- That was you?
- Yeah.

536
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,253
- You gave it all away?
- Yeah.

537
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,821
- You asshole.
- Yeah.

538
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,833
I think most people
would agree with you.

539
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,859
Now I can't believe
that I did it,

540
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,167
but at that time,
it certainly seemed logical.

541
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:34,300
- Every last cent?
- Every last cent.

542
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:37,334
Aram, that's the most
insane thing I've ever heard.

543
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:40,279
- Just to force your kid to get a job?
- Oh yeah.

544
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,510
Couldn't you just kick
him out of the house?

545
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,984
No! He knows his
father would never let him starve.

546
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,646
Took away
his incentive.

547
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,349
I'm restoring
that incentive.

548
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,358
Couldn't you have stashed your money
in a bank and not told him?

549
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:53,792
Well, yeah, but...

550
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,854
the truth is I'm not doing it
just for Michael.

551
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,866
See, I've got
other reasons.

552
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,765
I'm bored.

553
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,362
The greatest pleasure
in life is becoming a success.

554
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:06,532
Being a success is crap
compared to it.

555
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:09,634
I'm giving myself a chance
to do that twice in a lifetime.

556
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,168
I see, and how's Millie
supposed to react

557
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,443
when you come home tonight,
you throw your arms up

558
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,609
and say, "Honey, I'm home.
We're poor!"

559
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:19,415
Don't you think you maybe
should have consulted her?

560
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,945
Yeah, but I couldn't,
you see?

561
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,481
I want Michael to think
that I've lost all my money.

562
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,493
If I tell that to Millie,
she's gonna give it away

563
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,051
because she's
a lousy liar.

564
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:31,361
- Oh, then it serves her right.
- But I did it for her, too.

565
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,233
- She's the third reason.
- Ah, Katourian's law.

566
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,237
By making Millie
a pauper,

567
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,330
you're restoring her
to a rich and full sex life.

568
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,842
- Exactly.
- I hope she's properly grateful.

569
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,174
It's not just the sex.

570
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,511
Before we were rich,
Millie's life had purpose.

571
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,575
Just as my money ruined my son,
it ruined her too.

572
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:55,020
I'm giving Millie back a reason
for living, a sense of importance.

573
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,217
By making her a pauper?

574
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,226
Oh, come on.
Millie's gonna be okay.

575
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,421
She won't starve
to death as long as I'm around.

576
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:04,056
Aram, what if
you're not around?

577
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:07,192
What if something should happen
to you while you're between fortunes?

578
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,294
You think I didn't
think of that?

579
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,965
I prepaid my insurance premiums
for the next 10 years.

580
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,566
I think of everything.

581
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,703
It's the deed
to the condo.

582
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,978
Aram, you didn't
have to do this.

583
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:26,009
Yes, I did. I won't be able to afford
the rent anymore.

584
00:33:35,463 --> 00:33:37,556
May be a while
before I can bring

585
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,691
the sort of gifts
I used to.

586
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,137
May I still come
and see you?

587
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:47,403
Aram, yes, of course
you can still come see me.

588
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,138
Thank you.

589
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,691
- Have a good day.
- Thanks. You too.

590
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,413
Michael, would you
come downstairs, please?

591
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,074
- Hello, Millie.
- Hello, Aram.

592
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,209
Would you sit down?
We have to talk.

593
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:33,084
- What is it?
- Let's wait till Michael gets here.

594
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:35,146
Hey, Dad, what's up?

595
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:38,852
Michael, sit down.
I, uh...

596
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,691
I've some bad news,
very bad news.

597
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,822
- Oh my God. Somebody died.
- No.

598
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,732
- You sure nobody died?
- Nobody died.

599
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,565
Well, is somebody
gonna die?

600
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,970
Everybody's gonna die. Please, Millie,
let me tell you what happened.

601
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,564
Now...

602
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:02,376
I made some very
bad investments lately,

603
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,782
and I lost
a lot of money.

604
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:08,979
So much money that
I've had to sell everything

605
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,991
in order to cover
those losses.

606
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,789
In short, this family is penniless.
We have nothing.

607
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,659
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

608
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,893
The entire business that took you
20 years to build, you lost it all?

609
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:21,663
- Yeah, everything.
- God, you must feel horrible.

610
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,528
All of the stores,
they're all gone?

611
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,507
Yeah, all.

612
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,772
- Our stocks, our government bonds?
- I had to sell 'em.

613
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,712
- We still have the house?
- We never owned the house.

614
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,375
The company bought the house
and leased it to us for tax purposes.

615
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,407
I no longer run
the company.

616
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,419
We no longer can
live in this house.

617
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,353
- The cars?
- Same thing.

618
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,856
The furniture?

619
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,517
The furniture is ours,
yes, and our clothes,

620
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,527
but that's all.
That's all.

621
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,496
- What about the paintings?
- No.

622
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,122
Not my jewelry.

623
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,531
The company bought those things
as investments.

624
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,129
They were only ours to use.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

625
00:35:57,171 --> 00:36:00,663
Hey hey,
we got our health.

626
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,041
We got each other.
We'll get by.

627
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:12,748
Millie, Millie.

628
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,755
I know you don't think
so right now, dear,

629
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,223
but believe me,
this may be the best thing

630
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,453
that ever happened
to us, and I mean it.

631
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:21,484
For three separate
reasons.

632
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,588
First, did you see
what happened down there?

633
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,623
Did you see Michael
take over that situation?

634
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,158
"We'll get by."
That's what he said.

635
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:31,501
"We'll get by."
It's making a man of him.

636
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:34,565
And second, you don't
know what this is doing for me.

637
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,305
I feel invigorated
by the challenge,

638
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,745
you know, rejuvenated.

639
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,681
I feel like I'm being
given a second chance at life.

640
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,242
- What's the third reason?
- I forget.

641
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,517
Now don't you worry.
You know that I'm gonna look after you,

642
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:52,151
- no matter what happens.
- Oh, Aram, what's gonna happen to us?

643
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:54,923
Oh no, we'll be fine.
Darling, you'll be fine.

644
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,328
You'll be...

645
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,765
fine.

646
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,571
Aram, where are we going?

647
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,602
You'll see.
You'll see.

648
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:21,211
Are we getting near?

649
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,553
Yeah, very soon.

650
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,655
All right,
we're almost there.

651
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,757
- Millie, get ready to close your eyes.
- What?

652
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,827
Just get ready to close your eyes.
It's gonna be a surprise.

653
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,965
- Okay.
- Don't open them. Keep them closed.

654
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,340
Michael, pay the cab,
would you? Okay.

655
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,773
Okay, be careful.
Step on out. Now close 'em.

656
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,783
All right,
up the curb. Okay.

657
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,751
Wait a minute.
Okay.

658
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:54,311
All right,
just keep 'em closed.

659
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,051
Almost, okay.
Now you can open 'em.

660
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,491
Huh, you see? Huh?
You recognize it?

661
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,189
Michael, this is the building
your mother and I lived in

662
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:05,062
when we first got married.
Millie, you're not gonna believe this.

663
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,431
Our old apartment
was vacant.

664
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,561
It's gonna be just
like coming home again.

665
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,299
Come on, come on.

666
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,801
We had some happy
times here,

667
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,642
huh, Millie, huh?

668
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,739
Yes.

669
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:28,450
Somehow it seems
smaller than I remember.

670
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:33,885
Five minus that...
833.

671
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:37,659
Okay, now I didn't get as much as
I wanted for the rest of the furniture,

672
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,326
but after paying the movers
one month's rent,

673
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:44,168
we have a grand total of $833.
We're still ahead.

674
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:47,606
Now, Millie, Michael,
come here a sec. Would you?

675
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:49,609
I've made a detailed
budget here.

676
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:52,544
I figure that we need $372 a week
for necessities.

677
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,741
- You see?
- Yeah, I used to pay that for a belt.

678
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,750
- Yes, I know.
- On sale.

679
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,843
You will again soon,
I promise you.

680
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:03,516
But in the meantime, our objective
is just to make $372 per week.

681
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:06,993
Dad, I got...

682
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:09,895
- I got a... I got a problem.
- Uh-huh.

683
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,057
You see,
it's a little problem.

684
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,398
Joey and I have this date to take these
two women out to dinner tonight,

685
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,165
and I don't have
any money.

686
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,434
Yeah, well, as I was saying,
Michael, right now

687
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:23,273
all our money has
to go for necessities. We're poor.

688
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,835
I know, but I made
the date when we were rich.

689
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,974
You know what?
Never mind.

690
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,382
Sorry, excuse me, Shag.
I'll ask Joey

691
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:33,410
to lend me some money.

692
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,220
No, hey, Michael,
we do not borrow.

693
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,726
12 friends tried to help us.
I refused every one of 'em.

694
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,728
- Aram...
- Excuse me, Millie, please.

695
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,697
This family will get by through
its own efforts, son.

696
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:46,757
- Hmm?
- You're right.

697
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,761
Hey, Michael.

698
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,908
Last time.

699
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:00,038
As long as there's food
on that table, you can eat it.

700
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,311
As long as we have
a roof, you can sleep under it.

701
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,408
But anything you want
or need more than that,

702
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,943
you supply the money,
okay, understood?

703
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,955
Understood.

704
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,957
There's Joey.
I'll see you later. Bye, Mom.

705
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,982
Have a good time
and don't forget your key.

706
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:18,362
Millie, that dinner was delicious.
It was just delicious.

707
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,367
And I was afraid
you'd forgotten how to cook.

708
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,993
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

709
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:24,732
After all these years, I haven't
forgotten how to cook or sweep floors

710
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:27,263
or wash windows
or do laundry or scrub toilets.

711
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:30,209
Isn't it wonderful?

712
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:37,011
I'm sorry.
It must be very hard for you.

713
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:40,020
And that's another thing I haven't
forgotten how to do...

714
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,045
bitch.

715
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,166
What?

716
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,570
You making breakfast
in the kitchen,

717
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,131
me going out
to look for a job

718
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:04,440
and having no idea
how to pay next month's rent...

719
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:07,379
life is an adventure again.
I feel 20 years old.

720
00:41:07,414 --> 00:41:09,712
I wish I could feel
20 years old.

721
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,186
You'll always be
20 years old.

722
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,484
- You do like me without the mustache?
- Very much.

723
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:17,991
- I missed your nostrils.
- I think it's important.

724
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,323
I want to look as young
as possible when I'm applying for jobs.

725
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:23,558
- Michael up yet?
- No, I haven't seen him.

726
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,895
Get up, Michael.
Michael.

727
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,366
- Hey. Michael.
- What's the matter?

728
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,375
Sorry. I'm on the way
to the employment agency.

729
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,377
I thought maybe you'd
like to go with me.

730
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,140
Huh?

731
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,444
Oh, yeah
yeah, right.

732
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,474
I really got to bed late.
Why don't you go alone?

733
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,486
I'll go later
this afternoon.

734
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,715
Well, the thing is
with an employment agency,

735
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,724
it's better to get there
early in the morning.

736
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,953
Get first crack
at those new jobs.

737
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:56,121
- Afternoon's not so good.
- Yeah yeah, you're right.

738
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:58,222
That makes sense.

739
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,995
I'd better wait
till tomorrow.

740
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:03,367
Hey, good luck.

741
00:42:07,474 --> 00:42:09,442
- Michael.
- Yeah.

742
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:13,003
The other day when I said that
we weren't rich anymore,

743
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:16,983
you put your arm
around me and you said, "We'll get by."

744
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,320
What exactly
did you mean by that?

745
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:24,290
I meant you'll find a way
to make us rich again.

746
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:39,370
Okay,
Mr. Katourian, age?

747
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:40,964
59... 5.

748
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:44,102
55.

749
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,112
Previous job experience?

750
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,706
When I was younger,
I did everything.

751
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:50,842
I sold insurance,
drove trucks,

752
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,852
did dishes,
you name it.

753
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:55,514
What was your most
recent employment?

754
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,826
Actually, chairman
of the board of a company.

755
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,853
We don't get a lot
of calls for that.

756
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,524
No, of course not.

757
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,058
Chairman of the board.

758
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:12,231
I'll take anything you got.
I'm just looking for work.

759
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:13,968
Approximate earnings
last year.

760
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,942
Oh, tough one.

761
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:18,035
What with stock
dividends and bonuses...

762
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,670
Ballpark figure.

763
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:22,147
Ballpark... three mil.

764
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,480
Well, 3.2.

765
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,578
Obviously, I'm not expecting
to earn anywhere near that much.

766
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,283
That does
make it easier.

767
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,661
Hey, man, do me a favor.
Don't have such a nice day.

768
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,040
Minimum wage, of course,
but it paid for supper.

769
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,981
Oh, the other interview I had,
that is very promising.

770
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:58,985
This fella is starting
an express delivery service downtown,

771
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,044
like in Manhattan,
you know, on bicycles,

772
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:03,318
so you can get through
the traffic fast.

773
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,258
Salary plus a dollar
a delivery and tips.

774
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:09,421
Anyhow, with that, plus three,
four nights a week at the car wash,

775
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:12,227
and then on Saturdays,
a shoe store.

776
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,325
They need extra help.
With those three jobs,

777
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:17,633
plus what you're gonna bring in,
I think we can meet expenses each week,

778
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:20,105
- put a little away for the business.
- What business?

779
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,131
I don't know,
but it'll be good.

780
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:25,304
Just like I came up with the health
food supermarkets 20 years ago.

781
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:28,611
I'll come up with right idea,
and I will make it a reality.

782
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:31,243
Why not the food business?
You already know it.

783
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:34,812
Exactly, I know it and I've done it.
That's no challenge, dear.

784
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:37,756
Michael, give me
a cookie, please.

785
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,487
Thanks.

786
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:45,364
Hey, Dad, going through
what you did,

787
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:47,367
I mean losing
everything like that,

788
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:50,029
yet refusing to be
beat, hanging tough...

789
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,630
well, I just think

790
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:54,573
you're terrific.

791
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,576
You're terrific
too, Michael.

792
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,602
You just haven't had a chance
to find out how terrific you are.

793
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,012
I don't know. Your drive,
your determination,

794
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:04,449
- I don't seem to have any of that.
- Oh, you have it.

795
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:07,113
It's in our blood.
Trust me.

796
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:10,146
Okay, well, I guess
I'd better get to bed early

797
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,250
if I'm gonna be the first
one at that employment office tomorrow.

798
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,056
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

799
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,723
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

800
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,601
And you were
worried about him.

801
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,871
I was so proud
of Michael that night.

802
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:36,246
Excuse me a second.
I think I see lunch.

803
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,317
- Do you need any help?
- No, I'm fine.

804
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:45,450
Maybe you could help me.
I haven't eaten in two days.

805
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,790
- Could you spare a little change?
- Sorry, no.

806
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,491
Oh, no wonder. Don't ever stand near
me when I'm begging.

807
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:54,899
Why?

808
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,165
A guy sees one bum,
he feels compassion.

809
00:45:57,204 --> 00:46:00,037
He sees two, he figures
it's a social problem,

810
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:02,439
- let the government take care of it.
- Oh, sorry.

811
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:05,411
So go on. Michael was going to
the employment office.

812
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:09,439
Oh, yeah, I couldn't wait
to see what happened.

813
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,253
He's coming, Millie.
He's coming.

814
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:19,824
- Hi Dad. Hi Mom.
- Hi. Hey there.

815
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,885
How did it go today
at the employment agency?

816
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:24,022
It was fine. I'm in kind of
a hurry, though.

817
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:26,760
- I got a date.
- Wait a minute.

818
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,325
Did you hear that, Millie.
Michael has money for a date.

819
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,337
- Did you get a job?
- Mmm-hmm.

820
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,363
Oh God, that's wonderful.
You spend the money you earn,

821
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:36,376
'cause you deserve it.
What kind of job?

822
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,275
Well, it was kind
of an office...

823
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:41,611
That's past tense, "was."
You did get a job?

824
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:44,845
- Yeah.
- You showed up? You started to work?

825
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,046
Yeah, I started work,
and then I quit.

826
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,783
- You quit?
- Well, Dad, the boss was a real jerk.

827
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:52,451
Well, of course he was a jerk.
All bosses are jerks.

828
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:55,690
Hopefully, someday you'll become
a jerk. What did he do?

829
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,892
Well, he kept ordering me around.
Do this, do that.

830
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:01,093
It was demeaning.
It was insulting.

831
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:04,934
Oh, how long did you
suffer these demeaning insults?

832
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:06,940
I don't know.
20 minutes, half-hour.

833
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:09,943
But it's okay. I figured out another
way to make some money.

834
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,274
Another job?

835
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:13,211
No, I don't want to go
through that again.

836
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,648
I found this secondhand clothing store.
I took in a bunch of my clothes.

837
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:18,810
I got over $100.

838
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:23,752
Oh! No!

839
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:45,910
Hello.
Hey, Joey, how you doing?

840
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,414
Nah, I don't feel like
going to a movie tonight.

841
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,643
I'm just gonna stay
around the house.

842
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:53,050
I do love Woody Allen.

843
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,646
I just don't love
him tonight.

844
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:57,782
Okay,
I'll see you later.

845
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:08,231
You'd like to see that
movie, wouldn't you?

846
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:09,792
Yeah.

847
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:13,533
Movies cost money,
don't they?

848
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:15,974
Yeah.

849
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:20,173
You're all out
of money, aren't you?

850
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:23,539
Oh yeah.

851
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:29,051
I guess if you
want those things that you like,

852
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,549
you'll have to get a job
and earn some money, won't you?

853
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,620
There's gotta be
a better way.

854
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,464
No, Michael, no, there is
no better way, period.

855
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,298
That's the way
the world is.

856
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,602
The way the world has always been.
Man must work.

857
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,767
Can't be right, Dad.

858
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,777
The human race
has gotten along

859
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:54,042
for hundreds of thousands
of years without work.

860
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:56,606
If a guy needed food,
he went out and he hunted.

861
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,312
If he needed shelter,
okay, he built one.

862
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,585
That was it. The rest of his time,
he did what he felt like.

863
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:07,185
Chased girls or he drew pictures
of animals in caves.

864
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:09,320
He had no concept
of work.

865
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,298
Do you know that
even today in some African tribes,

866
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:14,493
and even in
the Eskimo language,

867
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,503
- no such word as work?
- What do you know from Eskimos?

868
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,165
Well, in college,
I took this course in anthropology.

869
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,607
- So?
- So you know how work got started?

870
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:27,171
One day this really big guy
went up to this little guy and said,

871
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,614
"Hey, buddy, I got
a proposition for ya.

872
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,450
From now on, you do all my hunting
for me. You do all my fishing for me.

873
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:37,184
You clean up my cave for me and you do
whatever else I tell you to do, okay?"

874
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,749
The little guy said,
"Well, gee, I don't know.

875
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,761
What do I get out
of it?"

876
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,855
And the big guy said,
"If you do all these things for me,

877
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,889
I won't bash your head
in with this rock."

878
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:49,629
And the little guy said,
"That sounds pretty good to me."

879
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,467
And boom, that's
how work got started.

880
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:54,269
And then one day,
the little guy's girlfriend went to him

881
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:56,775
and said, "Honey,
why are you doing all this stuff?"

882
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,778
He didn't want
to seem like a wimp.

883
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:01,576
So he said,
"Because it's good.

884
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:04,049
Work is a noble thing
for man to do."

885
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,984
And that's how
the work ethic got started.

886
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,452
Yes, work is a noble thing.

887
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,284
It is the most noble
thing in the world.

888
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,950
- Dad, that's your opinion.
- Who would disagree?

889
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:13,755
- Socrates, for one.
- Socrates?

890
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:16,194
Socrates. In his day,
work was for slaves.

891
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:19,323
For inferior beings who
did all the menial tasks

892
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:23,029
so that the superior
Greeks would be free to pursue art

893
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,233
and philosophy
and statecraft.

894
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,004
All through Europe, up to the 20th
century, if work was so noble,

895
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:33,240
how come you never
saw any of the nobility doing it, hmm?

896
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,805
What is with these Eskimos
and superior Greeks?

897
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,817
This is the United States.

898
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,513
And this is today.
People think differently, Michael.

899
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,385
Not everybody.

900
00:50:42,422 --> 00:50:44,822
You can't change the world
you live in, Michael.

901
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:48,624
And everybody knows
that work is good for man.

902
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:51,358
Like everybody in your
grandfather's village

903
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:54,333
knew that they were safe
from the Turks?

904
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:58,632
Are you sure you don't
want to be a lawyer?

905
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:01,766
Here you go.
Good luck.

906
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:32,637
Whoa!
Whoa!

907
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,698
Hey, wanna go around it
and not through it?

908
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:37,903
I'm sorry.

909
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,524
Hey, man, come on.
Get out of the way!

910
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,558
Trying to get through.

911
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,220
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

912
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,161
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

913
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,891
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
- Are you sure?

914
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,399
Long as I don't have
to sit down for the next 20 years,

915
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,402
I'll be okay.
I'm fine.

916
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,701
I'll be all right. It's like somebody
used a pineapple as a probe.

917
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:15,435
Pillow pillow, put the pillow down.
Put the pillow down.

918
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,534
Put the pillow down.
That's it. That's it.

919
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,613
You are not going
back to that job.

920
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,050
No, it's just I did
too many miles the first day.

921
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,816
My body will adjust.

922
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:30,846
Make me a drink.

923
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:48,898
Until the pain set in,
I really enjoyed the day.

924
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:51,638
It was nice riding out
there in the open air,

925
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:54,977
and the people going by,

926
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:56,983
all the activity.

927
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:59,986
The trees passing by.

928
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,352
Heck of a lot nicer
than that damned exercycle.

929
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,449
You know, sitting there
looking at nothing but reruns on the...

930
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,285
television.

931
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,765
- Oh oh oh! That's it!
- What is it?

932
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:17,326
That is it. Michael, come on
out here, would you?

933
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,305
Hurry up, quick. This is the new
business that I'm going into.

934
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,037
Here, listen to this idea.
Video bicycle tours.

935
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:26,307
We make videos of what
a biker would see

936
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,109
while he was riding
through London

937
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,638
or Rome,
the French countryside,

938
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,015
whatever, you name it.
We sell those videos

939
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:33,883
to the people that own
the exercycles.

940
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,888
They go home.
They put it into their set

941
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:40,416
and instead of boring exercise,
every workout becomes a holiday.

942
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,863
- Do enough people own these exercycles?
- There must be millions.

943
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:46,957
Wait a minute.

944
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,127
We could develop
a luxury exercycle.

945
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:51,694
You know, with the TV set
built right on it.

946
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:54,366
Two, three of 'em.
Yeah, different points of view.

947
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:57,137
Left, right and center.
Sensational.

948
00:54:57,177 --> 00:55:00,510
You could go around the world
without ever leaving your bedroom.

949
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,845
Sunday we'll take the camera,
we'll go to the park

950
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,817
- and we'll try it out on my bike, huh?
- Okay, sounds great.

951
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,980
One problem, I don't think
you'd use your video camera on the bike.

952
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:11,388
The picture would get wobbly.
I know how to fix it.

953
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:14,222
- Why don't you let me handle it?
- Well, thank you, Michael.

954
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,728
As a matter of fact,
a buddy of mine is in film school.

955
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:19,061
He could probably
loan us some of his equipment.

956
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:21,090
- I'll go check it out.
- Yeah.

957
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:27,197
- Help me up. Help me up.
- All right.

958
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,977
Yes!

959
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:33,002
- Shut up!
- Okay, help me down.

960
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,250
Are you ready?

961
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:40,514
I am ready.

962
00:55:40,553 --> 00:55:42,919
Okay, come ahead
when you're ready. Go ahead.

963
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:51,962
Looking good.

964
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,929
That's beautiful.

965
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,871
- Millie, your son is a genius.
- Hey, I just provided

966
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:01,703
a little technical
assistance, Dad.

967
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,608
You have come up with a terrific idea.
This thing could work.

968
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:07,613
Of course it could work,
but I'll tell you what's really great.

969
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:10,514
It takes hardly any capital.
We start out making the videos,

970
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,075
we sell them to the video stores,
then later we expand

971
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,917
- into the exercycles with TVs attached.
- Sound great.

972
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,923
Yeah, there's only
one problem, though.

973
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,891
I mean, merchandising
is a cinch.

974
00:56:19,926 --> 00:56:22,053
It's just I've got to find
someone to take care

975
00:56:22,095 --> 00:56:24,154
of the production
of the videos themselves.

976
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:27,655
Someone who has a certain
technical knowledge about filmmaking,

977
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,964
and, of course,
someone who wouldn't mind

978
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:31,800
traveling
all over the world

979
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:34,807
to those exciting
and exotic locations.

980
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:37,935
You wouldn't
have any idea where I might find

981
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,945
such a someone,
would you, Michael?

982
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,776
It does sound
like fun.

983
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,443
Yeah, and it also sounds
like earning a bundle of money.

984
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,577
- No, sounds like fun.
- Earn a bundle.

985
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:49,782
- Less filling.
- Tastes great.

986
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:53,159
"Katourian & Son," right?

987
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:54,956
"Travel Videos."

988
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,519
Let's celebrate, huh?
Movie and a dinner sound good?

989
00:56:57,564 --> 00:56:59,930
Oh, sounds wonderful,
but I promised the neighbor

990
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,695
I'd babysit.
You guys go.

991
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:03,702
- Okay.
- I'll go grab a sweater.

992
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,364
We'll see that Woody Allen movie,
then we'll come back

993
00:57:06,406 --> 00:57:09,375
and pick you up for dinner.
Now, you remember the Blue Pagoda?

994
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:12,207
- Oh, I remember.
- A couple of weeks ago I took a walk.

995
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:15,442
I wanted to see if it was still there,
and it is, and I promised myself

996
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:18,610
we wouldn't go until we had a real
reason to celebrate.

997
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:21,211
I can't think
of a better occasion.

998
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,749
Thank you.

999
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:28,955
Well, we have about a half hour
to kill before the movie starts.

1000
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:30,963
Okay, why don't
we go...

1001
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:32,965
Oh.

1002
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,126
- Let's do a little window-shopping.
- Good.

1003
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:38,001
We can look at things
we'll be able to afford again.

1004
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,767
- We can get Mom a little something.
- Why not?

1005
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,591
Would you like to try it, sir?
Please feel free.

1006
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,996
Oh, thank you.

1007
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:08,227
Wonderful idea,
isn't it?

1008
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:11,795
So simple. It's amazing nobody
ever thought of it before.

1009
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:13,863
How long has this
been in the market?

1010
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,204
Just last month.

1011
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,608
- Is it doing well?
- Incredibly.

1012
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,205
A new health club just
ordered 20 yesterday.

1013
00:58:24,884 --> 00:58:26,875
That is rough.

1014
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:30,156
Oh.

1015
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,591
It's amazing, the waste that goes
on in this world.

1016
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:35,594
- Oh my...
- You want some?

1017
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:37,596
No, thank you.

1018
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,122
So what happened after the bicycle
video thing fell through?

1019
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,260
It was a rough time.

1020
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,109
What happened?

1021
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,111
Well, you showed up
about half an hour ago

1022
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:54,113
after six weeks
without a word.

1023
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:56,775
We sat down
on the couch,

1024
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:58,443
you kissed my neck,

1025
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:00,384
you put your hand
inside my blouse

1026
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,116
and you fondled my right breast
for about three seconds,

1027
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:05,624
- then fell asleep.
- I'm sorry.

1028
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:08,058
Oh, don't be.
It was very pleasant while it lasted.

1029
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:10,494
Don't be upset,
'cause it's not your fault.

1030
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,896
Same thing happened with Millie
the other night.

1031
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:15,332
Well, a wife expects
that sort of thing.

1032
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:18,098
- I don't seem to have any energy.
- It's so strange, Aram.

1033
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,935
You're just working
18 hours a day at three different jobs.

1034
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,442
- You know you can't go on like this.
- Well, it's only

1035
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,706
for a short while,
just until I get enough money

1036
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:27,645
- to start the business.
- What business?

1037
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,478
I don't know... yet,
but I'm gonna get an idea.

1038
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:32,916
It's gonna be better
than that damn bicycle thing.

1039
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:35,420
And when I do,
I'm gonna need capital,

1040
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:37,423
so until then
it's important

1041
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:39,425
that I, you know,
keep on... keep...

1042
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:41,450
- Killing yourself.
- Exactly.

1043
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,551
Add in workmen's
compensations.

1044
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:16,391
Okay, how does that
come out?

1045
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:20,160
The expenses are 316 a month
more than the income.

1046
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,724
- What's in the bank?
- A little under 400.

1047
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:26,136
Well, that'll get us by for a month.
By then I should find another job.

1048
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,140
Don't be crazy, Aram.
The doctor said

1049
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:31,234
you need six months,
and he knows what he's talking about.

1050
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:34,872
He doesn't know me. I've already
stood up long enough to take a pee.

1051
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:37,474
That's wonderful,
but I don't think it pays very well.

1052
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:39,382
I will do
what I have to do.

1053
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:40,909
No, Mom's right.

1054
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:42,921
If I don't find work,
Michael,

1055
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:45,515
- we'll be out in the street in a month.
- No, we won't.

1056
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,025
Dad, don't worry
about a thing.

1057
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,528
Everything is gonna be great.
Let me handle it.

1058
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,190
Finally, all
you had to do

1059
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,699
to get your son off his ass
was to break your own.

1060
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,429
Ha, if I'd known,
I would have done it

1061
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:58,130
months earlier.

1062
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:09,580
Mom, would you get
our best glasses?

1063
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:11,082
I'd like to make
a little toast.

1064
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,449
- What's going on?
- I have great news, Dad.

1065
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:15,454
Hey, that's champagne.
Did you get a job?

1066
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,513
Our money
worries are over.

1067
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:19,525
Oh, Millie,
our son the breadwinner.

1068
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,256
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- I'd like you to take a look at this.

1069
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,264
Oh my God, you got
a paycheck already?

1070
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:28,426
$200,000...
What is this, some joke?

1071
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:30,527
Oh no, no joke.
It's very real.

1072
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,697
- Who's this Linda Talbot?
- You met her.

1073
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:35,401
She used to come over
to the house sometimes, play tennis.

1074
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,932
- Oh, I remember. The blonde girl.
- Why should she...

1075
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:41,174
- It's a gift, Dad.
- A gift? $200,000?

1076
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:43,478
- She's rich.
- Well, good. If she were poor

1077
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:46,246
- this could break her.
- No, she's really rich.

1078
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,118
Her father was GK Talbot,
the tire manufacturer.

1079
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:51,623
You remember, he and his wife
died in that plane crash

1080
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:54,217
a couple of years ago.
Linda was left with everything.

1081
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,625
Over $300 million.

1082
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:58,528
And she just decided
to give you 200,000?

1083
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:01,465
Well, it's
an engagement gift.

1084
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,493
Oh, Michael.

1085
01:02:04,537 --> 01:02:07,062
Like Linda said, you can't expect
someone in her position

1086
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:09,006
to just go out
and marry a pauper.

1087
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:12,477
Okay, she wanted me to have the money
so I'd feel independent.

1088
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:15,345
God, she's really terrific.
When you're feeling a little better,

1089
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:17,440
we'll have dinner so you
could get to know her.

1090
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,180
- Michael, do you really love her?
- Yeah, Mom, I really do.

1091
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,018
We hadn't planned on getting married
for a couple of years,

1092
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:25,489
but now it seems
to make sense.

1093
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:27,652
Tomorrow morning
I'm gonna start looking

1094
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:29,422
for a new place
for you guys.

1095
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:31,623
- Maybe a condo and a car.
- Oh, Aram.

1096
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,632
And Dad, Linda says
whatever business

1097
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,226
you wanna get started,
she will back you financially.

1098
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:38,396
You see?
Everything's gonna be great again.

1099
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:40,963
When he first walked in
I thought you had a job.

1100
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,238
Are you kidding? I'll never have
to work as long as I live.

1101
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:46,108
Oh, yeah, good.
So far you've lived

1102
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:48,375
off your father,
now you can live off your wife.

1103
01:02:48,414 --> 01:02:50,541
Dad, come on.
Money is money.

1104
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,574
If it's there,
why not enjoy it?

1105
01:02:53,753 --> 01:02:56,085
He's a bum.
Millie, our son is a bum.

1106
01:02:56,122 --> 01:02:58,420
- Aram.
- He's a bum. He's a bum!

1107
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,426
Is everybody
who doesn't work a bum?

1108
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,223
Is Prince Charles a bum?

1109
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,229
Yes, Prince Charles
is a bum!

1110
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:06,231
Never done a day's work
in his life!

1111
01:03:06,265 --> 01:03:08,665
If I was his mother,
I'd throw him out of the palace!

1112
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,431
And that is exactly what I'm doing
to you. I'm throwing you

1113
01:03:11,471 --> 01:03:14,531
out of my palace!
Now this may not be much of a palace,

1114
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:18,010
but oh God, every penny
that pays for it, I earned it!

1115
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,875
And I want you
out of it!

1116
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,683
You get out of it.

1117
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,708
You get out of my life.

1118
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,902
Damn it.
Excuse me.

1119
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:49,100
No, that's okay.
Let that out. It's healthy.

1120
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,046
- Want a cigarette?
- I quit.

1121
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,742
Yeah, I should too.
Smoking is stupid.

1122
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:58,750
It's suicide.
No offense.

1123
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:00,752
No offense taken.

1124
01:04:00,786 --> 01:04:03,550
So, you and your son
ever get back together again?

1125
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,649
Oh God,
months went by, terrible months.

1126
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:10,492
Aram, don't worry.
We'll try again later.

1127
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,590
Oh, it's no use.

1128
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:16,261
Same thing with Millie
for a couple of weeks now.

1129
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:19,237
My son and my thing...
I can't get either one to work.

1130
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,240
How is Michael?
Have you seen him?

1131
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,708
The wedding was last month.
Millie went.

1132
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,711
You didn't?

1133
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:28,680
To witness my only son's
manhood being amputated?

1134
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:30,682
Thank you, no.

1135
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:32,684
But you're feeling
okay, right?

1136
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:35,516
- Your back's better, your leg?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1137
01:04:35,555 --> 01:04:37,523
Except...

1138
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:39,525
- You're able to work?
- Huh?

1139
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:41,527
Yeah, I'm well enough.

1140
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:44,121
The guy at the bicycle
delivery service

1141
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:46,131
made me a dispatcher.

1142
01:04:46,165 --> 01:04:48,133
I sit at a desk
all day long.

1143
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:51,295
- Does it pay anything?
- Well, we scrape by.

1144
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,002
I went on some interviews
for jobs that pay better,

1145
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:58,010
and nothing
seemed to happen.

1146
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:00,604
And I don't know why.

1147
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,444
I used to be able
to make things happen,

1148
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,349
and I cannot
make things happen now.

1149
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,883
And what's worse is,
it's beginning

1150
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:11,890
not to bother me.

1151
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:14,950
I'm content to sit
at a desk

1152
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,395
and just answer a telephone
for $200 a week.

1153
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:21,965
If I were
half the man I was,

1154
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,333
I would be raging
at my failure.

1155
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,329
Raging.

1156
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,537
No rage left in me.

1157
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:53,791
- Hi Aram.
- Hi dear.

1158
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,801
Mmm, what smells so good?

1159
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:58,395
I have a roast
in the oven.

1160
01:05:58,437 --> 01:06:00,405
- Cherry strudel?
- Uh-huh, and I have

1161
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,805
a Crown Royal over there.
Pour yourself a drink.

1162
01:06:02,842 --> 01:06:04,867
Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.

1163
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,901
Where'd the money come from?
Did Michael...

1164
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:09,073
No, I promised you
I wouldn't take from Michael.

1165
01:06:09,115 --> 01:06:11,606
- Then where?
- You know Anita, Mrs. Villalobos

1166
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:13,448
down the hall?
She had the flu today.

1167
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:15,283
She cleans for this
lady in the valley.

1168
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:18,449
This lady had a party last night,
and she needed somebody real bad,

1169
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:20,721
- and Anita asked me if I would go.
- And you went?

1170
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,558
- You cleaned another woman's house?!
- Oh, it wasn't hard.

1171
01:06:23,596 --> 01:06:25,860
I earned $45,
and while I was there,

1172
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,866
this other lady,
this neighbor,

1173
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,630
she needed someone to come in
and clean three times a week,

1174
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,570
- so I said I would.
- Oh Millie.

1175
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:35,039
Aram, if you don't
want me to, I won't,

1176
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,542
but it would make things
a lot easier.

1177
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,544
Aram...

1178
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,546
I went from my father's
house to yours.

1179
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,878
I never had a job.
I really enjoyed

1180
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,384
the feeling of earning
money today.

1181
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,683
It was a really
good feeling.

1182
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:51,485
Please don't be
angry with me.

1183
01:06:53,659 --> 01:06:56,526
Oh Millie, how could I
be angry with you?

1184
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,252
Aram?

1185
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:22,811
Aram?

1186
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:26,347
Aram?

1187
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:45,744
Millie...

1188
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,638
there's something
I gotta tell you.

1189
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:55,281
I don't have the guts
to do it to your face.

1190
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,551
I didn't go bankrupt.

1191
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,058
I gave my money away.

1192
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:04,396
See, I thought
I could turn my son into a man

1193
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,796
and I thought I could turn myself
into a kid again,

1194
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,562
and I couldn't
do either.

1195
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,570
It's a te...

1196
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,868
no no, Shaggy,
go away right now, please.

1197
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:16,875
It's a terrible thing
that I've done to you, Millie.

1198
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:19,469
I stole your
whole life away.

1199
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,480
I thought I could
give it back to you

1200
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,347
anytime I wanted,
and I couldn't.

1201
01:08:25,384 --> 01:08:27,352
And I cannot

1202
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:29,479
stay here
day after day

1203
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,956
looking at the results
of my stupidity,

1204
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:34,221
and I do not have
the right to forbid you

1205
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,228
from taking
Michael's help.

1206
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,230
God, let him...
let him look after you

1207
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:41,495
the way that you deserve
to be looked after.

1208
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,525
And...

1209
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,830
you're a wonderful
woman...

1210
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:53,476
and I'm not worthy
of you.

1211
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:57,213
Goodbye.

1212
01:08:58,617 --> 01:09:00,141
Oh.

1213
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,362
Boy, that's really
rough.

1214
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,364
That's when you found me
on the overpass.

1215
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,764
- I should have jumped.
- No, don't say that.

1216
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,825
If you had, I wouldn't have
gotten to know you.

1217
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,837
I wouldn't have
heard your story.

1218
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:21,362
Anyway, I love
a good cry.

1219
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,376
Hey, I got kind of
a confession to make.

1220
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,901
When I told you
that I knew some of the guys

1221
01:09:26,946 --> 01:09:28,914
that you gave
that money to,

1222
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:30,745
- that wasn't the whole truth.
- No?

1223
01:09:30,783 --> 01:09:32,751
- I was one of the guys.
- Huh?

1224
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:35,913
I was afraid if I told
you you might put the touch on me.

1225
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:37,946
You mean, there's
some of it left?

1226
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,617
I got most of it.
In a bank.

1227
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,148
What are you
saving it for?

1228
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:43,821
For when times
get rough.

1229
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:45,558
Look,

1230
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,930
it kills me to part
with even a dime.

1231
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:51,494
I just can't do it.
That's just the way I am, all right?

1232
01:09:51,537 --> 01:09:55,303
But maybe I could let you have
a couple of hundred?

1233
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:57,673
That's very good of you.

1234
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,644
Good?
I'm a goddamn saint!

1235
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:02,374
But what the hell,
and I'll tell you what,

1236
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,382
- I'll buy you dinner.
- Yeah?

1237
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,441
Yeah, we'll go someplace
really great, huh?

1238
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:08,453
- Like maybe Denny's?
- Yeah.

1239
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:11,354
- Or you got another idea?
- Oh, there's a Chinese restaurant

1240
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,187
that I would love
to go to. Yeah.

1241
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:14,852
I haven't been there
in a long time.

1242
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:16,794
Mmm, wow,

1243
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:18,854
that was one of the best
meals I've ever had.

1244
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:20,991
Yeah.

1245
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:23,092
What's the matter?
You didn't like the food?

1246
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,103
Oh hell yeah,
I liked the food.

1247
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,163
I loved it.
The damn food was great.

1248
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:31,108
On special occasions,
I used to come here with my wife

1249
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,509
when I was feeling
very proud of myself, you know,

1250
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:35,979
made a big sale,
closed a deal, whatever.

1251
01:10:36,015 --> 01:10:39,041
I always thought
that what made these dinners so great

1252
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:41,018
was how good I felt
about myself.

1253
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:43,317
- You see?
- No.

1254
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:46,483
Well, I never thought
that I could enjoy anything

1255
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:49,050
unless I really earned it.
Otherwise I'd feel guilty.

1256
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:50,527
Ah.

1257
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:52,792
So I figured if the food
tasted that good,

1258
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,959
- it's because I earned it.
- Oh.

1259
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,526
- That wasn't it at all.
- Oh.

1260
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,004
This meal is being paid for
by a lovely lady

1261
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,203
who lives in a cardboard box.
It's every bit as good.

1262
01:11:04,243 --> 01:11:06,837
The damn food
is just great.

1263
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:09,279
Yeah well,
there was a lot

1264
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:11,545
of good stuff in the world
before you came along,

1265
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:14,108
and there'll be
a lot of good stuff after you've gone.

1266
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,519
The trick is to grab some
while you're here.

1267
01:11:18,223 --> 01:11:20,191
You're a very wise
derelict.

1268
01:11:20,225 --> 01:11:21,749
Thank you.

1269
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,801
- Okay.
- Where are you headed?

1270
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:32,861
As far as that
bus is going.

1271
01:11:32,905 --> 01:11:35,373
You know, I would go with you,
but I really like LA.

1272
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,375
- Yeah?
- I wouldn't feel at home

1273
01:11:37,409 --> 01:11:39,343
being homeless
anywhere else.

1274
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,869
Bye, Billie.

1275
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:44,883
Bus number 67 serving
the route to San Diego

1276
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:47,408
- arriving at gate 9.
- Thanks for all your help.

1277
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:51,689
Hey, wait a minute.
I got something for you.

1278
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,692
Here's your watch.

1279
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,819
Thank you.

1280
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,921
Five, 10, 20.

1281
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,515
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

1282
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:06,354
Hello, Millie.

1283
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,540
I went by the apartment.

1284
01:13:18,577 --> 01:13:20,374
I didn't know
you'd moved.

1285
01:13:20,412 --> 01:13:22,380
Mrs. Villalobos told me
I'd find you here.

1286
01:13:22,414 --> 01:13:24,382
You look wonderful.

1287
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,407
Oh, thank you.

1288
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:30,155
How are you?

1289
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:32,157
Eh? Fine.

1290
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:34,659
You got my letters?

1291
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:37,924
Yeah, from all over
the country.

1292
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:41,364
But I'm not so sure
an envelope with no address

1293
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,267
containing only some money
wrapped in a blank sheet of paper

1294
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:48,034
could be called a letter,
but thank you for the money.

1295
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:50,041
It's not much, I know,

1296
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:52,009
but whenever I had
any to spare...

1297
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:54,012
Oh...

1298
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:55,741
it was nice
you thought of me.

1299
01:13:56,748 --> 01:13:58,579
It would have been nice

1300
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:01,051
if I had known
what you were doing.

1301
01:14:01,086 --> 01:14:03,577
Nothing really
worth talking about.

1302
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:05,920
I'd find a job
of some kind,

1303
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,291
make a little money,
and then quit the job, relax a bit,

1304
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:12,593
move on somewhere else,
take another job, and so on.

1305
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:14,599
It's hard for me

1306
01:14:14,633 --> 01:14:17,397
to picture you
ever relaxing.

1307
01:14:17,436 --> 01:14:20,064
What did you do
when you weren't working?

1308
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:23,506
Sit in a park
and feed a pigeon.

1309
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,510
Read a book.

1310
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,512
Visit a zoo,
Grand Canyon.

1311
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,514
What about you?

1312
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,516
Isn't Michael
taking care of you?

1313
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,383
- Why are you still working?
- I enjoy it.

1314
01:14:34,419 --> 01:14:35,818
Oh.

1315
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:37,879
The boss
treat you okay?

1316
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:43,419
Aram, I am the boss.

1317
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:47,023
Oh, isn't that
wonderful!

1318
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:49,033
Michael bought this
for you?

1319
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,592
No no, I never
took money from Michael.

1320
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:53,605
I wanted
to look after myself.

1321
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:55,869
- Then how...
- I have a partner

1322
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,876
who put up
the initial investment.

1323
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,401
- Oh, is it anybody I know?
- Oh yes.

1324
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:04,816
What's going on here?

1325
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:07,250
Oh, don't worry.
It's not "This is Your Life."

1326
01:15:07,286 --> 01:15:09,117
- How...
- After you left,

1327
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:11,122
and I didn't hear
a thing for two months,

1328
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:14,057
I didn't know if you were alive,
so I went to see Irene

1329
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,959
- to see if she knew anything.
- You knew about Irene?

1330
01:15:16,995 --> 01:15:19,429
I knew about Irene.

1331
01:15:19,464 --> 01:15:21,489
How long?

1332
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:24,331
Oh, a few years.

1333
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:26,337
You never said
a word to me.

1334
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,339
The night
before I got married

1335
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:30,341
my grandmother
came to my room.

1336
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,343
She told me
there were three things

1337
01:15:32,377 --> 01:15:34,345
even God
could not create...

1338
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:35,812
a floor
that would stay clean,

1339
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,371
a baby
that would stay dry

1340
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:39,646
and a husband
that would stay faithful.

1341
01:15:39,685 --> 01:15:41,880
Oh.

1342
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:46,022
Very wise,
your grandmother.

1343
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:48,686
Anyway, when I didn't hear from you,
I went to see Irene.

1344
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:51,252
And she was as worried as I was,
and we started talking

1345
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,025
and we found
we liked each other.

1346
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:55,090
We agreed you had
excellent taste in women.

1347
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,998
One day
I invited her over

1348
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:59,765
to the apartment for coffee
and I baked my cherry strudel.

1349
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,932
- Oh, it was incredible!
- I know.

1350
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,942
Oh yeah, of course.

1351
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,444
And Irene got the idea
of opening up a shop.

1352
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,946
I took out a mortgage on the condo,
and here we are.

1353
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,473
The shop is doing well?

1354
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,485
We have branches
in Westwood, Encino,

1355
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:16,646
we're opening another
in Pacific Palisades,

1356
01:16:16,688 --> 01:16:18,883
and there's a group of investors
talking to us

1357
01:16:18,924 --> 01:16:21,154
about opening a national
franchise operation.

1358
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:23,161
What?

1359
01:16:23,195 --> 01:16:25,459
I wanted to make a man
of my son, not my wife.

1360
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:31,900
Aram, why did you
come back?

1361
01:16:31,937 --> 01:16:34,599
Pick up the invoice
for me, will you?

1362
01:16:37,276 --> 01:16:39,244
It occurred to me

1363
01:16:39,278 --> 01:16:43,180
that you might want
to end the marriage formally.

1364
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:45,911
So I'm here to do
whatever you want me to do.

1365
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,919
That's very considerate.

1366
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:49,921
Is there...

1367
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:53,652
anyone in your life
right now?

1368
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,660
No no, not really.

1369
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,662
Every time I start
to think about someone,

1370
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,426
an envelope would come
from Buffalo or Wichita

1371
01:17:00,465 --> 01:17:02,433
with $15 or $20 in it,
and l...

1372
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:05,436
it confused the issue.

1373
01:17:07,673 --> 01:17:09,664
Is there anyone
in your...

1374
01:17:10,742 --> 01:17:13,074
No, it's okay.
You can ask her.

1375
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:15,079
Ask me what?

1376
01:17:15,113 --> 01:17:17,081
Is there anyone
in your life?

1377
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:19,379
Yes, there is,
an actor.

1378
01:17:19,418 --> 01:17:21,386
Oh.

1379
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,014
Been in anything
I've seen?

1380
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,024
Just my bedroom.

1381
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,492
He's a lot younger than I am,
and he's poor.

1382
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:32,054
I find the combination
irresistible.

1383
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,065
Irene, we have to hurry.

1384
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,067
Oh, Millie,
how is Michael?

1385
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:38,160
Oh, he's fine.
Look, Irene and I have to meet

1386
01:17:38,203 --> 01:17:40,831
the architects at the new shop.
Here's my home address.

1387
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:43,670
Come over to the house
for dinner about 6:00 and we'll talk.

1388
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,677
Oh good, yeah.

1389
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:47,736
Well, I'm very happy
things are working out

1390
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:50,748
- so well for both of you.
- In a way, we owe it all to you.

1391
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:53,182
Millie and I never would have met
if you hadn't been

1392
01:17:53,218 --> 01:17:55,948
the rotten cheating
bastard that you are.

1393
01:17:55,987 --> 01:17:58,922
- Uh-huh.
- See you at 6:00.

1394
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:01,187
Heather, we'll be back
in a few hours.

1395
01:18:01,226 --> 01:18:02,955
Oh okay, Mrs. Katourian.

1396
01:18:24,549 --> 01:18:26,517
Hi, Millie.

1397
01:18:26,551 --> 01:18:28,542
Hi.

1398
01:18:30,222 --> 01:18:32,190
All this
from cherry strudel?

1399
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:34,784
Oh, this isn't mine.
I'm just renting the guest house

1400
01:18:34,826 --> 01:18:37,386
until I can find
a place of my own.

1401
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:39,397
I was planning
to cook dinner,

1402
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:42,059
but I didn't have any time to shop,
so if you don't mind,

1403
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,728
- I thought we'd eat out.
- Good, fine.

1404
01:18:52,077 --> 01:18:54,409
Tell me about Michael.
Is he happy?

1405
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:56,414
What did you say?

1406
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:58,848
Michael and his new bride,
are they happy together?

1407
01:18:58,884 --> 01:19:00,943
No, I'm afraid not.

1408
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,954
Linda met
a baseball player

1409
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,718
and fell head over heals
and she and Michael got a divorce.

1410
01:19:05,757 --> 01:19:09,318
Oh my God.
Is he all right?

1411
01:19:09,361 --> 01:19:11,659
He was pretty broken up.
He really loved her a lot,

1412
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:13,721
but he's adjusting.

1413
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:16,928
Oh Lord.
Where is he living?

1414
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,061
- Here.
- Oh, with you?

1415
01:19:19,104 --> 01:19:22,232
No, it's his house.

1416
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:27,742
- His house?
- It was part of the divorce settlement.

1417
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:30,475
Part of the...
what do you mean, "part"?

1418
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:33,109
He also got
$5 million.

1419
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:36,211
$5 million?

1420
01:19:36,254 --> 01:19:38,779
Aram, please don't be angry with him.
His lawyer said

1421
01:19:38,824 --> 01:19:42,191
he could have gotten 10 time that,
and he didn't want to take anything.

1422
01:19:42,227 --> 01:19:45,492
And Linda pleaded with him to take it,
because she was feeling very guilty

1423
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:48,021
about what she was doing.
Don't be angry with Michael.

1424
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:50,034
I'm not angry.

1425
01:19:50,068 --> 01:19:52,468
I am delighted for him.
Good for him.

1426
01:19:52,504 --> 01:19:54,199
Even though
he didn't earn it?

1427
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:57,265
If a man wins $50 million in a lottery,
did he earn it?

1428
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:59,470
As your son would say,
money is money,

1429
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:01,479
and God bless him,
let him enjoy it.

1430
01:20:01,513 --> 01:20:03,572
Even though it came
from a woman?

1431
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:06,812
Don't women get money
from men in divorce settlements, Millie?

1432
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:09,252
What, are you becoming
a sexist pig?

1433
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,658
You know, Millie,
I'm not really proud of the way

1434
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:20,995
Michael turned out.
I'm not gonna kid myself about that.

1435
01:20:21,032 --> 01:20:23,000
But I have come
to realize

1436
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:25,935
you don't have to be proud
of someone to love them.

1437
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,040
Is he home?
I'm dying to see him.

1438
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,703
Oh no, he usually doesn't get home
until past midnight.

1439
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:35,144
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1440
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,546
Oh, uh...

1441
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,550
have you given
any thought

1442
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,552
to what I said earlier?

1443
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,577
Do you you want
a divorce?

1444
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:46,757
I don't know.

1445
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:49,385
Would you?

1446
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,555
I've never stopped
loving you, Millie.

1447
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,401
I'm not the same
person I was.

1448
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,403
I'm a very
different woman.

1449
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,405
Oh I know.
I can see that.

1450
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,771
I think I like
the new woman too.

1451
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:05,435
And I am
a different man.

1452
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:09,311
I think perhaps
I could like this new man as well.

1453
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:12,214
Maybe the four of us
could double-date sometime.

1454
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:20,882
- What was that for?
- Irene.

1455
01:21:20,926 --> 01:21:24,453
- What about your grandmother?
- Screw my grandmother.

1456
01:21:24,496 --> 01:21:27,431
Let's eat.

1457
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,460
Right this way.

1458
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,943
Your waiter will be
right with you.

1459
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,945
Thank you.

1460
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,947
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1461
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,711
- It's very nice.
- I knew you'd like it.

1462
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,116
Aram, could you
order me a sherry?

1463
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,781
- I'll be right back.
- Oh yeah, sure.

1464
01:21:54,426 --> 01:21:56,394
Excuse me,
could you have

1465
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:58,396
that waiter over there
serve us, please?

1466
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,421
- Certainly, madam.
- Thank you.

1467
01:22:04,235 --> 01:22:07,204
Michael, table nine.

1468
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:11,943
Good evening.

1469
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:13,672
Good...

1470
01:22:13,712 --> 01:22:15,509
- Dad?
- Michael.

1471
01:22:15,547 --> 01:22:18,015
- Dad!
- Michael!

1472
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:23,020
Would you like to know
tonight's specials?

1473
01:22:23,054 --> 01:22:25,545
No, I don't wanna know
tonight's specials.

1474
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,558
I'd like to know
what you're doing here.

1475
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:30,459
- I'm working.
- Working?!

1476
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:33,828
Yes. Would you care
for a drink before dinner?

1477
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:36,390
Yeah, I think
I could use one.

1478
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:38,902
Crown Royal
on the rocks for me

1479
01:22:38,937 --> 01:22:41,599
and a dry sherry
for your mother.

1480
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,437
Mom?

1481
01:22:43,475 --> 01:22:44,942
Yeah yeah.

1482
01:22:44,976 --> 01:22:47,638
Okay, I'll be
right back with them.

1483
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,670
Dad!

1484
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,318
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything.

1485
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:57,185
- I wanted you to be surprised.
- It worked.

1486
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,385
$5 million,
he's waiting on tables.

1487
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:02,859
Yes, at least it's a job.
I thought you'd be pleased.

1488
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:06,091
- Pleased?!
- Is anything wrong, sir?

1489
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:08,725
Just found out my son's a lunatic.
Everything's fine.

1490
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,735
Very good, sir.

1491
01:23:10,769 --> 01:23:14,136
For madam,
dry sherry.

1492
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:16,140
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.

1493
01:23:16,174 --> 01:23:18,142
- Surprised?
- Oh yes.

1494
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:21,407
And for the gentleman,
Crown Royal.

1495
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:24,074
- Why, Michael?
- Why?

1496
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:25,605
Why are you
working here?

1497
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:28,175
It's a little
complicated to explain.

1498
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:31,245
I should get your dinner orders
in first. Tonight's specials...

1499
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:34,258
Never mind the specials.
Just bring me steak.

1500
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:36,590
- Medium rare.
- I'll have the salmon.

1501
01:23:36,628 --> 01:23:38,926
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you, yes.

1502
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:42,296
Now, salad comes with that.
Anything to start?

1503
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,994
Nothing to start.

1504
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:53,109
Couldn't you have
talked him out of this?

1505
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:56,011
He's a man.
This is what he wants.

1506
01:23:56,047 --> 01:23:59,483
Clearing away people's dirty dishes?
That's what he wants?

1507
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:02,918
- You said you've waited on tables.
- To make ends meet.

1508
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:04,945
Not for the thrill of it.

1509
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:08,591
House dressing
or vinaigrette?

1510
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,685
- What's the house?
- Blue cheese and walnut.

1511
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:12,629
- Okay, I'll have that.
- Me too.

1512
01:24:12,664 --> 01:24:15,792
Hey now, Michael, that complicated
story, I'd love to hear it.

1513
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:18,997
Well, you know
about my divorce?

1514
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:21,005
- Yeah.
- I told him.

1515
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:23,007
I'm sorry.

1516
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:26,374
The day the divorce became final,
I was feeling pretty down.

1517
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:29,539
I can understand that. Your wife running
off with the ball player.

1518
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:32,709
If it had at least been
a real good ball player... you know?

1519
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:34,946
I mean, your woman leaves you
for George Brett

1520
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,954
or Don Mattingly,
you kind of understand.

1521
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:40,515
But this guy never batted
over 260 in his career.

1522
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:42,526
Couldn't hit an
inside slider if his life

1523
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,187
depended on it,
and his fielding...

1524
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:46,891
I understand. The man is not gonna
make the Hall of Fame.

1525
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,923
Anyway, I was really
feeling low,

1526
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:51,936
and I happened to pass
by this restaurant.

1527
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:54,905
I thought to myself,
"Okay, maybe I'll go inside.

1528
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:57,737
I might have a nice dinner.
I'll feel a little better"

1529
01:24:57,776 --> 01:24:59,471
And darned
if it didn't work!

1530
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:03,345
The food was terrific,
I had some really nice wine,

1531
01:25:03,381 --> 01:25:05,815
and when I finished,
I really felt better.

1532
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,876
You know, like the world
wasn't such a terrible place after all.

1533
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,480
And I felt grateful.

1534
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,491
I wanted
to thank somebody

1535
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,255
for the terrific meal I had that just
cheered me up so much.

1536
01:25:16,294 --> 01:25:19,263
But who?
Who would you thank?

1537
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:22,528
I don't know,
the waiter, the chef.

1538
01:25:22,567 --> 01:25:25,331
Them? Sure,
but they're not the only ones.

1539
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,338
What about the people
who wash the dishes?

1540
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,863
What about the people
who sweep up?

1541
01:25:29,908 --> 01:25:31,876
Or the cocktail pianist?

1542
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,310
What about the fisherman
who caught the fish I ate?

1543
01:25:34,345 --> 01:25:36,313
The farmer who grew
the lettuce,

1544
01:25:36,347 --> 01:25:38,474
the people who picked
the grapes for the wine?

1545
01:25:38,516 --> 01:25:41,314
What about the miner
who dug out the silver for the cutlery?

1546
01:25:41,352 --> 01:25:43,718
I mean, if you add them all up,
thousands of people

1547
01:25:43,755 --> 01:25:46,451
worked to make that meal
I enjoyed so much possible.

1548
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,459
- Pepper?
- Thank you.

1549
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:50,688
That's what work is.
Doing something

1550
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:53,595
that makes life a little bit nicer
for other people.

1551
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:56,259
You can't just go through life
without doing something

1552
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:58,997
back for them.
I mean, Dad, it's not right.

1553
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:02,473
So on my way out,
I asked the maitre d'

1554
01:26:02,507 --> 01:26:05,908
if they had any job openings...
here I am.

1555
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:07,468
Working as a waiter?

1556
01:26:07,512 --> 01:26:09,912
A person has to work.

1557
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:11,848
I know that!

1558
01:26:11,883 --> 01:26:13,942
I've always
known that, Michael.

1559
01:26:13,985 --> 01:26:15,953
Aram, you don't seem
to understand.

1560
01:26:15,987 --> 01:26:18,387
Michael had to prove to himself
that he wasn't you.

1561
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,620
Work for you is everything,
so for him it had to be nothing.

1562
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:24,594
- Now, he was dumb.
- She's right, I was dumb.

1563
01:26:24,629 --> 01:26:26,597
Well, you both were dumb.

1564
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:29,896
I wish I had some special ability
or a talent in some field,

1565
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:32,164
but if I have,
I haven't found it yet,

1566
01:26:32,203 --> 01:26:33,761
and maybe I never will.

1567
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,671
I'm sorry if I haven't
turned out the way you wanted, Dad.

1568
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:41,406
I'm sorry if I'm not
the son you wanted,

1569
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,414
but this is me.

1570
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,643
I think your dinner
should be ready now.

1571
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:49,643
Michael.

1572
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:58,062
If all the fathers
of all the people

1573
01:26:58,096 --> 01:27:00,064
that ever won
a Nobel prize

1574
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:02,066
were here tonight,

1575
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,068
every one of them
would envy the way I feel

1576
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:06,127
about my son right now.

1577
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:12,606
Sir, if you are pleased
with our service,

1578
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,908
a simple gratuity
would suffice.

1579
01:27:23,888 --> 01:27:25,856
I have to go
to the Palisades today.

1580
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:27,858
I have this tax appeal
on the new shop.

1581
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:30,360
- I'll see you tonight for dinner.
- All right, dear.

1582
01:27:30,395 --> 01:27:33,023
- So what are you gonna be doing today?
- I think I'll play

1583
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:36,227
tennis with Michael and then maybe
go to the track with Walter.

1584
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:39,395
- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, bye-bye.

1585
01:27:39,437 --> 01:27:42,201
- Bye, Mom, have a good day.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

1586
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,175
Hi Dad, I'm sorry I can't play tennis.
I gotta get to work.

1587
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:46,836
- Why so early?
- Oh, it's chaos.

1588
01:27:46,878 --> 01:27:49,574
Two busboys quit the restaurant.
We're short of staff.

1589
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:52,640
Maybe I should apply for a job there,
get to work again.

1590
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,549
You do work.
You handle my investments.

1591
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:56,576
Oh, a couple
of phone calls a week.

1592
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,987
Yeah, whatever.
My money's earning twice as much.

1593
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:00,991
By the way, are you
all right for cash?

1594
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:02,993
I told you,
when I need I'll ask.

1595
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,995
- Yeah, but you never do.
- Oh Lord.

1596
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,089
- I'll see you later
- All right, kid, bye.

1597
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:10,100
Oh, Michael.

1598
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:15,167
Do you ever stop and think
that while you're running around

1599
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,902
every day in that restaurant
carrying those heavy trays

1600
01:28:17,942 --> 01:28:21,400
in and out of that steamy kitchen,
I'm just sitting by your pool,

1601
01:28:21,446 --> 01:28:23,710
drinking your booze,
eating your food,

1602
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:26,376
in general having one hell of a time
with your money?

1603
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:29,545
Yeah, sometimes I think
about that.

1604
01:28:29,587 --> 01:28:31,612
How does that
make you feel?

1605
01:28:31,656 --> 01:28:33,419
I love it.

1606
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:38,626
I'll see you later.

1607
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:45,953
English - R1
