00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:10,880
And it'll be like this.

6
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:11,880
Should I snap on the way out?

7
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,580
If you could not snap on the way out.

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,580
He doesn't understand not snapping.

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,680
Should I not snap on the way out?

10
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,714
No, nobody should be snapping on the way out.

11
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:17,714
Do the names and the order again,

12
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:18,980
so we know how we're coming out.

13
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:20,714
Sure, it'll be Ryan Gaul...
Nope, nope, nope.

14
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:21,780
Nobody's gonna be snapping.

15
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,980

We're gonna be performing
long-form improv.

26
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,604
Some people have done improv before.

27
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:00,970
Some people have not.

28
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,737
Everybody on the stage will have been in season three

29
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,604
of<i> House of Lies,</i> which is on Showtime.

30
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,670
That's [bleep] insane.

31
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,937
Are you guys ready

32
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:12,804

33
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,004
Yeah!

And give it up for Golden Globe

40
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:44,704
- Oh.
- This is the cast, okay, guys?

41
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,770
So what we're gonna do is,

42
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,970
we're gonna get a suggestion from you.

43
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:49,404
The suggestion is gonna be "the
greatest lie you've ever told,"

44
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,537
and then we're gonna improvise.

45
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:51,904
Everything will be made up on the spot.

46
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,537
This show will exist in this moment, then evaporate,

47
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,937
except for now it's being recorded for eternity.

48
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,537
But, like, for us, it...
It just exists in this moment.

49
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:01,804
So all we need to get started is
the biggest lie you've ever told.

50
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,737
Someone shout it out right now.
- I'm pregnant.

51
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,804
Great.

52
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,804
You came very pre...
and a man said that, correct?

53
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:10,604
We're doing great.
"I'm pregnant."

54
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:14,538
All right, you guys don't have
to say anything else ever again.

55
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,404
- What is it?
- I don't know.

56
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:23,570
I don't know how it happened.

57
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,004
What do you mean?

58
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,804
First of all, that's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

59
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:27,804
I know!

60
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:29,470
Who have you had sex with, huh?

61
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,704
- Well...
- 'Cause you said you never cheated on me.

62
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,804
Oh, define "cheated."

63
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,970
Putting your penis in a different woman.

64
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,604
Yeah, I cheated on you.
Yeah, I cheated on you.

65
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,904
- Yes!
- But how did I get pregnant?

66
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:43,337
That's the part I can't figure out!

67
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:44,737
- We got to go to a doctor.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:47,037
There's a lot of things this doctor has to figure out

69
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,104
more than anything.

70
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,637
Let's talk to a doctor, please.

71
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:52,804
So let me get this straight.
Um, could...

72
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,970
- I'm sorry.
- Just hold up.

73
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,437
- Wait, I'm sorry.
- Just hold on a second.

74
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,570
- Are you eating your pencil?
- What are you doing?

75
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,004
You just took a bite out of your pencil.

76
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,370
Hey, guys, we're here for...

77
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,604
We're here for a specific reason, okay?

78
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,870
So you're pregnant?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,904
- But you're a man.
- And he's... it's a guy.

80
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:03,904
- You're a man.
- It's a guy.

81
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,004
- Yeah.
- It's weird.

82
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,437
We're seeing a lot of it.
- Really?

83
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,004
Yeah. We're actually seeing
a lot of this.

84
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,370
- He's not even taking notes.
- No, listen...

85
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:11,737
Why is he in here?

86
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,104
Okay, you have a lot of attitude for
a couple of people coming to a doctor.

87
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,504
- You're right.
- Okay?

88
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,970
- You're right.
- Tell us what's going on.

89
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,470
Please tell us what's going on.
- Okay, well, you're pregnant.

90
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,870
You're gonna had a ki...
I assume you guys are married?

91
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,370
- What? How?
- Did he start saying "kitten"?

92
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,404
Is that how it works?

93
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,470
Yeah, you're gonna have a kit...

94
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,870
A man can't be pregnant with a baby.

95
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,737
No, you're gonna...

96
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,904
You're going to have a kitten.
And congratulations.

97
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,704
- Mm, congratulations.
- Doctor, I'm so sorry.

98
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,637
I just... I-I'm freaking out
right now because

99
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,437
I think I got my boyfriend pregnant...

100
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:36,704
- Oh, no.
- And I'm allergic to cats!

101
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:37,837
- Hey, relax!
- Sit... sit down.

102
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,037
And I don't...
like, I'm flipping out

103
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,337
right now, because it's not that I don't...

104
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:41,737
Here, here, here.
You want a pencil?

105
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,504
Yo, we need [bleep] plan "B," man.

106
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:44,870
Yeah.

107
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,337
Ted, please have a seat.

108
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:47,504
Look, already, man!
We're going to break up.

109
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:48,904
It's okay.
No, have a seat.

110
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,870
All right, well, we can do a "cabortion," if you like.

111
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,104
Yeah!

112
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:56,437
Can't we just put it up for "cadoption"?

113
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,604
Hey, I'm looking for a, um...

114
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm looking for a kitten.

115
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,470
Yeah, you want a cat?

116
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,537
A little kitty cat?
- Yeah!

117
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:05,437
Oh!
Let's get you hooked up

118
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:07,470
with one of them kitty cats!
Oh, cool.

119
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,670
All right.

120
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,104
- So, it just...
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:12,938
This one we just got fresh a couple...

122
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,637
I got to tell you, a lot of men getting pregnant.

123
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:21,104
Business is booming for the cat man!

124
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:22,670
Okay.
There you go!

125
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,952
They call you "The Cat Man"?
They call me "the Cat Man."

126
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:33,004
- I'm the cat man!
- Yeah.

127
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,604
Okay.
Can I ask you a question

128
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,604
about why this cat is just eating a pencil?

129
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,905
Oh.

130
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,004
- Uh, can I get that, um...
- Sorry. What?

131
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,404
Twothree waiters is fine.
Four waiters is... five waiters.

132
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,670
Oh, my God!
I told you I was so...

133
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:50,804
Six waiters is fine.

134
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,437
Thank you so much.
- Terrified to come here

135
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,804
because they do this to everybody.

136
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:54,970
I see it in the window.
- I know.

137
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,470
They're, like, right up in your space,

138
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,637
and I'm just trying to eat...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:59,004
And I feel like I have something in my teeth.

140
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,504
Oh, God, that's the worst.

141
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,070
- I hate that!
- It's because I didn't leave

142
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,337
a tip last time.
- Yeah, yeah, we remember.

143
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,870
We apologize about the tip.

144
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:07,337
Hey, what do you want...
what do you guys want to drink?

145
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:10,004
Yeah, something to start with?
Tap water, filtered water?

146
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,471
Do you want some sparkling water?

147
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,004
What kind of water do you guys need?

148
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:17,004
Uh, just regular water.

149
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,004
- We have Rosemary chicken.
- Wet your whistle.

150
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,037
Waiters, waiters, can you bring, um...

151
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,105
Can you bring the champagne?
- Yeah!

152
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,437
- No problem, no problem.
- Champagne!

153
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:31,337
No problem.
You got it, you got it.

154
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,870
Oh!

155
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,604
- Hey!
- Yes!

156
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,470
Hey, did you say "champagne" or "chair pain"?

157
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,437
- Champagne.
- Oh!

158
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:41,804
Champagne.
Champagne.

159
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:42,804
- Can I say to you...
- Yeah?

160
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,570
- Can I say to you...
- Yes.

161
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,670
It's champagne.

162
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,737
Don't want to ruin the surprise.

163
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,037
We have a Rosemary crusted chicken!

164
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,737
- Oh!
- Shh, sir? Sir?

165
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:52,837
- It's so good!
- Just give me a minute.

166
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:54,070
One minute, just to talk.
- One minute.

167
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,104
- Just to talk to my girlfriend.
- We didn't know.

168
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,105
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

169
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:02,970
A minute. A minute.
A minute.

170
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,570
No, no!

171
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,037
A minute.
A minute.

172
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:07,570
A minute. A minute.
No, a minute.

173
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:08,704
A minute.
It's crusted with Rosemary.

174
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,870
A minute.
A minute.

175
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:10,871
A minute.
- One minute.

176
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,837
Jenna...

177
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,504
One minute. One...
- Didgeridoo.

178
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:18,704
One minute.

179
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,337
One minute.
- It's a tough one to mime.

180
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,737
Okay.

181
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:22,870
Do you remember when I...

182
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:25,470
Stop it! Stop it.

183
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,637
That's better.
- Here we go.

184
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,437
- That one's better.
- That's better.

185
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:31,904
Do you remember when, um...
you remember when I saw you...

186
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:33,404
- Yeah?
- And I said...

187
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,604
I said, "I want to see that
face for the rest of my life"?

188
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,605
It was a lie!
It was a lie!

189
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,871
Wait. What is that?
What is that?

190
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,604
How can I help you?

191
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,837
Uh, hey, um, I'm looking to change my service.

192
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,670
I'm so sorry.
What was that?

193
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,770
I'm looking to change my service.

194
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:06,537
There's somebody else on my phone!

195
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,537
Oh, are you getting a crossover signal?

196
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,670
Yeah, yeah, there's somebody...
I was call...

197
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,337
This is why I want to change my service!

198
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,370
Okay, I just need to have one
of your social security numbers.

199
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:17,437
Okay, yeah.
5...

200
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,504
Mmhmm.

201
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,804
If that's true, that person's not alive.

202
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,337
- 3-2-6-4...
- No?

203
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:24,370
546-2.

204
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,337
- Okay.
- Oh, very cute.

205
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:28,804
- Oh, my God, thank you.
- You're welcome.

206
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:29,870
You're welcome.
Oh, what's your name?

207
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,004
- Danica.
- Yeah?

208
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,604
So you gonna take care of this?

209
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, I'm sorry.
And what...

210
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,704
And can I...
- Is your name Patsy?

211
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,737
- Patsy, yeah.
- Okay.

212
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:39,004
Yeah, okay.
We got you both here.

213
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,037
I can see the problem.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,537
It seems like... Richard, are
you signed up for a dual line?

215
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,870
What I bought is a dual line.

216
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,070
It's a cheaper line.
It's a cheaper line.

217
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,604
It's a cheaper line.
I said, "anytime I make

218
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:50,104
a phone call, you can just
patch anyone you want in."

219
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,604
Yep.
You press...

220
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,337
It's really bothering me, though.

221
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,870
I'm so sorry.
I get it. I get it.

222
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,337
Okay, so he patched into mine, right?

223
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:57,337
I get it, yeah.

224
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,404
And you have the right person, Patsy?

225
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,970
- Yeah, I see you right here.
- Okay.

226
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,737
'Cause that's me.
- Yeah.

227
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:04,404
I have some good news, and I have some bad news.

228
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:08,004
- Ooh, give me the good one.
- The good news...

229
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,004
The good news is that I'm...

230
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,970
There's a chance I can change this for you guys

231
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,870
and get you on each individual contracts.

232
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,337
- All right!
- The bad news is,

233
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,804
I just found out I can't do it, though.

234
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:18,870
What?

235
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,337
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

236
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:21,504
- Yeah, absolutely.
- We're gonna keep you on board.

237
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,604
Yes!

238
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,004
- Sit down!
- Okay.

239
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,837
No, honestly, I thought you were gonna...

240
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,870
This was, like...
- No, no.

241
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,337
I should fire you, okay?
- I know.

242
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,470
- Are you firing him?
- Huh?

243
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,470
N-not--
- Somebody's getting fired!

244
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,104
- No, guys! Guys!
- Oh!

245
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:37,004
Champagne! Champagne!

246
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:40,104
You're fired.

247
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:42,337
You're fired.
You're fired.

248
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,337
- Hi.
- So, thank you guys so much.

249
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,404
- Yeah.
- So, the last person

250
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,504
was terrible with customer service.

251
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,537
- Right.
- Don't say "good news"...

252
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,570
"Calls are monitored."

253
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,870
- Thank you so much!
- I know it!

254
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,337
I know!
- Thank you!

255
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,704
- "For quality assurance."
- This is great!

256
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,004
- I...
- Use this when you're

257
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,004
on the phone with people.
- Right.

258
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,504
Well, I'm not gonna say that,

259
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,704
'cause I think the automated voice

260
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,470
in the beginning says it, right?
- Smart.

261
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,470
When you get on the phone with
people and you have bad news,

262
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:01,870
just give 'em the bad news.

263
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:03,404
Don't sugarcoat it, okay?
- Quickly!

264
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,804
- Quickly!
- Hi. It's, uh...

265
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,404
I talked to you guys earlier this week.

266
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,604
This is Patsy.

267
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,804
- Patsy, Patsy.
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:11,937
Oh, yeah, I got you right here, pats.

269
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,404
- Oh, great.
- What's up?

270
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,870
- Great. Hi... wow, hi.
- Hi.

271
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,837
- Uh, I'm doing well.
- Hi!

272
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,437
- Uh, I...
- Patsy, real quick,

273
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:21,604
I got to cancel your service.

274
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,605
- "Real quick"?
- Yeah.

275
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,470
Yeah, baby!

276
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:29,837
Okay?

277
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,337
This time, you could even be
a little harsher, if you want.

278
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,837
Get right to it.
There's no problem, okay?

279
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,637
- Okay, okay, so don't...
- You're nailing this job.

280
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,804
Be cordial at all.
Just...

281
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,470
- Don't... what's the point?
- I know.

282
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,337
I kind of feel like...

283
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:40,537
- Hi. I'm having a situation...
- Hi.

284
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,805
Nope!

285
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,670
Whoo!

286
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:47,870
- Thank you.
- If you can do it

287
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,570
without them getting a word out,

288
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,770
I will honestly promote you to my job.

289
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,070
- Oh, my gosh.
- And I'll go see my kids

290
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:54,670
for the first time in, like, seven years.

291
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:58,370
Done! I'm saving the company
that much money.

292
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,705
Right.

293
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:09,570
Okay.

294
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,004
So?
- All right, well, I mean--

295
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,770
- I will admit, when you sit in the chair,

296
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,470
you tell the truth.

297
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,070
So don't sit in the chair unless you're will...

298
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,104
No, it's not, it's not a...
- No, no, no!

299
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,704
Don't say that, don't do that!

300
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,570
- You're yanking my [bleep]!
- Can I ask you a question?

301
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,337
First of all, do you really [bleep] like this?

302
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:24,337
Yeah.

303
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,004
Like, show me how you masturbate.

304
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,970
Oh, I mean, I just masturbate like a regular guy.

305
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,070
I just... just like this.

306
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,537
I mean, it's...
you know, you guys.

307
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:32,937
No, you were doing it over here.

308
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:34,104
No, I do.
I masturbate like this!

309
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,537
See?
Get out of the chair!

310
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:36,937
- Get out of that chair.
- Did you see what happened?

311
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:38,837
Oh, [bleep]! Oh, my God, dude,
that's not funny.

312
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,837
- No.
- Wait, hang on.

313
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,070
That's the truth?
- Huh?

314
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:45,337
You masturbate out of your thigh?

315
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,870
No, [bleep]!

316
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,404
Fine, then do you know where your penis is?

317
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,470
Yes, of course I know where it is.

318
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,637
- Take a seat.
- Uh, you guys.

319
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,704
You guys, what's a penis?

320
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,771
- Get up.
- What?

321
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,404
I don't...

322
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:01,770
- This is bad.
- By the way,

323
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,337
the chair works.
- Yeah.

324
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,604
A-plus for us.
- Oh!

325
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,837
- Because we were unsure.
- We were unsure.

326
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:08,870
- Oh, honestly?
- Yeah.

327
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,437
You're onto something here.

328
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,937
I mean, you got to use this chair for good,

329
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,004
not for finding out if guys like
me don't know what a penis is.

330
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,337
I mean, I feel like everyone is gonna be doing that.

331
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,604
Have you had sex before?

332
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,970
Ah, come on!

333
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,804
Tell the truth.
You know we got the chair here.

334
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,870
Hey, man, this one I got no problem about.

335
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,104
Have you had sex before?

336
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,804
Yeah, man, I've had a whole bunch of sex.

337
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:30,004
All the time.
- No, sit on it!

338
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,337
- What are you talking about?
- Sit on it.

339
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,470
Sit on it.
- Fine.

340
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:33,670
Fine... aah!

341
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,605
Women frighten me!
- Oh!

342
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,018
Do you mind if I put my popcorn right here?

343
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,329
You know, yeah, go ahead.

344
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,762
- Is that fine?
- Yeah.

345
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,041
Hey, you guys, when you have a chance,

346
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,907
could you shut the [bleep] up so we...

347
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,419
Wow.

348
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,419
Nice.

349
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,486
I didn't even think...

350
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,219
- Wow.
- I didn't even think we were...

351
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,419
Wow.

352
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,552
- Turn it the [bleep] down.
- Yeah.

353
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:58,486
Turn it the [bleep] down!

354
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,552
Wow.

355
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,652
I didn't think we were that loud.

356
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,152
We didn't think we were that loud.

357
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:05,686
The movie
hasn't even "stooted."

358
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,352
Oh, it's the Jimbo.
It's the Jimbo.

359
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,419
You know what I mean?

360
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,586
They have so much to say so early.

361
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,152
Some of us like to play the trivia questions.

362
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,452
- Really?
- So play it!

363
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,652
And you don't need to worry about the noise

364
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,419
because you can read, right, bitch?

365
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,319
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,687
- Uh-oh!
- No, you didn't!

367
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,552
- Ay yeah!
- "Mm-humba."

368
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:38,419
"Mm-humba."

369
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,486
- "Mm-humba."
- Excuse me, ladies?

370
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,052
My children and I just want
to watch<i> Walking with Dinosaurs</i>

371
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,219
without all this hullabaloo.

372
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,552
Good, well, the movie will
start, and we will quiet down...

373
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,119
- Thank you.
- But while it's still trivia...

374
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,586
It's anybody's game.

375
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,386
- It's game on.
- Game... it's game on.

376
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,552
It's like the beginning of the...

377
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:55,052
Sorry, I don't think my dad was clear.

378
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:56,286
He meant shut the [bleep] up.

379
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:58,119
Whoa!

380
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,552
That's right! That's right!
That's right!

381
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:03,420
My daughter, bitches!
That's my girl!

382
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,452
So this is it.
You just stand up here.

383
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,552
The light will go off.

384
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:10,752
If boats see it out at sea,

385
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:13,319
you just, like, make sure they can see the...

386
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,686
The light.
- If it goes out, I'm...

387
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,019
I turn it back on?

388
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

389
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,352
That's basically the one rule...
- So they can see it?

390
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:21,719
Yeah, as a lighthouse captain, that's
kind of the thing you got to remember.

391
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,219
Okay.

392
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,419
If you're asking me if it can get lonely...

393
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,286
Yeah.

394
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,719
Yeah.
Yeah.

395
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,319
And what do you do, just, like, or something?

396
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,219
What?
What was that?

397
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,052
I just...
So is it written down anywhere?

398
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:36,552
Just turn it off, or...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

399
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:39,019
You just... what did you just...
"Do you [bleep]?"

400
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,119
Yeah, I was like, what do you do up here all by yourself,

401
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,152
like, [bleep] [bleep], or...?
- Hey, hey.

402
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:46,153
You got a hip [bleep], man?

403
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,386
What?

404
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:52,686
Yes.

405
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:56,186
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

406
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,419
Eugene, this is the weirdest porno I've ever seen.

407
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,019
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

408
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,486
- You bumped right into it!
- Are you sure?

409
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,586
- It gets...
- No, he's...

410
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,252
It gets better.
It gets better.

411
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:07,052
Hey, put your [bleep] away, dude.

412
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,086
- It gets better.
- They never get to...

413
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,152
It does get lonely

414
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:11,652
up here, doesn't it?
- It does.

415
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,219
- Get to [bleep]!
- Hey, hey, hang on.

416
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,686
The shorter one has a monologue for a little while.

417
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,619
So run me through the instructions

418
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,152
of turning on the light.

419
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,486
- Well...
- Like, how exactly do I turn...

420
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,786
Is the shorter one playing with her [bleep]?

421
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,352
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:27,552
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here we go.

423
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,152
Oh, yeah, now it's getting good.

424
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:30,552
Now we got it.

425
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:32,152
- It's okay.
- Did somebody order a pizza

426
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:34,019
in this lighthouse?
- What'd I tell you?

427
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,786
Oh, yeah!

428
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:39,019
Yo, yo!
How did that bitch get there?

429
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,619
A lighthouse is so far away from land!

430
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,152
How did that bitch get there?
- Oh, yeah.

431
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:45,019
Why don't you pop that pizza down right here, right?

432
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,186
Oh, now we're getting to [bleep]!

433
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,252
Oh, my God!

434
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:51,419
It's ramming me in my side vagina!

435
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,219
- All right, hang on, hang on.
- Pause, pause, pause!

436
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,086
- Pause, pause.
- Okay, I forgot to tell you,

437
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,152
my pornos get
a little "rapey."

438
00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:59,152
Like, they just go immediately...

439
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,686
Like, she's just putting a pizza...

440
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,586
- But they're not [bleep]!
- I'll tell you... guys, guys.

441
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,252
I'm gonna fast-forward
to the [bleep].

442
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:07,286
Fast forward here, okay?

443
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:09,386
- No, press play, press play!
- Play, play, play, play!

444
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:13,487
Play, play, play, play, play!

445
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,286
Now get out of here!
- What the [bleep]?

446
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,687
Get out!

447
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:30,686
State your name

448
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,452
when you're in the front.
- Okay.

449
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:34,787
Um, Lisa Simpson.
- Lisa Simpson?

450
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,686
I'm assuming... I'm assuming
not <i>the</i> Lisa Simpson?

451
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,486
- No, I know, it sucks.
- Right.

452
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,552
Uh, can I see your profile?
- Uh-huh.

453
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,686
- Height?
- Uh, 27 inches.

454
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,252
- Profile?
- It's Lisa Simpson.

455
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,352
Is that Lisa Simpson?

456
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:51,519
It's really, truly Lisa Simpson.

457
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,052
- Is that the real Lisa Simpson?
- No, it's not.

458
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,086
I'm the same height, I look a lot like her.

459
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,286
Okay, can you do the scene?

460
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:56,286
Can you do the scene, please, Lisa?

461
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,319
- Yes.
- Face forward.

462
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,019
- Yeah.
- And, you know, be yourself.

463
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,386
Like, be yourself.
- Yeah.

464
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,586
How many fingers do you have?

465
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,286
- Four.
- Okay.

466
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,519
- It's Lisa Simpson.
- Josh, whenever you're ready.

467
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,386
- Bart, come on.
- And cut.

468
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,419
There's no Bart in this.
- Yeah, no Bart.

469
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,219
- It's a commercial...
- Not even a Bart.

470
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,786
What is it, Josh?
A commercial for...?

471
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,619
- A commercial for balloons.
- Oh.

472
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,686
- Just balloons.
- No, I...

473
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,286
Just say my name?

474
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,552
- Yes, just say your name.
- Just say your name, yeah.

475
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:25,386
Luis Guzman.

476
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,752
- Well, look...
- All right, sir.

477
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,186
And then Josh will be reading with you.

478
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,452
- I'll be reading with you.
- Thanks. Thanks.

479
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,019
And you know it's a commercial for balloons.

480
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,319
Whenever you're ready, action, Luis.

481
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,719
- What kind of balloons?
- Hey.

482
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,552
Well, we got every color balloon...

483
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,119
blue, red, purple, and green.

484
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,419
Are they my friend?

485
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,686
Try to stick on script, sir.

486
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,552
- Not allowed to improv?
- Not allowed to improv.

487
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,419
- Please don't improvise.
- Don't improvise?

488
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,686
Just stick to the script.
Just whatever's on... yeah.

489
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,252
My bread and butter is my improv.

490
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,619
Okay.
At the end, at the end...

491
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,419
You can add a little flourish at the end.

492
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,752
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:57,486
Let's start from the top, if you don't mind, guys.

494
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,419
And cameras are rolling.
Luis, whenever you're ready.

495
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,752
What kind of balloons?

496
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:06,086
We got every color balloon...
blue, red, purple, and green.

497
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,052
Can I get the address?

498
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,153
What are you saying?

499
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,419
Hi. My name
is Tony St. McClair.

500
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,586
I am an aftra "must join,"

501
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:21,486
and I need this pretty bad.
- Cool.

502
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,019
So, again, it's a commercial for balloons.

503
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,486
Whenever you're ready.
- I already--I read the sides.

504
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,252
I am not even holding them.
- Oh, wow, very prepared.

505
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,352
- That's great.
- I memorized.

506
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,552
Josh will be reading with you,

507
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:30,152
whenever you're ready.
- Okay, Josh.

508
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,186
Nice to meet you.

509
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:34,187
Uh...

510
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,586
What kind...

511
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,019
Of the balloons?

512
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,486
So, again, just on script.

513
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,519
Its the same script that we've had the whole day.

514
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,686
- But, uh...
- "What are these?" I think.

515
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,052
Right?
- "What are the--," okay.

516
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,286
Can I do it again?

517
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:49,719
No, no.

518
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,286
No.

519
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,152
So, whenever you're ready.
Your name again, sir?

520
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,686
- Tony St. McClair.
- Okay.

521
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,719
Oh, you're kind of Irish, but not?

522
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,587
- No, actually, I'm 100% French.
- Okay.

523
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:03,686
Thanks for asking, though.
A lot of people...

524
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,152
I don't care about your life story, buddy.

525
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:06,152
So, whenever you're ready, Josh is ready for you.

526
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:07,252
You do?
I couldn't hear.

527
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:08,686
You do want to hear it, or you don't?

528
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,119
I do not want to hear your life story.

529
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,286
- Okay.
- Whenever you're ready.

530
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:12,519
We're running out of tape.
- Absolutely.

531
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,019
What, um... In terms of
the balloons, what kinds...

532
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,552
- That's fine. Keep going.
- All over the place.

533
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,219
Yeah, we've got every kind of balloon...

534
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,286
blue, green, orange, and purple.

535
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,152
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are they my friends?

536
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,019
No.

537
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,286
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to <i>That's My Answer.</i>

538
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,119
The following three contestants are still in the running.

539
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,119
Whawha... what?

540
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,152
We have Sally pulleys.

541
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:36,286
Whawha... wha...
oh, that's you?

542
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:42,287
We have Cooper super-duper
looper Craig.

543
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,786
Okay.
And we have Diane.

544
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,152
- Thank you.
- You remember...

545
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,519
The name of the show was...
What was it?

546
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,086
- <i> That's My Answer.</i>
- <i> That's My Answer.</i>

547
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,319
Great!

548
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,386
One point for Diane.

549
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:55,552
No!

550
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,152
Okay, this is how...
This is how it works.

551
00:19:57,153 --> 00:20:00,119
We have a series of your "personal people,"

552
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,419
from your "personal lives," in the back.

553
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,786
- Oh, my God.
- They're gonna ask a question.

554
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,152
- Oh, my God.
- And you guys have

555
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,152
to answer the exact way you answered them

556
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:08,586
in the real life.
- Okay.

557
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,686
- Oh, this doesn't make sense!
- Okay.

558
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,152
Here we go, okay?
The question will be there,

559
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,486
and you have to try to remember the
way you answered in real life.

560
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,586
- Yes.
- Okay.

561
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,752
"Do you love me, or do you not love me?

562
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:20,119
Because honestly,
I can't tell anymore."

563
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,652
Yes.

564
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,252
Come on, what?

565
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,619
Yep!
Points!

566
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,519
Point for super-duper
looper Cooper!

567
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,019
Point for super-duper...

568
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,052
Now, these are questions that have been asked

569
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,086
to all three of you.

570
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:33,286
- I should have known that one.
- Yes.

571
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:34,452
Honestly, I should have known that one.

572
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:37,552
Here we go, number two.

573
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:40,519
"I don't get it.
It's like you were, you know,

574
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,319
"taken advantage of as a child.

575
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,019
"Why do you have to always take this out on me?

576
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,319
Am I not good enough
for you?"

577
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,552
I was raped as a child!

578
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,152
- Whoa!
- That's what I was gonna say.

579
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,652
- Diane, you get a point.
- Thank you! Yes!

580
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,653
- Nice.
- Last one... "why me?"

581
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:58,652
'Cause you're here.

582
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,786
Correct!
You go to the bonus round!

583
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:02,152
Oh!

584
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:03,352
- Yeah, thanks, Cooper.
- If you don't mind.

585
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:05,752
We have Mary.
You have your last girlfriend

586
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,019
who you broke up with, okay?

587
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,352
- Oh, hey, Mary.
- Hi.

588
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:11,719
Okay, now, as you know, things didn't end perfectly

589
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,486
for you two, okay?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

590
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,552
Mary is going to say the sentence

591
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,152
that broke up your relationship.

592
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,586
You have to remember, word for word,

593
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:20,719
how to answer it.

594
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,652
The audience, put 20 seconds on the clock.

595
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:24,419
I don't know why the audience's job is that.

596
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,452
Put it on the clock.

597
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,686
- Audience, are you ready?
- Yeah!

598
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,552
Ready!
We're so ready!

599
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:34,319
I love watching stuff!

600
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,652
And, Kristen, when you're ready,

601
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,019
20 seconds on the clock.

602
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,552
What the hell is that substance on the table?

603
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:40,619
- That's it, 20...
- Yeah, I know, yeah.

604
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,319
- Yeah, I know.
- 18...

605
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,352
- Yeah, no, I know.
- 17, 16...

606
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:44,386
Yeah, I know it's...

607
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,519
Yeah, I know it...
- 17, 16...

608
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,586
- Yeah, I know it feels weird.
- 15, 14...

609
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,186
- Yeah, I know, but that's me.
- 13...

610
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,686
Ahh! I'm so sorry,
the answer was,

611
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:52,186
"that's a condom!"

612
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,686
- Oh!
- Yes!

613
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,586
- Oh, that's what broke us up?
- That's what broke you up.

614
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:59,253
- Yeesh!
- Okay, well...

615
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,452
Do it, Ryan.
See what happens.

616
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:08,186
Come here.

617
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:09,619
Come on, Ryan.
Go for it, Ryan.

618
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,286
- Ryan, come on.
- Go for it. Do a scene.

619
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,286
- I'm just scared.
- Do a scene.

620
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,319
Yeah, come on, go for it.

621
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,452
- Do a scene. Initiate!
- Do it, man.

622
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:16,252
- I'm nervous about it.
- Initiate!

623
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,252
- I know.
- Just do it.

624
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,286
- I'm nervous.
- Come on.

625
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,386
Do a scene.

626
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:20,586
- You guys...
- Just initiate.

627
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:22,419
Come on.

628
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,652
Do a scene.

629
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:24,752
- Do it, man.
- Do a scene.

630
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:26,287
Go, go, go, go, go.
Ryan, do a scene.

631
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,019
I'm literally off the stage.

632
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,220
I can't do one now.

633
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,286
I feel like it's intimidating.
- Go, go!

634
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,052
No, I'm not...
Why would I take all these?

635
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:39,519
- Get in there.
- God! I can't!

636
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,519
- Go, go!
- I'll try.

637
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,386
Chairs for sale!

638
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:44,686
What?

639
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:46,686
- Chairs for sale!
- Good!

640
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:49,686
Good! Come on!
- It's not working!

641
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,086
They're not...

642
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:52,419
The joke is not landing.

643
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,286
Oh, cool.

644
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,419
Cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,119
You guys interested in chairs?
I got chairs.

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,286
What type of chairs you got?

647
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,019
I got dinner chairs.
I got bathroom chairs.

648
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,219
- Nice.
- Oh!

649
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,152
- Bathroom chairs?
- For the bathroom?

650
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,619
See, you got to have a chair in the bathroom,

651
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,019
I'm the guy you want to talk to.

652
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,686
Ryan Gaul, can I talk to you for a second?

653
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,686
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

654
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,019
- Ryan, can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

655
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,219
I'm here with <i>The New York Times.</i>

656
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,619
- Yeah.
- We were around for what

657
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,586
people have called, "the greatest improv initiation

658
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:16,152
of all time."
- Yeah.

659
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:18,019
Supposedly, it was the best bit of all time.

660
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,686
You took five chairs?
- Yeah.

661
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:21,286
Which were...
- Oh, wha-wha-wha-wha-wha?

662
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:22,552
- They weren't that heavy.
- Huh?

663
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:23,652
- They weren't that heavy.
- And what happened?

664
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,786
They said that the audience exploded?

665
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,052
What does that mean?

666
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,252
Exploded with laughter, I think.

667
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:28,486
Oh, with laughter, not physically exploding?

668
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,286
I don't think so, but honestly, it was dark.

669
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,086
I couldn't tell.
- What are you gonna do now?

670
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,419
What do you do after this?
After you've defeated...

671
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,752
After you've beaten comedy, what's the point?

672
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:36,152
What do you do next?

673
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,552
You got to find what you're good at,

674
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:39,119
and I'm good with chairs,

675
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,552
so I mean...
- Really good.

676
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:43,119
Okay, just state your name.
Face forward, please.

677
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,052
Uh, it's Ryan Gaul.

678
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,086
Okay, profiles?

679
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,652
Thank you.
I really needed that. Okay.

680
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,552
So, whenever you're ready...

681
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,286
Just before we start,

682
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:54,286
I want to say I'm a big fan.

683
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:57,352
I was there when you did the chair bit.

684
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,152
I was... I was one of the people
you hit on the side.

685
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:01,586
Oh.
Sorry about that.

686
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,719
But my wife literally exploded.

687
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,052
Okay.

688
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:06,186
- And, um...
- Oh!

689
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:07,486
And I'll never forgive you for that.

690
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,019
- Oh.
- I'll never forgive you

691
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,052
for that.
- I'm sorry.

692
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:13,652
I'll go ahead and start.
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,119
Did you take my [bleep] chair?

694
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,352
Guys, we have a problem.

695
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,519
Guys, guys, the camera exploded.
What do we do?

696
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,019
Oh!
Oh, my...

697
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,452
I'll record it on my Google Glasses.

698
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,052
Oh, record it on your Google Glasses!

699
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:24,286
Yeah.
No, I got it.

700
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:26,686
Smart.

701
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:27,719
You take my [bleep] chair?

702
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,452
Oh, no!

703
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:33,286
- Oh, no!
- You're a monster!

704
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:35,652
- I'm sorry!
- We're gathered here today

705
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:40,052

706
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,686

00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,187
Ryan Gaul is gonna do the eulogy.

708
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:50,020
So, Ryan, if you would just like to say a couple words...

709
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:54,187
Thanks, Don.

710
00:24:58,287 --> 00:24:59,386
Woody...

711
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,386
- No!

712
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:01,552
- No, I...
- Oh, my God!

713
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:02,786
Oh!

714
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:04,152
Keep going.

715
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:05,152
Oh.

716
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,419
- Here.
- Thank you.

717
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Not the bathroom chair.

718
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,186
Trusty bathroom chair.

719
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,152

- - Unh!

720
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:16,686
- No!
- Oh, whoa!

721
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,552
- Um...
- This isn't safe.

722
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:20,552
I shouldn't be doing this.
- No, I really want to know

723
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,686
what you're gonna say.

724
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:25,686
- Okay.
- Are you insane?

725
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,553
Chairs were a huge...

726
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:30,687
- No!
It went out of order!

727
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:36,419
