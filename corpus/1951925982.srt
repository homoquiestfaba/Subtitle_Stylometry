2
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,760
It's hard to believe he's gone 

3
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,731
For all his triumphs...

4
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:45,325
I fear that even in death
He will find no peace


5
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,087
Nor will those who fought beside him

6
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,325
Still... we must move forward 

7
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:59,290
and while others will come to accept
that his crusade has come to an end

8
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:02,968
for Dick Grayson 

9
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,327
It begins again!

10
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:23,688
What's gotten into you? 

11
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,411
It's like you're training for a war

12
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:33,285
We will find Batman's killers 

13
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,601
and bring them to justice

14
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:37,605
and that's all I can say

15
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,729
Ah... Saleena 

16
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:01,406
You're making a mess of my plan

17
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,371
Careful! This kitten to bites

18
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:09,003
Well, I see you've done your homework

19
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,810
Now let it go

20
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:15,681
Your crime fighting days are over

21
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,004
I've seen you... together

22
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,571
So don't you know them to recon side?

23
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:31,563
Don’t act like I don't know
what you're doing

24
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,124
Barbara...

25
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,445
I won't be a part of it, Dick.
Not again

26
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,450
Careful

27
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,045
Old heroes bring about old villains

28
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,406
You need to tell me what you know

29
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:29,082
I want him out of the equation

30
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,407
Easy, boy 

31
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,684
Stay out of this, Clark
