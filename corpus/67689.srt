1
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,363
Doug?

2
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:45,025
Honey, are you all right?

3
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,538
You're dreaming.

4
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,910
Was it about Mars?

5
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,411
Is that better?

6
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,816
My poor baby.

7
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,325
This is getting to be
an obsession.

8
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:17,763
Was she there?

9
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,237
Who?

10
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:26,106
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

11
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,573
Lori.

12
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:34,485
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

13
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:38,054
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

14
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,353
"Nobody"? What's her name?

15
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,858
I don't know.

16
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:44,958
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

17
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,328
You better tell me!

18
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,165
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

19
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,932
And I'm always back
in the morning.

20
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,438
Let me go!

21
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:00,103
Come on, baby.

22
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:03,204
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

23
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:04,976
You mean it?

24
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,018
You know I do.

25
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,397
I'll give you
something to dream about.

26
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:30,508
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

27
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:34,103
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

28
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:38,275
are our only defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

29
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,784
And more violence
last night on Mars...

30
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,184
where terrorists
demanding independence...

31
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:46,713
once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.

32
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:53,893
Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade...

33
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,990
claimed credit
for this latest bombing,

34
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,332
which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

35
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,299
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

36
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:10,178
and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.

37
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,738
No cameras!

38
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:15,912
With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

39
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:18,080
vowed that troops
would be used if necessary...

40
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:21,990
to keep production
at full capacity.

41
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,496
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

42
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,065
- Lori.
- Doug?

43
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:35,504
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

44
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,006
Move to Mars.

45
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:41,510
Why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

46
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:44,614
Just think about it.

47
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:50,353
We've been through this before.
You'd hate it on Mars.

48
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,255
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

49
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:58,456
I mean, really, a revolution
could break out there any second.

50
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,464
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

51
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,133
You believe him?

52
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,439
Okay. Forget about it.

53
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:18,807
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

54
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:22,580
Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.

55
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,588
It's absurd to think
we'd give it away...

56
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:27,250
just because some lazy mutants
think they own the planet.

57
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,919
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Any comment on the rumor...

58
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,898
- Lori, move.
- that you've closed the Pyramid Mine...

59
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,900
because you found
alien artifacts inside?

60
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:39,960
There's a lot better places
than Mars.

61
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,973
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

62
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,034
I wish we could find some artifacts.
Our tourist industry could use a boost.

63
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,672
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

64
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:53,479
The fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

65
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,644
to undermine trust
in the government.

66
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,349
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

67
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:03,087
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

68
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,288
- What do you say?
- That's the news.

69
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,297
- Stay tuned for weather.
- I'm late.

70
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,923
But first, this.

71
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:13,303
- Tonight, World Series Game Five...
- Sweetheart.

72
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:14,804
Iive from Tokyo.

73
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:21,611
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

74
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:28,543
Don't you understand? I feel like
I was made for something more than this.

75
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:33,357
I want to do something with my life,
to be somebody.

76
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,416
You are somebody.

77
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,620
You're the man I love.

78
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,666
Bye.

79
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,138
Have a nice day.

80
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,950
You are now entering
a safety zone.

81
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:14,397
No unauthorized weapons allowed
beyond this point.

82
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,778
Would you like to ski...

83
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,280
but you're snowed under
with work?

84
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:34,375
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

85
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,386
but you can't float the bill?

86
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:40,747
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

87
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,353
but now you're over the hill?

88
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,597
Then come to Rekall lncorporated...

89
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:50,725
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

90
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:53,464
cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.

91
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,302
So don't let life pass you by.

92
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,969
Call Rekall
for the memory of a lifetime.

93
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:03,946
For the memory of a lifetime

94
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:07,416
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

95
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:27,329
Harry.

96
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:33,108
- You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

97
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,112
Where they sell
those fake memories.

98
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,670
Oh, Rekall.

99
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,477
- Thinking of going there?
- Maybe.

100
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,487
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

101
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:48,083
A friend of mine tried it,
nearly got himself lobotomized.

102
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,022
No shit?

103
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,858
Don't fuck with your brain.
It ain't worth it.

104
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,600
I guess not.

105
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:43,346
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

106
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,507
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

107
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,410
- Bob?
- Yeah?

108
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,548
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- I'll be right out.

109
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,423
Just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

110
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,028
Thank you.

111
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,199
- Paul McClane. Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

112
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,902
Come on in.

113
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:15,774
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

114
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,577
Help me out here, Doug.

115
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,380
- You were interested in a memory of--
- Mars.

116
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,114
Yeah. Mars.

117
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:25,621
Is there a problem?

118
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,286
To be perfectly honest...

119
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,884
if you like outer space...

120
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:35,524
you'd be happier with
one of our Saturn cruises.

121
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,433
I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

122
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,999
Okay. You're the boss.

123
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:44,132
Mars it is.

124
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,503
Now, let me see.

125
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,636
The basic Mars package...

126
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:52,046
will run you 899 credits.

127
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:55,574
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

128
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:59,145
A longer trip is more expensive
because it's a deeper implant.

129
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,657
What's in the two-week package?

130
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:05,287
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

131
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,424
Private shuttle cabin, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

132
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,833
Mount Pyramid,
the Grand Canals...

133
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,429
and, of course, Venusville.

134
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,303
But how real does it seem?

135
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,607
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Don't bullshit me.

136
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,614
I'm telling you, your brain
will not know the difference.

137
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,741
That's guaranteed
or your money back.

138
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:30,151
What about the guy you lobotomized?
Did he get a refund?

139
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,850
You're talking ancient history.

140
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,920
Nowadays traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

141
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,931
Check out those statistics.

142
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,696
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

143
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,432
You got lost luggage,
lousy weather...

144
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,497
crooked taxi drivers.

145
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,770
When you travel with Rekall...

146
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,870
everything is perfect.

147
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,039
What do you say?

148
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,015
- All right.
- Smart move.

149
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:05,419
While you fill out
this questionnaire,

150
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,015
I'll familiarize you
with some of our options.

151
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:09,559
No options.

152
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:14,129
Whatever you say.
Let me ask you one question.

153
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,991
What is exactly the same...

154
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:20,231
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

155
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,531
I give up.

156
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,371
You. You're the same.

157
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:28,003
No matter where you go,
it's always you.

158
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:31,438
Let me suggest
that you take a vacation...

159
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,915
from yourself.

160
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,576
I know, it sounds wild.

161
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:37,587
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

162
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,812
I'm not interested.

163
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,688
You're gonna love this, Doug.

164
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,456
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

165
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,091
Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as a playboy...

166
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,032
or a famous jock or--

167
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,228
"Secret agent."

168
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:54,066
How much is that?

169
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:59,507
Let me tantalize you.

170
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:04,378
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

171
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,043
People are trying to kill you.

172
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,383
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

173
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:11,547
Go on.

174
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,284
I don't wanna spoil it for you...

175
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:16,553
but by the time
the trip is over...

176
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:20,620
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

177
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:22,188
Now, you tell me.

178
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:25,201
Isn't that worth
a measly 300 credits?

179
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,845
Your first trip?

180
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:45,088
Don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

181
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,315
Good evening... Doug.

182
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,758
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:54,628
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

184
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,634
Would you like us to integrate
some alien stuff?

185
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,636
Sure. Why not?

186
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,672
Two-headed monsters?

187
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,674
Don't you watch the news?

188
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:08,303
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

189
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,280
Yeah, they date back
a million years.

190
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,312
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

191
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:16,182
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

192
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:19,723
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

193
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,281
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

194
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,158
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

195
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:27,129
Number seven.

196
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:28,631
Ready for dreamland?

197
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:35,366
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

198
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,374
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself much more.

199
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:41,309
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

200
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,809
How do you like your women?

201
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:51,821
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

202
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:53,954
Brunette.

203
00:16:56,227 --> 00:17:00,186
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

204
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,034
Athletic.

205
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,242
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

206
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,835
Be honest.

207
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,345
Sleazy.

208
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:21,980
Demure.

209
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,088
41A, Ernie.

210
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,052
Boy, is he gonna have
a wild time.

211
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:34,589
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- That's for sure.

212
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,912
So...

213
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,888
what do you say?

214
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,891
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

215
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:07,363
Not true. We supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site...

216
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,365
and even letters from--

217
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,898
- What is it?
- Get down here.

218
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,304
I am with
a very important client.

219
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,809
Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.

220
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:23,139
I'll be right back.

221
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,306
Mr. McClane?

222
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,812
Bob! What's wrong?

223
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,819
Don't let her leave!

224
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,322
Get off!

225
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:39,958
You blew my cover!

226
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:43,228
You can't do a simple
goddamn double implant?

227
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,961
We hit a memory cap.

228
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:47,368
They're coming!
They'll kill you all!

229
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:50,168
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

230
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,141
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

231
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,579
My name is not Quaid.

232
00:18:56,647 --> 00:19:00,515
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

233
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:03,075
- Hold him down!
- Let me go!

234
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:29,075
Are you all right?

235
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:32,274
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

236
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:35,284
- He has really been there.
- Use your head.

237
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:38,651
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

238
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:40,657
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

239
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,522
We haven't implanted it yet.

240
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,026
Oh, shit.

241
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:53,228
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

242
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:54,566
Excuse me.

243
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,401
"Someone"?

244
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:58,408
We're talking about the Agency.

245
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:01,172
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

246
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:07,242
Renata, cover up any memory he's got
of us or Rekall.

247
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,548
I'll try.
It's pretty messy in there.

248
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,851
Ernie, dump him in a cab.
Tiffany, you help him.

249
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:15,915
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

250
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:19,326
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

251
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:35,177
Where am l?

252
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,449
You're in a Johnnycab.

253
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,109
What am I doing here?

254
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:44,677
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

255
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,814
How did I get in this taxi?

256
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,451
The door opened, you got in.

257
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,130
Hell of a day, isn't it?

258
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,780
- This okay?
- Right here.

259
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:12,543
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

260
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:15,107
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

261
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,653
Hey, Quaid.

262
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:20,121
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

263
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:23,285
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

264
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:26,556
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

265
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,122
- I told you not to, but you went.
- What are you, my father?

266
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:34,900
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Thank you. I'm already late--

267
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:39,799
Okay, bring him--
Come on, move it!

268
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,107
Let's go get that drink.
Move it!

269
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,637
What is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

270
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,776
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

271
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:52,084
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

272
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:55,614
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

273
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:02,663
You're making a big mistake.
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

274
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,201
You got yourself mixed up with--

275
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,181
And pivot... and serve...

276
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,723
and shift... and stroke...

277
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,189
Very good.
Perfect form.

278
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,168
Hi, honey.

279
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:18,439
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

280
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:20,101
Muggers?
Are you all right?

281
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:22,202
No, they were spies or something.

282
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,009
Harry, from work, he was the--
Get down!

283
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:29,041
- Harry was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

284
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,055
- Why would spies want to kill you?
- I don't know.

285
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,559
- It had something to do with Mars.
- You've never been to Mars.

286
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,960
It sounds crazy, but I went to
this Rekall place after work--

287
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,464
- Those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

288
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:46,731
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

289
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:50,240
Forget about Rekall.
They were going to kill me.

290
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:53,299
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

291
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:55,402
But I killed them.

292
00:23:57,281 --> 00:24:01,945
Listen, sweetheart. Those assholes
at Rekall have fucked up your mind.

293
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,317
You're having paranoid delusions.

294
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,822
You call this a delusion?

295
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:19,560
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

296
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:50,299
Lori, go! Get out!

297
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,051
Why are you doing this?

298
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,132
Talk!

299
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:03,298
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

300
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,364
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

301
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:08,036
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

302
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,945
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

303
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:12,447
It was an Agency implant.

304
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,108
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

305
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:18,052
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted?

306
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:21,057
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

307
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,558
Bullshit.

308
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,863
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

309
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:32,163
I was written in as your wife
so I could make sure the erasure took.

310
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,100
Sorry, Quaid.

311
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,371
Your whole life
is just a dream.

312
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:48,381
Okay, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am l?

313
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:49,578
Beats me.

314
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,855
I just work here.

315
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:03,731
There's something
I want you to know.

316
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:09,396
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

317
00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm honored.

318
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:15,111
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

319
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,408
If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

320
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:25,278
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

321
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:31,789
Clever girl.

322
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:38,267
You wouldn't shoot me, Doug,
after all we've been through.

323
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:41,270
Some of it was fun.

324
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,800
Nice knowing you.

325
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:21,704
Don't touch her.

326
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,871
Nobody here.

327
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:29,009
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

328
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,714
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

329
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:33,380
I've got him.

330
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,561
He's going for the subway.
Let's go.

331
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,574
Let's go. Move it.

332
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,790
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

333
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,792
What if they bring him back?

334
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,294
Not a chance.

335
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:22,738
Subway! Go!

336
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,783
Get him!
He's got a gun!

337
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,614
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

338
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,952
Hold it!

339
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:14,081
The escalator.

340
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:16,591
You four go up.
You come with me.

341
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,136
Get out of the way!

342
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:37,336
Move!

343
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:09,340
The platform!

344
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,084
- Which way?
- To the right.

345
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,842
Botco.
Tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

346
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,609
Don't settle for pale memories
or fake implants.

347
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:52,154
Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way...

348
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:55,521
on a real, live holiday
you can afford.

349
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,499
I want that fucker dead.

350
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,798
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want
Quaid porking my old lady.

351
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:11,807
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute.

352
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:16,876
Six-beta-nine, we have a live
transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

353
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:20,644
- Richter here.
- Patch it through.

354
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:24,244
- What is going on?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

355
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:26,983
I want him alive, you moron.

356
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:29,287
No. He knows too much.

357
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,819
Lori says
he can't remember anything.

358
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:35,456
In an hour
he could have total recall.

359
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:40,162
Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for reimplantation.

360
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,761
Have you got that?

361
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:44,898
I want him back in place
with Lori.

362
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,475
Did you hear me?

363
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:51,105
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

364
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:53,240
I got Quaid again.

365
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:56,547
Switching to another channel.
I've got sunspots.

366
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:00,683
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

367
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:03,658
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

368
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:06,093
We should've killed Quaid
on Mars.

369
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:32,712
- How we doing?
- Fine.

370
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:37,456
Zooming in.

371
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:38,619
We got him!

372
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:02,013
If you want to live,
don't hang up.

373
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,019
- What do you want?
- You've been bugged.

374
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:08,421
They'll be there in three minutes
unless you do as I say.

375
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:11,426
Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.

376
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,365
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

377
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,459
Wrap a wet towel around your head.
That'll muffle the signal.

378
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:22,471
- How'd you find me?
- I'd advise you to hurry.

379
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,644
This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.

380
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,915
- Shit!
- What?

381
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,480
- I lost him.
- Well, find him!

382
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:43,116
Yeah, right.

383
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:45,127
Hurry up.
You look beautiful.

384
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:51,295
Now go to the window.
Go.

385
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:56,432
Can you see me down here?

386
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:59,771
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

387
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:03,301
I'm gonna set it here.
Come and get it, keep moving.

388
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,439
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

389
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:09,042
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency on Mars.

390
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,611
You asked me, if you disappeared,
to find you, so here I am.

391
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:15,157
What was I doing on Mars?

392
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:21,554
Excuse me, but this is mine.

393
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,828
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

394
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:27,734
- Find your own bag.
- I need it!

395
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,735
Fuck you, you asshole!

396
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,184
He's gotta be around here
somewhere.

397
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,182
That guy there.

398
00:35:57,033 --> 00:36:00,594
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

399
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,336
Drive. Drive!

400
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:07,672
- Please repeat the destination.
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

401
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,678
Please state the street
and number.

402
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:11,873
Shit. Shit!

403
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:15,645
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat--

404
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,820
Fasten your seat belt!

405
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,362
The fare is 18 credits, please.

406
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,897
Sue me, dickhead.

407
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:14,399
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

408
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,805
Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.

409
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:55,236
If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself...

410
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:58,405
and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

411
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,939
Whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

412
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,519
You are not you.
You are me.

413
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,154
No shit.

414
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,654
Six-beta-nine,
six-beta-nine, come in.

415
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,163
Did you find him?

416
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:18,166
We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.

417
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,833
Send two units.
We'll meet you there.

418
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:29,144
All my life I've worked
for Mars intelligence.

419
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:31,305
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

420
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:34,316
But recently I met somebody--
a woman--

421
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:36,318
and I learned a few things.

422
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:39,184
I've been playing
for the wrong team.

423
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:44,224
All I can do now is try
to make up for it.

424
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:47,627
There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.

425
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:51,929
But if you're listening to this,
that means he has got to me first.

426
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,669
Here comes the hard part.

427
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:56,932
Now it is all up to you.

428
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:58,268
Great.

429
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:11,977
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

430
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:14,489
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

431
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:16,024
Find him.

432
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:19,027
First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.

433
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:22,895
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

434
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,991
Don't worry.
It's self-guiding.

435
00:40:30,974 --> 00:40:33,067
Just shove real hard.

436
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:40,779
When it crunches, you're there.

437
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,115
Just pull it out.

438
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:46,587
Be careful.
It's my head too.

439
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,345
I've got a lock.

440
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:11,846
Up. Let's go.

441
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,745
This is the plan.

442
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,445
Get your ass to Mars...

443
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,921
go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker l.D. at the desk.

444
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,753
That's it.

445
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:28,661
Just do what I say and we can nail
that bastard who fucked you and me.

446
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:30,790
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

447
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,596
Don't let me down.

448
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:02,689
Straight ahead.

449
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,102
In there.

450
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:18,013
There!

451
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:37,164
Give me that.

452
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:43,864
Shit.

453
00:42:45,308 --> 00:42:48,505
Get your ass to Mars--
Get your ass to Mars--

454
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:25,547
Welcome to the Mars
Federal Colony.

455
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:28,550
For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed...

456
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:30,779
to protect you
from the vacuum outside.

457
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:34,448
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

458
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:38,790
Air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.

459
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:39,953
Next.

460
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:44,224
Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.

461
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,733
Passport.

462
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:00,849
- Get out of the way.
- Make way!

463
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,748
Stand back.

464
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,419
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

465
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:14,122
Any news of Quaid?

466
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:17,132
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.

467
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:21,998
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

468
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,266
Look at that shit.

469
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,901
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

470
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:30,172
They think
he's fuckin' George Washington.

471
00:44:30,246 --> 00:44:31,975
Kill the bastard.

472
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,811
Nobody knows who he is.

473
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:37,784
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

474
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:39,786
Two weeks.

475
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:41,715
Excuse me?

476
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,093
Two weeks.

477
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:54,331
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

478
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,871
The rebels took over
the refinery last night.

479
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:58,634
No terbinium is going out.

480
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,676
And it gets worse.

481
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,495
Quaid.

482
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,100
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

483
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,067
The woman!
Get him-- her!

484
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,665
Arrest that woman!

485
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,206
Grab her!

486
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,098
Catch!

487
00:46:04,173 --> 00:46:06,437
Get ready for a surprise!

488
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:19,214
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

489
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:20,646
Open it!

490
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:22,445
They're all connected!

491
00:47:32,428 --> 00:47:35,363
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

492
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:38,764
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth cares about Mars.

493
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:41,769
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

494
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:43,805
Excuse me. What's that?

495
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:46,034
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

496
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:49,669
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

497
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:52,179
Well, that's a rumor,
isn't it?

498
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:53,715
Think so?

499
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:24,702
Mr. Cohaagen.

500
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:33,921
You wanted to see me, sir?

501
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:38,959
Richter...

502
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:42,426
do you know why I'm so happy?

503
00:48:42,498 --> 00:48:43,931
No, sir.

504
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,259
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

505
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:53,434
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

506
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:54,942
Anything.

507
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:58,073
In fact...

508
00:48:58,147 --> 00:49:01,412
my only worry
is that one day...

509
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:03,748
if the rebels win...

510
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,379
it all might end...

511
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:08,047
and you're making it happen!

512
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,960
First you try to kill Quaid,
then he escapes.

513
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:14,291
He had help from our side, sir.

514
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:16,725
I know that.

515
00:49:18,801 --> 00:49:21,133
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

516
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:24,297
I don't give you enough information
to think.

517
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:29,504
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

518
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,978
Yes, sir.

519
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,912
Let's get to business.

520
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:43,990
We've got
a tricky situation here.

521
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,425
Kuato wants
what's in Quaid's head.

522
00:49:47,763 --> 00:49:51,096
He might be able to get it.
They say he's psychic.

523
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:55,436
I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

524
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,808
Suppose you could play along?

525
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,003
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

526
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:05,546
Otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

527
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,795
You need a taxi?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

528
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,304
You need a cab?
Come on!

529
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,364
Can I help you?

530
00:50:57,433 --> 00:50:59,993
I would like a room, please.

531
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:08,042
Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

532
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,509
Definitely.

533
00:51:11,747 --> 00:51:13,840
You've left something in our safe.

534
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:14,848
Could you get it?

535
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:22,748
Identification?

536
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:34,501
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

537
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:54,251
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

538
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,814
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

539
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:10,133
Thank you.

540
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,835
Hey, man, you need a cab?

541
00:52:17,913 --> 00:52:22,373
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

542
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:24,885
- Where's yours?
- Right over there.

543
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:29,986
Hey, asshole!
That's my fare!

544
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:31,424
Eat this!

545
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:32,824
Damn you, Benny!

546
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,626
Welcome to Mars, man!

547
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,435
- What was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels.

548
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,977
Let's get outta here...

549
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,945
before they arrest us!

550
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:54,278
What do the rebels want?

551
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,341
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

552
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,688
So, where to?

553
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:05,522
Last Resort.

554
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:07,619
You're getting off
to an early start.

555
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,794
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

556
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,731
Well, actually, no.

557
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:14,564
Well, sort of.

558
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:18,629
The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

559
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:31,451
Voila. Venusville.

560
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:35,019
Hey, you see anything you like?

561
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:42,393
End of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

562
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:44,398
I'll show you where.

563
00:53:44,466 --> 00:53:48,197
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

564
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:52,036
It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

565
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,041
They got everything.

566
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,546
Not bad, huh?

567
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:03,883
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

568
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,747
I bet I can guess
your birthday.

569
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:09,757
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

570
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:14,759
- Tell me, are all psychics--
- Freaks?

571
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,889
Afraid so.
It goes with the territory.

572
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:22,130
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

573
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:26,197
This is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

574
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:29,438
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

575
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:32,446
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down--

576
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:34,778
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

577
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,751
Hey, man,
I got five kids to feed.

578
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,754
Take them to the dentist.

579
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,313
Thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

580
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:44,757
Take your time.
Benny's the name.

581
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,739
- What do you want?
- Melina.

582
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:08,578
She's busy.

583
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,743
But Mary here, she's free.

584
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:14,255
Well, not free, honey, but...

585
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:16,185
available.

586
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:21,694
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

587
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:22,991
Earth slime.

588
00:55:23,065 --> 00:55:25,761
Thing is, friend,
Mel's real picky.

589
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,995
She sticks to her regulars.

590
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,004
She'll like me.

591
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:32,538
Mel!

592
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:11,509
Hello, Hauser.

593
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:14,549
Still bulging, I see.

594
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:19,249
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

595
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:23,123
I think it's still hungry.

596
00:56:25,494 --> 00:56:28,554
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

597
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,655
Look who's talking.

598
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:33,565
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

599
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:35,967
Relax. You'll live longer.

600
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:37,471
Come on.

601
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:46,741
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

602
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:49,750
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

603
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:06,692
You son of a bitch.

604
00:57:06,768 --> 00:57:09,362
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

605
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:11,303
Well, I guess he didn't.

606
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:15,207
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

607
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:25,116
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

608
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:28,553
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

609
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,426
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

610
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:37,124
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

611
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,326
I don't remember you.

612
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:42,859
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

613
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,374
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

614
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,842
- Hauser left me a note.
- You're Hauser.

615
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:51,845
Not anymore.

616
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:55,041
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

617
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,247
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- No, Cohaagen stole it.

618
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:06,920
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

619
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:08,428
This is too weird.

620
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:11,125
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job--

621
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,134
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

622
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:16,193
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

623
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:18,899
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

624
00:58:18,974 --> 00:58:21,670
- Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

625
00:58:21,743 --> 00:58:25,543
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

626
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:29,949
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

627
00:58:30,018 --> 00:58:32,612
Don't be ridiculous.

628
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:37,453
You never loved me, Hauser.

629
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:39,517
You just used me to get inside.

630
00:58:39,594 --> 00:58:41,528
Inside what?

631
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:47,693
I think you'd better leave.

632
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:51,034
-Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
-I'm not falling for it.

633
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:53,267
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

634
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,275
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

635
00:58:55,343 --> 00:58:57,470
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

636
00:58:57,546 --> 00:58:59,480
People are trying to kill me.

637
00:59:00,348 --> 00:59:02,043
Really?

638
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:06,445
All right, I'm leaving.

639
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:21,402
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

640
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,200
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

641
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:26,672
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

642
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:29,175
Hey, that didn't take long.

643
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:31,838
Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

644
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:34,381
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

645
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:37,043
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

646
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:46,862
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

647
00:59:46,862 --> 00:59:50,593
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

648
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:52,997
throughout the Mars federal colony.

649
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:57,664
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

650
00:59:57,739 --> 00:59:59,934
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
must understand...

651
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:03,444
that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering--

652
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:08,310
Mr. Quaid?

653
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,312
What?

654
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:12,717
I need to talk to you
about Mr. Hauser.

655
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:16,254
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

656
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:18,656
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

657
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:21,594
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

658
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:26,300
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

659
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:31,669
- What do you want?
- This will be hard for you to accept.

660
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,232
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

661
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:40,109
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

662
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,515
You're not here
and neither am l.

663
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:44,847
That's amazing.

664
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,014
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

665
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:50,023
You're strapped into
an implant chair...

666
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:52,992
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

667
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:56,622
Ah, I get it.
I'm dreaming.

668
01:00:56,698 --> 01:01:00,065
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

669
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,568
Not exactly.

670
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:05,766
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes...

671
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,468
but you're inventing it
yourself as you go along.

672
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:13,303
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

673
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:17,317
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

674
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:20,718
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

675
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:23,155
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy...

676
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,285
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

677
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,295
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

678
01:01:29,764 --> 01:01:33,894
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

679
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:36,403
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

680
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:40,999
the suite at the Hilton-- are elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

681
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:43,476
You paid to be a secret agent.

682
01:01:43,545 --> 01:01:46,036
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

683
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:48,674
And what about the girl?

684
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,548
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

685
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,145
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

686
01:01:54,222 --> 01:01:57,851
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

687
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,019
Mr. Quaid.

688
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:04,122
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

689
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,225
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

690
01:02:07,302 --> 01:02:09,770
Would you mind opening the door?

691
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:14,106
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

692
01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:16,006
I'll do it.

693
01:02:22,584 --> 01:02:23,846
Sweetheart?

694
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:28,480
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

695
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:35,630
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here...

696
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:38,359
at Rekall.

697
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:43,798
I love you.

698
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:47,239
Right. That's why
you tried to kill me.

699
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:51,336
No. I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

700
01:02:51,413 --> 01:02:53,745
I want you to come back to me.

701
01:02:55,884 --> 01:02:59,149
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

702
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:03,816
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?

703
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:07,851
Or that you're really
an invincible secret agent from Mars...

704
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:12,161
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think...

705
01:03:12,233 --> 01:03:14,201
he's a lowly construction worker?

706
01:03:21,776 --> 01:03:24,108
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

707
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,148
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

708
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,641
Your whole life is ahead of you.

709
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:35,249
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

710
01:03:37,492 --> 01:03:40,256
Let's assume I do.
Then what?

711
01:03:43,098 --> 01:03:46,192
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

712
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:50,101
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

713
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:52,605
Inside your dream,
you'll fall asleep.

714
01:03:56,544 --> 01:04:00,742
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

715
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:03,511
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

716
01:04:03,585 --> 01:04:06,645
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

717
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:11,215
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

718
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:14,693
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

719
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,027
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

720
01:04:17,098 --> 01:04:19,532
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

721
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:23,059
One minute you'll be the savior of
the rebel cause, and right after that...

722
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:25,299
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

723
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:29,309
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilizations, as you requested...

724
01:04:29,377 --> 01:04:32,107
but in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

725
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:38,107
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

726
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:47,323
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

727
01:04:52,066 --> 01:04:54,261
Swallow it!

728
01:04:56,738 --> 01:04:59,263
Go ahead, sweetheart.

729
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:25,262
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

730
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,611
That's for making me come to Mars.

731
01:05:49,891 --> 01:05:52,826
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

732
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,492
Cuff him.

733
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:06,471
-I got him.
-Bring him down in the service elevator.

734
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,209
Let's go.

735
01:07:23,618 --> 01:07:24,778
Fuck you!

736
01:07:35,663 --> 01:07:36,595
Doug.

737
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:40,592
Honey...

738
01:07:40,668 --> 01:07:43,262
you wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

739
01:07:45,006 --> 01:07:48,305
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

740
01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:50,469
After all, we're married.

741
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,483
Consider that a divorce.

742
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:01,649
That was your wife?

743
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,993
What a bitch.

744
01:08:15,103 --> 01:08:17,196
Hey, get out of the way!

745
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:22,234
I thought you didn't like me.

746
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,245
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be okay.

747
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:28,646
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologize.

748
01:08:28,716 --> 01:08:30,775
Kuato wants to see you.

749
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,953
Come on.

750
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,009
- Now what?
- Jump!

751
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:37,549
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

752
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:44,388
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

753
01:09:56,471 --> 01:09:57,563
Move!

754
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,471
Taxi!

755
01:10:02,477 --> 01:10:04,411
Melina! Melina!

756
01:10:07,515 --> 01:10:09,107
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort.

757
01:10:09,183 --> 01:10:10,707
You guys are going in circles.

758
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:16,746
Jesus!

759
01:10:16,824 --> 01:10:19,054
Come on! You drive!

760
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,253
You guys are in trouble?

761
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:21,920
Go! Go!

762
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,775
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

763
01:10:35,843 --> 01:10:38,107
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

764
01:11:12,113 --> 01:11:13,307
Shit!

765
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:15,212
No brakes!

766
01:11:15,283 --> 01:11:16,910
You idiot!

767
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:21,145
What are you doing?

768
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:36,728
Christ! Now they're after me!

769
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:39,365
Give me that!

770
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,203
Get out of the way!

771
01:11:47,982 --> 01:11:49,244
Tony!

772
01:11:52,954 --> 01:11:55,354
Get out of the way!
Come on!

773
01:11:55,423 --> 01:11:57,914
Come on! Come on!

774
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,662
Thank you, Tony.

775
01:12:27,622 --> 01:12:29,783
You wanna have some fun?

776
01:12:29,857 --> 01:12:31,051
Where are they?

777
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,855
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

778
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:43,698
Maybe you know.

779
01:12:50,544 --> 01:12:52,239
Kill them all!

780
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:07,486
Thumbelina!

781
01:13:32,653 --> 01:13:34,211
Richter!

782
01:13:34,288 --> 01:13:37,485
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

783
01:13:37,558 --> 01:13:40,550
- We've got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

784
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:42,528
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

785
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:46,957
Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.

786
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:48,592
Don't think.

787
01:13:48,669 --> 01:13:51,433
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

788
01:13:51,505 --> 01:13:53,166
Pull 'em out.

789
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,606
Everybody, pull out!

790
01:13:55,676 --> 01:13:57,268
Move!

791
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:09,222
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

792
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:12,785
The first settlers
are buried here.

793
01:15:12,853 --> 01:15:16,812
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

794
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:19,724
He built cheap domes and watched
the kids turn into freaks.

795
01:15:19,794 --> 01:15:21,056
I saw them.

796
01:15:21,128 --> 01:15:23,858
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

797
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:25,523
Maybe you can change all that.

798
01:15:25,599 --> 01:15:29,831
Hey, I think my grandpa
might be here.

799
01:15:29,904 --> 01:15:31,531
So what can I do?

800
01:15:31,605 --> 01:15:34,233
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

801
01:15:34,308 --> 01:15:37,072
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

802
01:15:37,144 --> 01:15:40,136
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

803
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:43,383
Since when?

804
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,192
Freeze!

805
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:56,491
Come on, Melina.

806
01:15:57,832 --> 01:15:59,265
Kuato's waiting.

807
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:01,597
I didn't find Grandpa, but--

808
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:04,370
Oh, shit.

809
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:07,601
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

810
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:11,907
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

811
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,424
You're a mutant, huh?

812
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,824
All right, let's go.

813
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:44,778
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

814
01:16:44,845 --> 01:16:46,779
It won't do any good.

815
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:50,180
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

816
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:53,220
We can't.
We're running out of air.

817
01:16:53,287 --> 01:16:55,312
We need help.

818
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:58,051
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

819
01:16:59,126 --> 01:17:00,889
I hope he was worth it.

820
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:02,622
So do l.

821
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,899
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

822
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:10,232
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

823
01:17:10,304 --> 01:17:12,568
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

824
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,608
He wants you.

825
01:17:14,675 --> 01:17:18,509
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

826
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:20,240
Then we don't have much choice.

827
01:17:20,314 --> 01:17:21,872
We can't turn him in.

828
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:25,542
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

829
01:17:39,733 --> 01:17:41,758
Sit down.

830
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:44,668
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

831
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:47,298
You heard the rumors
about the Pyramid Mine?

832
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:49,205
Yeah.

833
01:17:49,276 --> 01:17:52,643
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

834
01:17:52,713 --> 01:17:54,977
What? Aliens?

835
01:17:56,383 --> 01:17:59,375
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

836
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:02,013
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

837
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:04,717
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole...

838
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,726
you call a brain.

839
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,321
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

840
01:18:11,398 --> 01:18:14,834
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

841
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:18,736
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

842
01:18:57,411 --> 01:18:59,606
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

843
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:02,415
Same as you: to remember.

844
01:19:02,483 --> 01:19:05,213
But why?

845
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:08,585
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

846
01:19:11,992 --> 01:19:14,187
A man is defined by his actions...

847
01:19:15,296 --> 01:19:17,423
not his memory.

848
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:19,894
Please...

849
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,026
take my hands.

850
01:19:27,574 --> 01:19:30,008
Now open your mind to me.

851
01:19:30,944 --> 01:19:32,434
Please.

852
01:19:35,115 --> 01:19:37,777
Open your mind.

853
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,545
Open your mind.

854
01:19:44,658 --> 01:19:48,094
Open your mind.

855
01:19:49,863 --> 01:19:53,560
Open your mind.

856
01:19:55,369 --> 01:19:59,738
Open your mind.

857
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:32,704
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

858
01:20:32,773 --> 01:20:35,401
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

859
01:20:35,476 --> 01:20:37,501
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

860
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:40,274
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

861
01:20:40,347 --> 01:20:43,544
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

862
01:20:43,617 --> 01:20:45,915
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

863
01:20:45,986 --> 01:20:49,183
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

864
01:20:49,256 --> 01:20:51,918
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

865
01:20:51,992 --> 01:20:54,187
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

866
01:20:54,261 --> 01:20:56,593
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

867
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:59,962
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

868
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:01,796
Let's make sure Kuato--

869
01:21:32,299 --> 01:21:36,258
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

870
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:40,165
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

871
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:43,639
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Come on!

872
01:21:48,248 --> 01:21:49,613
They found us!

873
01:21:49,683 --> 01:21:51,207
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

874
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:53,378
Get moving! Get out!

875
01:21:54,621 --> 01:21:55,349
Get out!

876
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:07,358
Everybody out! Get out!

877
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,508
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

878
01:22:17,144 --> 01:22:18,771
Benny, come on!

879
01:22:22,816 --> 01:22:25,444
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

880
01:22:44,571 --> 01:22:48,200
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

881
01:22:51,111 --> 01:22:52,874
Benny, hurry.

882
01:23:00,354 --> 01:23:02,288
Congratulations, Quaid.

883
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:04,654
You led us right to him.

884
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:07,489
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

885
01:23:08,428 --> 01:23:10,362
I got four kids to feed.

886
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,591
So what happened to number five?

887
01:23:15,068 --> 01:23:17,696
Shit, man. You got me.

888
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:19,466
I ain't even married.

889
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,701
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

890
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:29,014
Quaid.

891
01:23:31,118 --> 01:23:33,177
Quaid.

892
01:23:34,855 --> 01:23:39,189
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

893
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,795
Start the reactor.

894
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:45,764
Free Mars.

895
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:53,464
Mr. Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

896
01:24:01,315 --> 01:24:03,715
So this is the great man.

897
01:24:08,655 --> 01:24:10,714
No wonder he kept out of sight.

898
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,894
Well, my boy...

899
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,222
you're a hero.

900
01:24:18,298 --> 01:24:19,390
Fuck you.

901
01:24:19,466 --> 01:24:23,197
Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

902
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:27,604
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

903
01:24:27,674 --> 01:24:29,073
He's lying.

904
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:32,138
You two-faced bastard.

905
01:24:34,014 --> 01:24:37,677
You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

906
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:43,756
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

907
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:46,759
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

908
01:24:46,827 --> 01:24:50,923
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

909
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:54,161
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

910
01:24:57,971 --> 01:24:59,939
That's what we wanted
you to think.

911
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:04,137
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

912
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:07,203
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

913
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,804
Get your story straight.

914
01:25:08,882 --> 01:25:12,409
This idiot has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.

915
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:14,750
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

916
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:18,757
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

917
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:21,760
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

918
01:25:21,828 --> 01:25:23,762
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

919
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:27,391
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money...

920
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:31,426
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

921
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:33,996
Sorry. Too perfect.

922
01:25:34,074 --> 01:25:35,735
Perfect, my ass!

923
01:25:35,809 --> 01:25:38,437
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

924
01:25:38,512 --> 01:25:42,608
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

925
01:25:42,683 --> 01:25:45,481
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

926
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:48,120
Well, Cohaagen...

927
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:51,851
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

928
01:25:53,026 --> 01:25:56,325
Well, don't take my word for it.

929
01:25:57,497 --> 01:26:00,591
-Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
-Who is it this time?

930
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:02,658
My mother?

931
01:26:04,705 --> 01:26:06,138
Howdy, Quaid.

932
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:09,698
If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead...

933
01:26:09,776 --> 01:26:12,142
and you have led us to him.

934
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:14,203
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

935
01:26:14,281 --> 01:26:16,442
Sorry for the shit
I've put you through, but hey...

936
01:26:16,516 --> 01:26:19,041
what are friends for?

937
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,418
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

938
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:25,481
but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

939
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:29,723
You see, it's my body you've got there
and I want it back.

940
01:26:29,796 --> 01:26:34,062
Sorry to be an lndian giver,
but I was here first.

941
01:26:34,134 --> 01:26:36,728
So adios, amigo.

942
01:26:36,803 --> 01:26:40,034
And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.

943
01:26:40,107 --> 01:26:42,735
Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.

944
01:26:46,346 --> 01:26:48,280
You never know.

945
01:26:53,019 --> 01:26:55,112
You bastards!

946
01:27:13,273 --> 01:27:14,740
Let go of me!

947
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,952
- Ready?
- Auto.

948
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:35,961
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

949
01:27:37,931 --> 01:27:40,195
Relax, Quaid.

950
01:27:40,267 --> 01:27:43,634
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

951
01:27:43,703 --> 01:27:46,968
That's not true.
He's one of my best friends.

952
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,975
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

953
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:54,036
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

954
01:27:54,114 --> 01:27:57,242
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

955
01:27:57,317 --> 01:27:59,512
I'll bust his balls.

956
01:28:01,655 --> 01:28:03,953
Uh-uh, princess.

957
01:28:04,024 --> 01:28:06,424
We're having you fixed.

958
01:28:06,493 --> 01:28:09,860
You're going to be respectful,
compliant...

959
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:13,457
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

960
01:28:17,204 --> 01:28:19,297
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

961
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,703
Yes? What is it?

962
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:26,610
The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

963
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,875
What do you want me
to do about it?

964
01:28:28,949 --> 01:28:33,010
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

965
01:28:33,086 --> 01:28:34,178
Fuck 'em.

966
01:28:34,254 --> 01:28:36,814
It'll be a good lesson
to the others.

967
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:39,586
You got what you want.
Give these people air.

968
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:43,425
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

969
01:28:43,496 --> 01:28:44,758
Fire it up, Doc.

970
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:46,958
Excuse me, Doctor.

971
01:28:47,033 --> 01:28:49,194
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

972
01:28:50,103 --> 01:28:51,365
Oh, really?

973
01:29:01,848 --> 01:29:03,475
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

974
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,280
Why don't you and Melina drop by.
Remind him, Doc.

975
01:29:06,353 --> 01:29:08,719
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

976
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:25,761
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

977
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:41,384
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

978
01:29:45,558 --> 01:29:46,991
Hey, don't!

979
01:29:53,967 --> 01:29:55,662
Melina, hold on!

980
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:21,891
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

981
01:30:21,962 --> 01:30:25,363
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

982
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:29,634
Let's get the hell out of here.

983
01:30:57,163 --> 01:30:59,461
You have to make a decision, sir.

984
01:31:09,943 --> 01:31:11,205
Kill him.

985
01:31:12,412 --> 01:31:14,437
It's about goddamn time.

986
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:09,463
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

987
01:32:09,536 --> 01:32:13,302
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

988
01:32:13,373 --> 01:32:17,332
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

989
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:20,607
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

990
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,272
Where's this reactor come from?

991
01:32:22,348 --> 01:32:24,407
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

992
01:32:24,484 --> 01:32:27,817
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

993
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,652
What the hell--

994
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:57,081
Quaid!

995
01:32:57,150 --> 01:33:00,278
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

996
01:33:00,353 --> 01:33:02,685
Benny! Benny's the name!

997
01:33:16,836 --> 01:33:18,326
Oh, that's good!

998
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:26,408
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!

999
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:28,447
I'm gonna grind you up!

1000
01:33:35,455 --> 01:33:37,480
I'm coming!

1001
01:33:37,557 --> 01:33:39,218
I'm coming for you, baby!

1002
01:33:54,707 --> 01:33:56,971
What the fuck is this?

1003
01:34:03,516 --> 01:34:05,643
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

1004
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:10,751
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

1005
01:34:11,724 --> 01:34:13,658
Benny, here!

1006
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,421
Where the fuck are you?

1007
01:34:24,103 --> 01:34:25,866
Screw you!

1008
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:34,004
Quaid, get over here!

1009
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,848
What is it?

1010
01:34:36,783 --> 01:34:37,875
There's an opening.

1011
01:34:39,018 --> 01:34:40,679
I knew it.

1012
01:35:09,415 --> 01:35:12,714
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1013
01:35:12,785 --> 01:35:16,186
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

1014
01:35:16,256 --> 01:35:17,518
Of course not.

1015
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:20,559
If Mars had an atmosphere,
he'd lose control.

1016
01:35:21,694 --> 01:35:23,127
See down there?

1017
01:35:24,264 --> 01:35:26,698
It's a glacier.

1018
01:35:26,766 --> 01:35:29,860
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1019
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:32,336
The reactor melts it...

1020
01:35:32,405 --> 01:35:34,270
and it releases the oxygen.

1021
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,705
Come on.

1022
01:35:35,775 --> 01:35:38,767
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1023
01:35:38,845 --> 01:35:41,780
Enough for the whole planet.

1024
01:35:41,848 --> 01:35:44,112
If we turn it on in time.

1025
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:52,691
Come on. Come on!

1026
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:10,968
Hold on.

1027
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,140
Now!

1028
01:37:13,706 --> 01:37:14,900
Son of a bitch.

1029
01:37:22,615 --> 01:37:23,274
Go!

1030
01:37:27,053 --> 01:37:29,214
He's got a hologram!

1031
01:37:51,077 --> 01:37:53,739
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

1032
01:39:13,593 --> 01:39:15,720
You're coming with me!

1033
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:31,472
See you at the party, Richter.

1034
01:40:09,682 --> 01:40:10,944
Don't touch that!

1035
01:40:11,017 --> 01:40:12,985
Get away! Get back!

1036
01:40:13,052 --> 01:40:14,485
What are you afraid of?

1037
01:40:14,554 --> 01:40:16,954
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1038
01:40:17,023 --> 01:40:20,186
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1039
01:40:20,259 --> 01:40:22,557
Mars will go into
global meltdown.

1040
01:40:22,628 --> 01:40:25,290
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

1041
01:40:25,364 --> 01:40:27,457
And you expect me
to believe you?

1042
01:40:27,533 --> 01:40:32,095
Who gives a shit what you believe?
ln 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1043
01:40:32,171 --> 01:40:35,572
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

1044
01:40:39,145 --> 01:40:41,079
I didn't want it to end this way.

1045
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:43,206
I wanted Hauser back.
But no.

1046
01:40:44,383 --> 01:40:46,647
You had to be Quaid!

1047
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,153
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1048
01:40:49,221 --> 01:40:52,349
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1049
01:40:52,425 --> 01:40:56,418
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1050
01:42:11,203 --> 01:42:13,569
Melina, hold on!

1051
01:42:13,639 --> 01:42:15,266
Don't do it!

1052
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:17,309
We'll all die!

1053
01:42:18,144 --> 01:42:20,635
Everybody will die!

1054
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:25,233
Quaid!

1055
01:48:40,325 --> 01:48:42,759
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1056
01:48:44,029 --> 01:48:45,690
What's wrong?

1057
01:48:45,764 --> 01:48:49,530
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1058
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:54,130
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.

1059
01:52:44,002 --> 01:52:47,938
