1
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,984
Next, we have the greatest

2
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,425
karate competition
in the State of California.

3
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:07,810
The competitors
are Bruce Lee from Seattle,

4
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:10,593
and the three-times champion
Hoffman,

5
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:13,864
a ninth Dan holder.

6
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,279
Ah, first time in the competition,
and you won't be winning.

7
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:33,331
Sorry.

8
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:34,720
No.

9
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,362
My goal is to win.

10
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,485
But that's too hard for you.

11
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:40,953
It's no fun if it's not hard.

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,571
Begin.

13
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,256
Good!

14
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:14,518
Bruce, come on!

15
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,901
Continue on.

16
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,834
Keep on. Keep on.

17
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,416
Hoffman, get up!

18
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,242
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:42,558
the champion in this competition
is Mr. Bruce Lee!

20
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,915
There he is!

21
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,533
Mr. Lee, is this your first time
in this kind of competition?

22
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,099
Oh, sir.
- Thanks.

23
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,832
Never participated before.

24
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,573
Tell us, then,

25
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:11,491
how did you beat
the third consecutive champion

26
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,750
who holds a ninth Dan position,
Mr. Hoffman?

27
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,490
Do you think it's luck?

28
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,633
Nothing to do with luck.
Right here. It's a strength.

29
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,730
One more question.
What level are you in karate?

30
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,940
Don't want to disappoint you,

31
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,553
but that wasn't karate
I used back there just now.

32
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,031
What you saw me do back there
to that Hoffman was kung fu.

33
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,396
Kung fu? What is kung fu?

34
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,286
It's Chinese kung fu.

35
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:40,246
Maybe you can't find it
in your dictionary,

36
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:43,027
but, today, I, Bruce Lee,

37
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,776
will add it to your dictionary.

38
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:31,518
Here he is, Bruce Lee.

39
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,452
Hey, Bruce, congratulations.
- Bruce.

40
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,921
Linda.

41
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,317
Tell me you didn't get hurt.

42
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh, no. Not even a single scratch.

43
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,349
Great.

44
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,496
He must be the man
you've been telling me about.

45
00:06:57,603 --> 00:07:00,559
Linda, let me introduce you
to Master James.

46
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,470
He's my first kung fu master.

47
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,527
Much like a father to me.

48
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,484
Bruce has often
mentioned you to me.

49
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,098
You should give him
more good ideas in the future.

50
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:13,920
You should take some credit
for Bruce's success today.

51
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,105
Thank you. But only if he can afford
to pay me a decent salary.

52
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:21,653
I've already decided
that I'll pay you with my whole life.

53
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:39,895
James, let's begin.

54
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:41,557
Okay.

55
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,965
I love kung fu so very much.

56
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,296
I've been searching
for a Chinese kung fu school

57
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,213
to study, and I've finally found one.

58
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,474
It's great.

59
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,776
Okay. This way, please.

60
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,317
Hi. May I have your name?
- Hello. Jim.

61
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,276
Good.
- Thank you.

62
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:11,817
Yeah. You can go in.

63
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,171
That Bruce Lee...
he must be out of his mind.

64
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,260
For so many years,

65
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:22,046
we Chinese set up
the kung fu schools in the US.

66
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,982
We abide by the rule
"never teach the outsiders."

67
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:29,394
Many years have passed,
and no one dared break this rule.

68
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:32,461
But this Bruce Lee
went and recruited students

69
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,690
using his title of karate champion.

70
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,788
In his school, most of the students

71
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:41,681
are either Caucasian or black
and Filipino and Japanese.

72
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:45,829
That's exactly why I'll help Master Wang,
whom we respect,

73
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:49,829
and stop Bruce Lee
in the name of Chinese kung fu.

74
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,646
Otherwise, our longstanding rule

75
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,246
of never teaching outsiders
will be destroyed by him.

76
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:02,635
The only way to stop him
is to win by fighting.

77
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,661
What?

78
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,354
What are you saying?
You know Bruce Lee?

79
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,883
Not only do I know him,

80
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,625
he and I have unfinished business.

81
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,723
Tø be honest,
the only reason I came here

82
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,367
was for Bruce Lee.

83
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:26,942
Look, Yellow.

84
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,312
He's beaten the karate
champion of California.

85
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:33,025
He must be extremely good.

86
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:37,377
You better be very confident
to beat him.

87
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,843
Don't worry, Master.

88
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,966
I've been working very hard in Taiwan

89
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,946
with only one thing in mind...

90
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:48,038
me kicking his ass.

91
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,126
He only uses Yong Chun Quan,

92
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,675
and all my techniques
are ready to beat his moves.

93
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:56,775
Now I'm worried.

94
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:59,244
He's afraid to face me.

95
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:02,967
What happens when you win?

96
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,811
I will follow the tradition.

97
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,549
Make him announce it.

98
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:10,593
Bruce Lee tells everyone
he lost to Wing Chun style.

99
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:17,242
The school will shut down.

100
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:25,207
Shifu, what are you thinking?

101
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,306
Nothing.

102
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:29,702
I want to remind you, on this matter,

103
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,176
you can't do it on your own.

104
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:37,780
If you pick a fight with him,
let me arrange it for you.

105
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,498
We'll do it aboveboard.

106
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,980
Good.

107
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:45,510
Two.

108
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,239
Good. Three.

109
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,445
Good. Let's do it together.

110
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,180
One, two, three!

111
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,223
Good. One, two, three!

112
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,482
One, two, three!

113
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,993
This way, sir.

114
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,726
It's my honor to see you here, Mr. Lee.

115
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,496
It's my honor, Master Wang.

116
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,556
Please, Bruce.

117
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,883
Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

118
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:26,127
Bruce, I feel so happy
that you knocked out Hoffman.

119
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:28,569
You made our Chinese
proud of ourselves.

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,528
Have a seat.
We are so proud of you.

121
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,107
A brilliant young man.

122
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:38,001
Bruce, I was invited to come here

123
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,997
to help our friends
and manage the business

124
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:44,027
of the Chinese Kung Fu Association.

125
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:52,481
I'd like for you to verify
the contents in these letters are true.

126
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:58,017
The main thing is, your school in Seattle

127
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,243
is a Chinese kung fu school,

128
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,341
which is very important.

129
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,711
Absolutely. It is indeed true.

130
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,816
However, I must say,

131
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:11,628
the students you have
are not all Chinese.

132
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:15,327
You're saying the international
students enrolled?

133
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:19,598
Yes. I've heard you've indeed
accepted many of them.

134
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:21,660
Tø be honest,

135
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,298
in my kung fu school,

136
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:26,252
80% of the students
are foreigners.

137
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,381
This is going to be a problem.

138
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,678
Listen to me, Bruce, many Chinese

139
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,986
have opened kung fu schools
to teach in America,

140
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,127
but none of them has done like you.

141
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,931
For a long time,

142
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:42,714
everyone here has been following
this unofficial rule

143
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,427
of teaching only Chinese students.

144
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:48,500
I invited you here for a talk today.

145
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:54,280
I hope you can correct your mistake
by expelling all the outsiders

146
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,534
to avoid complaints from others.

147
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,966
Master, these rules
don't help us develop Chinese kung fu.

148
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:08,653
If we want our kung fu to move forward,
we have to abandon these old rules.

149
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,687
Mr. Bruce Lee,
haven't you ever thought

150
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,623
about the consequences
of teaching students from other countries?

151
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,417
Isn't karate from Japan?

152
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,600
The Japanese brought it to America
and made it available to all.

153
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,996
You can see karate clubs everywhere.

154
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,096
There are national, even international

155
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,984
karate competitions in America.

156
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:37,894
If the Japanese had never done this,

157
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,437
would karate even
be popular in America?

158
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:44,261
All right, Mr. Lee. I get it.

159
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,178
Mr. Lee, I was trying to be nice,
but let's forget that.

160
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:57,706
Master Wang, it looks like we're...
having a Hongmen Banquet today.

161
00:13:57,812 --> 00:14:01,361
Well, then, on behalf of the association,

162
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:06,297
I advise you to obey all the rules
and behave yourself.

163
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,896
Higher. Higher.

164
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,906
Your hands, higher. Higher.

165
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,717
Master, look.

166
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:39,965
Hello, sir. You must be sent
by Master Wang.

167
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:41,533
Yes.

168
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,453
On behalf of Chinese
Kung Fu Association,

169
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,059
here is an invitation of challenge.

170
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,781
A challenge?

171
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes.

172
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,882
Now, what if I accept
the challenge I've been given?

173
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,424
And what if I don't? Then what?

174
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:03,604
If you accept,
there will be a winner or loser.

175
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,763
If you are the loser,
you will have to accept

176
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,981
all requirements from the association.

177
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,731
You have to do whatever they say.

178
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:14,074
You have two choices
from which to pick.

179
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,657
Either stop teaching the outsiders,

180
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:19,304
or shut down your kung fu school.

181
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,710
Okay, I'll accept your challenge.

182
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:34,580
Bruce Lee!

183
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,771
Yellow Skin. Is that you?

184
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,284
You didn't expect me?

185
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,096
It's unexpected indeed.

186
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,200
Bruce Lee,

187
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:07,794
doesn't matter you've defeated
Americans or Japanese.

188
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:11,724
But today, you will lose to me.

189
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,306
You are just a ghost.

190
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:19,208
Right. I am a ghost.

191
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:25,056
Wherever you go,
I will never leave you.

192
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:30,558
In fact, I think we came up
with a winner years ago.

193
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:36,132
Tøday, we are just going to fight,

194
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,814
have a competition
in front of everyone.

195
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,902
This way,

196
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:42,991
let everyone watch,

197
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:47,857
let them see how you will fall
right in front of me,

198
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,668
and that's that.

199
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,865
You're done.

200
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:17,517
So, then, let's fight!

201
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:45,993
Stop!

202
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:50,614
That's it!
- I'm not done yet.

203
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,803
I haven't lost yet.
- I said stop!

204
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,616
I did win, didn't I?

205
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:57,577
From now, I can teach whomever I like

206
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,536
and do whatever I want
with my kung fu school.

207
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,489
This is great.
- It's great.

208
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,506
Let's go.

209
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,769
Oh, Bruce!

210
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,470
Bruce!

211
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,226
Careful. Careful.

212
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:04,448
Bruce...

213
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,993
I can't fall.

214
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,530
I must stand up.

215
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,620
What did the doctor say?

216
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,456
We're still waiting for the result.

217
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:40,969
I will tell you as soon as we get it.

218
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:46,122
Jesse, let's go ask the doctor what's up.

219
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,663
All right.
- Okay. Let's go.

220
00:23:58,835 --> 00:23:59,986
Linda?

221
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,746
Yeah?

222
00:24:03,462 --> 00:24:05,479
Do I look very ugly?

223
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,948
No.

224
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:10,490
What did the doctor say?

225
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:13,898
He said you would be fine.

226
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,669
Linda?
- Yes?

227
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,566
Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.

228
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:26,566
Just from their look,

229
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,677
I could see my injury
must be severe.

230
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,364
Bruce, please don't think so much.

231
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,796
You'll recover and be fine.

232
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:41,296
Fortunately, we still have our baby.

233
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:43,733
Bruce, don't talk so much.

234
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:47,072
Control your emotions.
He will be fine.

235
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:54,186
If our little son Brandon
saw his father like this,

236
00:24:55,644 --> 00:25:01,176
I think our little Brandon
would feel very sad.

237
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,610
He won't be sad, Bruce.

238
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:05,074
Proud.

239
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,599
Doctor, please don't comfort me.

240
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:17,987
I need to know his real condition.

241
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,723
Please sit down, Mrs. Lee.

242
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,499
I don't want to waste your time.

243
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,523
Your husband's injury
is much worse.

244
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,615
Tell me if he's paralyzed forever.

245
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:27,704
Your husband's backbone
is severely injured.

246
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,994
I would even say shifted.
- What?

247
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,125
I don't care about the backbone.

248
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,830
I need the final result.

249
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,831
He will never stand up, will he?

250
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:46,537
Well, we can hardly find
any fat in his whole body,

251
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,625
only incredible muscles.

252
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:53,385
If he's mentally strong,
he may live in a wheelchair.

253
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,658
Wheelchair?

254
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,153
Spend his life in a wheelchair?

255
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:05,715
Like I said, Linda,
I can't even say if he can stand up,

256
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:07,806
not to mention continuing his karate

257
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,025
which I'm sure his body won't allow.

258
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,024
No. It's Chinese kung fu.

259
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,318
Okay. Chinese kung fu.

260
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,584
Is he ever gonna be able to walk?

261
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,952
Only if there's a miracle.

262
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:46,268
What is it, Linda?

263
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,007
Did the doctor tell you

264
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,582
when I can get rid of this
stupid, horrible equipment?

265
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,238
The American top doctor praised
your muscle a great deal.

266
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:59,423
And what else did they say?

267
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:05,070
The doctor said there's hardly any fat
in your body to be found.

268
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:07,539
He can't believe how strong you are.

269
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,188
Yes, you're injured,

270
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:15,054
but with your body's condition
and strong willpower,

271
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,910
it just might be a miracle.

272
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:19,376
A miracle?

273
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:24,843
Linda, don't beat around the bush.

274
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:30,301
Please tell me the truth.

275
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:33,539
You better tell me the truth now!

276
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,279
Bruce...

277
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:36,639
Tell me!

278
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:44,024
Bruce, listen to me.

279
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,167
Linda, I can handle it.

280
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,292
Just tell me the truth.

281
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:54,818
You should.

282
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,569
You should tell me the truth...

283
00:27:58,683 --> 00:28:01,282
that I'll never stand up.

284
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:03,095
Right?

285
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,762
Bruce...

286
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,763
You tell me now.

287
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:11,172
Bruce, I... I...

288
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:14,026
Is it true or not?

289
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:25,658
Don't you ever,
ever come see me again.

290
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,819
Get out!

291
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,287
You get out of here!

292
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:57,897
<i>The next couple is Bruce Lee
and Kim Jaman.</i>

293
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:02,132
<i>Please give them a big round of applause.</i>

294
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,970
He was great.
- Notice he really mastered the steps.

295
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:08,170
<i>The champion of the Hong Kong
Cha-Cha Competition</i>

296
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:13,046
<i>is the couple of Bruce Lee
and Kim Jaman.</i>

297
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:20,498
Bruce Lee, you felt good today,
didn't you?

298
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,663
So what? You want to fight?

299
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,960
Right. I'll make
an Asian man kiss my ass.

300
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,420
Don't be rude.

301
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,680
Get him!

302
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:45,046
Come on. Let's go.

303
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:47,893
Let's get a couple of pies tonight.

304
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,642
You dirty Asian.

305
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,768
Blair, you just wait.

306
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,256
You dirty Asian.

307
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:35,768
James.

308
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:40,461
Why'd you get up so early?

309
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:43,205
You have to go back to the U.S. Soon.

310
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,670
I just want to learn more moves from you
while you're in Hong Kong.

311
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,026
So what do you think
about that, James?

312
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:52,232
Okay. Go practice standing method.

313
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:53,691
All right.

314
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:06,220
You have to practice every morning.

315
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:09,809
Don't even miss one day.

316
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,543
I know that,

317
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:14,364
but I want to learn
something more practical.

318
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:18,228
You're too anxious. Relax.

319
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:22,792
Anxiety is a big mistake
when practicing kung fu.

320
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,848
I am anxious.

321
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:29,513
Bruce, if you really want to
master this technique for yourself,

322
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:34,107
it's not one or two days
or not even one or two years.

323
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:39,189
Besides, to have
a real perception of kung fu,

324
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:43,048
you need to have
a superb perseverance.

325
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,310
If you don't have that,

326
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,715
then you'll have nothing
when you get old.

327
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:50,117
Do you understand me?

328
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:10,132
Take it.

329
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:11,870
What's up?

330
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:14,241
What, are you waiting
for revenge or something?

331
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:16,537
Or are you waiting for my fists?

332
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,704
But I should warn you,
these are well-trained fists.

333
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:20,792
I've come to teach you a lesson today.

334
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,595
A lesson.

335
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,675
Then let's find a place.

336
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,407
Right here.
- Oh, really?

337
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,599
If you kick my ass,
I'll fix my bike myself.

338
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:32,340
Got it?

339
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:34,638
Are you out of your mind?

340
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:38,468
Okay. It looks like you need
another lesson from me.

341
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:41,217
Come on.

342
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:43,314
I'll let teachers and students see

343
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,304
how a whitey like you falls in front of me.

344
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,541
Get him! Come on!
- Get him!

345
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:57,057
Honey!

346
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,535
Bruce!

347
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,629
Do you see that? I'll beat him

348
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,548
down on the dirty ground
and let you guys step over him.

349
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:11,403
Come on!

350
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:24,627
Bruce...

351
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:26,795
There goes your children's future.

352
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:36,715
You embarrass this family!
- No. Stop. Stop. Bruce...

353
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,919
Bruce, just apologize
to your father. Hurry up.

354
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,006
Dad, why don't you listen
before you punish me?

355
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,572
No...
- There's no need.

356
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,175
I've known everything.

357
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,357
I told you not to fight, for God's sake,

358
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,801
and I swear to God,
I'll punish you if you do.

359
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,536
You heard me.

360
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,764
But I didn't promise you
I wouldn't fight today.

361
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,063
You bastard!
- Stop! Please stop!

362
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:59,132
Just run away, Bruce, please. Just stop it.
- All you know is fight.

363
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,222
Stop it! Enough! Please just go!
- Come here!

364
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:04,035
All you know is fight!
- Stop!

365
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:06,855
Stop, please!
- You're spoiled!

366
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:09,116
Dad, what's with you?
- Enough!

367
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,902
You can't hit Mom.
You can't ever do that to her.

368
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,093
It's okay, Bruce honey. It's fine.

369
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:17,889
Even if you beat me to death,
I won't run away,

370
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:19,772
even if I really want to.

371
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:21,961
You feel like it?

372
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:24,403
You dare talk back to me
after making such trouble?

373
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,068
Stop it!
- Bruce!

374
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:28,652
Stop beating him.
- I'm telling you...

375
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,742
I am telling you...
- Help us. Stop beating him.

376
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:32,474
- Okay. Dad,
- Please.

377
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,183
I swear to you I won't fight again.

378
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:43,342
But how can I fight back
if someone insults me?

379
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,548
I mean, look, son,
today you were at the school

380
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,015
where you picked a fight
with your own classmate Blair.

381
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,460
But he insulted me yesterday
on Udang Street.

382
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:57,224
Do you understand
what that feels like?

383
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,782
He also broke my sister's bike.

384
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:04,404
He did it on purpose,
and I didn't even pick the fight.

385
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:06,137
The bike is broken.

386
00:36:06,252 --> 00:36:07,711
Dad can fix it.

387
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:09,314
Can you make no more trouble?

388
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:11,888
You must've offended him,
you see?

389
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:14,180
I didn't!

390
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,477
I didn't do anything wrong.

391
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,297
He's jealous 'cause I'm
the champion of cha-cha.

392
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,524
He's British,

393
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,549
and I'm Chinese!

394
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,257
I don't deserve to win the title?

395
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:32,669
Son, I'm sorry.

396
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:37,682
We are all Chinese.

397
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,939
We are a nation of etiquette.

398
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:44,125
Can you not learn to hold back
or be tolerant?

399
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:49,584
Dad, he called me a dirty Asian, Dad!

400
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:53,483
The son of a dirty Asian!

401
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:41,038
Why are you fighting
with your clothes?

402
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,749
What's with you?

403
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,697
What do you want?

404
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:04,675
Hey, Bruce, we better go.

405
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,765
Better to fight with a pro.

406
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:17,421
You are the one I want to fight.

407
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:19,081
You want to fight?

408
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,981
Hey, come on.

409
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,029
Stop there.

410
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:15,590
What was that?

411
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,140
Kung fu.

412
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,846
Go and learn some kung fu.

413
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,964
Kung fu?

414
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,336
Kung fu?

415
00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:00,872
Hoi-chuen, I'd like to tell you

416
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:05,508
that it seems like your son Bruce

417
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:08,534
has made up his mind
to learn kung fu.

418
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:10,483
Is that right?

419
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:15,321
Hoi-chuen, when you didn't
allow him to learn kung fu,

420
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:16,963
I totally agreed.

421
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:20,855
Indeed, it's hard
for kung fu artists to live.

422
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,498
Why bother to learn?

423
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:24,229
But I had a chat with him tonight.

424
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:28,345
And your son Bruce, you know,

425
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:31,715
the only thing
he thinks about day and night

426
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,677
is learning kung fu.

427
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:36,556
I'm afraid this time,

428
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,436
neither you nor I can sway him.

429
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,063
You know, the saying goes,

430
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:45,919
a father knows his son.

431
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,571
Let me ask you.
Do you really know him?

432
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:51,312
He's my son.
How can I not know him?

433
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:53,125
That's bull crap!

434
00:40:56,301 --> 00:40:58,591
Tø be frank, Bruce is smart.

435
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,730
When he dedicates himself to something,
he does it completely.

436
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:04,578
When he studies it,
he learns it faster than anyone else.

437
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:07,575
That's right. For example, cha-cha.

438
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:10,497
Do you know why
he wanted to learn cha-cha?

439
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:13,006
Hoi-chuen, you don't get it.

440
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:14,574
I'll tell you why and what.

441
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,830
Because all those
foreign classmates

442
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:18,404
were looking down on him,

443
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,085
so he wanted to prove
that he could do it, too.

444
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,765
Yes, but my Bruce...

445
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:26,578
he never committed
to one thing whatsoever.

446
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:29,230
You see, he won
the champion of cha-cha.

447
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:30,618
Right?
- Exactly.

448
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,355
But now he doesn't want to continue.

449
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,345
This is what
you don't understand about him.

450
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:39,219
I think from now on,

451
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:44,231
we should get
a real kung fu master.

452
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,774
Someone to train him.

453
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:50,143
James,

454
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,496
if Bruce really wants
to learn kung fu,

455
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:58,920
then you'll be the best for him.

456
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,250
Why bother to get a master?

457
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:04,877
Tø tell you the truth, Hoi-chuen,

458
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:07,346
if Bruce is really up for kung fu,

459
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,604
then I can't teach him.

460
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:13,469
I'm not among the top masters
in Hong Kong.

461
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:16,288
I'd like to introduce him right away

462
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:20,295
to the head of Yong Chun
Boxing Academy, Master Ye.

463
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:42,609
It's 1:30 a.m. Already.

464
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,702
What the hell's going on here?

465
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,725
It's way too late for this.

466
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,887
What's wrong with him?

467
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:02,697
Let's go.

468
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:37,194
Hey, who are...

469
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:39,701
Hey, who are you?

470
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:41,200
What do you want?
- What the hell?

471
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:49,935
Hello, Master Wang.

472
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,361
What do you want?

473
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:55,638
I would like to practice
with Yellow Skin.

474
00:43:57,982 --> 00:44:00,035
Come practice with him.

475
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,449
Yeah! Nice!
- That was great!

476
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,708
Good job!
- You got him!

477
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,212
Very good! Yes!

478
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,790
Dad.

479
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:35,691
Bruce, get your clothes and come.

480
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:37,499
I'll take you to see someone.

481
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,335
Come on. Follow me.

482
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:58,001
Dad, please.

483
00:45:58,116 --> 00:46:00,443
Follow me. Quickly.

484
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:06,818
Faster.

485
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:12,208
Stay with me. Quickly.

486
00:46:48,036 --> 00:46:51,027
Dad, what is this all about?

487
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,709
Bruce, you didn't give up.

488
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:55,440
Good for you.

489
00:47:02,414 --> 00:47:05,155
Master Ye, I brought my son to you.

490
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,178
Based on your instruction,

491
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:10,587
I let him run over here
from Kingburg Park.

492
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:13,060
And my son... he made it.

493
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,630
Well, that's good.

494
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:18,213
Not so many people
can run such a distance in one go.

495
00:47:18,322 --> 00:47:22,286
He's passed the first test
for acceptance?

496
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:27,196
All right. Come on back.

497
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:45,015
Yong Chun Quan,

498
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:48,319
created by Master Wu Mei
from Fujian.

499
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:50,582
The key thing is
it's simple and practical.

500
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:54,340
They're practicing an entree routine
called "small idea."

501
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:58,283
All right.

502
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,565
You guys spread out.

503
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:01,897
Small combat. Three groups.

504
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:04,959
Yong Chun Quan

505
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:07,543
requires coordination
of hands and feet,

506
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,632
including three-side fist...

507
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:11,721
...breakthrough fist.

508
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,785
The steps include clam step,

509
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:17,846
tripod step, chasing step,

510
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:20,660
and also one leg standing.

511
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:22,304
And another thing is,

512
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,629
what you see is striking fists.

513
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:27,970
That means you launch attack
while defending.

514
00:48:29,267 --> 00:48:31,736
What he's doing is chasing step,

515
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:34,871
which requires speed and ferocity.

516
00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:39,494
This is grab and strike,
used when you are close.

517
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:42,146
Yong Chun Quan is integrated

518
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,516
with Nanquan and close-fighting fists.

519
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:47,540
It stresses actual combat.

520
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:50,639
Shun Leung, come.

521
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:53,073
Show Bruce the inch punch.
Over here.

522
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,678
Get a board.

523
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,859
Inch punch means one burst

524
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:03,413
at all the strength to beat
his rival within an inch.

525
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:05,504
Within an inch?

526
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,008
That's right.

527
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:10,515
Other kung fu boxings...

528
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:12,878
the strength's from waist and arms,

529
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,901
while Yong Chun Quan...

530
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,681
the strength's from
the stroke of your whole body.

531
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:19,741
Therefore, you can strike a deadly blow

532
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:21,130
within an inch.

533
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,391
Come show him.

534
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:25,866
Take it.

535
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,217
Morning, Master.

536
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:38,066
So, did you actually
run here just now?

537
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:40,287
Yes. Based on your instructions.

538
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:41,957
10 kilometers a day...

539
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:44,257
5 coming here and 5 back home.

540
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:46,174
Good. You must keep it going.

541
00:50:46,286 --> 00:50:48,363
Master, what are you
gonna teach me today?

542
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,245
You see the corner of the wall?

543
00:50:54,362 --> 00:50:56,866
Go there and practice horse squatting.

544
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,633
Horse squatting?

545
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:01,038
Master, I want to learn actual combat.

546
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,203
Horse squatting I can do at home.

547
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:05,254
Shut up.

548
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:07,416
Go horse squatting now.

549
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,214
Yes, Master.

550
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:12,051
Morning, Master.
- Morning.

551
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:17,273
Master, do you mind if I practice
with my brothers today?

552
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,784
I've been horse squatting
for a week now.

553
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,245
Shun Leung, go work
on strengthening his wrists.

554
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,613
Let's go.

555
00:52:41,755 --> 00:52:43,701
Let's go, Bruce.

556
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,863
Bruce, can you lift it up?

557
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,678
Yeah. Of course I can.

558
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,072
Like this?

559
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:57,102
No, not like that.

560
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:59,466
Grab it from one end

561
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,597
and lift evenly

562
00:53:01,702 --> 00:53:03,577
while horse squatting.

563
00:53:08,107 --> 00:53:10,089
Let me do it.

564
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,787
You see? I can lift it evenly.

565
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:19,279
Can you hold it still for an hour?

566
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:23,801
Brother, can I please skip practice
on this useless nonsense?

567
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:25,537
It's ridiculous.

568
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:27,800
I don't want to spend
my vacation this way.

569
00:53:27,915 --> 00:53:31,701
You'll achieve nothing
without basic practice.

570
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:34,413
Just do what Master asks you to do.

571
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,129
Master, Bruce is still practicing.

572
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:56,076
Bruce, it's almost done.

573
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:58,960
Take a break now.
- Leave me alone.

574
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,570
It seems you think
I didn't keep my words,

575
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,677
didn't you?

576
00:54:08,784 --> 00:54:12,012
But do you know why
I keep asking you to squat?

577
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:16,295
I guess you still don't
understand the essence of kung fu.

578
00:54:16,408 --> 00:54:18,390
Essence?

579
00:54:18,496 --> 00:54:21,000
What were you thinking
while horse squatting?

580
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,184
What could I think?

581
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,219
I was thinking
why you changed your mind.

582
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:27,824
What else?

583
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,957
Whatever you ask me, I'll do it.

584
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:32,380
Don't worry, Master.

585
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,923
I'll keep horse squatting
well till you say so.

586
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:38,332
Yes, Bruce,
you've wasted time so far.

587
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:41,327
Lots of time.

588
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,656
Why? I don't understand.

589
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:46,096
Do you know why you have to squat?

590
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:52,916
Master James told me
that horse squatting is practice.

591
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,736
Can't learn kung fu
without practicing.

592
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,403
So I'm practicing.

593
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,191
I thought you'd teach me the real thing
sooner or later.

594
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:02,417
If you want me to lift the pole forever,

595
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,823
I'll just do it.

596
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,368
So Master James

597
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:09,553
has taught you the importance
of horse squatting.

598
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:13,384
However, you didn't get
the core of it, you see?

599
00:55:13,498 --> 00:55:15,825
Horse squatting is a basic skill

600
00:55:15,935 --> 00:55:20,588
for all kung fu artists to master first.

601
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:22,923
Horse squatting is not only

602
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:26,028
for strengthening your legs,
but more importantly,

603
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,709
it is to strengthen your mind.

604
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:30,725
The key of kung fu training

605
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:32,817
is to train your mind.

606
00:55:32,923 --> 00:55:34,727
Train your mind

607
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:37,128
is to strengthen your mind and spirit.

608
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,735
What, squatting can train your mind?

609
00:55:38,841 --> 00:55:41,512
That's right, Bruce. You're too anxious.

610
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,608
What's vital to kung fu training

611
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:47,607
is to make both your body and mind

612
00:55:47,718 --> 00:55:50,781
as calm as still water.

613
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:54,328
A calm mind can reach
a thousand miles away.

614
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,869
A thousand miles away.

615
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,870
While you're horse squatting,
you're like a tree.

616
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:05,182
Just imagine yourself
as a big tree reaching the sky.

617
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:07,873
No matter how tall it is,

618
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,206
it stands on its root, you know?

619
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,539
So your entire body and mind

620
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:17,783
should take root
into the earth under your feet.

621
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:20,154
<i>The deeper your root gets,</i>

622
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:23,185
<i>the better your kung fu is.</i>

623
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,894
<i>Kung fu training means
to build yourself up</i>

624
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:27,921
<i>from the inside out.</i>

625
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:30,012
<i>That eventually integrates</i>

626
00:56:30,118 --> 00:56:32,231
<i>with all creatures on earth.</i>

627
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,780
<i>If you can reach this level,</i>

628
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,806
<i>your entire body and mind</i>

629
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:41,702
<i>will then turn into water...</i>

630
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,292
<i>from a big tree to water</i>

631
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,816
<i>which can infiltrate to everything on earth.</i>

632
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,837
<i>At that time,</i>

633
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:55,910
<i>you will reach an even higher level
of kung fu training.</i>

634
00:56:56,018 --> 00:56:59,080
<i>Only when you integrate yourself
into water consciously,</i>

635
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,440
<i>or unconsciously,</i>

636
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:03,736
<i>can your body and mind integrate</i>

637
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,069
<i>into the earth beneath you.</i>

638
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:15,089
<i>Only by then can you get the true spirit
of kung fu.</i>

639
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:40,817
Master is back.

640
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:41,862
Master.

641
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:44,224
Master is back.
- Master.

642
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:51,436
Keep practicing.

643
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:20,218
Did you ask him
to lift two poles together?

644
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,871
No. He did it himself.

645
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:26,348
I've been out so long.
Has he been doing it?

646
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:28,821
Absolutely.
It's been the whole day.

647
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,388
Good boy.

648
00:58:34,499 --> 00:58:36,482
He has the makings of a kung fu artist.

649
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:38,606
Originally, he didn't like
this kind of boring stuff.

650
00:58:38,712 --> 00:58:41,596
But he did it against your will.

651
00:58:43,168 --> 00:58:45,221
What a character.

652
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,091
Mind your posture.

653
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,937
Looks good.

654
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:44,748
Master.

655
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:46,551
Bruce,

656
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,253
from now on,

657
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:50,482
you may practice
with your elder brother

658
00:59:50,598 --> 00:59:53,339
and see how that feels.

659
00:59:53,452 --> 00:59:56,123
Really? That's awesome!

660
00:59:56,237 --> 00:59:58,420
Go. Practice over there. Just go.

661
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:01,109
Thanks, Master.

662
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:58,928
Slow down. Don't drag me.
- Hurry up.

663
01:00:59,037 --> 01:01:01,671
Why did you take me here
in the early morning?

664
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:05,015
Do you want to get beaten again?
- Hey, you go in there.

665
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:08,156
Think of a way to get Yellow Skin out.

666
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:09,817
Aw, Bruce,

667
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:12,080
I can't help you this time.

668
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:13,893
You've just recovered.

669
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:17,554
You can't do anything...
but get beaten up all day.

670
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:19,988
You go in now.

671
01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:22,425
Okay. I know.

672
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:29,596
Go in!
- Okay, I'll go.

673
01:01:29,706 --> 01:01:31,474
What should I tell him, huh?

674
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:35,716
Just tell him his rival is here.

675
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:43,027
What did you say?

676
01:01:45,475 --> 01:01:48,359
Whose rival is he?
- Of course it's yours.

677
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:51,044
It's mine?

678
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,227
I might like to learn
a few tricks from you.

679
01:02:00,235 --> 01:02:04,721
It seems I didn't kick you
hard enough last time.

680
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:07,193
Tøday would you like me
to break your ribs

681
01:02:07,302 --> 01:02:08,762
or your legs first?

682
01:02:11,654 --> 01:02:14,325
What if I broke your ribs
or your legs?

683
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,589
What, then?

684
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:22,861
Then I'll say you're great.

685
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:26,824
Come on.

686
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,268
Hey, Bruce, why do you
ask for trouble?

687
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,457
Leave me alone.

688
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,345
Just kick.

689
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:42,606
Kick, you idiot.

690
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:05,415
Shun Leung, begin.

691
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:06,875
Right away.

692
01:04:06,984 --> 01:04:08,265
Yes, Master.

693
01:04:08,376 --> 01:04:10,002
Jun Lee, you'll be defending.

694
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:13,866
Come here.

695
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:15,262
Master.

696
01:04:15,374 --> 01:04:16,798
Bruce.

697
01:04:18,507 --> 01:04:22,613
Well, you two go get ready.

698
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:25,425
Make sure to go beyond that.

699
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:27,793
Get it? Ready? Begin.

700
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,363
Bruce, when fighting
with Yong Chun Quan,

701
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:38,522
don't stick to the rules and tricks.

702
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:41,405
Fight whatever you feel like.

703
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:02,298
Billy, go on.

704
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:33,800
Good job.

705
01:05:33,908 --> 01:05:36,615
Good job.

706
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,639
Way to go.

707
01:05:38,747 --> 01:05:40,372
Brother, are you okay?

708
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:42,920
No. You've used inch punch.

709
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:45,082
I did it involuntarily.

710
01:05:45,187 --> 01:05:47,858
Wow. You did it in such a short time.

711
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:50,298
Really awesome.
- You got it.

712
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:51,999
Good job.

713
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:56,115
Bruce, although you just fought
with the inch punch,

714
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:58,691
your level of skill wasn't good enough.

715
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:00,780
Little did your brother expect

716
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:02,905
you could learn do it
in such a short time.

717
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,992
He underestimates you.

718
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,389
That made you a very lucky guy.

719
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,771
But, Bruce,

720
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,285
you can't always count
on luck to save you all the time.

721
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:16,720
Yes. I didn't expect it, either.

722
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:21,626
I think Bruce's punches
are quite powerful now.

723
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:25,075
Bruce, to learn a certain boxing,

724
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:27,298
action is the foundation.

725
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:30,155
Your brother has taught you about it.

726
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:32,772
But you want to make it perfect.

727
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,932
You have to put
your whole heart into it,

728
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,612
and it takes a long time to master it.

729
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:40,495
Get the board. Give her a try.

730
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:43,289
Try this.

731
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:47,084
Okay.

732
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:51,222
Get more strength.

733
01:06:56,516 --> 01:06:59,542
You see, you've got the essentials
of the inch punch.

734
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:02,426
But to smash the board
with one punch

735
01:07:02,538 --> 01:07:04,615
is not training you can do in one day.

736
01:07:04,732 --> 01:07:07,236
What you're learning
now, Bruce, see,

737
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:09,324
is real kung fu.

738
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:14,440
The rules of action, hands and steps
will be of less importance.

739
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:18,228
If keeping practicing, everyone can get it.

740
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:21,464
Tø simply put, get power from feet

741
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,799
and punch out from the heart,

742
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:26,061
attack whenever you can,

743
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,323
and defend each inch of land.

744
01:07:28,438 --> 01:07:30,170
Again, simply put,

745
01:07:30,283 --> 01:07:32,431
you get power from feet,

746
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:34,598
punch out from the heart,

747
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,649
and simply attack when you can,

748
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:38,740
and defend each inch of land!

749
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,137
Get power from your feet

750
01:07:41,248 --> 01:07:43,325
and punch out from the heart,

751
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:45,387
attack whenever you can,

752
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,050
and defend each inch of land.

753
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:49,492
It's like a kid holding a concave mirror

754
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:51,621
to emblaze paper with collected sunlight.

755
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:55,312
The theory is that the concave mirror

756
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:58,716
converges sunlight to one final point, no?

757
01:07:58,828 --> 01:08:00,738
Which emblazes things.

758
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:02,164
I got it, Master.

759
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:05,301
Also, utilize the power

760
01:08:05,408 --> 01:08:07,069
of your opponent.
- You mean

761
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:10,731
utilizing the rival's power
to get back and attack him

762
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:14,031
quickly enough to save our energy.

763
01:08:14,146 --> 01:08:17,101
You'll understand it more
when thinking about it.

764
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:19,571
I believe in your perception.

765
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,636
The core of real kung fu
is that while attacking,

766
01:08:22,743 --> 01:08:24,689
you should focus all your power

767
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:27,017
on one point and attack in a second.

768
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,040
While defending,

769
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:31,060
eliminate the rival's attack

770
01:08:31,168 --> 01:08:34,468
and turn your defense mode to offense

771
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,571
with the suddenness of a thunderbolt!

772
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:49,265
<i>You have to reach the unity
of offense and defense,</i>

773
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,974
<i>the harmony of yin and yang.</i>

774
01:08:52,089 --> 01:08:54,760
<i>This is the level you should achieve</i>

775
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:57,652
<i>when fighting with Yong Chun Quan.</i>

776
01:08:57,764 --> 01:08:59,389
<i>In other words,</i>

777
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,831
<i>your attack includes defense,</i>

778
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:05,526
<i>and within your defense,
hides offense.</i>

779
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:09,275
<i>The speed and skill
of the transition between the two</i>

780
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:13,700
<i>is what kung fu artists
need to master.</i>

781
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:15,545
Prepare.

782
01:09:41,452 --> 01:09:46,081
Bruce, I always admired you as a man,

783
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:51,612
and you're a hero in my heart,

784
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:55,364
but now... you're different,

785
01:09:57,987 --> 01:10:01,109
and I thought...

786
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:04,454
you have a side of weakness

787
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,680
and cowardice.

788
01:10:08,919 --> 01:10:11,317
But we can't do anything about it.

789
01:10:16,124 --> 01:10:19,222
You're Bruce Lee.

790
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:23,885
Find a way to make it work.
You see?

791
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:27,671
You won't be beaten by anyone.

792
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:31,086
You will bounce back.

793
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:33,108
We can do this, Bruce.

794
01:10:33,216 --> 01:10:35,614
Tøgether we can overcome anything.

795
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:45,049
Will you let me help you, Bruce?

796
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,376
We'll do this together.

797
01:10:57,028 --> 01:11:00,363
Bruce, I love you.

798
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,053
No matter when the miracle's
coming, okay,

799
01:11:08,168 --> 01:11:10,221
I promise to stay by your side.

800
01:11:10,326 --> 01:11:14,527
But you must stay strong, Bruce,

801
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:18,286
and we'll face the problem together.

802
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:22,152
I trust you, Bruce.

803
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,912
Okay?

804
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,967
Linda,

805
01:11:31,074 --> 01:11:33,127
I understand what you mean.

806
01:11:33,232 --> 01:11:35,416
Let American doctors'
diagnosis go to hell.

807
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:38,758
I refuse to let it happen to me.

808
01:11:38,871 --> 01:11:40,925
Trust me.
- I know.

809
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,498
I swear I'll make the miracle happen.

810
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:46,668
I won't let anybody down like this.

811
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:48,684
I won't.

812
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:50,703
I believe in you, sweetheart.

813
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:52,865
I believe in you.

814
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:07,206
James,

815
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:10,471
Kimura,

816
01:12:10,585 --> 01:12:13,362
I'm sorry.

817
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,461
What are you guys doing here?

818
01:12:22,525 --> 01:12:24,507
Master Wang.

819
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:28,091
What in the hell
are you guys doing here, huh?

820
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,977
Haven't you put Bruce's life
in enough danger?

821
01:12:31,089 --> 01:12:33,071
What else do you want anyway?

822
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:36,334
But, please. Master James,

823
01:12:36,449 --> 01:12:38,074
we mean no harm.

824
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,074
We heard Bruce's injury is quite severe.

825
01:12:41,183 --> 01:12:43,261
We're extremely worried.

826
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:46,889
We are here to see him.

827
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:54,366
Mr. Lee, how are you feeling?

828
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:55,870
Good or bad?

829
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,509
You can tell with your own eyes.

830
01:12:57,614 --> 01:12:59,763
Yes, yes.

831
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:03,699
The things that happened
were totally unexpected.

832
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:09,868
What Yellow Skin has done to you
is surely unforgivable.

833
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:13,000
He's already been dismissed.

834
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,791
You guys can feel at ease.

835
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:19,476
Happy Yellow Skin left?

836
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:23,712
Master Wang, what you did
is very smart.

837
01:13:23,828 --> 01:13:28,552
Mr. Lee, you misunderstand.

838
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:32,868
I truly feel terrible
for such an accident.

839
01:13:34,585 --> 01:13:37,362
These past couple of days,
my colleagues and I

840
01:13:37,474 --> 01:13:40,145
have been thinking.

841
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:42,894
We are all Chinese

842
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:46,072
who live in a foreign country.

843
01:13:47,604 --> 01:13:49,681
Why can we not
negotiate it peacefully

844
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:52,859
rather than end up like this?

845
01:13:52,965 --> 01:13:55,920
We are responsible.

846
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:58,319
Therefore,

847
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:01,172
I have discussed it
with all of the Chinese

848
01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:03,540
kung fu colleagues in California,

849
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:05,942
and we are here

850
01:14:06,054 --> 01:14:08,688
on behalf of the association

851
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:12,317
to apologize to Mr. Lee.

852
01:14:13,504 --> 01:14:15,486
Master Wang,

853
01:14:16,776 --> 01:14:19,138
all of you,

854
01:14:21,372 --> 01:14:23,876
I, Bruce Lee,

855
01:14:23,982 --> 01:14:25,786
don't deserve this.

856
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:28,531
All of you, please rise.

857
01:14:29,691 --> 01:14:32,088
Just for what Master Wang has said,

858
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:33,895
we are all Chinese.

859
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:36,441
I forgive you.

860
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:39,290
I won't blame you.

861
01:14:39,404 --> 01:14:43,190
Bruce is right. You can stand now.

862
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:51,088
Master Wang, please rise.

863
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,917
Linda, go help him up.

864
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:02,028
Mr. Wang, please, stand up.

865
01:15:07,984 --> 01:15:11,284
James, Kimura,

866
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:14,315
please help Master Wang up.

867
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:31,165
Master Wang, we Chinese

868
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:34,156
have a very low social status
in foreign countries.

869
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:40,596
They call us "Asian sick men"

870
01:15:40,706 --> 01:15:43,033
or "yellow dogs with pigtails."

871
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:47,173
How dare they treat us like this?

872
01:15:47,286 --> 01:15:49,921
'Cause we don't bond together.

873
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:53,680
Rather, we fight amongst ourselves.

874
01:15:53,795 --> 01:15:57,997
If we stop fighting each other

875
01:15:58,113 --> 01:16:02,279
and never create chaos within us,

876
01:16:02,394 --> 01:16:04,055
I will be grateful,

877
01:16:04,169 --> 01:16:05,937
even if I never stand up again.

878
01:16:06,049 --> 01:16:08,862
Please, Master Wang.

879
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:10,504
Please stand up.

880
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:13,387
Please stand up.

881
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,320
Bruce Lee,

882
01:16:22,446 --> 01:16:26,303
you are a true master.

883
01:16:47,788 --> 01:16:51,088
One, two,

884
01:16:52,906 --> 01:16:54,259
three...

885
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,875
Bruce...

886
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:04,283
Bruce, love, you're done.

887
01:17:04,394 --> 01:17:06,542
You don't have to do any more.

888
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,734
I can do it.

889
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:12,362
Your determination's
three times stronger than others'

890
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,095
No problem.

891
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,907
Go ahead.

892
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,189
Bruce, be careful.

893
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:28,127
How is it? Can you keep going?

894
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,352
Is that okay?

895
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:33,493
How are you feeling?

896
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,712
Look. You're doing it.

897
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:37,810
Good job.

898
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:41,014
Are you feeling okay? Does that hurt?
- You know what?

899
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,959
Does that hurt?

900
01:17:43,069 --> 01:17:44,623
Does it hurt?

901
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,209
So the physical therapy works.
- Bruce, you're doing great.

902
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:49,678
I think your legs are recovering.

903
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:55,737
What are you doing?

904
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:57,720
Just a little more. Drink it.

905
01:17:57,829 --> 01:17:59,812
Just drink it. Drink it all.

906
01:17:59,918 --> 01:18:01,473
All of it.

907
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:10,249
I'm so useless. I got your clothes dirty.

908
01:18:10,361 --> 01:18:12,379
Doesn't matter, Mr. Lee.

909
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:14,668
You know what?

910
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:19,925
If your positive energy
travels to the injured area,

911
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:22,577
it'll beat negative energy.

912
01:18:22,684 --> 01:18:25,046
First, you must keep
taking herbal medicine.

913
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:27,754
Meanwhile, the doctors suggest

914
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:31,978
you start with acupuncture treatment.

915
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:34,373
This will connect your meridian

916
01:18:34,486 --> 01:18:37,892
and boost the blood
circulation in your body.

917
01:18:38,002 --> 01:18:40,850
The key of Chinese acupuncture...
- Oh, I see.

918
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,809
...isn't just healing whatever
goes wrong in the body.

919
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:47,504
Instead, it cures...

920
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,235
by way of conditioning
the relationship

921
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:55,121
between body and mind, you see?

922
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:58,496
You're starting to finally get it.

923
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:02,017
Overall concepts.

924
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:03,098
Yes?

925
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:07,205
Actually, kung fu also requires
the overall concept.

926
01:19:07,312 --> 01:19:08,807
For example,

927
01:19:08,914 --> 01:19:11,062
when attacking and defending,

928
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,811
it's important
to coordinate the whole body

929
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:16,775
so you can better
play the role of Yong Chun Quan.

930
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,104
You're so crazy about kung fu

931
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:21,889
that everything has to relate to it.

932
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:32,125
I remembered a competition.

933
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:33,733
What about it?

934
01:19:33,839 --> 01:19:37,387
I realized that Chinese wushu

935
01:19:37,494 --> 01:19:40,235
has a drawback in actual combat.

936
01:19:40,348 --> 01:19:44,170
For example, both Hong Quan
you taught me,

937
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:46,786
and Master Ye's Yong Chun Quan

938
01:19:46,893 --> 01:19:50,999
have some disadvantages
in real-world fighting.

939
01:19:51,106 --> 01:19:53,432
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

940
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:55,904
I think the traditional kung fu styles,

941
01:19:56,013 --> 01:19:57,996
its movements and patterns

942
01:19:58,102 --> 01:20:00,120
are all outdated,

943
01:20:00,226 --> 01:20:03,454
and with no innovation.

944
01:20:03,568 --> 01:20:06,310
I want to...

945
01:20:06,422 --> 01:20:09,235
I want to empty the glass.

946
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:11,400
This way, I can fill it up again.

947
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:13,345
This is what I'm thinking.

948
01:20:13,454 --> 01:20:15,567
Empty the glass...

949
01:20:15,683 --> 01:20:17,665
and then refill it.

950
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:22,917
You're... You're talking about

951
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,725
enlightenment.

952
01:20:24,838 --> 01:20:26,297
These days,

953
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:29,430
since I'm not able
to move around much at all,

954
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:32,385
I have time to think
about those problems

955
01:20:32,496 --> 01:20:35,036
and the kung fu theories.

956
01:20:35,142 --> 01:20:38,893
I just spend time
emptying my own glass.

957
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,916
You know what I mean, Dad?

958
01:20:41,024 --> 01:20:43,695
I believe I will fill it with what I need.

959
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,828
<i>Learning kung fu</i>

960
01:20:45,933 --> 01:20:49,684
<i>will influence our thought and lifestyle.</i>

961
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:53,441
<i>The training you get from
certain masters or a school,</i>

962
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,634
<i>you still won't get developed fully</i>

963
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,670
<i>even though you may reach
to its highest level.</i>

964
01:20:58,778 --> 01:21:02,006
<i>If you follow the traditional model,</i>

965
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:05,634
<i>all you learn is the old routines.</i>

966
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:08,625
<i>In kung fu training,
we don't want to be limited</i>

967
01:21:08,734 --> 01:21:11,097
<i>by any school or tradition.</i>

968
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:13,533
<i>The core of kung fu</i>

969
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:16,112
<i>is freedom.</i>

970
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:27,009
Daddy's here.

971
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,513
Come on, son. Let Daddy hold you.

972
01:21:29,621 --> 01:21:32,220
Come on, son. Let me hold you.
- We won't let you.

973
01:21:33,486 --> 01:21:35,598
Son, give Daddy a smile.

974
01:21:35,714 --> 01:21:38,705
We can show Daddy your trick.

975
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:41,209
We'll show it to you.
- Come on, son.

976
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:44,416
Right. Okay. Here we go.

977
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:47,263
Right there.
- Son, come over here.

978
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,656
Oh, Daddy.

979
01:21:48,768 --> 01:21:50,881
Come here, son. Come.

980
01:21:50,995 --> 01:21:52,906
Here we go.
- Come. Come.

981
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,622
Hey, be careful.

982
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,570
You scared Daddy.

983
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,980
Bruce... Bruce, you're standing.

984
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:18,769
Linda, it's Brandon
that made me stand up.

985
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,719
Oh, sweetheart.

986
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,907
Give me the baby.

987
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:26,286
Okay. I'm so excited.

988
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,247
Oh, it's wonderful. I'm so proud.

989
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,002
Yes, it is very good. Let's take a walk.

990
01:22:33,118 --> 01:22:35,028
I stood up because of Brandon.

991
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:38,364
I never expected this.
- You can walk.

992
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:40,734
Yes, I can walk.

993
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:15,452
Hey, Bruce, did you read
today's newspaper?

994
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,823
Don't you know what the article

995
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:24,965
"The Miracle Return of Bruce Lee"
means to us?

996
01:24:25,071 --> 01:24:27,219
The enrolling students
are beyond capacity.

997
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:29,352
Bruce, did you hear what he said?

998
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:31,713
Usually, Kimura is such a slow coach.

999
01:24:31,824 --> 01:24:35,824
He jumped on the news today
and came to tell you right away.

1000
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:38,781
You know, I knew this day would come.

1001
01:25:18,472 --> 01:25:20,799
Master, Bruce Lee

1002
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:23,757
dares to show his kung fu
at our arena.

1003
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,743
Is Bruce Lee gonna perform?

1004
01:25:25,853 --> 01:25:28,001
Yes. I just came from the committee.

1005
01:25:28,115 --> 01:25:30,298
The clerk told me.

1006
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:33,047
The opportunity's here.

1007
01:25:33,163 --> 01:25:35,181
I'll be known in Seattle.

1008
01:25:35,286 --> 01:25:38,657
I'll win and make this arrogant brat

1009
01:25:38,768 --> 01:25:41,272
unable to stand up before everyone.

1010
01:25:41,378 --> 01:25:44,049
So you mean to say
we'll challenge him?

1011
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,642
Whether it's a challenge or not,

1012
01:25:47,748 --> 01:25:49,731
you just wait and see
the good show I put on.

1013
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:11,241
Hey, now!

1014
01:26:11,351 --> 01:26:13,819
You are going to know the hero of Seattle.

1015
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:15,387
My man. That's who.

1016
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:17,226
In front of you, you, you, you and you,

1017
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,401
5,000 years of history
will be displayed.

1018
01:26:20,506 --> 01:26:23,841
That's right. Come on. Follow me.

1019
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,709
You're really awesome.
How did you beat me just now?

1020
01:27:31,138 --> 01:27:33,607
What I use is Chinese kung fu.

1021
01:27:33,714 --> 01:27:36,254
Great. Great, man.

1022
01:27:55,577 --> 01:27:58,248
Who are you? Give your name.

1023
01:27:58,361 --> 01:28:00,344
I'm Yamamoto.

1024
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:03,998
I have waited so long,
and now you've showed up.

1025
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,382
It's a good opportunity.

1026
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,269
Bruce Lee, you can fight in any style.

1027
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,743
I've heard that you're arrogant.

1028
01:28:13,852 --> 01:28:16,974
You said you didn't have
an equal in Seattle, didn't you?

1029
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,549
Didn't you?

1030
01:28:18,657 --> 01:28:20,639
That's right. I said this.

1031
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:23,694
Well,

1032
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,791
I really want you to see

1033
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:28,639
how I'll teach you a lesson,
you arrogant China boy.

1034
01:28:28,752 --> 01:28:31,635
Okay. Come on.

1035
01:29:24,763 --> 01:29:28,348
Brat, you're quite flexible.
Come on. Again.

1036
01:29:59,122 --> 01:30:05,663
Bruce Lee, now you've got an idea
what Japanese karate is like.

1037
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:09,071
In Seattle, there is no place for you.
None for you!

1038
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:21,121
Bruce! Bruce, calm down!

1039
01:30:35,187 --> 01:30:42,188
Kimura, these days, a demon
has been bothering me a lot lately.

1040
01:30:44,099 --> 01:30:48,728
This demon... is he Yamamoto?

1041
01:30:48,832 --> 01:30:50,114
Yes.

1042
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:55,685
Yamamoto's a well-known karate master
in Japan and America.

1043
01:30:55,795 --> 01:30:59,831
He pays great attention to his training.

1044
01:30:59,937 --> 01:31:03,237
He's opened karate clubs
in many places in the U.S.,

1045
01:31:03,349 --> 01:31:09,402
but mostly he's keen on teaching
rather than competing.

1046
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:18,937
I don't really get it.

1047
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:23,215
Why is he able to build
such a solid foundation?

1048
01:31:23,331 --> 01:31:27,640
Probably it has something
to do with the iron man.

1049
01:31:28,936 --> 01:31:31,891
Iron man? What do you mean?

1050
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:33,209
I've just heard of it.

1051
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:35,375
But I've never seen it myself.

1052
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,329
His students told me
that he fights every day

1053
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:42,368
with a big iron man twice his size.

1054
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,572
I've never heard of this kind of thing.

1055
01:31:51,076 --> 01:31:54,339
Well, I'd like to meet
this Yamamoto again.

1056
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,073
Well, if it isn't Bruce Lee.

1057
01:32:06,184 --> 01:32:08,367
Am I not welcome?

1058
01:32:09,874 --> 01:32:12,236
I didn't teach you
a good lesson last time.

1059
01:32:12,345 --> 01:32:15,573
Aren't you asking for trouble?

1060
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:35,348
Bruce Lee, you are such a nuisance.

1061
01:32:35,461 --> 01:32:38,309
I don't intend
on spying on your training.

1062
01:32:40,438 --> 01:32:42,516
I've just come to deliver
my challenge invitation.

1063
01:32:42,631 --> 01:32:44,162
You don't have the eligibility.

1064
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,371
I have.

1065
01:32:45,486 --> 01:32:46,767
Get lost.

1066
01:32:49,455 --> 01:32:51,472
Bring it on.

1067
01:33:03,727 --> 01:33:05,780
Bruce?

1068
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:16,875
Where's Bruce?
- Where could he be?

1069
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:18,973
Could he be at school training?

1070
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:22,624
No. I just came back
from there. He wasn't there.

1071
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,381
Oh, God.

1072
01:33:25,484 --> 01:33:27,988
I bet he went to visit Yamamoto.

1073
01:33:28,095 --> 01:33:29,412
We should go.

1074
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:38,528
Don't come back!

1075
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:43,581
Let's go.
- Are you okay?

1076
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:07,567
Bruce, you're not sleepy?

1077
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:09,302
I can't sleep.

1078
01:34:10,531 --> 01:34:15,539
If I don't go compete
with various masters,

1079
01:34:15,648 --> 01:34:19,612
how would I know the core
of their exquisite skills?

1080
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:25,114
Kimora, I want to set up my own style.

1081
01:34:25,221 --> 01:34:26,396
Your own style?

1082
01:34:26,509 --> 01:34:29,108
That's right. My own style.

1083
01:34:29,224 --> 01:34:31,064
Well, that's not easy.

1084
01:34:31,173 --> 01:34:34,271
When I was little,

1085
01:34:34,376 --> 01:34:38,756
I learned from Master James
Tang Lang Quan, Shaolin Quan,

1086
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:43,175
Hong Quan, Chang Quan,
and many other styles.

1087
01:34:43,288 --> 01:34:48,154
Later on, I learned from Master Ye
his Yong Chun Quan.

1088
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,805
And after that, I felt Yong Chun Quan

1089
01:34:50,911 --> 01:34:53,024
was the most powerful one
in the world.

1090
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:55,846
Later on, I joined
on the Western boxing team

1091
01:34:55,959 --> 01:34:59,544
and found there was something
useful as well.

1092
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:06,017
Now I realize some secret tricks
in Japanese karate.

1093
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:08,273
Oh, right.

1094
01:35:09,431 --> 01:35:10,962
More and more,

1095
01:35:11,068 --> 01:35:13,050
I feel that each style

1096
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:15,969
has its own advantage
and disadvantage

1097
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:19,380
which can be studied and utilized.

1098
01:35:19,492 --> 01:35:23,658
Now, I haven't known
enough boxing styles,

1099
01:35:23,773 --> 01:35:26,515
but I believe that through
my studying and research

1100
01:35:26,628 --> 01:35:28,776
of the various boxing styles,

1101
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:30,801
I can improve Yong Chun Quan

1102
01:35:30,911 --> 01:35:32,465
and make it a more practical one.

1103
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:35,394
Improve Yong Chun Quan?

1104
01:35:35,505 --> 01:35:36,655
Right.

1105
01:35:38,185 --> 01:35:41,972
Bruce, why don't we sit down
with Professor Klein

1106
01:35:42,084 --> 01:35:43,995
and discuss it further,

1107
01:35:44,104 --> 01:35:46,466
creating a new way for kung fu together?
- You got it.

1108
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,296
Good.

1109
01:35:53,746 --> 01:35:57,331
UNIVERSITY OF WASHING TON

1110
01:36:27,235 --> 01:36:29,775
Professor Klein,

1111
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:32,765
I know that I have to learn
a lot of knowledge about martial arts.

1112
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:36,316
I need to understand the essences
of various schools...

1113
01:36:36,426 --> 01:36:40,497
analyzing, comparing,
and doing research.

1114
01:36:40,603 --> 01:36:43,036
And for achieving my goal,
I have no better way

1115
01:36:43,143 --> 01:36:46,514
but to compete
with those masters from each school.

1116
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:50,969
That way, I can discover
which school is practical and which is not.

1117
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:52,742
You know what, Bruce Lee?

1118
01:36:52,857 --> 01:36:55,598
Rodin once said,
"It's not a lack of beauty in life

1119
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:57,621
but the eyes to discover."

1120
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:00,993
In your case, it means
it's not a lack of master of martial arts

1121
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,911
but the eyes to discover.

1122
01:37:03,021 --> 01:37:05,905
You may have to compete
with yourself after all.

1123
01:37:06,015 --> 01:37:09,243
Compete with myself?
- Yes.

1124
01:37:09,357 --> 01:37:12,064
One's biggest rival is none but himself.

1125
01:37:12,176 --> 01:37:14,431
I guess you've chosen a philosophy major,

1126
01:37:14,544 --> 01:37:17,641
which is the best way to find out
how to compete with yourself.

1127
01:37:17,747 --> 01:37:20,939
And what's more,
my understanding of martial arts

1128
01:37:21,054 --> 01:37:23,593
is that it isn't just
for building up your body,

1129
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,919
nor competing with your rival.

1130
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:28,464
The biggest benefit
for studying martial arts

1131
01:37:28,573 --> 01:37:31,670
is probably a way
of an appreciation of cultures.

1132
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:34,244
Young man, you should make
the best use of your time

1133
01:37:34,352 --> 01:37:38,458
to study and figure out how to create
your own theory for martial arts.

1134
01:37:38,564 --> 01:37:40,617
I believe that you have such potential.

1135
01:38:59,709 --> 01:39:03,531
Our jujitsu is the most
powerful skill of combat.

1136
01:39:03,643 --> 01:39:06,491
No other combat styles can defeat us.

1137
01:39:07,577 --> 01:39:08,727
Come over.

1138
01:39:12,067 --> 01:39:14,702
Aim it. Come on.

1139
01:39:14,817 --> 01:39:18,153
Make him unbalanced at first.

1140
01:39:18,263 --> 01:39:21,361
And then it'll be easier.

1141
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,164
This is called defending with one blow.

1142
01:39:40,473 --> 01:39:46,942
Yong Chun Quan has its strong points
and its limitations, too.

1143
01:39:47,053 --> 01:39:50,768
Are you still thinking
about Willy Jay's jujitsu?

1144
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:56,241
We should learn anything
useful to us.

1145
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:00,974
Well, let's send him
a challenge invitation.

1146
01:40:03,519 --> 01:40:08,077
I have a challenge invitation that says
Bruce Lee wants to compete with me.

1147
01:40:08,183 --> 01:40:10,925
Bruce Lee wants to compete
with you now?

1148
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,577
I bet he doesn't want to lose his ribs.

1149
01:40:13,684 --> 01:40:15,523
James, I don't understand all this.

1150
01:40:17,025 --> 01:40:21,156
Bruce Lee is such a small
and slim guy at only 140 pounds.

1151
01:40:21,273 --> 01:40:23,776
I mean, I won't waste more time on this.

1152
01:40:23,883 --> 01:40:25,164
Where will it take place?

1153
01:40:25,276 --> 01:40:26,557
In a public venue.

1154
01:40:26,668 --> 01:40:28,128
You're competing in a public venue?

1155
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:29,588
I've never heard of such a thing.

1156
01:40:29,697 --> 01:40:31,466
Yeah, he's crazy.

1157
01:40:31,576 --> 01:40:34,175
I think he's too arrogant.

1158
01:40:34,292 --> 01:40:36,274
Completely arrogant.

1159
01:40:36,381 --> 01:40:38,849
Only a maniac would take
his own life lightly.

1160
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:41,176
Don't you think?
- James, what do you want to talk about?

1161
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:44,316
Well, it's about the match.

1162
01:40:44,422 --> 01:40:47,306
There's gonna be
a supervisor there officiating.

1163
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:48,590
Who?

1164
01:40:48,704 --> 01:40:50,543
Inosando.

1165
01:40:50,653 --> 01:40:52,492
That guy.

1166
01:40:52,603 --> 01:40:54,478
He's a professor at a sports college.

1167
01:40:54,587 --> 01:40:56,213
Right. Right.

1168
01:40:56,327 --> 01:40:59,449
You know what? He's famous for
the "King of Filipino Stick."

1169
01:40:59,565 --> 01:41:01,784
Really? It sounds great.

1170
01:41:28,632 --> 01:41:32,489
Mr. Willy Jay.
- Hello, Mr. Lee.

1171
01:41:32,601 --> 01:41:34,298
After you.

1172
01:41:35,595 --> 01:41:37,577
Come.

1173
01:41:44,297 --> 01:41:47,075
Tøday, the master
of Bruce Lee Kung Fu Club,

1174
01:41:47,187 --> 01:41:49,098
Mr. Bruce Lee,

1175
01:41:49,206 --> 01:41:51,710
will challenge Mr. Willy Jay,

1176
01:41:51,817 --> 01:41:54,915
the master of Willy Ja Jujitsu Club.

1177
01:41:55,019 --> 01:41:57,002
As the host of this game today,

1178
01:41:57,108 --> 01:41:59,363
I'd like to invite Professor Inosando

1179
01:41:59,475 --> 01:42:02,146
from the Sport Academy
to be our supervisor.

1180
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:04,800
The rule of the game is

1181
01:42:04,907 --> 01:42:09,595
as long as one party makes the other
unable to stand up again,

1182
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:12,808
he declares victory.

1183
01:42:12,913 --> 01:42:16,011
Both parties get ready.

1184
01:42:16,116 --> 01:42:18,787
Is that clear?

1185
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,369
Is that clear?

1186
01:42:23,112 --> 01:42:25,402
Professor Inosando.

1187
01:42:33,626 --> 01:42:35,500
Are you ready?

1188
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:37,164
Now begin.

1189
01:44:12,804 --> 01:44:13,954
Yeah!

1190
01:45:15,499 --> 01:45:17,718
Go on. Go on with it.

1191
01:45:40,633 --> 01:45:44,419
This is Bruce Lee's fight.

1192
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:50,343
Your jujitsu is really powerful.

1193
01:45:50,449 --> 01:45:51,695
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

1194
01:45:51,807 --> 01:45:54,097
You didn't make a fool of me
in front of everybody.

1195
01:45:54,209 --> 01:45:57,473
I knew you showed me some mercy,
allowing me to have the upper hand.

1196
01:45:57,586 --> 01:45:58,974
I knew it, Mr. Lee.

1197
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:02,346
And even if you went all the way,
maybe I couldn't keep my feet.

1198
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:05,760
And also, you dominated me
when falling to the ground.

1199
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:09,349
If you'd used the eyeball trick,
I'd have been blinded already.

1200
01:46:12,311 --> 01:46:15,682
I think I understand what you want
isn't for winning or losing

1201
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:19,828
but to get to know me,
or I'll say to improve your skills

1202
01:46:19,935 --> 01:46:22,225
by learning from my jiujitsu.

1203
01:46:22,337 --> 01:46:23,832
Is that right?

1204
01:46:23,938 --> 01:46:26,407
Correct. You've got it.

1205
01:46:26,514 --> 01:46:29,089
Now, I try to compete
with various masters.

1206
01:46:29,194 --> 01:46:31,901
My goal isn't for winning

1207
01:46:32,014 --> 01:46:35,836
but to improve my kung fu
to a higher level.

1208
01:46:35,948 --> 01:46:39,140
So I hope you can help me,
Master Willy Jay.

1209
01:46:39,255 --> 01:46:40,988
I appreciate it.

1210
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:44,056
It's my honor to teach you
my jujitsu, Mr. Lee.

1211
01:46:45,835 --> 01:46:48,862
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Master Jay.

1212
01:47:28,548 --> 01:47:30,458
Class is dismissed.

1213
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:45,079
Bruce! Bruce, the professor is here.

1214
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:50,224
Professor Inosando.

1215
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,331
We've met before.

1216
01:47:54,866 --> 01:47:56,848
Yes.

1217
01:47:56,955 --> 01:47:58,414
I just want to know,

1218
01:47:58,521 --> 01:48:00,360
when you were competing
with Willy Jay,

1219
01:48:00,471 --> 01:48:03,390
why did you hold back?

1220
01:48:03,499 --> 01:48:05,482
I don't want to just beat Willy Jay

1221
01:48:05,588 --> 01:48:11,012
and lose the chance to learn
and study jujitsu together with him.

1222
01:48:14,152 --> 01:48:16,169
Would you please
give me a chance like that?

1223
01:48:16,275 --> 01:48:18,814
You're too humble.

1224
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:22,742
I've heard you're a great martial artist
with high achievements.

1225
01:48:22,854 --> 01:48:24,907
I haven't had a chance to learn from you.
- Flattering.

1226
01:48:25,012 --> 01:48:26,472
Okay, well, watch out.

1227
01:48:31,453 --> 01:48:33,292
You're indeed fast.

1228
01:48:33,402 --> 01:48:35,171
Let's see who's faster.

1229
01:48:40,886 --> 01:48:42,832
Thanks for the opportunity.

1230
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:45,409
I admit defeat.

1231
01:48:45,516 --> 01:48:47,011
You're too modest.

1232
01:48:52,688 --> 01:48:54,005
Professor Ino,

1233
01:48:54,115 --> 01:48:56,749
I feel that Filipino boxing
is quite flexible,

1234
01:48:56,865 --> 01:48:59,263
with rapid speed
and the various changes,

1235
01:48:59,371 --> 01:49:01,282
but it is not powerful enough.

1236
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:04,452
Yong Chun Quan's key
is simple and direct.

1237
01:49:04,559 --> 01:49:08,202
It requires you to launch attack
while defending yourself.

1238
01:49:08,318 --> 01:49:10,572
This is the crucial characteristic of it.

1239
01:49:10,685 --> 01:49:13,153
But there are weaknesses
in its footwork.

1240
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:15,860
It's quite useful at a closer distance,

1241
01:49:15,976 --> 01:49:19,763
but it doesn't work well
between the middle to long range.

1242
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:34,593
Kimura, I'd like to promote
our kung fu club

1243
01:49:34,705 --> 01:49:37,376
in a really big way in the community.

1244
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:39,638
I still truly believe in the importance

1245
01:49:39,752 --> 01:49:43,052
of exchanging ideas
with different schools.

1246
01:49:44,174 --> 01:49:45,633
But how?

1247
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,722
Breaking into their schools?

1248
01:49:47,828 --> 01:49:49,941
Well, come.

1249
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:57,845
It's not a good idea
to challenge them at their door.

1250
01:49:57,959 --> 01:50:00,012
I suppose it'll be better

1251
01:50:00,117 --> 01:50:02,752
to ask for them to challenge us here

1252
01:50:02,868 --> 01:50:06,654
rather than we go to their door.

1253
01:50:09,795 --> 01:50:12,014
What are you dreaming again?

1254
01:50:12,127 --> 01:50:14,417
When you compete
with others in our club,

1255
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:17,200
if you happen to lose
before our students,

1256
01:50:17,314 --> 01:50:18,489
it would be a shame.

1257
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:23,120
My goal is to set up
a new style of boxing.

1258
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,522
I don't care about winning or losing.

1259
01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:28,792
It's worth it even if I lose.

1260
01:50:30,508 --> 01:50:32,241
All right? Like this.

1261
01:50:33,432 --> 01:50:34,749
Write it down.

1262
01:50:38,235 --> 01:50:40,977
No matter, whenever,

1263
01:50:41,090 --> 01:50:44,912
wherever, and whoever

1264
01:50:45,024 --> 01:50:46,519
wants to challenge me,

1265
01:50:46,626 --> 01:50:48,085
I'm going to accept it.

1266
01:50:51,116 --> 01:50:53,822
Looks like Bruce Lee
is going to challenge...

1267
01:50:53,936 --> 01:50:55,740
the Americans.

1268
01:50:58,844 --> 01:51:00,232
Bruce Lee is challenging

1269
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:02,109
the whole field of martial arts in America.

1270
01:51:02,221 --> 01:51:05,663
Bruce Lee has put up a sign
at the gate of his club,

1271
01:51:05,771 --> 01:51:08,893
saying anyone at any time at any place

1272
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:11,585
wants to challenge him,
he's ready to accept.

1273
01:51:13,326 --> 01:51:15,308
Bruce is too damn arrogant.

1274
01:51:15,415 --> 01:51:17,634
He's out of his mind.

1275
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:22,476
He had some nerve to come
and challenge me in my home.

1276
01:51:22,586 --> 01:51:26,229
So he came up with such an idea?

1277
01:51:26,345 --> 01:51:29,229
I'll smash his kung fu club.

1278
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:45,098
Did you hear me?

1279
01:51:55,169 --> 01:51:58,161
What are you doing here?

1280
01:52:00,948 --> 01:52:03,203
Hello, Mr. Yamamoto.

1281
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:06,128
I'm glad you're here to instruct me.

1282
01:52:07,702 --> 01:52:10,135
I'm only here
to see your kind of boxing.

1283
01:52:12,018 --> 01:52:14,866
I've been wanting
to learn from you, Master.

1284
01:52:14,977 --> 01:52:19,606
Thank you for paying me a visit.

1285
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:21,621
I'm so thrilled to see you.

1286
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,712
I'm warning you right now,

1287
01:52:23,818 --> 01:52:27,605
there is no place
for you in America, Bruce Lee.

1288
01:52:27,718 --> 01:52:30,008
You can't be so arrogant.

1289
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,853
Whether I'm arrogant or not,

1290
01:52:31,965 --> 01:52:33,662
we'll find out after the match.

1291
01:52:33,775 --> 01:52:38,368
If you lose the game today,
you have to be my coach,

1292
01:52:38,475 --> 01:52:43,970
and I'll teach you Yong Chun Quan
and some other things.

1293
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:46,441
You teach me?

1294
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:49,364
Only if you beat me
will I accept any of your requests.

1295
01:52:49,475 --> 01:52:52,074
Come on.
- Good. Come on.

1296
01:54:51,664 --> 01:54:53,609
Master, my apologies.

1297
01:55:09,835 --> 01:55:11,568
Mr. Yamamoto.

1298
01:55:14,813 --> 01:55:18,220
You've made your promise,
and I really hope you can keep it, okay?

1299
01:55:18,329 --> 01:55:21,000
I'll visit you in a couple of days
to see how you're feeling.

1300
01:55:32,114 --> 01:55:34,404
Jesse, please put up the sign again.
- Sure.

1301
01:56:21,581 --> 01:56:23,207
Here's $20.

1302
01:56:23,322 --> 01:56:26,313
I'll bring the ice bucket back
a little later.

1303
01:56:32,442 --> 01:56:34,661
Come on, guys.
Let's get ready for class.

1304
01:56:34,775 --> 01:56:37,030
Tell us about your matches.
- Yeah.

1305
01:56:43,756 --> 01:56:45,595
Bruce Lee.

1306
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:04,184
Have some ice.
- Okay.

1307
01:57:15,156 --> 01:57:16,686
I've met a real master.

1308
01:57:22,919 --> 01:57:25,352
You don't have to do that.

1309
01:57:25,461 --> 01:57:27,965
I just wanted to cool you down.

1310
01:57:29,638 --> 01:57:33,603
If you can beat me,
I'll cool down immediately.

1311
01:57:33,711 --> 01:57:36,559
Do you have any idea
how this will finish?

1312
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:40,491
Of course. Only one of us
will walk outta here.

1313
01:57:40,603 --> 01:57:42,585
If that is the case,

1314
01:57:42,692 --> 01:57:45,160
why do you want to act
like a fool right now?

1315
01:57:45,268 --> 01:57:49,683
If I don't accept your challenge,
I'll be the idiot.

1316
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:51,597
Bruce, forget it.

1317
01:57:51,708 --> 01:57:53,476
Tell them to leave.

1318
01:57:56,651 --> 01:57:59,570
Kimura, please take them out.

1319
01:58:05,006 --> 01:58:07,712
Let's go. Everyone. All of you.

1320
01:58:16,877 --> 01:58:19,796
You're a one-armed martial artist.

1321
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:30,327
Your kung fu is really good.
Why don't you compete?

1322
01:59:30,433 --> 01:59:33,769
It's pretentious and makes me sick.

1323
01:59:33,879 --> 01:59:36,134
Cool guy.

1324
02:01:06,722 --> 02:01:08,775
I'm giving you a little lesson.

1325
02:01:10,063 --> 02:01:13,256
No one should ever be that arrogant.

1326
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,110
Hey.

1327
02:02:05,275 --> 02:02:06,805
Bruce!

1328
02:02:09,069 --> 02:02:10,529
Bruce, did he hurt you?

1329
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:17,174
He's smarter than me.

1330
02:02:17,284 --> 02:02:18,982
Master, can you beat him?

1331
02:02:19,094 --> 02:02:21,077
Bruce, what did he say to you?

1332
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:08,759
Yong Chun Quan
has many advantages

1333
02:03:08,875 --> 02:03:10,858
as well as disadvantages.

1334
02:03:10,964 --> 02:03:12,982
I want to integrate the hand techniques

1335
02:03:13,087 --> 02:03:16,600
and footwork of jujitsu
into Yong Chun Quan.

1336
02:03:16,707 --> 02:03:20,873
I will also combine the footwork
of Western boxing with it.

1337
02:03:20,989 --> 02:03:22,971
After this improvement,

1338
02:03:23,078 --> 02:03:27,279
Yong Chun Quan will absorb the essence
of many other boxing techniques

1339
02:03:27,395 --> 02:03:31,881
and will eliminate the complicated
and unpractical stuff.

1340
02:03:47,272 --> 02:03:49,634
A new boxing style. Good paper.

1341
02:03:49,744 --> 02:03:53,565
Professor Klein,
do you see any problems with it?

1342
02:03:54,757 --> 02:03:57,985
I'm really pleased
to see the progress you've made.

1343
02:03:58,098 --> 02:04:01,849
Remember, I told you not long ago,
you should defeat yourself.

1344
02:04:01,963 --> 02:04:04,740
The biggest enemy is... yourself.

1345
02:04:04,852 --> 02:04:07,426
So now I see you have
revised your view on it.

1346
02:04:07,533 --> 02:04:09,646
But, still, there are a lot
of unanswered questions.

1347
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,743
Please, have a seat.

1348
02:04:11,849 --> 02:04:13,759
Go ahead. Sit down.

1349
02:04:13,868 --> 02:04:15,256
Professor Klein,

1350
02:04:15,365 --> 02:04:17,762
I've been troubled by them for a while.

1351
02:04:21,074 --> 02:04:25,145
Oh, Bruce Lee, you are now quite clear
about the innovation of your new style.

1352
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:27,684
You've used the power
your rival attacked you

1353
02:04:27,793 --> 02:04:29,775
to counterattack him.

1354
02:04:29,881 --> 02:04:32,516
As for the boxing,
it is your way of attacking.

1355
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:36,002
As for styles,
there are too many variations, correct?

1356
02:04:36,113 --> 02:04:40,422
Bruce Lee, you must realize that the new
style that must be established...

1357
02:04:40,534 --> 02:04:42,551
Whoa. Hold on.

1358
02:04:42,658 --> 02:04:44,497
On the basis of Chinese philosophy,

1359
02:04:44,607 --> 02:04:46,268
will keep developing.

1360
02:04:46,382 --> 02:04:49,230
The new style created
is based on Chinese kung fu,

1361
02:04:49,341 --> 02:04:51,109
Both the Confucianism and Daoism

1362
02:04:51,221 --> 02:04:53,998
have influenced Chinese kung fu
tremendously.

1363
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:56,887
The Confucianism
values harmony and moderation,

1364
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,857
while the Daoism
focuses on dialectics and perception.

1365
02:05:00,968 --> 02:05:03,080
So, you can learn a lot
from other schools

1366
02:05:03,196 --> 02:05:06,781
and transplant them onto
the tree of Chinese kung fu.

1367
02:05:06,886 --> 02:05:11,160
I think you should aim the core of kung fu
and simplify them.

1368
02:05:13,918 --> 02:05:15,828
I get it. But, Professor...

1369
02:05:15,937 --> 02:05:19,308
It's important for you to always simplify
everything you do, Bruce.

1370
02:05:19,418 --> 02:05:23,098
Simplify? So what should I do
to simplify the theories?

1371
02:05:23,213 --> 02:05:25,231
Now, what I'd like to know is,
what is the simplest issue

1372
02:05:25,336 --> 02:05:26,997
of the kung fu theories?

1373
02:05:27,112 --> 02:05:28,322
Please tell me.

1374
02:05:28,435 --> 02:05:30,417
It should be offense and defense.

1375
02:05:32,125 --> 02:05:33,441
How very smart.

1376
02:05:33,552 --> 02:05:35,629
Please take a look
at this dialectic picture.

1377
02:05:35,745 --> 02:05:37,763
It consists of persuasive colors.

1378
02:05:37,868 --> 02:05:40,407
This is a simple way
to make it easy and clear.

1379
02:05:41,593 --> 02:05:45,236
Professor Klein, so keep it simple then?

1380
02:05:45,353 --> 02:05:47,335
Right. You've got to study

1381
02:05:47,441 --> 02:05:50,777
to keep it simple,
and then you have more freedom.

1382
02:05:50,887 --> 02:05:55,053
I must free myself and be relaxed,
simplifying everything,

1383
02:05:55,169 --> 02:05:56,629
eliminating the unnecessary,

1384
02:05:56,736 --> 02:05:58,789
freeing myself from the shackles
of complication.

1385
02:05:58,895 --> 02:06:01,434
Right you are. You said that perfect.

1386
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:04,174
But when you relax yourself,
you free yourself

1387
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:06,164
and control your own life.

1388
02:06:06,274 --> 02:06:09,122
Whoever can control the initiative
of the transformation...

1389
02:06:09,234 --> 02:06:11,180
he will find himself definitely.

1390
02:06:11,287 --> 02:06:13,055
Thank you, Professor.

1391
02:06:13,167 --> 02:06:15,280
Kung fu is a special skill,

1392
02:06:15,395 --> 02:06:17,163
an exquisite form of art,

1393
02:06:17,275 --> 02:06:19,708
but not a simple physical exercise.

1394
02:06:19,816 --> 02:06:24,302
It is a kind of art that must combine
wisdom and techniques together.

1395
02:06:24,411 --> 02:06:26,357
The principle of kung fu

1396
02:06:26,465 --> 02:06:29,693
is to utilize your body and mind effectively.

1397
02:06:29,807 --> 02:06:34,531
Yin Yang Tai Chi stands as
the highest of achieved states,

1398
02:06:34,646 --> 02:06:37,316
which indicates the essence
of everything in the universe.

1399
02:06:37,431 --> 02:06:39,971
As for kung fu theory,

1400
02:06:40,076 --> 02:06:41,500
Yin Yang Tai Chi simplifies

1401
02:06:41,609 --> 02:06:44,801
the complicated kung fu
theory into two words:

1402
02:06:44,915 --> 02:06:47,277
"Defense" and "offense."

1403
02:06:47,386 --> 02:06:50,484
In order to reach
the highest state of kung fu,

1404
02:06:50,589 --> 02:06:53,616
you must eliminate
all the extraneous elements

1405
02:06:53,722 --> 02:06:58,138
to reach and maintain the essence
of fighting within the shortest time.

1406
02:06:58,248 --> 02:07:02,034
In fact, it's a kind of
one-two punch, if you will,

1407
02:07:02,147 --> 02:07:04,781
that is very practical in combat

1408
02:07:04,897 --> 02:07:07,295
rather than those elaborate slick moves.

1409
02:07:07,403 --> 02:07:11,783
Meaning, it turns the intangible
into something tangible.

1410
02:07:11,895 --> 02:07:14,363
Jeet Kune Do doesn't have
any fixed set form

1411
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:17,045
which, in turn, is the best form.

1412
02:07:17,151 --> 02:07:19,061
It doesn't belong to any schools,

1413
02:07:19,169 --> 02:07:23,205
so it's free to use anything from them
without any limitation and forms.

1414
02:07:23,312 --> 02:07:27,277
It's good at using all skills and techniques
which serve their own purpose.

1415
02:07:27,385 --> 02:07:30,970
Instinctive defense
with well-established offense

1416
02:07:31,076 --> 02:07:34,968
is the most straightforward definition
of Jeet Kune Do.

1417
02:07:47,575 --> 02:07:49,629
How many students do you have now?

1418
02:07:49,734 --> 02:07:51,716
No more than 200,

1419
02:07:51,823 --> 02:07:54,422
with four different training sessions.

1420
02:07:54,538 --> 02:07:57,351
This is the evening class.
They're doing their drills right now.

1421
02:07:57,462 --> 02:08:01,010
Bruce, let's talk about
the American fighting competition.

1422
02:08:01,117 --> 02:08:03,337
I think you should take
some time to recover better.

1423
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:06,892
Don't rush.
- No. I feel fine now.

1424
02:08:07,001 --> 02:08:10,644
Professor, come on.

1425
02:08:10,761 --> 02:08:14,202
Help me analyze. How can I win
the U.S. Championship?

1426
02:08:14,311 --> 02:08:16,186
Bruce, okay.

1427
02:08:16,295 --> 02:08:18,693
I'll give you my opinion then.

1428
02:08:20,298 --> 02:08:21,888
Actually, this time,

1429
02:08:22,004 --> 02:08:24,057
only three of the fighters
will be competitive:

1430
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:28,755
Rolex, you, and Piao Zhengyi.

1431
02:08:28,862 --> 02:08:32,233
And Rolex looks the best here.

1432
02:08:32,343 --> 02:08:34,598
And, Master Lee, you can only win

1433
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:36,788
if you have an exchange,
you see, with Master Piao.

1434
02:08:38,922 --> 02:08:41,106
All right. I may go
see him right away then.

1435
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:47,966
Hey, what's up?

1436
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:50,511
I want to see your master,
Piao Zhengyi.

1437
02:08:50,619 --> 02:08:52,601
My master can't see anyone.

1438
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:58,136
Whether he likes it or not,
I must see him now.

1439
02:09:00,401 --> 02:09:02,940
Master.

1440
02:09:03,047 --> 02:09:06,275
Master Piao, sorry to interrupt you.

1441
02:09:06,388 --> 02:09:10,839
I heard that you have competed
in the U.S. Karate competition,

1442
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:15,187
and you're honored as a genius
of Tae Kwon Do.

1443
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:18,849
But as far as I know,
you're still not able to rival Rolex.

1444
02:09:18,956 --> 02:09:21,983
If you want to defeat Rolex at all,

1445
02:09:22,089 --> 02:09:24,522
I think you and I should try
to have an exchange.

1446
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:27,265
Who are you?

1447
02:09:28,324 --> 02:09:29,474
Bruce Lee.

1448
02:09:29,574 --> 02:09:30,819
Bruce Lee.

1449
02:09:30,931 --> 02:09:33,850
Correct. You heard right. Bruce Lee.

1450
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,535
What qualifications do you have
to walk into my dojo?

1451
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:40,984
Now, you're looking down upon me,
which I understand.

1452
02:09:41,096 --> 02:09:44,253
You are the famous genius
of Tae Kwon Do.

1453
02:09:44,369 --> 02:09:47,811
But I, Bruce Lee... I'm nobody here.

1454
02:09:47,919 --> 02:09:50,138
Let me tell you, if you compete with me,

1455
02:09:50,251 --> 02:09:54,381
I will take you down on the ground
within three rounds.

1456
02:09:54,498 --> 02:09:55,744
I promise you that.

1457
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:54,971
Stop.

1458
02:12:42,637 --> 02:12:44,406
Stop.

1459
02:12:44,517 --> 02:12:47,366
Ready? Continue.

1460
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:11,811
Stop.

1461
02:13:22,601 --> 02:13:24,096
Bruce Lee wins.

1462
02:13:49,511 --> 02:13:54,662
Now, in the final round
of the Karate Competition begins.

1463
02:13:54,767 --> 02:13:57,960
Let's welcome Mr. Bruce Lee
from Oakland

1464
02:13:58,074 --> 02:14:00,649
with a big round of applause.

1465
02:14:07,159 --> 02:14:08,654
Now, presenting the champion

1466
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:11,680
of the last National Karate Competition,

1467
02:14:11,789 --> 02:14:13,700
Mr. Rolex.

1468
02:14:13,809 --> 02:14:16,907
Please give him a round of applause.

1469
02:15:19,498 --> 02:15:20,648
Begin.

1470
02:18:18,012 --> 02:18:19,886
Yes!

1471
02:19:05,564 --> 02:19:08,235
One, two, three.

1472
02:19:08,349 --> 02:19:10,782
Game's over.

1473
02:19:36,894 --> 02:19:40,122
I am Chinese!

1474
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:53,251
I am Chinese!

1475
02:20:15,987 --> 02:20:19,358
Mr. Rolex, will you please tell us
about your feelings about this match?

1476
02:20:19,468 --> 02:20:20,537
Please tell us.

1477
02:20:20,651 --> 02:20:22,835
It's really hurt my whole career.

1478
02:20:22,950 --> 02:20:26,665
I don't understand
how Bruce Lee could strike me.

1479
02:20:26,779 --> 02:20:28,927
What's more, when I hit on his fist,

1480
02:20:29,042 --> 02:20:31,119
my fist turn powerless all of a sudden.

1481
02:20:31,235 --> 02:20:34,190
But I believe he hasn't

1482
02:20:34,298 --> 02:20:37,146
tried hard on his three kicks.
- That was amazing.

1483
02:20:37,257 --> 02:20:39,476
He has amazing power.
- Thank you very much.

1484
02:20:39,589 --> 02:20:41,607
He should be the winner.

1485
02:20:41,713 --> 02:20:43,208
Thank you.

1486
02:20:43,314 --> 02:20:47,385
An amazing scene just took place here
at the National Karate Competition.

1487
02:20:47,491 --> 02:20:49,081
We have never seen anything like it.

1488
02:20:49,197 --> 02:20:55,215
A young man from China
has completely rewritten the way we fight.

1489
02:20:55,324 --> 02:20:57,437
Journalists cannot figure out...

1490
02:20:57,552 --> 02:20:59,629
Okay, that's all for today.

1491
02:20:59,745 --> 02:21:02,284
You may leave now, everyone.

1492
02:21:14,819 --> 02:21:18,748
It's good. It's absolutely amazing.

1493
02:21:18,857 --> 02:21:21,599
It looks like you have some regrets.

1494
02:21:21,712 --> 02:21:24,524
What are you thinking?

1495
02:21:25,819 --> 02:21:28,632
What a pity. I...

1496
02:21:30,379 --> 02:21:32,812
I should've gone to watch him
fight in the stadium.

1497
02:21:32,921 --> 02:21:35,734
We should go visit this
Chinese guy Bruce Lee maybe.

1498
02:21:35,844 --> 02:21:37,719
He's a Chinese hero, in fact.

1499
02:21:40,127 --> 02:21:41,860
We should go visit him.

1500
02:21:41,971 --> 02:21:43,632
Well, Mr. Harrison, I've got an idea.

1501
02:21:43,747 --> 02:21:45,270
Hollywood needs this kind of action hero.

1502
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:46,903
George,

1503
02:21:47,019 --> 02:21:50,046
I have to say you are
a brilliant businessman.

1504
02:21:50,152 --> 02:21:51,505
Yeah? I hope so.

1505
02:22:22,248 --> 02:22:24,158
Bruce Lee. Well, well, well.

1506
02:22:24,267 --> 02:22:26,451
Hey, hello, Mr. Lee.
- Hi. Hello.

1507
02:22:26,565 --> 02:22:28,025
We're here to congratulate you.

1508
02:22:28,131 --> 02:22:29,914
We've been waiting for you for a while.
- What...

1509
02:22:30,014 --> 02:22:31,674
Come on. You've never heard of him before?

1510
02:22:31,787 --> 02:22:32,937
You're kidding me, right?

1511
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:34,737
He's with Robert.

1512
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:37,592
Big Hollywood producer of stars.

1513
02:22:37,705 --> 02:22:40,862
Very important man.
Let's go and talk to him.

1514
02:22:42,021 --> 02:22:43,374
James?

1515
02:22:44,562 --> 02:22:47,233
Sure you should go. Go see him.

1516
02:22:47,348 --> 02:22:50,267
Okay. I'll go.

1517
02:22:53,509 --> 02:22:56,179
It can't be bad that someone
from Hollywood asked to meet Bruce.

1518
02:22:56,294 --> 02:22:58,965
Let's go wait for the good news.

1519
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:02,176
Let me introduce you.
This is George from Hollywood.

1520
02:23:02,282 --> 02:23:05,308
Hello, Mr. Lee.
I've been watching you for a long time.

1521
02:23:05,415 --> 02:23:07,112
What can I do for you
this afternoon?

1522
02:23:07,225 --> 02:23:08,958
Well, but, of course,

1523
02:23:09,069 --> 02:23:10,909
with your specific permission,

1524
02:23:11,019 --> 02:23:13,096
I'd like to make a movie
of your great performance.

1525
02:23:16,241 --> 02:23:17,558
Why?

1526
02:23:17,668 --> 02:23:20,932
I saw you win the championship on TV.

1527
02:23:21,045 --> 02:23:23,099
I admire your
kung fu skills very much.

1528
02:23:23,203 --> 02:23:25,185
Your movements were so fast
in the game,

1529
02:23:25,292 --> 02:23:26,822
I'd like to record it for other players.

1530
02:23:26,928 --> 02:23:30,643
But my real purpose,
to be honest with you,

1531
02:23:30,757 --> 02:23:34,757
is to work together
in some other field someday.

1532
02:23:34,865 --> 02:23:37,464
You mean, shooting movies?

1533
02:23:37,581 --> 02:23:40,085
Yes. Kung fu movies.

1534
02:23:40,191 --> 02:23:43,491
You have a chance
to showcase your work in Hollywood.

1535
02:23:43,603 --> 02:23:46,486
What better way to showcase
your kung fu performance?

1536
02:23:47,606 --> 02:23:49,445
Well, this is not a bad idea.

1537
02:23:49,556 --> 02:23:50,837
You persuaded me.

1538
02:23:50,947 --> 02:23:52,716
Ah, that's great, Mr. Lee.

1539
02:23:52,827 --> 02:23:55,367
Wouldn't you say we have a deal
between us, don't you think?

1540
02:23:55,473 --> 02:23:57,063
All right. I'll listen to you.

1541
02:23:57,179 --> 02:23:58,805
That's great.

1542
02:23:58,919 --> 02:24:00,902
We should have a drink
to celebrate, don't you think?

1543
02:24:01,008 --> 02:24:02,397
Sounds good.
- Let's go.

1544
02:24:38,570 --> 02:24:40,303
That's great.

1545
02:24:40,415 --> 02:24:44,131
Mr. Kato's appearance
definitely gives us a fresh impression.

1546
02:24:44,244 --> 02:24:48,838
Mr. Kato, you're a great warrior
nobody can match.

1547
02:24:48,943 --> 02:24:50,569
Don't you understand?

1548
02:24:50,685 --> 02:24:53,568
Wearing the mask will only
boost your charm as a warrior

1549
02:24:53,678 --> 02:24:56,040
and show a kind of mysterious style.

1550
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:57,882
You may choose whatever you like

1551
02:24:57,995 --> 02:25:01,817
from all these masks
we prepared for you here.

1552
02:25:01,928 --> 02:25:06,344
George, so you're still planning
on using a mask to cover my face?

1553
02:25:06,454 --> 02:25:08,816
Listen, it's not about your face.

1554
02:25:08,926 --> 02:25:11,739
Warriors have been known
to often wear masks.

1555
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:15,150
After putting on the mask,
you will show a special characteristic.

1556
02:25:15,262 --> 02:25:17,730
And so I hope you will wear the mask.
It's really up to you.

1557
02:25:17,838 --> 02:25:20,472
Maybe you'll be amazed
and even like it.

1558
02:25:24,068 --> 02:25:25,599
Mr. Lee,

1559
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:30,887
the masks I've created for you

1560
02:25:30,996 --> 02:25:32,835
are to enhance your mysterious style.

1561
02:25:32,946 --> 02:25:35,236
Okay. I know.

1562
02:25:45,059 --> 02:25:47,386
You look great.

1563
02:25:47,497 --> 02:25:49,442
George, how do I look?

1564
02:25:49,551 --> 02:25:51,105
How do you like it?

1565
02:25:56,513 --> 02:25:59,017
Well, then, this time,
I don't want to argue with you

1566
02:25:59,124 --> 02:26:01,034
because I like this film
and this character.

1567
02:26:01,143 --> 02:26:03,256
But there's one thing you must
listen to me on, George.

1568
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:04,830
Right now.
- What?

1569
02:26:04,937 --> 02:26:07,536
I want to use kung fu.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1570
02:26:07,652 --> 02:26:09,242
You must Jeet Kune Do.

1571
02:26:09,358 --> 02:26:11,897
Use Jeet Kune Do.
- All right.

1572
02:26:12,004 --> 02:26:15,101
Right. Great, then. That's it.
- Thank you.

1573
02:26:15,207 --> 02:26:17,319
Okay, sounds good.

1574
02:26:17,434 --> 02:26:20,247
All right, everybody.
Let's welcome back Bruce Lee.

1575
02:26:20,358 --> 02:26:21,604
We're all ready to go.

1576
02:26:22,761 --> 02:26:24,707
Welcome.

1577
02:26:24,814 --> 02:26:27,627
Come on now, people.
Come on now. Hurry.

1578
02:26:27,739 --> 02:26:29,792
Action!

1579
02:26:29,897 --> 02:26:31,321
I'll ask you the last time.

1580
02:26:31,429 --> 02:26:33,386
Where is the recipe of the Green Hornet?
- Okay, okay.

1581
02:26:33,486 --> 02:26:35,256
I'll never tell you.

1582
02:26:35,362 --> 02:26:37,724
So you're not gonna tell us,
is that right?

1583
02:26:37,834 --> 02:26:39,531
No, no, no.

1584
02:26:39,644 --> 02:26:41,827
Let's kill him another way.

1585
02:26:54,648 --> 02:26:56,308
Okay, cut!

1586
02:26:58,199 --> 02:27:01,534
Hey, Director, why did you stop?

1587
02:27:01,645 --> 02:27:03,105
Why not keep going naturally?

1588
02:27:03,212 --> 02:27:04,952
What the hell's going on here?
I just got started

1589
02:27:05,052 --> 02:27:07,139
on the whole routine with these guys.

1590
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:09,433
Bruce, that was perfect.

1591
02:27:09,547 --> 02:27:12,609
That's exactly what I wanted.
It was just great.

1592
02:27:12,715 --> 02:27:16,537
You were being irresponsible.
How come I haven't even hit them,

1593
02:27:16,649 --> 02:27:18,382
and they've all fallen down?
- Bruce, man...

1594
02:27:18,494 --> 02:27:20,369
Stand up. Stand up.

1595
02:27:25,595 --> 02:27:27,055
Hey, Director Huang.

1596
02:27:27,162 --> 02:27:29,796
Yeah, he's Bruce Lee.
You know, champion

1597
02:27:29,912 --> 02:27:32,796
of the Cha-cha Competition
of Hong Kong High School.

1598
02:27:32,905 --> 02:27:36,062
You know. Yes, that's him.

1599
02:27:36,178 --> 02:27:39,786
He's also the champion of the Hong Kong
High School Boxing Competition.

1600
02:27:39,903 --> 02:27:44,247
He played in several movies
when he was a kid.

1601
02:27:44,359 --> 02:27:48,489
The one in the film
<i>Xi Lu Xiang.</i> That's right.

1602
02:27:48,606 --> 02:27:52,214
You have to keep Bruce Lee here.

1603
02:27:52,331 --> 02:27:55,286
With him, we'll have hope yet.

1604
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:16,373
Hi!

1605
02:28:18,405 --> 02:28:21,182
How are you, Linda?
- Hello, Miss Shen. You came so fast.

1606
02:28:21,294 --> 02:28:22,991
Well, you know, I didn't waste a minute.

1607
02:28:23,104 --> 02:28:26,261
After I hung up the phone with Bruce,
I just rushed right over here.

1608
02:28:26,377 --> 02:28:27,658
Well, Bruce is waiting for you.

1609
02:28:27,768 --> 02:28:29,643
Oh, okay. Great.
- All right. Come on in.

1610
02:28:29,753 --> 02:28:31,557
Thanks.

1611
02:28:31,667 --> 02:28:33,851
Nice place.

1612
02:28:35,393 --> 02:28:37,197
Bruce.

1613
02:28:41,449 --> 02:28:44,511
Hi, Minzhi. Come in. Have a seat.
- Hello, Bruce.

1614
02:28:44,618 --> 02:28:46,243
I've gone through the contract.

1615
02:28:46,358 --> 02:28:47,983
Everything looks good so far.

1616
02:28:48,098 --> 02:28:50,804
Basically, I'll agree to it.

1617
02:28:50,918 --> 02:28:53,624
However, one more thing, though.

1618
02:28:53,738 --> 02:28:57,251
I'd really like
to read the script first, if I could.

1619
02:28:57,358 --> 02:28:59,341
I have brought it with me.

1620
02:28:59,447 --> 02:29:01,393
Here.

1621
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:05,324
Good.

1622
02:29:05,435 --> 02:29:10,028
If everything is okay with it,
I can sign it right away.

1623
02:29:10,134 --> 02:29:12,673
Bruce, to be honest,

1624
02:29:12,779 --> 02:29:14,797
I just talked to Mr. Xu on the phone.

1625
02:29:14,904 --> 02:29:16,637
He actually mentioned to me

1626
02:29:16,748 --> 02:29:19,323
even to postpone for another six months.

1627
02:29:19,428 --> 02:29:21,089
He will work with you on this movie.

1628
02:29:22,666 --> 02:29:24,612
<i>The Big Boss.</i>

1629
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:26,275
What kind of story is it?

1630
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:27,851
Tell me more about it.
- Well,

1631
02:29:27,957 --> 02:29:30,770
<i>The Big Boss</i> screenplay
is actually based on a true story.

1632
02:29:30,882 --> 02:29:33,873
The main character, Zheng Chao-an...

1633
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:35,297
he's from mainland China.

1634
02:29:35,408 --> 02:29:38,743
During the end of the 19th
and early 20th century,

1635
02:29:38,854 --> 02:29:41,702
he was the leader
for Chinese in Thailand.

1636
02:29:41,812 --> 02:29:44,281
Due to his resistance
of the local triad,

1637
02:29:44,388 --> 02:29:46,014
for many Chinese laborers,

1638
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:48,242
he became their hero.

1639
02:29:48,357 --> 02:29:52,214
Those overseas Chinese
called him "the Big Boss."

1640
02:29:52,326 --> 02:29:54,960
There's a wonderful statue
of him in Bangkok.

1641
02:29:55,076 --> 02:29:56,393
Have you seen it?

1642
02:29:56,503 --> 02:29:58,164
Good.

1643
02:29:58,279 --> 02:30:00,605
Someone like me who lives abroad

1644
02:30:00,715 --> 02:30:06,388
understands well how difficult it is
for us Chinese to survive here.

1645
02:30:06,494 --> 02:30:09,722
I can fully understand
the main character's feelings.

1646
02:30:11,228 --> 02:30:13,032
I'm exactly like him.

1647
02:30:13,143 --> 02:30:15,920
Therefore, no one else
could play it better than me.

1648
02:30:16,033 --> 02:30:18,015
I like this kind of story.

1649
02:30:18,121 --> 02:30:20,625
I'm willing to sign your contract.

1650
02:31:07,310 --> 02:31:10,372
Scene 96. Shot 12. Action!

1651
02:31:50,475 --> 02:31:51,650
Play. Play.
- Good! Get him!

1652
02:31:52,982 --> 02:31:55,557
Quiet. Quiet.

1653
02:32:01,129 --> 02:32:02,789
What?

1654
02:32:18,568 --> 02:32:20,063
Good! Good move!

1655
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:27,294
Good. Continue.

1656
02:33:30,385 --> 02:33:32,782
Good!

1657
02:33:32,891 --> 02:33:34,315
Bruce!

1658
02:34:32,244 --> 02:34:33,668
Action.

1659
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:32,005
You know, my opinion,

1660
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:37,331
this script is too unbelievable.

1661
02:35:39,779 --> 02:35:41,132
What?

1662
02:35:43,468 --> 02:35:46,424
Because I can hardly put it down.

1663
02:35:46,532 --> 02:35:49,310
I've read it three times in one sitting.

1664
02:35:50,431 --> 02:35:55,060
Even at midnight, I woke up my wife
and told her that this...

1665
02:35:55,166 --> 02:35:58,952
this is the best script I've ever read
since I started producing films.

1666
02:35:59,065 --> 02:36:01,248
Boss, you scared me.

1667
02:36:01,362 --> 02:36:03,344
I thought you didn't like it.

1668
02:36:03,451 --> 02:36:05,813
I didn't like it? If I didn't like it,

1669
02:36:05,922 --> 02:36:09,020
I'd be the biggest idiot
in the Hong Kong film industry.

1670
02:36:10,170 --> 02:36:13,718
Good. Let's get started.

1671
02:36:13,824 --> 02:36:16,008
You can count on me.

1672
02:36:16,122 --> 02:36:17,581
I'll try my best.

1673
02:36:22,770 --> 02:36:26,070
Ready. Scene 22. Shot 16. Take one.

1674
02:36:26,182 --> 02:36:27,332
Action!

1675
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:38,511
Action!

1676
02:38:19,145 --> 02:38:20,985
Cut!

1677
02:38:21,095 --> 02:38:22,864
It was great! Wonderful!

1678
02:38:22,974 --> 02:38:25,514
Right. Wow. Wow.

1679
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:27,733
Thank you, George.
Thanks so much.

1680
02:38:27,849 --> 02:38:31,220
Darling.
- Bruce, you're fantastic.

1681
02:38:31,329 --> 02:38:34,629
Everyone, great job. Fabulous.

1682
02:38:34,741 --> 02:38:36,580
Director, like us?
- You were great, Bruce.

1683
02:38:36,691 --> 02:38:37,972
Let's...

1684
02:38:38,083 --> 02:38:39,852
Let's take a break.

1685
02:38:46,403 --> 02:38:49,703
Bruce! Bruce!

1686
02:38:49,814 --> 02:38:53,457
Bruce! Somebody get
a doctor or something.

1687
02:39:23,965 --> 02:39:25,662
I reviewed all these reports.

1688
02:39:25,775 --> 02:39:27,436
The problem is...

1689
02:39:27,550 --> 02:39:28,939
Sorry. Doctor?

1690
02:39:32,111 --> 02:39:34,544
Mr. Lee, what's the problem?

1691
02:39:34,651 --> 02:39:36,835
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1692
02:39:36,950 --> 02:39:38,718
I've been in the hospital for a week.

1693
02:39:38,829 --> 02:39:41,499
I've just been wondering how come
there is still no diagnosis yet?

1694
02:39:41,614 --> 02:39:46,932
Mr. Lee, we're studying
your reports right now.

1695
02:39:47,045 --> 02:39:49,786
We're looking very closely at them.

1696
02:39:51,326 --> 02:39:53,581
Have you come to a conclusion?

1697
02:39:53,693 --> 02:39:57,658
The other reports
won't come in till tomorrow.

1698
02:39:57,767 --> 02:40:00,793
We have to wait for all of them
before we can reach any conclusion.

1699
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:03,083
What's your projection?

1700
02:40:08,384 --> 02:40:11,482
Mr. Lee, you're 32, right?

1701
02:40:11,586 --> 02:40:13,699
What do you mean?

1702
02:40:14,998 --> 02:40:20,600
We can hardly believe
that there isn't any fat in your body.

1703
02:40:20,708 --> 02:40:25,752
Your body is just like
a large piece of steel.

1704
02:40:25,859 --> 02:40:28,221
Doctor, whatever it is,

1705
02:40:28,331 --> 02:40:29,791
you should know.

1706
02:40:29,897 --> 02:40:31,392
You can tell me frankly.

1707
02:40:31,498 --> 02:40:34,382
I'll know when I see all the results.

1708
02:40:34,493 --> 02:40:36,783
This isn't guesswork.

1709
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:44,373
Well, I think when Bruce goes back
to the States for the movie premiere,

1710
02:40:44,483 --> 02:40:47,058
it shouldn't be a problem.

1711
02:40:48,312 --> 02:40:50,330
Okay. Okay.

1712
02:40:50,436 --> 02:40:52,419
Bye-bye.

1713
02:40:53,778 --> 02:40:54,988
Come in.

1714
02:40:57,050 --> 02:40:58,854
Hey, Bruce.

1715
02:40:58,965 --> 02:41:00,626
Mr. Xu.

1716
02:41:00,740 --> 02:41:04,217
Bruce, aren't you supposed
to be at the hospital?

1717
02:41:04,326 --> 02:41:05,643
Why did you come here?

1718
02:41:06,832 --> 02:41:10,618
I'm not sick. Why should I have to stay
in the hospital any longer?

1719
02:41:10,731 --> 02:41:14,244
Are you really all right?
- I'm fine. Look at me.

1720
02:41:14,352 --> 02:41:17,829
Nothing's wrong.
- That's great, Bruce.

1721
02:41:17,937 --> 02:41:20,263
Let me tell you, George just called,

1722
02:41:20,374 --> 02:41:24,860
and he said the Hollywood gurus
loved <i>Enter the Dragon</i> after the screening.

1723
02:41:24,969 --> 02:41:27,152
You made it again.
- Yeah.

1724
02:41:27,267 --> 02:41:29,000
You made it again.

1725
02:41:29,112 --> 02:41:31,651
This is exactly
what we expected, right?

1726
02:41:31,757 --> 02:41:34,749
This time, it's even better, you see?

1727
02:41:36,109 --> 02:41:38,091
The Hollywood side

1728
02:41:38,198 --> 02:41:41,841
has just decided to have
the premiere in August, in L.A.

1729
02:41:41,957 --> 02:41:46,158
They invited you to go back
for the premiere.

1730
02:41:46,274 --> 02:41:51,841
I think this is your good chance
to rise as an international superstar,

1731
02:41:51,948 --> 02:41:54,203
which is a big deal.

1732
02:41:54,316 --> 02:42:00,262
And... therefore,
I've accepted for you.

1733
02:42:00,372 --> 02:42:06,533
Well, Mr. Xu, this is my plan
for shooting <i>Game of Death.</i>

1734
02:42:06,638 --> 02:42:09,213
I want you to take a look first.
Tell me what you think.

1735
02:42:09,319 --> 02:42:11,823
What I mean is,
you should take a few months off.

1736
02:42:11,930 --> 02:42:14,292
We'll wait until after.

1737
02:42:14,401 --> 02:42:16,062
And...
- No, no, no, no, no.

1738
02:42:17,186 --> 02:42:18,811
Let's shoot right away.

1739
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,111
Feeling strong enough?
Are you, Bruce?

1740
02:42:24,218 --> 02:42:26,852
If there is no problem, I'd really like

1741
02:42:26,968 --> 02:42:29,781
to start working on it
in three days, if that's okay.

1742
02:42:29,892 --> 02:42:32,219
Are you sure?
You're in good shape?

1743
02:42:32,329 --> 02:42:38,312
Mr. Xu, for this film, I'd like to invite
several world-class martial artists

1744
02:42:38,421 --> 02:42:40,474
and celebrities to join me.

1745
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:43,393
For example, Inosando,

1746
02:42:43,504 --> 02:42:45,308
the " Nunchakus
King of the Philippines."

1747
02:42:45,419 --> 02:42:46,878
He's an amazing martial artist.

1748
02:42:46,985 --> 02:42:52,718
Their participation will surely make
our film more fun to watch.

1749
02:42:53,808 --> 02:42:55,161
Okay.

1750
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:57,905
Bruce, you handle the creative.

1751
02:42:58,021 --> 02:42:59,611
I'm always here for you.

1752
02:42:59,725 --> 02:43:02,194
But you don't look very well.

1753
02:43:02,302 --> 02:43:04,248
Please go take some rest.

1754
02:43:04,356 --> 02:43:08,106
Mr. Xu, I got a lot to do
before shooting <i>Game of Death.</i>

1755
02:43:08,220 --> 02:43:10,166
I gotta go get some work done.

1756
02:43:10,274 --> 02:43:11,591
Thank you.

1757
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:16,602
<i>Game of Death?</i>

1758
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:21,859
Well, what kind of title is this?

1759
02:43:21,971 --> 02:43:24,439
Why? What's the problem?

1760
02:43:26,601 --> 02:43:30,530
Well, based on Chinese tradition,

1761
02:43:30,638 --> 02:43:34,354
it's not very lucky.

1762
02:43:34,467 --> 02:43:37,803
Can we change to another...
- No, we can't.

1763
02:43:37,914 --> 02:43:40,905
Just go with it.

1764
02:43:42,056 --> 02:43:43,896
Good. Push hard.

1765
02:43:45,816 --> 02:43:50,125
Do you know why
we need to practice kung fu?

1766
02:43:50,238 --> 02:43:53,264
Tø beat others?
- Not really.

1767
02:43:53,371 --> 02:43:55,839
Do you know the way of kung fu?
- No.

1768
02:43:55,947 --> 02:43:59,175
But of course.
Well, the question is too deep for you.

1769
02:43:59,288 --> 02:44:02,896
But we martial artists
have a simple goal.

1770
02:44:03,013 --> 02:44:07,143
That is to challenge
our entire body to its limit.

1771
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:08,791
Do you know what that is?

1772
02:44:10,010 --> 02:44:11,993
Don't know?

1773
02:44:12,099 --> 02:44:14,247
Can you kick that leaf?

1774
02:44:14,362 --> 02:44:16,060
Take a look.

1775
02:44:17,217 --> 02:44:19,294
You can't, right?

1776
02:44:19,410 --> 02:44:20,905
Then you wait for a few years.

1777
02:44:21,011 --> 02:44:23,930
You will make it by then.

1778
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:26,437
Son, watch.
Daddy will show you a kick.

1779
02:44:28,843 --> 02:44:30,124
All right. Good.

1780
02:44:34,273 --> 02:44:37,157
Daddy's kicking!
- Oh, God!

1781
02:44:38,315 --> 02:44:39,465
He's kicking!

1782
02:44:39,565 --> 02:44:40,989
He's kicking! Kicking!

1783
02:44:48,651 --> 02:44:51,393
Baby, did he scare you?
- It's okay, darling.

1784
02:44:51,506 --> 02:44:54,389
Don't cry, Shannon. Let's go, Brandon.
- It's okay.

1785
02:44:54,499 --> 02:44:55,887
Come on.
- Hurry. Dinner's ready.

1786
02:44:55,996 --> 02:44:58,500
Dinner's ready.
- Do you know what I cooked for you?

1787
02:44:58,607 --> 02:45:01,907
Foshan pig. It's delicious.

1788
02:46:02,138 --> 02:46:04,772
Bruce, what's wrong?

1789
02:46:04,888 --> 02:46:09,162
We have started <i>Game of Death.</i>

1790
02:46:09,274 --> 02:46:12,016
You know, once we start shooting,

1791
02:46:12,129 --> 02:46:14,633
we can't stop even for a day.

1792
02:46:41,858 --> 02:46:45,086
From now on, every day I go to the set,

1793
02:46:45,199 --> 02:46:47,906
you mark it on the calendar for me.

1794
02:46:48,019 --> 02:46:51,010
When you make it till next month,

1795
02:46:51,118 --> 02:46:53,100
<i>The Game of Death</i> will be wrapped.

1796
02:46:55,051 --> 02:46:56,201
Okay.

1797
02:47:57,852 --> 02:47:59,797
Stop. When I was hitting you,

1798
02:47:59,905 --> 02:48:01,815
I didn't get it,
so you have to keep punching.

1799
02:48:01,925 --> 02:48:03,384
Keep doing what you were doing.

1800
02:48:03,491 --> 02:48:06,754
You must attack just like this.
Let's do it again.

1801
02:48:51,948 --> 02:48:56,434
Bruce Lee, I will watch you fall this time.

1802
02:49:08,867 --> 02:49:12,059
Who is it?
- I want to speak to Bruce Lee.

1803
02:49:14,506 --> 02:49:16,001
Hello? Who is it?

1804
02:49:16,107 --> 02:49:18,611
It's me.

1805
02:49:18,718 --> 02:49:20,901
Bruce Lee,

1806
02:49:21,016 --> 02:49:23,615
you may forget everybody,

1807
02:49:23,731 --> 02:49:25,285
but you'll never forget me.

1808
02:49:25,402 --> 02:49:26,577
Yellow Skin.

1809
02:49:29,301 --> 02:49:31,591
Our business is not done yet.

1810
02:49:31,703 --> 02:49:33,471
What the hell do you want?

1811
02:49:33,583 --> 02:49:35,766
You know what I want.

1812
02:49:37,969 --> 02:49:40,295
Yellow Skin, listen up.

1813
02:49:40,406 --> 02:49:42,768
We don't have any
unfinished business anymore.

1814
02:49:42,878 --> 02:49:45,548
Your Master Wang had apologized to me.

1815
02:49:45,662 --> 02:49:47,323
No!

1816
02:49:47,438 --> 02:49:50,630
Back then, I made a big mistake.

1817
02:49:50,745 --> 02:49:52,026
Tø make it up to you,

1818
02:49:52,137 --> 02:49:53,418
I'd like to challenge you again.

1819
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:55,475
I'll defeat you fairly and openly.

1820
02:49:55,584 --> 02:49:56,734
Otherwise,

1821
02:49:58,681 --> 02:50:02,468
the rest of my life will be meaningless.

1822
02:50:02,580 --> 02:50:04,907
But I don't want to compete with you.

1823
02:50:05,017 --> 02:50:07,000
You're afraid.

1824
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:09,501
I'm not afraid of you.

1825
02:50:09,612 --> 02:50:12,496
I no longer want to prove myself
through competing.

1826
02:50:12,606 --> 02:50:16,915
What I'm doing is to promote
the way of martial arts.

1827
02:50:17,028 --> 02:50:20,399
I don't give a damn about
your way of martial arts.

1828
02:50:20,508 --> 02:50:22,169
My goal is to defeat you.

1829
02:50:22,284 --> 02:50:24,017
Listen up, Bruce Lee.

1830
02:50:24,129 --> 02:50:26,526
This is it.

1831
02:50:26,636 --> 02:50:28,890
I am now formally challenging you.

1832
02:50:29,003 --> 02:50:33,383
I told that I won't challenge anyone,

1833
02:50:33,493 --> 02:50:36,092
nor take a challenge anymore.

1834
02:50:39,132 --> 02:50:42,396
No! Bruce Lee,
you have to accept my challenge!

1835
02:50:42,509 --> 02:50:44,836
I'll never give up if I don't defeat you!

1836
02:50:48,427 --> 02:50:50,789
Bruce Lee, you will not ignore me! No!

1837
02:51:35,701 --> 02:51:38,799
And?
- 14, 15, 16...

1838
02:51:38,904 --> 02:51:42,381
Bruce? Darling?

1839
02:51:43,917 --> 02:51:45,899
Are you all right?

1840
02:51:46,006 --> 02:51:47,845
I'm fine.

1841
02:51:47,955 --> 02:51:49,580
Come.

1842
02:51:49,696 --> 02:51:53,767
Hey, I've fixed some snacks for you.

1843
02:51:53,873 --> 02:51:55,819
Your mom taught me
how to make dim sum.

1844
02:51:55,926 --> 02:51:59,262
And I know how much you love dim sum.

1845
02:51:59,374 --> 02:52:01,664
Come. Sit down.

1846
02:52:01,775 --> 02:52:03,306
You need to take a break.

1847
02:52:03,411 --> 02:52:04,621
Just rest.

1848
02:52:06,127 --> 02:52:08,346
Sweetie, I don't want
to eat anything right now.

1849
02:52:08,459 --> 02:52:12,138
I just want to lie on your lap
quietly for a while.

1850
02:52:14,342 --> 02:52:16,976
My mind has just
been racing recently.

1851
02:52:17,092 --> 02:52:22,896
I just got so much stuff going on
that I just can't relax, you know?

1852
02:52:23,011 --> 02:52:25,966
These days... These days,

1853
02:52:26,074 --> 02:52:28,578
you seem to have changed
into another person,

1854
02:52:28,684 --> 02:52:32,850
and I think Professor Ino was right.

1855
02:52:32,966 --> 02:52:35,114
I think that you're exhausted
to the point

1856
02:52:35,229 --> 02:52:37,412
where you just need to lay and rest.

1857
02:52:38,606 --> 02:52:40,516
Like you are now.

1858
02:52:41,703 --> 02:52:44,623
Quietly, not thinking of anything.

1859
02:52:44,732 --> 02:52:46,785
Bruce, I'll call the hospital tomorrow

1860
02:52:46,891 --> 02:52:48,968
to set up an appointment
for your checkup.

1861
02:52:49,084 --> 02:52:50,543
And if there's still no diagnosis,

1862
02:52:50,651 --> 02:52:53,155
I'll take you to the States
for an even better checkup.

1863
02:52:53,261 --> 02:52:55,860
No, damn it!

1864
02:52:55,977 --> 02:52:57,436
What are you saying?

1865
02:52:57,543 --> 02:52:59,240
You want me to stop the film?

1866
02:52:59,353 --> 02:53:01,750
So many people on the crew
depend on me,

1867
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:04,079
and the boss has thrown
so much money into this,

1868
02:53:04,192 --> 02:53:06,826
but you want me
to moan in the hospital,

1869
02:53:06,942 --> 02:53:10,871
having exams,
even a vacation in the States?

1870
02:53:10,980 --> 02:53:12,678
How the hell could I do that?

1871
02:53:17,107 --> 02:53:18,317
Darling.

1872
02:53:22,294 --> 02:53:23,789
Please don't call the hospital again.

1873
02:53:23,895 --> 02:53:25,556
I don't have any disease.

1874
02:53:27,516 --> 02:53:31,587
If I did,
it'd be nothing but a headache

1875
02:53:31,693 --> 02:53:34,470
caused by exhaustion, right here.

1876
02:53:36,183 --> 02:53:38,961
Bruce, your expectation
is way too high.

1877
02:53:39,073 --> 02:53:41,056
You need to calm down.

1878
02:53:51,744 --> 02:53:53,275
Let me.

1879
02:53:54,356 --> 02:53:55,946
Hello?

1880
02:53:56,061 --> 02:53:58,281
Bruce Lee, either you accept my challenge,

1881
02:53:58,393 --> 02:54:00,791
or you admit you lose in public!

1882
02:54:00,900 --> 02:54:02,846
Listen, you insane, crazy devil,

1883
02:54:02,953 --> 02:54:06,016
Bruce does not accept your challenge.

1884
02:54:06,122 --> 02:54:08,756
This is something between us men.

1885
02:54:08,872 --> 02:54:10,498
Nothing to do with you.

1886
02:54:10,612 --> 02:54:13,769
I'm warning you, now leave us alone.

1887
02:54:18,897 --> 02:54:20,843
Bruce, what are you doing?

1888
02:54:20,951 --> 02:54:23,491
Linda, I cannot allow him
to be so arrogant,

1889
02:54:23,597 --> 02:54:25,128
especially right now.

1890
02:54:27,148 --> 02:54:28,916
I have to keep all my dignity.

1891
02:54:29,028 --> 02:54:30,523
Do you understand
what this means to me?

1892
02:54:30,629 --> 02:54:32,255
Bruce...

1893
02:54:32,369 --> 02:54:34,315
Hold on.

1894
02:54:36,581 --> 02:54:40,581
Okay, I'll accept your challenge.

1895
02:54:40,690 --> 02:54:43,229
Please tell me the date and place.

1896
02:54:43,335 --> 02:54:46,398
Listen carefully.

1897
02:54:46,503 --> 02:54:47,749
In just three days,

1898
02:54:47,860 --> 02:54:53,558
I'll invite all the masters
of Honk Kong martial arts,

1899
02:54:53,674 --> 02:54:56,522
and they will see
how the great Bruce Lee...

1900
02:54:56,633 --> 02:54:59,031
loses under my fists!

1901
02:55:00,497 --> 02:55:01,813
All right, Yellow Skin.

1902
02:55:01,924 --> 02:55:04,321
You'll regret this.

1903
02:55:04,431 --> 02:55:05,535
Let me tell you,

1904
02:55:05,650 --> 02:55:08,047
you don't know me at all,

1905
02:55:08,156 --> 02:55:10,138
nor do you understand me.

1906
02:55:10,244 --> 02:55:12,262
You didn't disappoint me.

1907
02:55:13,412 --> 02:55:14,871
I'm telling you,

1908
02:55:14,979 --> 02:55:16,961
I've never been defeated by anyone,

1909
02:55:17,067 --> 02:55:19,916
much less some loser like you.

1910
02:55:23,089 --> 02:55:28,134
Well, let's meet at the arena.

1911
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:36,666
By then, don't forget to bring
a stretcher for yourself!

1912
02:55:36,770 --> 02:55:39,060
Crazy nut job.

1913
02:56:19,067 --> 02:56:20,692
Bruce Lee!

1914
02:56:22,652 --> 02:56:25,644
We finally meet again.

1915
02:56:28,361 --> 02:56:30,510
Long time no see.

1916
02:56:30,624 --> 02:56:32,772
You still look the same.

1917
02:56:32,886 --> 02:56:36,708
You're still so arrogant.
It seems that you got better in kung fu,

1918
02:56:36,820 --> 02:56:41,794
but I'm not so sure
if you got better ethically.

1919
02:56:41,902 --> 02:56:44,335
I failed to defeat you in the States.

1920
02:56:44,444 --> 02:56:46,497
I've regretted it for many years.

1921
02:56:49,283 --> 02:56:51,716
But today,

1922
02:56:51,824 --> 02:56:53,972
we'll finally decide who the winner is.

1923
02:56:54,087 --> 02:56:56,200
Wait.

1924
02:56:56,315 --> 02:56:59,958
Before we start,
I have a little suggestion.

1925
02:57:00,075 --> 02:57:02,057
We'll compete one round first.

1926
02:57:02,163 --> 02:57:04,347
After the first round,

1927
02:57:04,461 --> 02:57:06,122
if you can't defeat me,

1928
02:57:06,236 --> 02:57:08,491
we'll stop the competition.

1929
02:57:08,604 --> 02:57:10,158
You shut up.

1930
02:57:11,423 --> 02:57:14,021
If you're able,

1931
02:57:14,138 --> 02:57:16,465
let your kung fu speak!

1932
02:57:50,168 --> 02:57:52,672
You've already lost.

1933
02:57:52,779 --> 02:57:55,413
You're doomed to lose this competition.

1934
02:57:55,529 --> 02:57:57,439
You're too eager...

1935
02:57:57,548 --> 02:57:59,387
too eager

1936
02:57:59,498 --> 02:58:00,993
to defeat me.

1937
02:58:01,099 --> 02:58:02,797
You shut up!

1938
02:58:02,909 --> 02:58:04,820
If I were afraid of death,

1939
02:58:04,928 --> 02:58:07,563
I wouldn't have come.

1940
02:58:12,343 --> 02:58:14,811
I'm ready now.

1941
02:58:18,713 --> 02:58:20,588
Let's stop right here.

1942
02:58:22,369 --> 02:58:26,155
It's not a bad thing
to stop at the right time.

1943
02:59:22,662 --> 02:59:24,323
How do you like that?

1944
02:59:26,074 --> 02:59:28,887
For speed, I'm faster.

1945
02:59:28,997 --> 02:59:30,766
For kicking,
I'm tougher than you.

1946
02:59:30,877 --> 02:59:36,646
I've said it long before,
kung fu takes more practicing,

1947
02:59:36,761 --> 02:59:38,600
less yapping.

1948
02:59:38,710 --> 02:59:42,010
Don't instruct me
like a master in front of me!

1949
02:59:42,122 --> 02:59:43,926
Quit your nonsense.

1950
02:59:44,037 --> 02:59:46,054
Just sign it!

1951
02:59:51,834 --> 02:59:53,638
You dare not?

1952
02:59:53,749 --> 02:59:54,899
I will.

1953
03:01:05,808 --> 03:01:09,072
Tøday, you're doomed to die!

1954
03:02:19,365 --> 03:02:21,347
Why don't you say stop?

1955
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:25,868
Stop, stop, stop!

1956
03:02:25,980 --> 03:02:27,368
Stop! Bruce Lee, you win.

1957
03:02:43,176 --> 03:02:47,176
Yellow Skin, didn't you ask me
about my boxing?

1958
03:02:47,284 --> 03:02:50,512
Well, now I'm telling you.
It's a Chinese martial art

1959
03:02:50,626 --> 03:02:52,845
called...

1960
03:02:52,958 --> 03:02:57,861
Jeet Kune Do.

1961
03:05:21,707 --> 03:05:22,882
Bruce.

1962
03:06:00,139 --> 03:06:06,263
Bruce, you can soar now.

1963
03:07:07,743 --> 03:07:10,662
The 32 years of Bruce Lee's life

1964
03:07:10,771 --> 03:07:14,522
is a journey filled
with extraordinary vitality.

1965
03:07:14,636 --> 03:07:18,351
Bruce Lee has opened
two brand-new fields for us.

1966
03:07:18,465 --> 03:07:21,836
He has contributed to the world
his amazing kung fu

1967
03:07:21,946 --> 03:07:24,830
and his unforgettable films.

1968
03:07:24,939 --> 03:07:29,628
He helped the world discover
authentic Chinese kung fu,

1969
03:07:29,744 --> 03:07:33,459
and Chinese kung fu
has also dazzled the world

1970
03:07:33,573 --> 03:07:36,006
through Bruce Lee's achievement.

1971
03:07:36,114 --> 03:07:38,167
Chinese kung fu movies

1972
03:07:38,273 --> 03:07:40,706
have opened a new and fresh chapter

1973
03:07:40,814 --> 03:07:43,449
because of Bruce Lee.

1974
03:07:43,564 --> 03:07:46,271
We believe, deep in our hearts,

1975
03:07:46,383 --> 03:07:49,896
that the spirit
is the core of a human being.

1976
03:07:50,004 --> 03:07:52,472
The day of death is also the moment

1977
03:07:52,581 --> 03:07:54,314
of coming back to life,

1978
03:07:54,425 --> 03:07:57,273
as the spirit never dies.

1979
03:07:57,384 --> 03:07:59,639
May God bless Bruce Lee

1980
03:07:59,751 --> 03:08:02,350
and accept his soul.

1981
03:08:02,467 --> 03:08:04,271
Amen.

1982
03:08:18,898 --> 03:08:20,844
Don't wake him.

1983
