The day your father died

said the car was mine.

The sheriff, he blew up the cabin.

You have to believe that.

736
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:57,925
It's just that I...

737
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,883
What was that thing your
mother said about the morning?

738
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,220
- Good things always come
to you in the mornings.

739
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,860
- That's right.

740
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,540
And tomorrow morning will
be a spectacular sunrise.

741
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:21,859
[serene music]

742
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:44,062
[mysterious music]

743
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:40,719
- Mr. Quintana.

744
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,360
- Wade, isn't it?

745
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,160
- That's right, Sheriff Rawley Wade.

746
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,748
- What brings you out here, Wade?

747
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,950
Can I get you a drink?

748
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,150
- No thanks.

749
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,020
Just stopped in to see if Rod
Major still worked for you.

750
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,293
- Oh hell no.

751
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,940
Got rid of him a while ago.

752
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,340
Why, is he in trouble?

753
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,293
- I think he is.

754
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,190
You know his brother Rupert?

755
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,670
- I do.

756
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,920
I know the whole family.

757
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,330
Let me tell you something, Sheriff.

758
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:16,210
You get a good solid mining family

759
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,540
and they'll give you five
generations, maybe more

760
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,630
and these generations, the miners,

761
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,840
get better and better.

762
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,440
It's genetics.

763
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,643
Hell, everything's genetics.

764
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:32,528
But the family structure
will build a foundation

765
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,010
of tradition.

766
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,300
Now we got our own econo system here

767
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,210
but when the foundation crumbles,

768
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,910
well then you get your ghost town.

769
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,800
And I believe that about mining.

770
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,230
My father believed it and
his father before him.

771
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,520
You get a split in the family structure

772
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,990
and the only way to handle
it is to nip it in the bud.

773
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,040
You know what I mean?

774
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,143
- Sure.

775
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,600
What kind of trouble is Rod in?

776
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,653
- Geez, he's let that mess fry his brains.

777
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,010
That kid had a lot of
potential a few years back.

778
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,320
I might have stood up for him.

779
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,229
Ever since his dad died,

780
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:17,582
who I might say comes from
a line of the best miners

781
00:57:17,582 --> 00:57:20,300
that ever came out of Darwin, Nevada.

782
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,393
God rest his soul.

783
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,660
I'll tell you, Rupert,
he has got a whole...

784
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,153
Any kind of virtue that kid has left.

785
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,920
- I know all about Rupert.

786
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,370
Just wanted to come by and
see how far down the road

787
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:39,203
Rod was.

788
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,440
Well listen, Mr. Quintana,
I appreciate your time.

789
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,323
Thanks.

790
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,089
- Hey.

791
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,010
Sheriff, I've been kind of,

792
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,210
you know speaking of new stops...

793
00:57:58,053 --> 00:58:00,470
Say, on another note
you haven't seen the new

794
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,267
magnesium bits, have you?

795
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:04,940
One with the nine nubs instead of eight?

796
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,009
Drill the hell out of a rock.

797
00:58:07,009 --> 00:58:08,939
Wanna take a look at it?

798
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:09,772
- No.

799
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:22,043

[knocking on door]

802
00:59:10,197 --> 00:59:11,210
- Hi Sheriff.

803
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,290
- Hello Mark.

804
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,593
I didn't think you were home.

805
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,910
I'm just up here asking
some of the residents

806
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,660
if they've heard or
seen anything suspicious

807
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,423
during the last couple of weeks,

808
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,810
around the time the Smiths were killed.

809
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,217
- Uh, I, sorry.

810
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,860
I didn't notice anything.

811
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,350
- You sure?

812
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,010
Nothing peculiar or strange?

813
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:34,910
- Not a thing, no.

814
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:39,030
- If you think of anything
will you give me a call?

815
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,510
- Sure, yeah.

816
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,343
- Appreciate it.

817
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,613
- Uh, Sheriff.

818
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,563
- Yes Mark?

819
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:56,923
- You did a real nice job on the ceremony.

820
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,807
- Thank you, Mark.

[knocking on door]

828
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,470
- Joseph.

829
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:07,390
Morning.

830
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,223
- Hi, Richard.

831
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,366
I hope I'm not bothering you?

832
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,166
- No, no, no come on in, come on in.

833
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,820
Go on, please have a seat.

834
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,340
- Thank you Richard.

835
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,400
New curtains?

836
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,860
- Jenny made them.

837
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,278
Honey, Joseph's here.

838
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:25,700
- [Jenny] Okay, I'll be right down.

839
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,150
- Get you something to drink?

840
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,653
- Yes please.

841
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,592
- [Richard] How about lemonade?

842
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:32,442
- Sounds perfect.

843
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,100
- Jenny's scared out of her mind.

844
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,920
You know our hardware
store's completely sold out

845
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,150
of deadbolts.

846
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,983
- Really?

847
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,060
- I just can't believe this
whole business about the Smiths.

848
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,410
- Terrible thing, isn't it?

849
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,880
- [Richard] Got any idea
who might have done it?

850
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,090
- No.

851
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:55,923
- You don't?

852
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,903
- Not yet anyway.

853
01:01:59,378 --> 01:02:00,211
- Hi Joseph.
- Hi Jenny.

854
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:02,270
- Honey, Joseph says they have no idea

855
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:03,498
who the killer is.

856
01:02:03,498 --> 01:02:04,504
- What?

857
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:05,804
- Richard, I said not yet.

858
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,233
Jenny, we're gonna catch this guy.

859
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,660
- Like cash for that?

860
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,340
- Just give me some quarters.

861
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,383
Thanks a lot.

862
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:31,086
What are the best machines to play?

863
01:02:31,086 --> 01:02:33,393
- You like to play reels,
you like to play video poker?

864
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,550
- How about reels?

865
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,063
- Try those by the window over there.

866
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:40,898

Darlene, let's flow the scotch.

Hey Bill, how you doing?

876
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:10,744
- [Bill] All right partner, how you doing?

877
01:04:10,744 --> 01:04:12,310
- I live and breathe.

878
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,129
I'm rolling today, darling.

879
01:04:15,135 --> 01:04:16,650
And you ought to be kissing up.

you know where to find me.

882

You be sweet.

You're quite the cowboy.

895
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,391
- Yeah?

896
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,680
You're a few hundred miles
from Hollywood, partner.

897
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,233
- Oh that's such a shame.

898
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,643
Then perhaps you can show
me how to bet for ranch.

Oh you like that, do you?

You like that?

I can be very generous to
the right kind of cowboy.

Make it strong.

904
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:22,120
So, how do you partner?

905
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,953
- Good.

01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,113
I think my luck is changing.

907

01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,390
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

920
01:07:40,326 --> 01:07:41,159
- No.

921
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:48,067
[slow music]

922
01:07:48,067 --> 01:07:48,900
Not if you're nice to me.

923
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,723
- Don't do it, Leonard.

924
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,989
[dramatic music]

925
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:43,801

[slow music]

927
01:08:56,242 --> 01:08:57,992
- My God, quick draw.

928
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,850
He was trying to kill me.

929
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:04,080
You're very good with a gun.

930
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,930
- What did he tell you in the casino?

931
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,700
- I don't know so much cowboy stuff.

932
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,013
Stagecoach robbery.

933
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,940
- Stagecoach?

934
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,920
- Yes, I think that's right.

935
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,970
Poor little lad.

936
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,583
He was so full of gusto.

937
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,013
Killing, bank robbing,

938
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,663
meta something.

939
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,953
Cute like a little
talkative Montgomery Cliff.

940
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,760
- Is that all you can remember?

941
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
- I'm afraid my attention was elsewhere.

942
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,553
Where are you staying?

943
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,630
- No, that's my question to you.

944
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,920
- Excuse me, excuse me.

945
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,210
My name is Klaus.

946
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,780
I stay at Independence, California,

947
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,923
just down the highway.

948
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,500
It's very nice there.

949
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,333
- Independence?

950
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,433
Okay, Klaus.

951
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:02,480
Make sure you don't venture
too far up the highway 385.

952
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,630
There's a lot of degenerates that hang out

953
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:04,940
in these mighty town casinos.

954
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,250
It can be very dangerous.

955
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,083
- Don't worry.

956
01:10:08,173 --> 01:10:09,150
I'll be careful.

957
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,327
- Very dangerous.

958
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,481
- Sheriff, when I was
driving most truck drivers

959
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:31,110
was good people.

960
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:32,530
Broke down out there, you could count on

961
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,270
a truck driver to help you out.

962
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,240
Road etiquette, that's what it was.

963
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,430
Nowadays there's some
pretty bad people out there.

964
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,930
Anyway, here's what you're looking for.

965
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,743
Stagecoach Line, this
is your guy, Jim Broody.

966
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,860
Keeps a damn regular schedule, Sheriff.

967
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,390
Looks like a circular route.

968
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,223
Strange.

969
01:10:50,223 --> 01:10:51,773
- How's that?

970
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:54,480
- I mean the shortest distance
being a straight line,

971
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,740
guy making a regular run,
making a regular drop,

972
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,350
why wouldn't he go back
the same way he came?

973
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,063
- Maybe he's taking the scenic route.

974
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,553
Thanks Dan.

975
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:04,730
- You bet.

976
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,710
Listen Sheriff, you just let
me know what you're looking for

977
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,803
I'll be more than happy
to help you find it.

[upbeat country music]

979
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,360
- How we doing Wayne?

980
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,320
- Well, I gotta tell you Joseph.

981
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,613
It's not going too good.

982
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,290
I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep

983
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,847
since the Smiths were killed.

984
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,910
And Geraldine's got me
checking the windows

985
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,430
every half hour.

986
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,263
- Yeah, we've been going through

987
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:30,240
exactly the same thing, Joseph.

988
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,480
In fact after you left this morning,

989
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,930
Jenny and I were talking.

990
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,500
We think we might rent a room here in town

991
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,200
until this whole thing blows over.

992
01:11:37,048 --> 01:11:39,570
I mean that's why we moved
up here in the first place,

993
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,180
to get away from this sort of stuff.

994
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,780
- Listen folks, we're right
on top of this situation.

995
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,430
All you gotta do is take
a few extra precautions.

996
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,030
Keep your doors locked,
keep your eyes open

997
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,020
and we'll all get through this together.

998
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,000
- Joe, I gotta tell you.

999
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,530
The people at the Funnel
Ranch are really concerned.

1000
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,157
- I'm aware of that Rusty.

1001
01:11:56,157 --> 01:11:58,400
- We're not trying to give
you a hard time, Joseph.

1002
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,830
We're just rattled.

1003
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,630
- Joe, do you think we need to bring in

1004
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,590
some outside help?

1005
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,973
- Joe doesn't need any
outside help, Wayne.

1006
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,770
We can handle everything here just fine.

1007

if you need our help.

01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,880
- You're not gonna get between
me and Rupert ever again.

1101
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,733
No one will.

1102
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,590
I'd rather die than be without him.

1103
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:03,542
- Rawley, shit!

Violet, Violet let's go.

1107
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:16,408
I'm here for you baby, come on.

1108
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,500

It's just you and me now baby.

1112
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:26,211
I love you.

1113
01:20:26,211 --> 01:20:27,701

1117
01:21:56,748 --> 01:21:57,748
- All right!

1118
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:02,036
I'm coming home baby.

[upbeat music]

1120
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:18,437
I'm home!

1121
01:22:22,766 --> 01:22:24,766
Hey, where is everybody?

1122
01:22:27,453 --> 01:22:28,286
Rod?

1123
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:31,066
Rod?

1124
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:33,649
Where is your sexy fucking ass?

1125
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,759
Hey, I'm home baby.

1126
01:22:36,759 --> 01:22:37,592
Rod?

1127
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:40,533
Hey.

1128
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:41,366
Vi?

1129
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:23,260
- Not gonna get between
me and Rupert ever again!

1130
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,267
I'd rather die than be without him.

[gun firing]

1132
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,380
- [Sheriff] All right, I'm letting you go.

1133
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,741
- Yes sir.

1134
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:33,845
- [Sheriff] You're headed
in the right direction.

1135
01:23:33,845 --> 01:23:35,485
- [Rod] Help me, help me Violet.

1136

[gun firing]

1137
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,920

[gun firing]

1140
01:23:40,334 --> 01:23:41,339

[slow music]

1143
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,372
- What is it?

1144
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:30,930
- What do you say you and I take the rest

1145
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:31,763
of the day off?

1146
01:24:33,132 --> 01:24:33,965
- Okay.

1147
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:42,190
- Hey son.
- Hey dad.

1148
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:43,793
We're gonna take a ride up to Yosemite.

1149
01:24:43,793 --> 01:24:44,626
- Sounds great.

1150
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:45,690
But you've got a telephone call.

1151
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,590
Mark Bradley wants to talk to you.

1152
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:48,423
- Mark Bradley?

1153
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,103
- Line two.

1154
01:24:57,352 --> 01:24:58,357
- Hello?

1155
01:24:58,357 --> 01:24:59,190
- [Mark] Hello?

1156
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,720
- Yeah Mark?

1157
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,070
- Anyone else on the phone?

1158
01:25:04,115 --> 01:25:05,213
Doesn't matter.

1159
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,280
Seems like I can't...

1160
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,400
Clear right now.

1161
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,233
Rawley?

1162
01:25:14,135 --> 01:25:15,413
I had to call you.

1163
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:19,657
I just needed to talk to someone.

1164
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:22,500
What happened to the Smiths.

1165
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,413
That was wrong.

1166
01:25:25,159 --> 01:25:25,992
They were a good family.

1167
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:27,470
That shouldn't have happened.

1168
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:28,970
- No, Mark, it shouldn't have.

1169
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,933
- Rawley, people are gonna be in trouble.

1170
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,910
- What do you mean?

1171
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:37,423
Mark?

1172
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,060
What do you mean people
are gonna be in trouble?

1173
01:25:42,323 --> 01:25:44,550
- I can't hurt myself Rawley.

1174
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:46,230
I'm sorry I can't.

1175
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,290
- Mark, what's going on up there?

1176
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,730
Do you want me to come up?

1177
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:52,960
- It shouldn't have happened that way.

1178
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,470
The Smiths were so good.

1179
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:00,972
All I wanted to do was hold them.

1180
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:03,203
I wanted to hold them.

1181
01:26:03,203 --> 01:26:05,263
Just to know what it was like,

1182
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:06,513
but I couldn't.

1183
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:13,289
I'm so, so...

1184
01:26:21,363 --> 01:26:22,353
I have no family.

1185
01:26:25,088 --> 01:26:26,323
Rawley,

1186
01:26:29,141 --> 01:26:31,560
I killed them, I killed
them, I killed them.

1187
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,060
- Mark, you killed the Smiths?

1188
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,810
- Yes I did, they're gone.

1189
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:39,893
They're gone.

1190
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,687
And I don't want it to happen again.

1191
01:26:45,124 --> 01:26:47,291
You've gotta come up here.

1192
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,673
- Mark?

1193
01:26:52,508 --> 01:26:55,425
[mysterious music]

1194
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:17,656
Mark!

[screaming]

1198
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:41,080
- I just don't get it Rawley.

1199
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,230
If Mark killed the Smiths

1200
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,400
then who slashed his throat?

1201
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,787
[phone ringing]

1202
01:29:47,787 --> 01:29:49,043
Hello?

1203
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,700
Yeah, he's here, hold on a second.

1204
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,983
Rawley, it's your dad.

1205
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,533
- Yeah dad?

1206
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:06,141
What?

1207
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:10,160
- It's Richard Philmore.

1208
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,566
His throat's been cut.

1209
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:13,572
- [Girl] If Mark killed the Smiths,

1210
01:30:13,572 --> 01:30:15,384
who slashed his throat?

1211
01:30:15,384 --> 01:30:17,281
- [Joseph] It's Richard Philmore.

1212
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:18,490
- That's why we moved up
here in the first place.

1213
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:20,140
Get away from this sort of stuff.

1214
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,772
- [Rawley] Mark, you killed the Smiths?

1215
01:30:23,772 --> 01:30:25,855
- [Mark] I had no family.

1216

1217

[crickets chirping]

1222
01:33:14,367 --> 01:33:15,617
- Thanks Billy.

1223
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:26,319
[suspenseful music]

1224
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,723
How's she doing?

1225
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,600
- She's in pretty bad shape.

1226
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,150
What happened to you?

1227
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:58,180
- I killed Rupert Major.

1228
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,340
- Rupert Major?

1229
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,440
- Yeah, he jumped me with a hunting knife.

1230
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,520
No dad, it's not Rupert.

1231
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,513
- For crying out loud, who is it?

1232
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:10,543
- Wait a minute.

1233
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:27,710
Take a look at this dad.

1234
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:30,910
I found that in Mark Radley's cabin.

1235
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:33,082
- My God.

1236
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:40,670
Who would wanna bring this back to life?

1237
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,480
- [Rawley] I gotta go.

1238
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,313
- Rawley.

1239
01:34:54,506 --> 01:34:56,877
- I'll call you later.

1240
01:34:56,877 --> 01:34:59,794
[mysterious music]

1241
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:15,301
- Sheriff.

1242
01:36:21,987 --> 01:36:23,940
[gun firing]

1243
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:26,931
- My God, he's trying to kill me.

1244
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:28,941
I knew you'd come.

1245
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:30,108
I'll show you.

1246
01:36:32,866 --> 01:36:34,370
You see I have you right here.

1247
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:37,097
Next to little Montgomery
Clifton like river.

1248
01:36:38,267 --> 01:36:40,843
And I loved you in Hondo, so tall.

1249
01:36:43,185 --> 01:36:44,435
I love America.

1250
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,037
Klaus says,

1251
01:36:50,201 --> 01:36:55,201
what makes a Charlie Manson forever!

1252
01:37:11,053 --> 01:37:12,720
- Charlie Manson.

1253
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,642
I can't believe he has a website.

1254
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,773
That photograph of Charlie
in the same cell in 1969.

1255
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,813
It was August '69 the day
we brought him in here.

1256
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,760
Evil, pure evil.

1257
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:36,180
My God Rawley, it's taken me 29 years

1258
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,830
to get this thing out of my life.

1259
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,023
Never thought I'd see
anything like this again.

1260
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,850
World's getting smaller, son.

1261
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,470
No matter how far we are from everything,

1262
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,873
this highway brings it all right to us.

1263
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:01,710
Where you going son?

1264
01:38:05,228 --> 01:38:06,278
- I'm going home dad.

1265
01:38:08,956 --> 01:38:12,039
[slow, gentle music]

1266
01:39:48,628 --> 01:39:51,211
[bluesy music]

1267
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:20,620
- [Klaus] I like cowboys.

1268
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:22,620
You're quite the cowboy.
