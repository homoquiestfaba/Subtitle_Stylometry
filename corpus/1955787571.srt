00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,090
♪ Oh, honey ♪

3
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,370
A confession.

4
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,310
Is that what they call it?

5
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,900
Billy Lyons was thrown in jail
for three days

6
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,300
without cause.

7
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,110
In the case of Inez Washington
v. the CR&L Bus Company,

8
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,980
gentlemen, I have reviewed
all the papers and briefs in my chambers

9
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,110
and I am prepared to rule.

10
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,410
The court finds that
service of the complaint

11
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,380
was in fact made at
the wrong address,

12
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,620
as Attorney Friedman has argued.

13
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,620
Therefore, the defendant's
motion to dismiss

14
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,990
is granted.

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,420
Thank you, Your Honor.

16
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,390
Great work, Friedman.

17
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,800
And to get their confession,

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Special Agent Cheatwood,

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,770
sent by the governor himself,

20
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,270
took this club...

21
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,510
his "nigger beater,"
he called it.

22
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,370
He tied Billy Lyons
to a chair...

23
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,250
and he pounded Billy Lyons
in the head with it.

24
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,750
And still Billy Lyons insisted

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,750
he had not committed
these murders.

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,650
We had this one
pegged as a loser.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,960
You've got a real knack
for spotting technicalities.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Thank you,
Mr. Sprague.

29
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,930
I'll be sending some more files your way,
if you've got the time.

30
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,370
I will make the time.
Good.

31
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,270
They forced him into their car

32
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,570
and hauled him off
to the murder scene.

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,210
The bodies had been burned
and were decomposing.

34
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,810
They took some of the bones
of these dead bodies,

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,490
put them in a pan and placed them
in Billy Lyons' hands.

36
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,320
They admitted this.

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,990
Delirious
with exhaustion and pain,

38
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,890
Billy Lyons confessed to a crime
he did not commit.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,630
And it is based upon
that confession alone

40
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,470
that they now seek to hang
Billy Lyons by the neck...

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,970
until he is dead.

42
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,410
You'll get them the next time, baby.
There may not be a next time.

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,910
We needed this one.
All right.

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,810
When you coming home?
I'll be on the next train to Knoxville.

45
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,320
I should be home
by midday Wednesday.

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,650
Okay. Be safe. I love you.
I love you too.

47
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Bye, baby.
See you soon.

48
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,630
Hey, boy.

49
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,140
Boy, what do you think
you're doing here?

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,750
What you gonna do, nigger?

51
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,620
All aboard.

52
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,820
I'll see you boys another time.

53
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,160
That son of a bitch.
Let's go scare him.

54
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,930
Shoot him.

55
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,060
NAACP.

56
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,320
Please hold.

57
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,730
Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
Good morning.

58
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,630
Welcome back.
Thank you.

59
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,770
Thurgood,
you're going to Bridgeport.

60
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,310
What? Now?

61
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,310
No, I swore to Buster
I would...

62
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,180
How many Thurgoods are there?
Five or 10? There's only one.

63
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,910
And that one is gonna get his ass
on the train tomorrow.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,250
Why?
Why?

65
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,850
"Nightmare in Greenwich."
That's why, Thurgood.

66
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,990
"Wife Attacked by Negro Driver."
That's why, Thurgood.

67
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,860
How about,
"Fear Grips Connecticut"?

68
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,530
What's the reaction?
Fear.

69
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,830
Getting calls from all over the country.
Negroes getting fired.

70
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,330
White families afraid
to have us in their home.

71
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,800
If we can't work as domestics,
Negro families are going to starve.

72
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,210
And this is a hell of a time
to lose half of our staff.

73
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,910
It's got everything, doesn't it?

74
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,680
"Eleanor Strubing,

75
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,880
fair-haired
Greenwich socialite,

76
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,220
was the victim of a beastly attack
in her own bedroom."

77
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,860
Yes, and the boy that they're holding
is straight out of Native Son.

78
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,790
Look at that.

79
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,230
Wow.

80
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,030
"Joseph Spell.

81
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,470
Uneducated Negro servant
with a criminal past."

82
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,640
A fable that the New York City press
is gonna feed on to the last morsel.

83
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,510
Yeah. They're starving for this one.
So are we.

84
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,110
We win this thing, our big donors
are coming right back, Thurgood.

85
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,820
There's only 13 million Negroes
depending on you.

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Irwin said
I would find you here.

87
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,570
What?

88
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,010
Your brother said I would find you here.
You know, swimming.

89
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,540
Nice swimsuit.

90
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,710
Who the hell are you?
Tad Lancaster.

91
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
Bridgeport High.
Remember?

92
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,720
Trombone?
Yeah!

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,790
Still blowin' it too, man.
What are you doing here, Tad?

94
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,930
Oh, I am, uh, working
with the Bridgeport NAACP.

95
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,300
Actually, I am the Bridgeport NAACP,
and I need a little favor.

96
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,230
Do you know that Spell case?

97
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,100
The guy who attacked the
girl from Greenwich? Yeah.

98
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,070
Now, National is sending a lawyer from
the city to handle his defense,

99
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,540
and we need a local guy
to get him admitted.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,950
Uh, sorry, no.
I'm not gonna do that.

101
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,620
- There's nothing else required.
- I'm not interested.

102
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Think about the publicity.
That's exactly what I'm thinking of.

103
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,220
- Your brother seems to think...
- My brother is an absolute idiot.

104
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,290
Listen, Tad, thank you so much
for thinking of me.

105
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Honestly, I'm grateful.

106
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,830
But I don't handle
criminal cases. Okay?

107
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,200
Find someone who wants
that kind of attention.

108
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,870
Irwin already filed the papers
with the court.

109
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,310
He did what?

110
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,780
...scattered
over many parts of the country.

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,580
Nazi aircraft were reported over the
south coast, the midlands... Paper, please.

112
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,490
As well as over the London area.

113
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,620
Thurgood Marshall.

114
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,120
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.

115
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,290
Sam Friedman.
Um, Friedman and Friedman.

116
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,760
Good to meet you, Sam.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Give me a hand with these, would you?
Sure.

118
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,630
What have you got in here?
Cement?

119
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
Guns.

120
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,640
Books, Mr. Friedman.

121
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,010
My law library.

122
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,010
It goes where I go.

123
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,510
Look, I told Tad Lancaster
I'll get you admitted, as a favor.

124
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,820
But I can't get involved with a
case like this. Yeah? Why not?

125
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,550
Well, I do insurance defense.
You know, accident cases.

126
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
I've got a reputation
to think of.

127
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,720
Ah.

128
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,390
That must be difficult.
What?

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,960
Having a reputation to think of.

130
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,300
You meet our client yet?
Your client. And no, I was waiting...

131
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, come on then.
Let's get to it.

132
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,810
Got another one coming in.
Okay.

133
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,880
University of Maryland
Law School.

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,750
Was walking distance from home.

135
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,480
But they didn't accept colored,
so I had to go to Howard.

136
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,520
An hour and a half
each way by bus,

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,820
and well-known
as a school for failures.

138
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,690
That's too bad.

139
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,230
No. No, it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

140
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,530
They'd just brought in a new dean,
Charles Hamilton Houston.

141
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,730
Turned that place around,
taught me everything I know,

142
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,070
including how to sue
the University of Maryland.

143
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,110
You sued them?

144
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,580
You bet your ass I did.
Soon as I passed the bar.

145
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,110
And?

146
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,980
Supreme Court ordered the bastards
to integrate.

147
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,720
You argued in the United States
Supreme Court?

148
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,630
What?

149
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,990
No, the Maryland Supreme Court.

150
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,280
I didn't argue in front
of the US Supreme Court until last year.

151
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Your boy is ready for you.

152
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,150
Spell.
Lawyer's here to see you.

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,940
Mr. Spell, I'm Thurgood Marshall
with the NAACP.

154
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,840
You heard of us?

155
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,950
- You a lawyer?
- I am.

156
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,450
This is Sam Friedman.
He's a lawyer too.

157
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,690
You can go.
Got no money for lawyers.

158
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,660
Anybody ask you for money?

159
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,160
Did you rape that woman, Joseph?

160
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,790
No.

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,360
Why does she say you did?
I don't know.

162
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,530
She says you raped her
and tried to kill her.

163
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
She's lying.

164
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,540
I was up in White Plains,
at a club.

165
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,340
Come on, Joseph.
All night long?

166
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,040
No, not all night.

167
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,540
I was at the house but couldn't sleep,
so I went to play cards.

168
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,550
Got back
maybe 6:00, 6:30.

169
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,780
Anybody see you at the club?

170
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,850
Yeah, but I don't know
their names or nothin'.

171
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,290
For an alibi defense,
you need witnesses, Joseph.

172
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,960
Otherwise it's her word
against yours.

173
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,430
And who do you think
they're gonna believe?

174
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,130
There was a cop.

175
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,840
A cop? Stopped me in Port Chester
on the way to the club.

176
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,540
Looked at my license, then let me go.
What time was that?

177
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,110
I don't know.
Maybe 3:00 in the morning.

178
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,980
I'm telling you this up front.

179
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,420
The NAACP,
we're not like most lawyers.

180
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,490
We only represent
innocent people,

181
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,490
people accused
because of their race.

182
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,960
That's our mission.
You understand?

183
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,730
So I need to know this...
Look at me now.

184
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Did you do
what they said you did?

185
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,470
I never touched that woman.

186
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,440
Okay, Joseph.

187
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
You got lawyers now.

188
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,060
Go ahead.
Change the station.

189
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,200
What do you know
about the prosecutor?

190
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Lorin Willis.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,800
Graduated Yale
the day he was born.

192
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Unless you came over on the Mayflower,
you're nothing to him.

193
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,410
They're grooming him
to be senator, I hear.

194
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,310
What do you know about the judge?
Judge Foster?

195
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,180
Former law partner
of Willis's father.

196
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,390
I'll move
your admission Monday morning, and then...

197
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,260
Back to fighting off
those insurance claims.

198
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,030
Yeah, I know.

199
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,850
Ah. So you like
Langston Hughes, huh?

200
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,580
Of course.
Don't you?

201
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,450
I don't give a damn
about no poetry.

202
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,020
Come on.

203
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,830
I actually went to school
with Langston.

204
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,960
I just wish he'd do something
more worthwhile with his time.

205
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,170
Another bourbon, Mr. Marshall?
Sure.

206
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,970
You know, Tad's got a law degree too.
From Fordham.

207
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,110
You told me you were a driver.
Yep.

208
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,980
The state of Connecticut decided to
not allow me a license to practice law.

209
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,180
They were generous enough
to give me a driver's license, however.

210
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,820
I see.

211
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,950
What about you, Irene?

212
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,820
What are you gonna be when you grow up?
A nurse like your mother?

213
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,390
No.
A lawyer then?

214
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,860
No.
A fighter pilot.

215
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,960
A fighter pilot?

216
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,700
Well, I feel a whole lot
more safe knowing that.

217
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,110
All right, say good night
to Mr. Marshall, Renie.

218
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,310
Good night.

219
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,910
You got kids?

220
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,250
Uh, Buster and I have been trying
for a while.

221
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,190
Buster is my wife. Sometimes people
think I'm talking about my dog.

222
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,820
You should get a dog and name it "Mrs.
Marshall." Ah!

223
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,760
So, you think this boy did it?

224
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,060
Hey, whose side you on?

225
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,830
Women don't just go around
lying about being raped, Mr. Marshall.

226
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,740
You're going to have to figure out
why she'd do such a thing.

227
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,240
Burden of proof is on the State.
Is it now?

228
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,870
Hey there.

229
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,780
So what can you tell me
about this Friedman guy anyway?

230
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,950
Sam and me played trombone together
in the high school band.

231
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,520
You trust him? Sam? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,620
If you dropped a nickel while kicking him
in the balls, he'd return it to you.

233
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,690
Mmm.

234
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,790
Couldn't play trombone
for shit though.

235
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,760
Gentlemen! Can I have a minute, please?

236
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,400
Just a minute!
Who is this, a relative of Spell?

237
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,870
I'm Mr. Spell's attorney.
Thurgood Marshall.

238
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,440
I thought you were
Spell's lawyer, Mr. Freeman.

239
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
It's Friedman.
Sam Friedman.

240
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,110
Of Friedman and Friedman.
Local counsel. That is all.

241
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,580
- The defense team, huh?
- Is your boy innocent, Mr. Friedman?

242
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,080
He is not my... Let me state this to
you all clearly and unequivocally.

243
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,990
Our client, Joseph Spell,
is an innocent man.

244
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, let's get
a picture of you two.

245
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,050
All rise.

246
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,660
Superior Court
is now in session.

247
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,760
The Honorable Carl Foster
presiding.

248
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,100
You may be seated.

249
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,210
The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.

250
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,140
Are the parties
ready to proceed?

251
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,340
The State is ready,
Your Honor.

252
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,010
Ah, Mr. Willis.
Good morning.

253
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,980
How's your father doing?

254
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,780
He's better. Thank you.
That's kind of you to ask.

255
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,360
Uh, the defense is ready as well,
Your Honor.

256
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,260
Well then, let's get on with it.

257
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,460
Mr., uh...

258
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,560
Mr. Friedman.

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,730
You filed an application to admit
an out-of-state attorney?

260
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,570
Yes, Your Honor. Attorney Thurgood
Marshall of the Maryland Bar.

261
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,710
I have the application
in front of me, Mr. Friedman.

262
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,110
Uh-huh.

263
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,880
Why do we need to admit this lawyer,
Mr. Friedman?

264
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,580
Does he have a long-standing relationship
with the defendant?

265
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,720
Uh, no, Your Honor,
uh, but...

266
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,660
- How long has he known him?
- Not long, Your Honor, but...

267
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,260
Exactly how long?

268
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,400
Well, he met him for the first time
a few days ago.

269
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,360
However...

270
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,600
A few days ago?

271
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, then what possible reason
could there be to admit him?

272
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,410
You're a perfectly capable attorney,
are you not, Mr. Friedman?

273
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,840
You have tried cases before,
haven't you?

274
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,250
Only civil cases, Your Honor.
But Mr. Marshall is with the NAACP.

275
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,520
And they are concerned that their defendant
receive a fair trial.

276
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,290
So are we all,
Attorney Friedman.

277
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,920
So are we all.

278
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,890
But he's not a member
of our bar, is he?

279
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,790
No, he's not.

280
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,790
However, Your Honor,
Mr. Marshall is a respected attorney.

281
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,960
He argued in the United States
Supreme Court.

282
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,870
That has no bearing
on this case.

283
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,770
Your Honor, may I be heard?

284
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,970
No, you may not.

285
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
The court has heard enough
and will rule.

286
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,480
The court sees
no legal requirement

287
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,750
to admit out-of-state counsel
in this case.

288
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,050
But, Your Honor...
However,

289
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,120
the court not only wishes to be fair
to all of the parties,

290
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,560
but to maintain the appearance of fairness
as well.

291
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,630
Therefore, the court
will allow Mr. Marshall

292
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,660
to enter his appearance
for the defense...

293
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,060
Respectfully...

294
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,330
His written appearance,
Mr. Willis.

295
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,140
Mr. Marshall
may sit at counsel table.

296
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,470
However, he may not speak.

297
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,110
Your Honor,
I must speak for the client.

298
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,650
He may not speak, argue,
or examine witnesses.

299
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,780
If he violates this ruling,
he will be held in contempt of court.

300
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,120
And you as well,
Mr. Friedman.

301
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,490
You will conduct this case.

302
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,820
Me?
Yes, you.

303
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,930
The trial will begin
a month from today

304
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,030
at 10:00 a.m.

305
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,500
Court adjourned.

306
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,030
All rise.

307
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,530
What the...

308
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,940
What the hell just happened?

309
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,140
What just happened here?
Shut up and be quiet. Let me think.

310
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,040
I can't do this. You know that.
Shut up.

311
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,610
Excuse me?

312
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,250
That son of a bitch.

313
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
I've tried cases before judges
who were Grand Dragons of the Ku Klux Klan,

314
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,790
who forced me to enter
through the back door,

315
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,820
but this horseshit is a first.

316
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,290
I cannot get involved
in a case like this.

317
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,860
Are you listening to me?
It would destroy my practice.

318
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,900
This is not my problem.

319
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,270
The hell it isn't.

320
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,410
No, you heard the judge.

321
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,080
Until we can find somebody better,
it's you and me.

322
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,980
It's our problem now.

323
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,880
Uh, Mr. Marshall...

324
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,270
According to
Eleanor Strubing's account,

325
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,240
Spell rapes her at home,
ties and gags her, then drives up here.

326
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,010
He stops approximately 60 feet
onto the bridge, like so...

327
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,350
Joseph! Please!

328
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,320
Takes her out of the car...

329
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,820
No! No!

330
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,220
then pushes her
over the guardrail,

331
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,360
into the reservoir,
right about here.

332
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,800
He throws rocks at her,
then drives away.

333
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,700
Somehow she gets to shore.

334
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,470
Dripping wet.

335
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,810
Then climbs up to the road.

336
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,390
Ah.

337
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,960
Awfully scary down there though.

338
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,700
Go take a look
where she climbed out.

339
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,200
Me? These are
my best shoes.

340
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,170
Please try to
make yourself useful.

341
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,650
Stop. Stop!

342
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Stop.

343
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,960
This is where
the truck driver found her.

344
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,310
What do you want with those?

345
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,880
It's an old Negro superstition.

346
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,480
Always take a little piece
of the earth with you.

347
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,380
Really?

348
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,800
Mr. Friedman, your picture's
on the front page with Mr. Marshall.

349
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,700
Oh.
Not a bad picture.

350
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,710
Of me, anyway.

351
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,040
- Also, your wife called.
- Oh, Sam. Perfect.

352
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,790
Where you been?

353
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,080
Out getting the cutlery
I need to castrate you.

354
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,580
You must be Irwin.
I am.

355
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,520
Mr. Marshall. Pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure.

356
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,580
Sam, listen, I have great news.

357
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,950
I made some calls.
Harry Gruber, he wants the case.

358
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,560
Harry Gruber.
The Communist.

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,760
Sam, at least he handles
criminal defense.

360
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,400
Can you get Gruber
on the line, Ruth?

361
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,940
Sure thing.
Thank you.

362
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,600
This is not
a cut-and-dry case.

363
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,940
You should really consider whether or not
this is something you want to commit to.

364
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,210
You want the Communist Party
taking over?

365
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,380
They'll martyr Spell
for their own cause.

366
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,650
Not my problem.

367
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,750
You think he did it.
That's for a jury to decide.

368
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,160
You think he raped this woman
and drove her to the reservoir to kill her?

369
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,830
People have done
stranger things.

370
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,460
That's right. People do all sorts
of strange things, horrible things.

371
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,000
But throw a woman over the bridge, into the
water, not check to see if she's dead,

372
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,170
then drive back to her house?

373
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,640
You've gotta have a pretty dim view
of Negroes

374
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,810
to think any one of us would do anything
so goddamn stupid.

375
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,020
The papers say he was dishonorably
discharged from the army.

376
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,590
This isn't
a court-martial.

377
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,650
He was fired from his last job
for stealing.

378
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,620
No charges were brought.

379
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,330
He left behind a wife
and two kids in Louisiana, Thurgood.

380
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,530
Yes, he's got baggage.
Criminal defendants usually do.

381
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,770
They're not perfect citizens
like you and me.

382
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,500
But none of that makes him guilty
of this crime.

383
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,640
I got Gruber on the phone.
What do you want me to tell him?

384
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,670
I don't know.
Tell him he's a schmuck.

385
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,510
- Sam, come on.
- Irwin! Genug, huh?

386
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,480
Why me?

387
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,820
I need someone who will do
as I say.

388
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,350
What makes you think
I will do as you say?

389
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,160
You have no choice.
You don't know what you're doing.

390
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,530
You're quite a salesman.

391
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,190
There's no time for that.

392
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,000
You want me to try this case.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,300
No, I need you to try this case.

394
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,670
"And the Lord commanded Moses
to enlist his brother's help.

395
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,910
He shall speak for you
to the people."

396
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,880
"He shall be your mouth,

397
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,210
and you shall be
as God to him."

398
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,120
Tell Gruber to go fuck himself.

399
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,530
All right.

400
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,160
And find the cop who stopped Spell.
We need a witness.

401
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,100
Okay. I'm on it.

402
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,740
What is this?

403
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,210
You say you've never tried
a criminal case before, right?

404
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,110
Yeah, that's right.

405
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,390
You'd better start reading then.

406
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,180
You've got one month.

407
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,760
Hey, look who's back.
You coming tonight?

408
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,930
No, not tonight.

409
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,030
Oh, man, I was really looking forward
to catching up with you.

410
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,540
All right, you need to stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

411
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,910
I am the one who's been sick...

412
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,350
every morning...

413
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,980
for the past month.

414
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,880
What?

415
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,950
You better not be lying.
Look at the bump.

416
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,460
Oh! I see it.

417
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,220
You see it?
Mmm!

418
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,660
Mmm, mmm.

419
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,630
I'm not going anywhere
after this.

420
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,160
Hmm.

421
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,900
What?

422
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,570
You don't believe me.
No, I don't.

423
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,500
I swear.

424
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,110
You swear.

425
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,670
I swear I swear.
Nowhere, nowhere.

426
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,580
I swear.
Mmm!

427
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,020

428
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,860

Langston, he swore
on his mother's life

433
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,140
that he wouldn't be going
anywhere anytime soon.

434
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,510
My mother's name was never mentioned.

435
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,110
Well, this case is all anybody in this city
is talking about.

436
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,850
Which only means that the inevitable loss
will be that much more devastating.

437
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,850
Don't bet against me.
You're not even trying the case, baby.

438
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,060
Every single word that man
utters in that courtroom will be mine.

439
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,020
I'm just making the point
that a Negro charged with ravishment

440
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,890
by the Greenwich gentility

441
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,300
should probably save himself the time
and unpleasantness of a trial.

442
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,670
Langston, maybe you should
just go back to Spain.

443
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,030
Or back to Russia.

444
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,070
Write your little poems,
explore big ideas with your comrades.

445
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,710
I was fighting Fascists
in Spain.

446
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,680
Well, you were writing about
fighting Fascists in Spain.

447
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,380
Listen, by the time the baby comes,

448
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,080
Thurgood's gonna be
out of a job.

449
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,320
Do none of you
have any confidence in me?

450
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,090
I'd say you have enough confidence
for us all,

451
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,090
misplaced as it may be.

452
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,000
Great to see you!

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,230
God, here comes Zora.

454
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,230
Probably leaving dinner
with Charles Lindbergh.

455
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,370
- Don't you dare...
- Zora!

456
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,070
Sit down!

457
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,070
Come on over here.

458
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,680
Zora Neale Hurston!
Hi!

459
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,980
How y'all doin'?

460
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,610
Langston Hughes.
Zora.

461
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,680
Mmm.

462
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,020
- And who is this?
- I'm August.

463
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,230
- I've heard so much about you.
- Huh.

464
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,360
That's funny, 'cause I haven't heard
a thing about you.

465
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,230
Huh, Langston?

466
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,600
♪ Oh, trouble in mind ♪

467
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,510
You had it now, girl!

468
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,350
Okay, guys.
We ready to go?

469
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,460
You're still not talking to me.

470
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,830
It's...
It's not my fault.

471
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,130
You have no idea how persuasive
this guy can be.

472
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,650
Shh.
Stella.

473
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,750
What on earth is Sam thinking?

474
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,020
With all that's going on
in the world today,

475
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,320
we don't need this kind of attention
focused on us.

476
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,690
Well, he wasn't looking for it, Rose.
Irwin got him involved.

477
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,100
Well, you tell him that everybody
is terrified by what this man did.

478
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,370
Sophie Gittelson
fired her girl today.

479
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,440
She's been with them
for 11 years.

480
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,170
They fired Gladys?
Why? She's lovely.

481
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,810
Yeah, she's lovely.

482
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,380
But what if one of her relatives
comes to visit?

483
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,110
They have their daughter
to think of.

484
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,050
I would've done the same thing.

485
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,200
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Friedlansky.

486
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Mr. Weisman.

487
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Dora and I couldn't remember.
Were you born here or in Minsk?

488
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,970
We, uh... We came over
when I was one.

489
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,610
That's what I thought.

490
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,880
So you feel like a really big shot, I bet,
defending that schvartze.

491
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,250
What do you think
your father would say?

492
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,150
I could not tell you.

493
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,130
I think he'd say he was proud.

494
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,800
For the defense.

495
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,670
Don't mention it.

496
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,240
To anyone.

497
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,360
Eew!

498
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,940
Jury selection, gentlemen.

499
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,140
Clerk, call the first
venire person.

500
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,510
Lester Gilman of Norwalk.

501
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,710
Mr. Gilman.

502
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,490
Mr., uh, Gilman,

503
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,390
um, in this case a colored man is accused
of raping a white woman.

504
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,960
Could you be fair
in deciding such a case?

505
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,900
I think so.

506
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,230
No further questions.

507
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,310
Accepted by the defense.

508
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,340
To tell you the truth, I don't know much
about them, the colored.

509
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,710
We don't have too many
in Stratford.

510
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,990
Excused.

511
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,170
I'll be honest with you.
I don't like the colored.

512
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,900
Seems to me they're always getting into
some sort of trouble.

513
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,870
I don't think much
of Hebrews either.

514
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,810
Excuse me?

515
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,680
Well, you're one of them...
I figured.

516
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,320
Thank you for your candor,
Mr. Wright.

517
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,950
Uh, no further questions.

518
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,220
Excuse for cause.

519
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,160
Counselor?

520
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,290
Your Honor, we move to have Mr. Wright
excused for cause.

521
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,160
On what grounds?

522
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,800
- Bias.
- I know.

523
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,230
He just admitted he's biased.

524
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,400
Mr. Wright, you are
a law-abiding citizen.

525
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,670
Wouldn't you say?
That's right, Your Honor.

526
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,910
If I instructed you that the law requires
that you set aside your bias,

527
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,780
would you obey my instruction?

528
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,180
Guess I'd have to.

529
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,820
The challenge for cause
is overruled.

530
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,550
You may use
the peremptory challenge.

531
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
- Your Honor, with all due respect...
- I've made my ruling.

532
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,260
Excused.

533
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,430
Mr. Ellis,
you agree, do you not,

534
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,200
that as a colored man you could not fairly
pass judgment on Mr. Spell.

535
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,340
No, sir.

536
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,770
You agree you could not be fair.

537
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,140
No. What I mean is, yes, if he's guilty,
I'd have to convict him.

538
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,750
I'll use a challenge.

539
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,580
Object.

540
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,520
On what basis?
Just do it.

541
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,050
Uh, Your Honor, I object.

542
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,020
Grounds?

543
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,960
He can't use the challenge to discrim...

544
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,790
I heard that,
Mr. Marshall.

545
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,890
It's a peremptory challenge,
Mr. Friedman.

546
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,030
The State may use it
for whatever reason it wants.

547
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,070
Mr. Willis, you have four left.
The defense has one.

548
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,140
What was the point of that?

549
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,470
Every single time they discriminate,
we're going to object.

550
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,910
Recognize it.
Now.

551
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,540
Mrs. Richmond,
do you reside in Greenwich?

552
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,680
Yes, Mr. Willis.
I do now.

553
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,950
And if the State
proves its case,

554
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,890
you could convict the defendant?

555
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,350
Yes, of course I could.

556
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,360
Thank you, Mrs. Richmond.
That's all I wanted to know.

557
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,900
Mrs. Richmond, I notice you have
an accent.

558
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:19,140
Really? Here I thought you were the one
with the accent, Mr. Friedman.

559
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,380
Fair enough.

560
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,410
Mrs. Richmond,

561
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,310
where did you live
before moving here?

562
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,250
Raleigh, North Carolina.

563
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,320
But now you live in Greenwich.
Yes, that's right.

564
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,190
So if you live in Greenwich,
you must have heard about this case.

565
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,190
It's all anybody talks about.

566
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,200
I assume, then, that you've come
to some sort of conclusion

567
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,230
regarding the defendant's guilt
or innocence?

568
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
You assume incorrectly.

569
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
I don't have all the evidence,
now, do I?

570
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,110
Have you met
Mrs. Strubing?

571
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,640
In passing, at parties
and community events.

572
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,150
I believe we belong
to the same club.

573
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,980
Do you really think then,
Mrs. Richmond,

574
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,890
that with all of these connections...
the club, the parties...

575
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,490
that you could really
just set all of that aside?

576
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,290
I don't see why not.

577
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,430
Thank you.
No further questions.

578
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,930
The State accepts
Mrs. Richmond.

579
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,040
Your Honor...
What?

580
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,540
No. Absolutely not.

581
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,240
Mr. Friedman.

582
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,140
Your Honor, may we have five minutes,
please?

583
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,920
Fine with me, Your Honor.

584
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,590
The court will recess
for exactly five minutes.

585
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,990
But we're not gonna make a habit of this,
are we, counselor?

586
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,560
No. No, of course not.
Thank you, Your Honor.

587
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,600
We have one challenge left.
It was made for this woman.

588
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,330
Just trust me on this.

589
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,330
She's a Southerner.
Lives in the same town.

590
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,100
Take her.
I'm not your goddamn puppet.

591
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,740
I'm getting rid of her.

592
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,070
She's smart, she's confident,
she resists authority.

593
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,610
Did you see the way
she talked back to you?

594
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,580
The other jurors will listen to her.
Which is exactly the problem.

595
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,510
She knows Mrs. Strubing.
They run in the same social circles.

596
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,450
And she doesn't
put her on a pedestal.

597
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,450
Maybe Mrs. Strubing
is a drinker.

598
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,290
Maybe she has a boyfriend in town.
This woman may know things.

599
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,760
You are stabbing in the dark.

600
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,700
Maybe, but this I do know.

601
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,470
The one thing Southerners like her hate
more than the colored...

602
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,330
arrogant Yankee pricks
like Willis.

603
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,370
Were you watching her?

604
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,610
She folded her arms and sat back
when Willis spoke.

605
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,380
When you began, she opened up,

606
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,910
leaned forward,
removed her glasses.

607
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,150
These are signs.

608
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,620
Signs of what?

609
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,190
She likes you.

610
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,100
No, my gl...
my glasses!

611
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,870
I need my glasses.

612
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,210
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah.

613
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,720
Mr. Friedman?

614
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,420
The defendant
accepts Mrs. Richmond.

615
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,920
Am I missing something?

616
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,760
Mrs. Richmond, you've been accepted
by both of the parties

617
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,330
and will serve as
our 12th and final juror.

618
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,340
The evidence will begin tomorrow
morning at 10:00.

619
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,670
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Mr. Friedman!
Mr. Friedman.

620
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,640
What do you have to say
about today's comments by the NAACP?

621
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,610
- What comments?
- The press release by Walter White?

622
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,980
He says that, "The Spell case
will show the world

623
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,680
that a colored man cannot get a fair
trial in the United States of America."

624
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,950
- Do you agree, Mr. Friedman?
- I have nothing to say about that.

625
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,690
What about you,
Mr. Marshall?

626
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,960
Hasn't it been proven
in this courtroom already?

627
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,360
How can a man have a fair trial
when he's denied counsel of his choice?

628
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,130
When the members of his race
are eliminated from service on his jury?

629
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,200
When fear and bias against his race are the
central points of the case against him?

630
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,370
In Europe right now,

631
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,180
the forces of tyranny
have mobilized

632
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,180
behind the vision
of a so-called master race.

633
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,220
But here in America,
our differences aren't supposed to matter.

634
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,320
Here we're promised
equal protection under the law.

635
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,060
Separate but equal!

636
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,160
Nothing complicated about that.

637
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,760
That promise has not been realized,
not even close.

638
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,100
Not in Birmingham, Alabama,
nor in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,

639
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,670
and certainly not here
in Bridgeport, Connecticut...

640
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,810
where your bigotry is simply covered
by a northern accent.

641
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,520
But a fair jury can always
render a just verdict.

642
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,620
That's what we're striving for
here today.

643
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,090
The Constitution was not written for us.
We know that.

644
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,520
But no matter what,
we're gonna make it work for us.

645
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,230
From now on
we claim it as our own.

646
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,450
What's bothering you?

647
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,050
Sam.
Not now.

648
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,980
What's bothering me?

649
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,150
You insulting the judge on the courthouse
steps. That's what's bothering me.

650
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,220
Just relax.

651
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,490
Excuse me?

652
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,060
I have to live in this city
after you're gone. Understand?

653
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,660
No more public statements
until this trial is over, or I'm gone.

654
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,570
Let me make this clear.

655
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,570
My people will decide what to say
to the newspapers and when to say it.

656
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,940
The newspapers should have
no place in this trial.

657
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,610
But they already do. People are losing
their jobs because of these stories.

658
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,780
- Those people are not my clients!
- Well, they are mine!

659
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,650
My jury isn't just the 12 people in that
jury box. It's the whole goddamn nation.

660
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,490
You just focus on this
case, try your best not

661
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,420
to screw it up and leave
the big picture to me.

662
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,090
Sam.

663
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,690
What is it, Irwin?
Don't you have something to do?

664
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,100
There's someone waiting for you
in my office.

665
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,300
Yes?
And who is this someone?

666
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,370
Uh, Officer McCoy.

667
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,140
And who the hell
is Officer McCoy?

668
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,940
The cop who pulled Spell over
that night.

669
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,380
I just did what you said.

670
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,860
I drove around Port Chester,
pulling over police cars, and I found him.

671
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,220
Attaboy, Irwin.
Attaboy.

672
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,290
What time did you pull over
Mr. Spell?

673
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,200
Did you hear the question?

674
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,640
3:37 a.m.,
according to my notes.

675
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,110
Why'd you stop him?

676
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,280
It didn't look like...

677
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,150
a man like that
would drive that car.

678
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,950
Was anyone with him in the car?

679
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,990
No. He was alone.

680
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,430
You're willing to
testify to that in court?

681
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,060
If I have to.

682
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:23,100
Irwin, get a sworn statement from
Officer McCoy, then escort him out.

683
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,630
Officer.

684
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,910
Wow.

685
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,310
An honest policeman.

686
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,290
See what your publicity
stirs up?

687
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,120
No, it just brings 'em out
where you can see 'em.

688
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,460
Give us justice!

689
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,490
That doesn't look
anything like me.

690
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,160
Does it?

691
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,210
The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.

692
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,940
Are counsel ready to proceed?

693
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,110
Ready for the State.

694
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,720
We are, Your Honor.

695
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,550
Mr. Willis, you may call
your first witness.

696
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,820
The State calls Greenwich Police
Captain Burke to the stand.

697
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,430
Would you identify these photos,
Captain Burke?

698
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,970
Yes, sir.
That's the Kensico Reservoir.

699
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,670
Did you find any evidence
at the scene

700
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,310
that pertains to this case?

701
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,910
Yes, sir, we did.

702
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,650
We found Mrs. Strubing's sealskin coat
floating in the reservoir,

703
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,080
under the bridge, about here.

704
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,950
Then about here, on the guardrail,
we found some strands of fabric.

705
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,450
I believe they were stuck
to some bird droppings.

706
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Were you able to
identify the fabric?

707
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,330
Yes, sir. It matched the fabric
from Mrs. Strubing's sealskin coat.

708
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,000
Thank you.
Nothing further.

709
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,000
Your witness,
Mr. Friedman.

710
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,110
Bird droppings.

711
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,280
Sorry?

712
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,990
Uh, bird droppings,
Captain Burke?

713
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,420
Yes, that's right.

714
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,320
Were you able to
identify the bird?

715
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,300
May I?

716
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,000
Thank you.

717
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,170
Now...

718
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,700
on one side of the bridge is the reservoir,
placid as a lake.

719
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:47,510
On the other side is a 30-foot drop
onto a jagged rock bed.

720
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,810
- Is that correct?
- You could say that.

721
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,080
And the fabric that you found
was on the lake side,

722
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,480
right about here,

723
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,550
around 60 feet onto the bridge.

724
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,860
Sixty-seven feet,
four inches.

725
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,890
Okay.

726
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,660
Did you conclude, then, that Mrs. Strubing
fell or jumped off the bridge?

727
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,100
- I concluded that she was pushed.
- Pushed?

728
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,770
To murder her.

729
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,600
That's right.

730
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,170
As a trained
crime investigator, Captain,

731
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,040
did you ever ask yourself,

732
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,210
if someone wanted
Mrs. Strubing dead,

733
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,550
why not push her onto the sharp, jagged
rock bed rather than the still lake water?

734
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,420
Object.
Asking for speculation.

735
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,960
Sustained. The jury will
disregard the question.

736
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,900
Now...
Mrs. Strubing told you

737
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,330
that after pushing her
into the water,

738
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,800
Joseph threw rocks at her
from the bridge.

739
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,740
Is that correct?
Yes.

740
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,540
Mm-hmm.
Were there any rocks on the bridge?

741
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,040
I don't know.
There may have been.

742
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,950
But there were rocks in the area
around the bridge. Is that correct?

743
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,620
Yes, there were.

744
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,250
About how big were they?

745
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,150
I really couldn't say.

746
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,690
Were they...

747
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,900
any bigger than this, Captain?

748
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,200
I can't say they were.

749
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,080
This... This is a pebble,
isn't it, Captain?

750
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,880
You could call it that.

751
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,820
What would you call it?

752
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,660
A pebble.

753
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,660
A pebble.

754
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,830
So, in summary, Captain,

755
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,640
it is your belief that this man

756
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,870
threw Mrs. Strubing
into a placid lake,

757
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,880
then gathered pebbles
to toss at her

758
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,110
while she waited patiently
under the bridge.

759
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,110
Object.

760
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,220
Withdrawn.

761
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,890
No further questions,
Your Honor.

762
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,150
Captain Burke, you are excused.

763
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,120
Court is adjourned.

764
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,420
All rise.

765
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,760
Mr. Friedman.

766
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,100
Well done.

767
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,300
Well done.
Let's go.

768
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,140
Why are you smiling?

769
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,980
I think we scored
some points there.

770
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,410
This isn't a sporting event.

771
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,750
A man's life is on the line.

772
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,520
A word with you, Friedman.

773
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,480
Yes, of course.

774
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,890
Alone.

775
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,360
Or to you both.

776
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,760
The doctor who examined Ellie
is testifying tomorrow.

777
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,600
It's rather personal, of course.

778
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,900
These are private people...

779
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,000
Please get to the point.

780
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,330
Excuse me?

781
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I've spoken with John Strubing,
and he's willing to consider a plea.

782
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,910
It's my decision, of course,

783
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,580
but plead your boy and I'll recommend
a sentence of 20 years.

784
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,480
- Otherwise, he gets life.
- No.

785
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,510
No deals.

786
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,150
Mr. Friedman?

787
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,390
Not my call.

788
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,860
Of course. You have to
speak to your client.

789
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,330
I'll expect a different answer
in the morning.

790
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,530
Even with good behavior,

791
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,940
you'd be locked up
at least 14 years.

792
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,670
I could maybe do that.

793
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,380
They don't know we found the cop,
Joseph.

794
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,780
We don't even know
if Strubing will show up.

795
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,880
- You could walk out of here a free man.
- But if she does...

796
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,390
- If you wrong...
- Listen.

797
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,690
The decision is yours.
Sam.

798
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,590
I need to talk to Joseph.

799
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,800
- Are you asking me to leave?
- Of course not.

800
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,960
He's your client.

801
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,870
I'm asking you to listen.

802
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,170
When we first met,

803
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,200
I told you I'd only
defend you if you were

804
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,340
innocent, and you told
me you were innocent.

805
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,450
You remember?
I remember.

806
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,420
Did you lie to me?
No, I didn't lie.

807
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,220
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you commit this crime?

808
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,660
No.
But you're willing to say you did.

809
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,990
If I got to.
For the deal.

810
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,860
If you "got to"?

811
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,940
My great-granddaddy
was a slave.

812
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,240
Were your people slaves, Joseph?

813
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,880
When we were slaves we had to do
what the master said.

814
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,850
But... we're not slaves now,
are we?

815
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,180
No, we ain't slaves.

816
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,320
You say that like it's nothin'.

817
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,620
We ain't slaves because we rose up and
we fought and we fought and we fought

818
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,260
till we got our freedom.

819
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,230
Isn't that right?

820
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,700
My granddaddy escaped
when he was 15.

821
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Fought off four men and an attack dog,
my mama said.

822
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,670
Okay, then you tell me this.

823
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,380
After what your granddaddy did
to get his freedom,

824
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,910
you're just gonna give it right back
for nothing,

825
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,780
for something
you didn't even do?

826
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,220
Understand this.

827
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,890
If you want your freedom,
you're gonna have to fight for it.

828
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,660
But you don't have to fight alone.
That's why I'm here.

829
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,160
We've got weapons now, Joseph.

830
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,700
Our people do.

831
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,600
Weapons we didn't have before.

832
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,510
We've got the law.

833
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,780
And you've got Sam,

834
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,950
one of the finest young trial lawyers
in this country, on your side.

835
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,190
You really think we can win?

836
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,160
I wouldn't be here if I didn't think
we could win.

837
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,000
Dr. Sayer, please tell the jury
your field of specialty.

838
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,900
I specialize
in the field of gynecology,

839
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,270
and I deliver babies.

840
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:24,940
Aww!

841
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,980
On the morning she was
discovered in the reservoir,

842
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,910
did you have occasion to examine
Mrs. Eleanor Strubing?

843
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,610
Yes.

844
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,550
She was brought to my home
by the police at, uh...

845
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,860
Let's see.
6:30 in the morning.

846
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,690
Did she tell you
what had happened?

847
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,990
Objection. Hearsay.

848
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,960
Overruled.

849
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,400
Doctor?

850
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,670
I've forgotten the question.

851
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,470
What did Mrs. Strubing
tell you?

852
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,170
She told me
that she had been raped

853
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,210
by a colored man
who worked for her.

854
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,980
What was her mental state
during all of this?

855
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,920
She was severely distraught,
weeping.

856
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,490
She kept repeating, "Am I pregnant?
Am I pregnant?"

857
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,860
- Did you then examine her?
- Yes.

858
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,860
My wife assisted
by removing her clothing.

859
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,700
It was torn, wet, and muddy.

860
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:28,500
I noted bruises
on her arms and legs

861
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,410
and numerous abrasions and contusions
on both extremities.

862
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,880
I then performed
an internal exam.

863
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,110
Do you have an opinion,
based upon reasonable medical certainty,

864
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,280
as to whether or not
she had been raped?

865
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,350
Beyond question,
Mr. Willis.

866
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,760
It was all consistent with rape.

867
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,930
Thank you.

868
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,690
Your witness.

869
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,630
Get the records.

870
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,030
Medical records.
Get them.

871
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,240
Your Honor, may we please see
the medical records of Dr. Sayer?

872
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,400
Object.
These are personal.

873
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,840
Overruled.

874
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Willis,
but the witness referred to them.

875
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,280
- They must be turned over.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

876
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,450
May I?

877
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,440
Abrasions and contusions. Those are
scrapes and cuts, aren't they, Doctor?

878
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,040
Yes. Scrapes,
scratches, bruises.

879
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,910
Right.

880
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,680
Well, the fall from the bridge and
the climb through the pine forest

881
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,980
could be responsible for cuts and bruises,
could it not?

882
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,250
It's possible.

883
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,000
You did an internal exam
and you found...

884
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,770
"edema, swelling,
traces of blood."

885
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,270
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

886
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,810
And it was based on this that you
determined that she was raped?

887
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,810
Indeed.

888
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,350
But those same findings...

889
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,380
are equally consistent
with a woman who took a lover

890
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,550
and engaged in vigorous sexual intercourse
over the course of an evening.

891
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,820
Objection. How dare you.
There is no evidence of any lover.

892
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,430
Sustained.

893
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,400
There's no place for that in my courtroom,
Mr. Friedman.

894
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,270
Um, of course, Your Honor.

895
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,870
I-I'm sorry.

896
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,750
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

897
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,350
No, they just pulled me
out of proceedings.

898
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,890
The baby...

899
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,220
didn't make it.

900
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,560
And it was just so much worse this time.
The bleeding was just...

901
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,960
It wouldn't stop.

902
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,270
I'm so sorry.

903
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,870
I should be there.

904
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,610
Buster?

905
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,280
Buster, are you there?

906
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,750
Yeah, I'm...

907
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,690
I'm here.

908
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,920
Where are you?

909
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,130
Do you have any further questions,
Mr. Friedman?

910
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,480
Mrs. Strubing told you
that she resisted her assailant?

911
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,390
Yes, she did.
Mm-hmm.

912
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,850
And you looked under her fingernails
too, didn't you,

913
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,920
to see if you could find
any traces of skin?

914
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,420
I did.

915
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,230
What did you find?

916
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,400
Splinters, dirt in some...

917
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,530
- Any skin, Doctor?
- No, Sam.

918
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,370
Yes. I was just
about to get to that.

919
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,340
Excuse me?

920
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,800
There was skin.

921
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,710
Wh-Where...

922
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,780
Where in these records does it say anything
about finding traces of skin?

923
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,920
It's not in the records.

924
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,020
My wife took the notes. She did not
write down that bit of information.

925
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,860
Why not, Doctor?
Why would she not record that?

926
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,370
Out of respect for the patient's privacy,
Mr. Friedman.

927
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,970
It was the skin
of a colored man.

928
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,640
No further questions.

929
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,110
It wasn't in the records.
They got a doctor to lie under oath.

930
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,680
How do we fight against that?

931
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,820
You asked the exact question

932
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,750
Willis wanted you to ask.

933
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,660
- What were you thinking?
- Where the hell were you? Hmm?

934
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,560
Getting instructions
from Walter White?

935
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,930
See what happens when I don't hold
your hand? You panic like an amateur.

936
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,230
You should have let him
take the deal.

937
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,070
Goddamn it, would you shut up about
the deal? We have an alibi witness.

938
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,640
What don't you get?

939
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,510
They will have McCoy change his testimony.
Just watch.

940
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,110
Let them. We'll take his sworn statement
and shove it up his ass.

941
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,080
No, tomorrow morning I'm asking Willis
if the offer is still on the table.

942
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,250
The NAACP
isn't taking any deals.

943
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,000
The NAACP isn't the one with
its life on the line here.

944
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,250
Yes, it is, goddamn it.

945
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,830
You're using him.

946
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,760
That's all this is.

947
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,870
Just like you said
the Communists would.

948
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,700
We're giving him the best possible defense
under the circumstances.

949
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,800
Mmm. Yeah.

950
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:06,770
I'm sure he'll feel really lucky as
he sits in prison for the rest of his life.

951
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,940
Let's not act like it's Joseph Spell you're
concerned for all of a sudden.

952
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,450
What is that supposed to mean?

953
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,780
From the moment you got involved in this,
you've been looking for a way out.

954
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,650
Play nice with the DA,
earn yourself a favor,

955
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,520
maybe they'll let you in their neighborhood
or their club one day.

956
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,730
Well, get this
through your head.

957
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,730
The only way to get through a bigot's door
is to break it down.

958
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,330
Must be easy
for you to say, huh?

959
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,140
See, it's my life
that is on the line here.

960
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,040
My family, my practice,
my future.

961
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,910
What do you have?
You have nothing to lose.

962
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,550
No, you just sweep through town,
stirring up all kinds of ugliness,

963
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,480
then move right on.

964
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,960
No one will ever
even remember you were here.

965
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,630
Oh, fuck you, Sam.

966
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,460
Fuck you.

967
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,590
Hey.
You two okay?

968
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,470
Please take the stand,
Mrs. Strubing.

969
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,880
Mrs. Strubing,
you reside in Greenwich?

970
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:02,560
Yes. My husband John and I moved
from Philadelphia about a year ago.

971
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,560
Is your husband here
in the courtroom today?

972
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,160
Of course.

973
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,060
Sitting in the front.

974
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:16,670
Mrs. Strubing, do you remember the night
you were attacked?

975
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:19,240
Mr. Willis, I assure you,
I will never forget it.

976
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,710
Please tell the jury
what happened.

977
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:29,620
My husband was away on business,

978
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,190
as he is often, I'm afraid.

979
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,420
I had dinner with friends...
the Moores.

980
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,830
And I arrived home
around ten o'clock

981
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,500
and then I decided
to shower before bed.

982
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,000
And I was fixing my hair.

983
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,670
And he came in the room.

984
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,340
He came after me
and started chasing me.

985
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,450
He had a knife.

986
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,620
The knife was pointed
at my throat,

987
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,020
and I...

988
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,960
I thought of screaming, but...

989
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,960
I couldn't.

990
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,230
He... He penetrated me.

991
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,800
I couldn't make him stop.

992
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,230
His body was crushing me.

993
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,470
What happened next,
Mrs. Strubing?

994
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,180
He said he wasn't finished
with me.

995
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,380
And then he did it again.

996
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,720
Did what?

997
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,820
Raped me, Mr. Willis.

998
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,420
And then what happened?

999
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:47,330
When it was over, he said,
"We're going for a ride, Mrs. Strubing."

1000
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,600
After all that,

1001
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,070
he still called me
"Mrs. Strubing."

1002
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,970
Then he tore my dress
with his hands...

1003
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,470
and gagged me.

1004
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,450
I show you Exhibit "H."

1005
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,720
- Is this the dress?
- Yes. That's it.

1006
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,620
And is this, Exhibit "I,"
taken from that dress,

1007
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,290
similar to the gag
he used on you?

1008
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,760
- Identical.
- Then what happened?

1009
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,530
We started driving.

1010
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:23,930
I had to lay down on the floor
so that I wasn't seen.

1011
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,140
He came around,
pulled me out of the car.

1012
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,440
And I remember
feeling weightless.

1013
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,880
Suddenly I was freezing.

1014
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,510
Rocks were hitting around me.

1015
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,620
Mrs. Strubing,

1016
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,950
do you see the man who raped you

1017
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,750
in this courtroom today?

1018
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,190
Yes.

1019
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,960
He's right over there.

1020
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,130
The colored man.

1021
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,530
For the record, Mrs. Strubing,
which colored man?

1022
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,040
The one in the brown suit.

1023
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,210
Thank you.

1024
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,350
One more question,
Mrs. Strubing.

1025
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:17,920
Did you encounter anybody else
during your time with Mr. Spell?

1026
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,590
Yes, as we were driving
toward the reservoir,

1027
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,620
the car suddenly filled
with red light.

1028
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,260
It was the police.
I thought, at last, I was saved.

1029
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,530
And then Joseph said
to get down back there

1030
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,670
and if I made a sound,
that he would cut my throat.

1031
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,340
Then I heard the policeman.

1032
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,040
And I thought,
please, please, just look.

1033
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,210
But he didn't.

1034
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,180
He-He spoke with Joseph
and then he left.

1035
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,410
I'm so sorry.
I did not want to cry.

1036
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,850
I'm so sorry.

1037
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,890
You've been very strong,
Mrs. Strubing.

1038
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,190
She certainly has,
Your Honor.

1039
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,120
No more questions.

1040
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,590
Hi there.

1041
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:34,060
Name, sir?
Sam... Friedman.

1042
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,400
Sam Friedman.
Friedman.

1043
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,430
I don't seem to have
your name here, sir.

1044
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,940
Actually, I'm a friend of...

1045
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,940
Hold onto this for me.

1046
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,510
Sir, you can't go back there.

1047
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,380
Gentlemen, you must leave now!

1048
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,910
Marshall, this is not the kind of place
you want to make a scene.

1049
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,680
I know.
I used to work in a place just like this.

1050
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,880
That's exactly
what my father said.

1051
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,520
If we just let the Reds
and the Nazis fight it out,

1052
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,250
they'll take care
of each other beautifully.

1053
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:02,060
This club is
for members only, boy.

1054
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,860
Lorin, it appears that you have
some rather unique admirers.

1055
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,240
- This is a private club.
- She wasn't in the car, Lorin.

1056
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,940
- Excuse me?
- You had her lie on the stand today.

1057
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,880
Are you accusing me of a crime?

1058
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,050
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm doing.

1059
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,220
Who do you think you are?

1060
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,320
We have a sworn statement from an Officer
McCoy that Spell was alone that night.

1061
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,760
I don't care what you have.

1062
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,890
Ellie Strubing told the Greenwich
police everything

1063
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,400
when she first recounted
the crime.

1064
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,170
If she wasn't in the car, how could she
have known the car had been stopped, hmm?

1065
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,370
Here.

1066
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,440
Read it.
What is this?

1067
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,840
Another sworn statement.

1068
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,910
This from Ellie Strubing the morning
they found her. Dated, timed, notarized.

1069
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,080
Everything she told
the Greenwich police.

1070
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,020
This is fraudulent.

1071
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,060
Get out of my club.

1072
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,600
I've had better.

1073
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,260
Are you okay, sweetie?

1074
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,930
You look blue.

1075
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,100
And a man as good-looking as you
has no cause to be blue.

1076
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,660
Where is he?

1077
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,460
Attorney Friedman.

1078
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,670
I'm not much of a conversationalist
tonight.

1079
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:34,480
It's okay. I am.
I'm Jen.

1080
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,510
Thurgood.
Pleasure.

1081
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:40,950
I've never
seen you here before...

1082
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,490
Attorney Friedman.

1083
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:51,690
Attorney Friedman,
hold on a minute.

1084
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:53,960
What do you want?

1085
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,100
We're just eager
to introduce ourselves.

1086
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:00,700
To you and the nigger lawyer.

1087
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,770
You don't want to have anything to do
with this man, miss.

1088
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,040
Excuse me.

1089
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:15,550
You gentlemen
are making a big mistake.

1090
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,720
There's no mistake.
We know who you are.

1091
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:26,060
Bet you wish you had
your nigger lawyer friend now.

1092
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,700
Get out of here. Get out of here.
Hey!

1093
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,370
Hold him up.

1094
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,780
Let him go! Hold on.

1095
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:45,050
You liking this?
You kike!

1096
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,250
Let him go!
Let him go!

1097
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,050
Let him go!

1098
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,490
- Go, go!
- Kike bastard!

1099
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:59,060
Sam!

1100
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,240
This here
is Mr. Thurgood Marshall.

1101
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,350
This man is an attorney.

1102
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,520
You'll be showing Mr. Marshall
all the respect he deserves.

1103
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,790
Understand?

1104
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,970
Sit down
and finish your bourbon.

1105
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,600
Say something!

1106
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,440
You're late.

1107
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,950
What happened?
Huh?

1108
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,520
I didn't mean to start trouble.

1109
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,280
It's not your fault.

1110
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,990
Here.

1111
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,560
It's okay.

1112
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,670
Listen.

1113
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,240
Men are men...

1114
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:20,980
and women are women.

1115
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,540
Right?

1116
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,450
Right.

1117
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,850
The Nazi masters of Germany...

1118
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,390
have made it clear
that they intend

1119
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,060
not only to dominate all life
and thought...

1120
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,130
in their own country,

1121
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,930
but also to enslave
the whole of Europe.

1122
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,300
There's flanken.

1123
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,130
Why are you so...

1124
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,210
My God, Sam.
What happened to you?

1125
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:56,210
I... I could use some ice.

1126
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,380
Hey. What is it?
What's wrong?

1127
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,680
I got in the first punch.

1128
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,290
Wh-What's wrong?
What is this?

1129
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,490
You've been crying.

1130
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:14,230
No. Not now. Let's...

1131
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,360
Tell me.

1132
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,200
My cousin Anna, in Kraków.

1133
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,540
They took her?

1134
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,090
Who is that?
I don't know.

1135
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,850
Stand back.

1136
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,090
Yeah.

1137
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,770
Who is it?
It's me.

1138
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:03,010
Thurgood. Your co-counsel.
Open up!

1139
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,450
What happened to you?

1140
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:13,890
Did I come at a bad time?
What do you want, Thurgood?

1141
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,820
I have thoughts about tomorrow.

1142
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,660
Tomorrow?
Get out of my house.

1143
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,390
No.

1144
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,260
Not until I tell you
why I'm here.

1145
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,140
Hear me out.

1146
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,650
You were right.

1147
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,280
I had it all wrong all along.

1148
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,650
Spell was with her all night.

1149
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,020
Spell lied.

1150
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,690
This is your big epiphany?

1151
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,700
Eleanor Strubing lied too.

1152
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,800
Neither of them have
been telling us the truth.

1153
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:03,940
Thurgood, you have just
broken this case wide open.

1154
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,610
My God, you really
are a legal genius.

1155
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,810
Men are men and women are women.

1156
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,320
Men are men
and women are women, Sam.

1157
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,560
You think it was consensual.

1158
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,300
It's the only explanation
that makes sense.

1159
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,370
How can we be certain?

1160
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,640
We need to talk.
Talk about what?

1161
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,440
Listen to me carefully now.

1162
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,880
Did you have sexual intercourse
with Eleanor Strubing?

1163
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,320
No. Why you
keep asking me that?

1164
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,890
I never asked you that before.

1165
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,050
Did you have sex with her?

1166
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,620
Speak, goddamn it.
I told you I didn't.

1167
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,560
She says she was in that car
when it got stopped.

1168
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,460
You hear her say that in court?
I heard, but she's lying.

1169
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,330
No, she's not lying.

1170
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,070
- You're lying.
- Why are you taking her side?

1171
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:13,240
The cop...
The cop never searched the car.

1172
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,510
She was in the back seat,
wasn't she?

1173
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,850
No. Look, I'm telling you...

1174
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,580
Get this through your head.

1175
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,980
She gave a statement to the police
early that morning.

1176
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:24,720
She knew then the car
had been stopped.

1177
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:34,030
Okay.
Okay, she was there.

1178
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,660
And did you have sex
with her that night?

1179
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:39,730
Mmm.

1180
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,700
Answer me.
Answer me now!

1181
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,240
Yes.

1182
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,070
How many times?

1183
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,880
Two times.

1184
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,180
So, you're guilty.

1185
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,980
- You've been lying all along.
- No!

1186
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,650
It wasn't rape.

1187
01:15:56,650 --> 01:16:00,990
What about the skin under her nails?
The doctor lying too?

1188
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,690
When we got to the reservoir,
I parked the car.

1189
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:06,190
But she starts screaming,
opens the door to run out.

1190
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,230
So I grabbed her
just to keep her there.

1191
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,400
That's when she scratches me.

1192
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,170
- You lying to me again?
- No.

1193
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,940
It's the truth.

1194
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,170
Why didn't you tell me the truth
in the first place?

1195
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,580
Because I-I was confused.

1196
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,510
That's not good enough, Joseph.

1197
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:27,180
Willis is gonna ask you why you lied,
sure as you're standing here.

1198
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,980
He's gonna ask you
in front of everyone.

1199
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,080
The jury's gonna be studying you
with all 24 eyes.

1200
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,550
And you're just gonna say you were
confused? I couldn't think straight.

1201
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,520
That's not gonna swing it.

1202
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,820
You lied in a sworn statement.

1203
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,360
Why would you do that?

1204
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,830
Because I was scared.
All right?

1205
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:48,800
I was scared what they'd gonna do to me
if they find out.

1206
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:26,010
My father told me once,

1207
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,380
"If anybody calls you nigger,

1208
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,610
you not only got my permission
to fight him,

1209
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:34,950
you got my orders
to fight him."

1210
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:41,690
Your father say anything
about being called a kike?

1211
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,330
No.

1212
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,300
Not to me anyway.

1213
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,700
You look like
a real fighter now, Sam.

1214
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,540
Like a Jewish Joe Louis.

1215
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,440
Nah.

1216
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,710
Barney Ross is my guy.

1217
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,720
Barney Ross it is.

1218
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:22,730
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Friedman.

1219
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,830
Mrs. Strubing,

1220
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,200
you're originally from Philadelphia,
is that correct?

1221
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,600
Yes.

1222
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,510
College grad?

1223
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,870
Bryn Mawr,
Mr. Friedman.

1224
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,010
And you were an athlete,
I understand?

1225
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,050
Yes, I was on the swim team.

1226
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,680
Ah.

1227
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,350
You and your husband moved to your estate
in Greenwich

1228
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,020
last spring, is that correct?

1229
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,060
I don't know
if I'd call it an estate.

1230
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,060
I'm sorry. A mansion?

1231
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,460
John and I moved here, to Greenwich,
rather, last May.

1232
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,400
Mm-hmm.

1233
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,000
But your husband was away on the night
of this incident. Is that right?

1234
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,700
Yes, as I said, on business.

1235
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,980
You've testified that you went out
on the evening in question.

1236
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:12,410
That is correct.
To the Moores'.

1237
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,980
Did you, um... Did you drink
at the Moores' home?

1238
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,150
As I recall, I drank some wine.

1239
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,990
How many glasses, would you say?

1240
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,560
I don't remember.

1241
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,960
But it was more than one.

1242
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,600
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't remember.

1243
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,830
Mm-hmm.

1244
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:36,600
When you drove home,
were you tipsy?

1245
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:39,370
I never drink enough
to get tipsy.

1246
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:44,580
Okay. So you went straight up to your
room to shower. Is that correct?

1247
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,350
Yes.

1248
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,780
And when you came out
of the shower,

1249
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,950
you say Joseph
was waiting for you.

1250
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,790
I didn't see him at first.

1251
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:58,430
I had no reason to believe
that I wasn't alone.

1252
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,860
But then...

1253
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,000
he was there.

1254
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:12,110
You were attracted to Joseph,
weren't you, Mrs. Strubing?

1255
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,110
- Objection! That's an absurd accusation!
- What?

1256
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,870
You invited him into
your bed, didn't you?

1257
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,480
Your Honor!

1258
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,450
He attacked me! Strike the question
and answer from the record.

1259
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:23,450
Mr. Friedman, no more of this.
You understand me?

1260
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,520
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

1261
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:31,060
Now, your bedroom is just below the room
where the maid slept?

1262
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,590
Yes.

1263
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,100
Did you scream for help?

1264
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,100
I couldn't.
He had a knife.

1265
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,800
Did he hold the knife
as he removed his clothing?

1266
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,500
He must have.

1267
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,870
So he removed his pants, belt,
zipper, whatever, with one hand?

1268
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,010
Apparently so.

1269
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,780
You told Mr. Willis

1270
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,780
that you fought him,
but he overpowered you.

1271
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,120
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1272
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,750
There was a phone
right next to your bed.

1273
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,360
- Did you attempt to use it?
- No. I was terrified.

1274
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,700
Afraid to use the phone or scream for help,
but not afraid to fight back?

1275
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,400
You have no idea what it feels like
to be so afraid.

1276
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:15,000
But at no point...
at no point

1277
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,770
during the hours and hours
that the two of you were together

1278
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:21,710
did you ever attempt to make any calls,
to escape, to raise your voice for help?

1279
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,710
- Object. This is argument.
- I was scared for my life!

1280
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,810
Sustained.
The jury will disregard the question.

1281
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,120
You knew you had been unfaithful
to your husband.

1282
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,480
You were terrified of what he would do
to you if he found out.

1283
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:33,550
And you wanted to get away.
He is badgering the witness!

1284
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,660
That is not true! I was forced
to leave the house. He bound me!

1285
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,290
He gagged me
and he dragged me to the car.

1286
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:41,630
The police stopped the car?

1287
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,000
Yes.
But still you did not scream?

1288
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,500
- He had a knife!
- Right. Right. The knife.

1289
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,140
As you testified, you were afraid that
he was gonna slash your throat

1290
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,510
from the front seat
of the car, was it?

1291
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,640
I couldn't make a sound.

1292
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:59,880
- Because of the gag?
- Yes.

1293
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,720
Mrs. Strubing,

1294
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,420
this Exhibit "I" is identical to the gag
that he used?

1295
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,660
Yes.

1296
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,220
Let's just show the jury
what he did then.

1297
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:16,900
Mrs. Strubing, please, please instruct
Mr. Marshall, if you would.

1298
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:23,170
The gag was between your lips.
Is that correct, Mrs. Strubing?

1299
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:25,310
Yes. That's correct.

1300
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:37,180
Is this about right?

1301
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:40,590
No, it was a bit tighter than that.

1302
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,960
How 'bout this, ma'am?

1303
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,490
Yes, that's about it.

1304
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,840
Now, you could have
done that, Mrs. Strubing.

1305
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,810
He would have killed me.

1306
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,420
- Who would have killed you? Your husband?
- Objection!

1307
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,590
- Quiet, Mr. Marshall.
- How dare you speak to me that way.

1308
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,530
There was a policeman
standing not three feet

1309
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:16,490
away from you. You did
not call out for help.

1310
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:18,170
Instead, Joseph drove
on to the reservoir.

1311
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,390
I'm warning you. No speaking!

1312
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,260
You bolted from the car because
you were ashamed of what you had done

1313
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,460
- with another man, with a colored man!
- Objection!

1314
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:28,070
One more word out of you and
I will hold you in contempt!

1315
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:31,070
You were afraid of what your husband
would do to you if he found out.

1316
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,240
Afraid that you were pregnant
with a colored child.

1317
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,340
- Objection! This is argument!
- Sustained.

1318
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,310
- Jury will disregard.
- You jumped into that water.

1319
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,850
- You wanted to end it all.
- Jumped? I was thrown.

1320
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:44,950
I was thrown. My hands were tied.
He tried to kill me!

1321
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:49,760
Your hands were not tied,
Mrs. Strubing.

1322
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,330
You were able
to remove your coat

1323
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,160
and let it float in the water
as you swam to shore.

1324
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:59,130
That's not true. That's a lie.
He gagged me. He tied me.

1325
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,400
Raped me.

1326
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:10,080
I am so... so sorry for your unhappiness,
Mrs. Strubing.

1327
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,010
No more questions.

1328
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,750
- Mr. Willis?
- I have no questions.

1329
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:30,560
How can we put Spell on the stand
with all this baggage?

1330
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,730
The jury needs
to hear him deny it.

1331
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:35,170
And you bring out
all the bad stuff yourself.

1332
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,540
Don't leave anything for Willis.

1333
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,840
What happens to the organization
if we lose?

1334
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,980
I don't even want
to think about it.

1335
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,380
You could blame me.

1336
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,420
You're one of us now, Sam.

1337
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,820
Haven't you noticed?

1338
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:55,320
In the papers they write, "Sam Friedman
and Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP."

1339
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,300
Joseph, please tell the jury
where you were raised.

1340
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:06,800
Louisiana.

1341
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:12,610
- You have a wife and two children, right?
- Uh-huh.

1342
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:16,680
Even though you have a wife, you have
another woman in White Plains, is it?

1343
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,380
Yes.
What's he doing?

1344
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,710
- Ever served in the army, Joseph?
- Yes, sir.

1345
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,780
Fort Benning, Georgia,
six years. Discharged.

1346
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,450
That was
a dishonorable discharge?

1347
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,350
Yes.

1348
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,220
Then you moved north?
That's right.

1349
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:34,730
Before working for the Strubings,
you worked for another family in Greenwich?

1350
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,930
Yes, sir.

1351
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,060
They accused you of stealing
and fired you.

1352
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,900
Yes, sir.

1353
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,630
And when you worked
for the Strubings,

1354
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,940
did you run into
any other difficulties?

1355
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:47,770
- No, sir.
- Did the Strubings treat you well, Joseph?

1356
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,140
She was always real nice to me.

1357
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,450
What about Mr. Strubing?

1358
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,520
Was he mean to you?

1359
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,590
He was mean to everybody.

1360
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:05,020
It is what you did.
Don't lie to me.

1361
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,230
- Watch where you're standing.
- Yes, sir.

1362
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:21,370
Just a second, Joseph.
I'm sorry.

1363
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,880
That's quite all right, ma'am.

1364
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,290
On the night of this incident,

1365
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,820
why did you go into
Mrs. Strubing's room?

1366
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:38,760
To ask her for money. I had to pay
a man I'd been playing cards with.

1367
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,690
What happened
when you got to the room?

1368
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,740
I knocked on the door.

1369
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,680
Come in.

1370
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,850
I could tell she'd been sad.
She was crying.

1371
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,610
- Are you okay, ma'am?
- What do you want, Joseph?

1372
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,020
It can wait, Mrs. Strubing.

1373
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,190
But she told me to stay,
ask my question.

1374
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:09,790
I told her I needed some money.
She asked what for.

1375
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,760
There's a man I owe.

1376
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,600
Ah.

1377
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,640
So she went to the bureau.

1378
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,740
She said, "Is this enough for you, Joseph?"
I said, "Yes, ma'am. Thank you."

1379
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,910
But she didn't give it to me.
Then she asked me...

1380
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,980
I'm not awful like him,
am I, Joseph?

1381
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:39,990
No, ma'am.

1382
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,360
Joseph.

1383
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:53,970
She asked me not to
leave her alone that night.

1384
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,140
And, uh... I didn't.

1385
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,400
Then what happened?

1386
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,800
Well, we went down to the living room,
me and her.

1387
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,940
- We had a drink together.
- What did the two of you talk about?

1388
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:32,340
She told me he beats her.

1389
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,610
Who beats her?

1390
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,820
Who did that?

1391
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,350
My husband.

1392
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,080
Did she ever resist you, Joseph?

1393
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,050
No, she didn't.
Not at all.

1394
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,620
What happened next?

1395
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:27,060
We were lying on the sofa.

1396
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:42,010
Oh, God.

1397
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:45,380
- And she heard some dogs barking.
- Joseph.

1398
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,680
She was convinced somebody was gonna
come to the house and find us together.

1399
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,250
Get up. Get up!

1400
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:54,620
Nobody gonna wake up.

1401
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:58,020
She started panicking. I told her
there's no one coming. Everything's fine.

1402
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,830
But she was insisting on,
"We gotta get out of here.

1403
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:04,330
We gotta get out of here right now."
So we left the house.

1404
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:08,300
We go down to the car,
and we drive around for a bit.

1405
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,970
She sat in the back,
so it don't look wrong.

1406
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:14,940
Then the cop car
come up from behind.

1407
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,180
She get real scared.

1408
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,180
She say...
Why don't you lie down and keep quiet?

1409
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,810
I can't be seen
with a colored man.

1410
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:24,250
I say, "You lie down
and keep quiet then."

1411
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,490
Don't move. Shh. Shh.

1412
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,320
Oh.
Shh, shh.

1413
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:36,360
Where'd you get this car, boy?

1414
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,800
I'm a chauffeur, sir. Belongs to John
Strubing. Greenwich, Connecticut.

1415
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,970
Identification.
Yes, sir.

1416
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,010
Drive slower, boy.
Yes, sir.

1417
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,950
Get your ass
out of Port Chester.

1418
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:58,520
On my way right now, sir.
Thank you.

1419
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,220
What happened next?

1420
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:04,160
We get to the reservoir,
and, uh, she scream at me.

1421
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,890
Joseph, stop the car.
Stop the car!

1422
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,060
Joseph, stop the car!

1423
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,130
What's the matter?

1424
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,530
She keeps shaking her head
and saying, "What have I done?"

1425
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,740
Everything's gonna be fine,
Mrs. Strubing.

1426
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:18,040
Just take a deep breath,
okay? No, no, no, no.

1427
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,070
No, you don't understand.

1428
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:24,480
Maybe we should just
go back to the house, huh?

1429
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,780
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

1430
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:31,780
She keeps saying, "I'm gonna get pregnant."
"No, you ain't," I said.

1431
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:34,420
- You're not gonna get pregnant.
- I can't have a colored child.

1432
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,820
You're not gonna have
no babies at all, okay?

1433
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:39,790
I say,
"Just let me take you home."

1434
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,090
And she screamed at me.

1435
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,930
Let me out of the car!

1436
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:45,670
I'm gonna tell everybody
you raped me!

1437
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,600
She go to open the door,
and I grabbed her.

1438
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,740
Let me go!
Just to keep her there.

1439
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,940
That's when she scratches my arm.
Mrs. Strubing.

1440
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,740
Hey. Hey!

1441
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,280
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1442
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,250
Mrs. Strubing,
what you doing up there?

1443
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,280
I yell at her
to come back, but...

1444
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:07,090
Come on down right now.
Let's get in the car and go home.

1445
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,790
She just turned away.

1446
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:10,560
Mrs. Strub...

1447
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,410
Joseph, did you rape
Mrs. Strubing?

1448
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,850
No. I did not.

1449
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,950
Thank you, Joseph.

1450
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,260
Your witness.

1451
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,460
Not bad.

1452
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:51,130
You wouldn't lie to the jury, would
you, Joseph? Not bad at all.

1453
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,800
No, sir, I wouldn't.

1454
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,700
But the fact is,
you are a liar, aren't you?

1455
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,640
Objection!
Argumentative.

1456
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,140
Overruled.
It's cross-examination.

1457
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,180
He's okay.

1458
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:06,210
When you married
your first wife, Hattie,

1459
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:09,520
you swore to God you'd be faithful to her,
did you not?

1460
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,450
- Yes, sir.
- But you weren't. It was a lie.

1461
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,660
You could say.

1462
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:19,330
You told her you'd take care
of your children, didn't you?

1463
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:22,130
Yes, sir.
But you haven't, have you?

1464
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:25,830
Not so much as I should.

1465
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:29,670
Then you were in the service
and you swore to honor your country.

1466
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,700
But that was a lie too.
No.

1467
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:36,340
Then you came north and you stole from
your first employer?

1468
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:38,140
When the police picked
you up, you lied to

1469
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:40,080
them about your whereabouts
the night before.

1470
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,750
- Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

1471
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,420
You gave a statement under oath
that you were in a bar all night.

1472
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,420
Yes.

1473
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,260
So you lied to your wife,
you lied to the State of Louisiana,

1474
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,790
you lied to the police,
you lied to God.

1475
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,060
Why should anyone
believe you now?

1476
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,770
I don't know why they should,
except it's the truth.

1477
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:05,470
The truth? If it's the truth,
why not tell it from the beginning?

1478
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:08,710
If you're an innocent man,
why lie?

1479
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:13,710
Why lie, Mr. Spell? Answer the question.
Tell him, Joseph.

1480
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:18,450
If you were an innocent man,
why would you lie?

1481
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:21,920
I tell the police I was with her,
it was what she wanted?

1482
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,060
If it's the truth.

1483
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,230
In Louisiana, you know what they do to me
for being with a white woman like that?

1484
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:31,100
If they don't kill me
right then and there,

1485
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,170
soon enough the others come,
they drag me off, they tie me up,

1486
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,200
they cut off my manhood.

1487
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:42,240
And then I'd be swingin'
off the branch of some tree.

1488
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:46,310
So... why'd I lie,
Mr. Willis?

1489
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,080
Because the truth
gets me killed.

1490
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,050
That's why.

1491
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,550
I move the answer be stricken.

1492
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,240
The answer will stand.

1493
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:21,410
Mr. Willis?

1494
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,690
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1495
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:43,040
You know what?

1496
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,810
It finally looks like a respectable
law office in here.

1497
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,310
Come in.

1498
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,480
There's someone here
to see you, Mr. Marshall.

1499
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,450
Walter?

1500
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,060
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?

1501
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:07,730
I'll just move
to Irwin's office.

1502
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,430
Come on, Walter.

1503
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,270
What is this?

1504
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,200
Fourteen-year-old boy in Mississippi.
They say he killed a cop.

1505
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:21,040
He needs a lawyer.

1506
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,040
- And I have to leave tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1507
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:26,210
He ready with the summation?

1508
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:29,050
Sam? He will be.

1509
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:32,320
Then there's no reason for you to stay.
I'll take care of everything.

1510
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,770
You get the picture
Renie left you?

1511
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,270
Ah, yes.

1512
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:55,010
Now, what kind of plane is this?

1513
01:36:56,110 --> 01:37:00,050
She said
it's supposed to be you.

1514
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:02,310
Those are ears, not wings.
Ah!

1515
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,680
She's quite a talent.

1516
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,590
You were right, you know.

1517
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,960
About what?
"Why would she lie?"

1518
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,630
Mmm.

1519
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,700
That is the question
we needed to answer.

1520
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,370
Well...

1521
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:26,540
I'm thankful Renie got to see there's men
like you in the world.

1522
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,310
I don't understand how you can leave
before closing arguments.

1523
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:37,180
Doesn't do anyone any good having me
sit around waiting on a verdict.

1524
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:39,290
What if something comes up?

1525
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:41,950
The case is in, Sam.

1526
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,960
Walter will represent the NAACP.

1527
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,430
And you'll be there for Spell.

1528
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:56,800
Sam, did you know
I only have one testicle?

1529
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,840
Um... no.

1530
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,770
Yeah.

1531
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:06,150
In my college years, I found myself running
from a gang of bigots

1532
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:09,680
in a part of town they didn't believe
I should be in.

1533
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,880
My buddies, they're ahead of me
in a truck.

1534
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:14,190
I jump for the back,
and I'm pulling myself up,

1535
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:18,520
but there's a jagged spike
of metal I don't see.

1536
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:21,630
It slashes
right through my sack.

1537
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,130
Yeah.

1538
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,800
Why am I telling you this?

1539
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,970
Well, I want you to know

1540
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:32,140
that even sitting
in the back of that pickup,

1541
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,970
my scrotum torn,

1542
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:37,010
every bump sending shocks
of pain down my leg,

1543
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:40,080
even that wasn't as excruciating
as sitting there

1544
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,180
watching you argue this case
these past few weeks.

1545
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:52,160
- But I did learn something.
- Huh?

1546
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:57,500
I need an army of lawyers
just like you, Sam.

1547
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:01,070
Lawyers who don't even know
they want to make a difference,

1548
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:04,770
who with just a little bit of training
can be just as capable as me.

1549
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,980
Well, almost as capable.

1550
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:16,050
And until then what?

1551
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:20,120
You just travel around the country
on this crusade?

1552
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,390
Putting out fires
in Mississippi,

1553
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:26,960
Oklahoma, Bridgeport?

1554
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,200
It's not really fires
I'm after, Sam.

1555
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:33,700
It's fire itself.

1556
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:38,670
Get out your pen now.

1557
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,780
Here's the closing argument
you're gonna give.

1558
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:46,080
Who is telling the truth?

1559
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:50,880
A woman from a fine family
with an unblemished background,

1560
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:53,220
or a depraved man,

1561
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,620
a repeat criminal
with no morals,

1562
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:59,960
a man whose whole life has been composed
of a series of lies?

1563
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,100
Did this decent, church-going,
intelligent woman,

1564
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,930
the graduate of a top college,

1565
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:10,970
engage in voluntary sexual relations
with her Negro servant

1566
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:13,270
and then jump
into the water, for what?

1567
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:16,680
For pleasure,
as the defense would have you believe?

1568
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,080
Of course not.

1569
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,750
Joseph Spell raped
Eleanor Strubing.

1570
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,320
Then he hurled her over the bridge to kill
the only witness to his crime.

1571
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,690
Acquit him, and you will set
a wild panther loose in our midst

1572
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,660
to stalk more victims,

1573
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,860
to threaten the safety
and security

1574
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,660
of each and every woman
in the State of Connecticut.

1575
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:41,100
As a jury, you have been exposed

1576
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,340
to the darkness
of a sinister man's soul.

1577
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:50,480
But you're also in a position
of great privilege.

1578
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,050
Because you...

1579
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:55,680
you have the power

1580
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:59,250
to do justice
on behalf of all of us.

1581
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,590
Bullshit.
Thank you.

1582
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,420
And God bless.

1583
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,770
Mr. Friedman.

1584
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:21,870
Why would a woman
like Eleanor Strubing

1585
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,750
consent... no, encourage...
sexual relations

1586
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,050
with a man like Joseph Spell?

1587
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,380
Let me tell you why.

1588
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:36,420
Eleanor Strubing's story
is nothing less than tragic.

1589
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:39,360
She is a respectable woman
from a fine family.

1590
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,060
She attended the best schools.

1591
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:44,660
She went to church
each and every Sunday.

1592
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:48,270
As the good book says, she was "spotless
as the lamb of God."

1593
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:52,100
She was "spotless
as the lamb of God."

1594
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:54,870
She and her husband John
move to Greenwich.

1595
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,940
Oh, he travels frequently,

1596
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:00,080
leaving her alone in a new town,

1597
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,950
away from her friends
and family,

1598
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,950
in a vast, empty house.

1599
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:08,220
The pangs of loneliness
hit hard.

1600
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,660
She has some drinks.

1601
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,990
A knock at the door.

1602
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:16,860
- Joseph.
- Joseph.

1603
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:20,200
She was not expecting this.

1604
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,070
A young man, a handsome man.

1605
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:26,610
In a moment of weakness,
her judgment impaired

1606
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:28,270
by the alcohol
of the evening...

1607
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,640
Consumed by loneliness,

1608
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,380
she invites him to share her bed
to ease her pain.

1609
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,620
As the evening goes on,
she becomes panicked

1610
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:39,490
that they will be discovered.

1611
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:43,120
She must leave the house,
must escape her sin.

1612
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,060
- What if she is pregnant...
- And with a colored child?

1613
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:50,630
What if her husband were to find out?
What would he do to her?

1614
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:54,430
She cannot live
with the fear, the shame.

1615
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,940
So then there they are,
at the reservoir.

1616
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:02,740
An opportunity to escape
her life, her despair.

1617
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:06,280
Joseph tries to hold her back,
but she wrangles free, runs from the car.

1618
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,280
And she plummets into the water.

1619
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:13,750
Only as soon
as she hits the surface,

1620
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,190
her years of training take over.

1621
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,660
See, she is a swimmer.

1622
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,630
And she simply cannot drown.

1623
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:24,130
With the zeal
to end her life gone,

1624
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,300
her only escape...

1625
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,870
She must accuse him.

1626
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,440
And so a story is created.

1627
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,770
A web of...

1628
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,310
desperate lies

1629
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:41,850
filled with inconsistencies,
absurdities,

1630
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,480
reasonable doubts.

1631
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:48,020
The State must prove its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1632
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:50,390
It must be a clear case.

1633
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:54,260
No scream for help
all night long.

1634
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,000
Doubt.

1635
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,130
No call on
the four family phones.

1636
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:02,230
Doubt.

1637
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,140
No cry to the officer
just a few feet away.

1638
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,510
Doubt.

1639
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:09,340
No rocks on a bridge.

1640
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,540
Doubt.

1641
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,550
Doubt, doubt, doubt.

1642
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:17,850
The doubt, my friends,

1643
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:19,590
is overwhelming.

1644
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:24,660
This is why you must find
Joseph Spell not guilty.

1645
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:27,090
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1646
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:29,560
you've heard the arguments
of counsel.

1647
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:33,300
You may now retire to the jury room
to begin your deliberations.

1648
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:35,800
Court is in recess.

1649
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,380
Who is it?

1650
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:50,920
It's me.

1651
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,190
Mmm!

1652
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,400
You're supposed
to be on a train.

1653
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,500
I have a little time.

1654
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,870
I heard you were looking for me.

1655
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:19,210
Well, Friedman, it seems you have
beginner's luck.

1656
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:21,650
John Strubing just called me.

1657
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:24,720
This whole thing has been a terrible
strain on Ellie, as you can imagine.

1658
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:27,220
They want it over, now.

1659
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,790
I'm prepared to offer
one final deal.

1660
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:32,320
What is it?
Five years.

1661
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:35,960
He'll have to enter a guilty plea right
away and admit he lied on the stand.

1662
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,400
I'll speak with him.
Do it now.

1663
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,870
If the jury comes back in,
the deal is off.

1664
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:51,480
You'd be out after three years,
with good behavior.

1665
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:55,350
Possibly sooner.
You think I should take it?

1666
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:57,350
I don't know
what the jury will do.

1667
01:45:57,350 --> 01:46:00,250
It's a good deal.

1668
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,790
And if they convict me?

1669
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:05,660
Most likely you'll spend the rest
of your life in a prison cell.

1670
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:10,060
And I got to decide right away?

1671
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,230
What I gotta do for the deal?

1672
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:20,440
Admit that you raped her and that you lied
on the witness stand.

1673
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,310
Can I talk
to Mr. Marshall?

1674
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:27,510
He's on a train probably somewhere
in Tennessee by now.

1675
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:29,750
I would never be able
to reach him in time.

1676
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,420
What do you think he would say?

1677
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:44,560
Ah.

1678
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,370
So, give me good news.

1679
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:54,270
No deal.

1680
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,080
You did advise him
to accept, hmm?

1681
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,710
I told him it was a good offer.

1682
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:02,650
I told him
what the alternative is.

1683
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:05,820
I told him if it was me,
I would take it.

1684
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:12,290
And I told him that no man should ever
confess to a crime he did not commit.

1685
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:19,260
I thought Jews were supposed
to be smart.

1686
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:21,270
But you sound
just like the Negro.

1687
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,740
Why, thank you, Lorin.

1688
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:29,640
That's possibly the greatest compliment
you could've given me.

1689
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,170
There's a verdict.

1690
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:10,480
Will the foreman
please rise.

1691
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:13,190
I'm the forewoman, Your Honor.

1692
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,660
Very well.

1693
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,490
Have you reached a verdict?

1694
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,060
We have, Your Honor.

1695
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:23,500
Mr. Spell.

1696
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,330
Rise and face the jury.
It's time.

1697
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,370
Madame Forewoman,
what is your verdict?

1698
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:38,340
We, the jury, find,
on the charge of rape,

1699
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:40,450
that the defendant,
Joseph Spell,

1700
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:42,150
is not guilty.

1701
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:56,560
Order.

1702
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,700
Is this your verdict,
so say you all?

1703
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,800
We do, Your Honor.

1704
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,300
That's it, Joseph.

1705
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:06,940
We did it.

1706
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:10,380
Mr. Spell, the jury
has found you not guilty.

1707
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,740
You are released from custody.

1708
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:15,780
Jury is dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

1709
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:18,180
All rise.

1710
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:39,470

- Thank you.

1711
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,550
Mr. Spell.

1712
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:48,880
Hi.
I'm Tad Lancaster.

1713
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,220
Mr. Marshall thought you might need a place
to sleep tonight.

1714
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,950
Oh, Mr. Marshall.

1715
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:07,130
Hello?
Hello.

1716
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:10,540
Sam.

1717
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:13,070
Sam, I can barely hear you.

1718
01:50:13,070 --> 01:50:16,940
- Is there a verdict yet?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

1719
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:18,880
Sam, are you there?
Yeah.

1720
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,550
Yes, can you hear me?
Sam?

1721
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,180
Not guilty! We did it!

1722
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,920
- What?
- Not guilty!

1723
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,850
Not guilty!

1724
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:30,620
Not guilty.

1725
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:33,190
Not guilty!
Sam!

1726
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:34,730
Yes!
Oh!

1727
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:36,160
Yes. We won!

1728
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,530
Sam, I told you.
I told you.

1729
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:41,600
I told you you could bring it home.
I told you.

1730
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,570
Yeah! Yes, we did it!

1731
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,040
Ah.

1732
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,140
Thurgood,
I'm having trouble hearing you.

1733
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,480
Sam, are you there?
Are you there?

1734
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:57,480
Thurgood!

1735
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:57,940
Oh, Luis.
Marshall!

1736
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,980
Your wife still putting up with you?
Look at me.

1737
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,950
She dress me from head to toe.

1738
01:52:01,950 --> 01:52:04,780
Got me looking as sharp as you.

1739
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:07,020
God bless you.
We really need your help.

1740
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:10,060
I promise you I'll do everything
in my power to help him.

1741
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,790
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Marshall.

We really need you in Mississippi.
My pleasure.

Are you hungry?

1745
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:23,200
You know, I very nearly
ate my briefcase on that train.

1746
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,500
Well, when we get to the house,
I'll fix you a nice supper.

1747
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:31,040
That'll be nice. You can fill me
in on everything that's going on down here.
