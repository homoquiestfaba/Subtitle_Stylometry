1
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,426
Cancel the noise.

2
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,387
Listen.

3
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,694
Music's everywhere.

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,004
We breathe and we
swallow with the place.

5
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,225
Pay attention to it.

6
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,142
Do let it connect.

7
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,973
There's a pleasing
combination of elements.

8
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:04,238
They all have different
callers and different sounds.

9
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,154
Listen to them.

10
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:10,635
There is a deep structure.

11
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,987
Music aligned.

12
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,468
The harmony that
complements the melody.

13
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,298
Don't pay attention
to the noise.

14
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,085
That is only noise.

15
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:29,480
Concentrate your attention.

16
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,702
Recalibrate your mind.

17
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,661
Music is inside.

18
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,536
It resides inside of you.

19
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,279
Just feel it.

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,718
Just sense it.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,983
Embrace it.

22
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,684
It's coming from you. It's
coming from your heart.

23
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,949
Music is right there.

24
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,344
That's what I learned from you.

25
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,828
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Minton's Playhouse,

26
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,658
the most iconic jazz parlor
in Harlem, New York City,

27
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,226
the United States,
and the world.

28
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,532
Minton's was
established in 1938.

29
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:25,579
We are celebrating 81
years of musical legacy.

30
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:28,626
Today we have a
very special guest,

31
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,325
He is a great
Cuban-American singer,

32
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:35,372
so please, help me
welcome Mr. Nico Quevedo.

33
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,351
Thank you for that.

34
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,180
You know, this moment...

35
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,705
right here, right now...

36
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,970
is all we have.

37
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,189
It's all we are.

38
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,323
This night.

39
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,978
So let's have fun
tonight. Right?

40
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,418
Let's give it up for the band.

41
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,822
Now this song,

42
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,520
this one's special for me,

43
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,697
because I couldn't sing
this song in a while.

44
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,048
And as we said,
tonight is the night.

45
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,314
As the old ones
used to say in Cuba,

46
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,665
if you want your
rumba to be profound,

47
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,059
you have to learn how to
sing out of your own pain.

48
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,974
You want your rumba to be heard,

49
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,542
let the drums cry your sorrow.

50
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,328
Allow your heart
to sing your blues.

51
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:09,161
I made this song

52
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,556
when I learned how to
transform my pain into music.

53
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,166
You have
to help me on this.

54
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,519
I really need you.

55
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,873
Nico!

56
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,397
Nico.

57
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,574
Yeah.

58
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,605
Yeah, why not? I'll
take it to go, though.

59
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,304
- Thank you.
- Go?

60
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,400
Good old days, huh? Good
old days are gone, Chino.

61
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:54,142
I'll pay for it next
week. Thank you.

62
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,557
You're cheating on the world.

63
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:04,778
What are you talking about?

64
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,500
I don't get it.

65
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,507
I don't fucking get it!

66
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,870
You said you were
gonna help me on this.

67
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,092
You told me that.

68
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,053
You're full of shit.

69
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,839
Full of... Fuck.

70
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,495
I have to endure
all this by myself,

71
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,323
and you can't even
keep your word?

72
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,371
What's wrong with you?

73
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,025
What's the matter?

74
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,642
I stayed here because of you.

75
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,473
We had something. It
was something special.

76
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,344
It was real.

77
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,130
What do I have now?

78
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:39,220
Nothing. I have nothing.

79
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,285
You don't wanna talk to me.
You don't wanna listen to me.

80
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,833
You don't wanna pay attention
to me. You don't wanna help me.

81
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:47,489
What do you want? What
the fuck do you want?!

82
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,022
You want rum?

83
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,027
Let me get you a
little bit of rum.

84
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,746
You
wanna go to the beach?

85
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,835
Hmm?

86
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,098
I can take you to a
baseball game if you want.

87
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,754
We can have drinks.

88
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,845
We can go out.

89
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,282
We can have fun. Is
that what you want?

90
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,373
Huh?

91
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,749
What do you want? What
the fuck do you want?!

92
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,838
What do you want?!

93
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:23,890
You...

94
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,415
You're not clear with me.

95
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,680
There's just no
communication at all.

96
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,858
You don't wanna be
my friend no more?

97
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,253
Why?

98
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,866
Why are you doing
this to me? Why?

99
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,047
I can't sing.

100
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,489
I can't... write.

101
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:04,887
I can't... I cannot play
because I don't feel it.

102
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,283
I don't have it no more.

103
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,857
I don't have...

104
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,034
Don't take that
away from me, bro.

105
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:29,085
Don't take it away from me
because that's all I have.

106
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,652
That's all I have.

107
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,437
Don't take it away.

108
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,835
Don't take it away from me.

109
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
Don't take it away from me.

110
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:55,958
Don't
take it away.

111
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,091
Thank you.

112
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,398
Hey, really cool music,
Nicolas. Nicolas, is it?

113
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,835
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,316
Man, I heard you're not
even from around here.

115
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,971
I was born in Jersey,
but I'm Cuban.

116
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,383
And what brought
you back out here?

117
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:00,062
Well, you know, oh, music.

118
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:03,196
Well, listen. You got
that music thing down.

119
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:06,068
Is it all, like, your music?

120
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,461
- Eh.

121
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,289
Wrote it with my best friend.

122
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,638
Anyway, listen. Really,
really cool music.

123
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,858
- I'm Bob Arenas, by the way.
- Ah, Nicolas .

124
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,036
So which one was he in the band,

125
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,213
your friend in the band?

126
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:23,520
He's dead. Passed
away three months ago.

127
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:27,133
Sorry about that,
man. I-I didn't know.

128
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,786
What was his name?

129
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,138
Celso.

130
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,010
Celso Quiñones.

131
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,535
- It was nice meeting you.
- Um...

132
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,537
Hey, you know...

133
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm a music manager and
producer in New York.

134
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,976
Check it out.

135
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:51,505
Listen, I would like to discuss
with you the possibility

136
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,160
of bringing you
back out there, man.

137
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,162
I really like what
you have, seriously,

138
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,512
and I think New York
is a better market...

139
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,123
Look, I'm... I'm not interested.

140
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:04,039
You must be the
only Cuban musician

141
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,910
that has no interest
in getting out of here.

142
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,043
- Gotta go. Thank you.
- Hey, Nico.

143
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,176
Just... Listen,
think about it.

144
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,526
The number in the back
is where I'm staying.

145
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,136
Check out the back.

146
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,357
If you change your
mind, hit me up.

147
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,447
I can help you. Trust me.

148
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,458
Nico!

149
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,083
I thought I would
never see you again.

150
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,477
I promised I was
gonna come back.

151
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,524
Yeah.

152
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,570
That was four years ago.

153
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,093
I never said when.

154
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,212
And I had a good teacher.

155
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,053
I can't believe he's gone.

156
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,360
Yep.

157
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,408
We had good
times together.

158
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,417
Ahh.

159
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,203
We wanted to change
the world with music.

160
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,816
We wanted to take all this...

161
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,427
our roots, our
background, the poetry,

162
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,822
and to put it out there.

163
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:17,825
I wanted to understand
who I was, and now...

164
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:22,786
I don't even know who I am.

165
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,181
And then... cancer.

166
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,316
Cancer took everything from him.

167
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,800
I took care of him all the
way to the end, you know.

168
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,499
One day...

169
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:43,067
One day we were celebrating
his last birthday,

170
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,984
and I sang a song
I wrote for him.

171
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:51,337
When I finished, he looked at
me in the eye and he said...

172
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,037
"You have to promise me.
You have to promise me that

173
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,563
no matter what,

174
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,872
you'll never stop doing this."
And I said, "I promise."

175
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,483
And then, his last day...

176
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,531
his last day,

177
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,880
the pain was killing him.

178
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,669
I didn't know...

179
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:24,631
I didn't know what to do to
relieve his pain, you know?

180
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,643
And I sang that song for him.

181
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,086
He was calm. He was...

182
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,090
He was... breathing.

183
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:53,747
He smiled... again.

184
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,972
That was the last
song I could write.

185
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,548
That was the last time I
could sing from my heart.

186
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,074
I needed this.

187
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,860
Me?

188
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,648
No.

189
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,476
I needed to be back home.

190
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:04,660
My life there is not
what it used to be here.

191
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,229
Sometimes I...

192
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,667
I feel out of place.

193
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:17,586
We're always gonna
feel out of place.

194
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,327
We're always gonna
need something

195
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:20,894
because we're immigrants.

196
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,898
When are you heading
back to New York?

197
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,029
Tomorrow.

198
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,470
If you ever go back,
you should call me.

199
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,167
- I will.
- Right!

200
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,691
- Yeah, I promise I will.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,260
That's what you
said when I left.

202
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:44,004
You and Celso were gonna
make it to the States.

203
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,487
You wanted to bring all
your music to New York.

204
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,623
What happened to that dream?

205
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:51,114
Hey, Bob, it's me. Nicolas.

206
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:55,641
Yeah. You blew me away
with your talent, Nicolas.

207
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,426
No, man, you're very special.

208
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,820
You have something
really special, man.

209
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,822
- Thanks.
- Nah, don't thank me.

210
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,232
We're doing business, my friend.

211
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,740
Aha!

212
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,092
Now, see, I usually
charge my clients 50%

213
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,529
for management and production
and that type of thing,

214
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,010
but I understand your
particular situation,

215
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:21,362
so I'm willing to lower my
fee to 30% of your profits.

216
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:28,587
- Thirty percent?
- Off the gross, of course.

217
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,893
But... hey, look,

218
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:34,593
the good thing is, as soon
as you get to New York,

219
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,595
you'll have a job.

220
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,555
- Huh? Isn't that somethin'?
- Yeah.

221
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,297
Isn't it crazy how two
Americans can close on a deal

222
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,908
out here in this
place, out in Cuba?

223
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,999
- Yeah. It's a new time.
- Hell, yeah.

224
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,133
Listen, I gotta talk to
you about something else.

225
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,700
What's that?

226
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,224
I don't have a place
to stay in New York.

227
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:00,096
Say no more. You look for me.

228
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,490
Okay? Mi casa es
su casa, baby.

229
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,274
You got that right.
You got it right.

230
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:05,817
- You know what I'm saying?
- Right. Yes.

231
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,277
- Huh?
- Yeah, you got it right.

232
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,497
Excuse me, sir. There's
someone waiting for you.

233
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,328
I have to go, man.
I have to get out.

234
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,113
It's my last night, and I
got a very special date,

235
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:20,421
but I'll see you
in New York. Yes?

236
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:24,294
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

237
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:28,516
You're very special,
Nicolas. Don't forget it.

238
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:57,893
Looks like we're
going to New York.

239
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:05,744
Hey, can
you open the door?

240
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,835
Hey, are
you fucking deaf?

241
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,488
Answer the door.

242
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,577
Mom! I'm
in the bathroom.

243
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,188
Fuck!

244
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,451
This is the third time you've
been in bathroom today.

245
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:20,584
I swear you spend more time on
the toilet than anywhere else.

246
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,850
Hey.

247
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:28,767
- What do you fucking need?
- Oh! Is, uh, Bob here?

248
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,466
No. I haven't seen that
piece of shit in months.

249
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:36,165
- What do you need him for?
- Well... I'm... My name is Nico.

250
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,167
And Bob and I met a
few months ago in Cuba.

251
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,953
He offered me a contract
to come and work with him.

252
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,955
- I'm sorry. Did you say Cuba?
- Yeah.

253
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,305
Yeah, Cuba. I was...
I was living in Cuba,

254
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,718
and he saw me perform in the
streets when he approached me.

255
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:50,005
- In Cuba?
- Yes, in Cuba.

256
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,441
Yeah. When was this?

257
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:54,096
Well, as I said,
a few months ago.

258
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,013
Fuck. I told you your
father was a piece of shit!

259
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:59,667
What?

260
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,297
He was supposed to be
at a spiritual retreat,

261
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,081
trying to find himself, and
you're telling me he was

262
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,890
messing around with
you, blowing lines

263
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,675
and banging whores in Cuba,
you fucking piece of garbage!

264
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,459
What? Mom, who's that?

265
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,220
Oh! There's some fucking
animal here that says

266
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,290
he's been with your father
in Cuba a few months ago

267
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:16,727
when your fucking father
was supposed to be in Ohio,

268
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:19,426
saving his fucking soul.
- What are you talking about?

269
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:22,298
He's been fucking whoring
around behind my back?

270
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,648
Again?

271
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,129
Seriously?!

272
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,262
Again?

273
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:31,153
You know, he told me after
Colombia he wouldn't do it,

274
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:34,920
but here we are. You
fucking piece of cocksucker!

275
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,184
- I-I-I...
- Don't talk to me, you pervert.

276
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:40,118
You were what, making a
mockery of me with him?

277
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:41,927
- No. I...
- Down in Cuba, having a party.

278
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,905
Now you're coming to my house.
What, you wanna do it here?

279
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,583
- No, I'm just a musician.
- Stop!

280
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,281
I'ma musician.

281
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:52,328
He was supposed
to be my manager,

282
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,982
and look where that got me.

283
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,766
He can't even
manage his own life.

284
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,030
How's he supposed
to manage your life?

285
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:03,252
My family won't even look
at me after being with him.

286
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,732
So let me do you a favor.

287
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,908
If you don't want
me to fuck you up,

288
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,998
get the fuck outta
here right now!

289
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,261
Get the fuck out!
Fucking monkey!

290
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,611
I'm gonna throw your
dirty ass down the stairs!

291
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,396
How dare you come to my house?!

292
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,355
If I ever see your face again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

293
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,749
If you're lucky.

294
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,112
Here's your water. No ice.

295
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,071
- Thank you.

296
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,947
Temerario Restaurant.

297
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:48,341
Hi, I'm
looking for Telmaris.

298
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,169
- Is she there?
- Who is this?

299
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,345
This is Nico. I'm
her friend from Cuba.

300
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,781
I am sorry, but
we're not allowed

301
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,280
to take personal
calls while we work.

302
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,393
I know. I know. I know.

303
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:59,874
It's just that this
is really important.

304
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,355
Let me see what I
can do. Hold on.

305
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,880
What's happening?

306
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,230
Uh, it's that guy that only
Telmaris can understand.

307
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,581
He wants to place an order.

308
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,322
That one?
Yeah, that's amazing.

309
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,238
- It comes with the ice. Uh...
- It's a guy from Cuba. Nico.

310
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:19,807
He wants to talk to you. He
says it's kind of urgent.

311
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,983
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

312
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,595
This is
today's special.

313
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,728
- Is everything good?
- Good.

314
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,477
- Hello?
- Hey.

315
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,132
I promised I'd call you as
soon as I get to New York.

316
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,829
Nico.

317
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,702
This is Celso.

318
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,378
What do you mean, this is Celso?

319
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,403
Yeah.

320
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,451
I... kept his ashes.

321
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,714
What?

322
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,153
Look.

323
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:05,505
I use four seashells to
communicate with him.

324
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:08,029
So if I throw 'em,
and the four of them,

325
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,162
they land facing
down, that means no.

326
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,902
If they face up, that means yes.

327
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,296
If I have three of them
facing down, one down...

328
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:19,258
- You out of your mind?
- No, no, no. This is serious.

329
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,215
I can talk to him.

330
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:22,087
And everything makes sense now

331
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:25,960
because he's not
really happy lately.

332
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,745
We went back. You came to Cuba.

333
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:32,880
You mentioned his dream.

334
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:37,624
I realized that this is
exactly what he wanted.

335
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,627
He always wanted to
be here in New York.

336
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,195
He wanted to be closer to you.

337
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,119
I'm not going to...

338
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,947
This is the completion
of his dream, Telmaris.

339
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,212
- Stop, Nico. This is insane.
- This is not insane.

340
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:01,972
- He's dead.
- I'm just trying to explain...

341
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,737
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

342
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,479
- Need some more coffee?
- No. Just the check.

343
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,263
- Ah. Okay.
- Thanks.

344
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,746
- He's dead.
- No, he's not.

345
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,791
- He's gone.
- He's not.

346
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,358
He was your best friend,

347
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,969
and what you guys lived
together was incredible,

348
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,929
but you have to realize that
he's no longer with you.

349
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:24,235
What I had with
him was beautiful.

350
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,803
It's in the past.
It was over many...

351
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,589
- He wanted you back in his life.
- What are you talking about?

352
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,031
You and I had sex
only a few months ago,

353
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:41,166
and now you're
telling me all this?

354
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:43,646
What you're doing
to yourself is sick.

355
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,737
What you're doing to
him is disrespectful.

356
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,480
Telmaris. Listen. Telmaris!

357
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:55,614
Here's the check.

358
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,157
Hi, Norman. I'm back.

359
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,856
How'd it go?

360
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,337
It wasn't what I expected.

361
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:24,383
Guys are fucking retarded.

362
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,689
The only head they
have is their dick.

363
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,518
Speaking of dickheads...

364
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,307
Thought you were
gonna be gone an hour.

365
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,135
It's barely 30 minutes.

366
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,745
Yeah.

367
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,921
What kind of emergency is that?

368
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,706
Never mind. It's all good now.

369
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,538
- I can't stand him.
- I know.

370
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,237
You can quit anytime.

371
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,866
I can't. I have to
send money to my mom.

372
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,241
She's taking care of my kid.

373
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:59,069
But you're by yourself.
It's better that way.

374
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,420
The minute you don't have
someone depending on you,

375
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,204
there is no freedom
in this place.

376
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:06,251
- That's all bullshit.

377
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,992
When I came to this country,
I wanted to build my dreams.

378
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,822
I wanted to become an
actress, and look at me.

379
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,956
Six years later, I keep
on doing this shit.

380
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:21,135
We come here to become
slaves, to work our asses off

381
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,094
so someone else has
that freedom we pursue.

382
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:29,056
But if I think of my
four-year-old back home smiling,

383
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,450
maybe it's worth this crap.

384
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:34,409
What's going on, ladies?

385
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,806
What is this, social
club? Get to work.

386
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,649
- Cancel the noise.

387
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:57,824
Listen.

388
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:08,443
We breathe and we
swallow with the place.

389
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,838
Pay attention to it.

390
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,581
Do let it connect.

391
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,068
Don't pay attention
to the noise.

392
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,464
That is only noise.

393
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,816
Concentrate your attention.

394
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,821
Recalibrate your mind.

395
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,998
Music is inside.

396
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,828
It resides inside of you.

397
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,660
Just feel it.

398
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,275
Just sense it.

399
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,496
Embrace it.

400
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,674
It's coming from you.

401
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,683
Coming from your heart ticking.

402
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,082
Well, this is it.

403
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,041
The Big Apple.

404
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:31,483
The place you always
wanted to come and see.

405
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:37,315
It's a nice view,
isn't it? Huh?

406
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,969
What do you think?

407
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,972
Big Apple.

408
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,635
Is it really that big of a city?

409
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,942
Not really.

410
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,597
Man, think about it.
It's just an island.

411
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:01,600
- Just like Cuba.

412
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,254
- Isn't that paradoxical?
- What?

413
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,214
You and me, we come
from similar places.

414
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,871
Isolated, surrounded by water,

415
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,787
and very different
backgrounds.

416
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,919
Different conditions.

417
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,488
One of us is dying,

418
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:24,231
and the other one is
full of commitments.

419
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:27,408
- Dreams.

420
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,279
You talking about
Cuba and New York,

421
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,369
or are you... you're
talking about you and me?

422
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,460
It's the same.

423
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,422
All right.

424
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,250
I would have loved to
have seen Manhattan.

425
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,991
We can still go.

426
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:48,473
When? I have two weeks.

427
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,649
- Maximum.
- Listen, don't...

428
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,651
- Don't believe everything...
- I know, I'm not.

429
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,915
I know. I know what's
going to happen.

430
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,612
I'm not blind.

431
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:02,443
I would have loved to
have seen my father,

432
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,619
look him in the eyes...

433
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,276
tell him that he
was my inspiration

434
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,452
for being in the music.

435
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,151
My mama always said
he was a unique man.

436
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,590
You think he will
have that jazz place?

437
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,901
I prefer to believe what
my mom used to say...

438
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,468
but at least for
the next two weeks.

439
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,690
- Come on.

440
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,707
Look, I wanna tell you,
that thing with Telmaris,

441
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,057
I didn't plan it. It
just happened, you know?

442
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:58,760
Shut the fuck up!

443
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,939
What is the matter with you?

444
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,595
Can't you see there are
people sleeping around here?

445
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,902
You wanna practice
your fucking monologue,

446
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,556
go someplace else, Shakespeare.

447
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,340
Sorry. I was just
having a conversation.

448
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:16,691
- With who? With your penis?
- No. I was talking...

449
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,519
Never mind.

450
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:21,348
What the fuck are you doing
sitting in my spot, in my park?!

451
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:24,786
Your spot? Your park?

452
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,745
I didn't know this
is private property.

453
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,636
- Get the fuck out of my park!
- Listen, buddy...

454
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,115
- I'm not your buddy.
- Well, listen...

455
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,881
I'm also homeless, okay?

456
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:36,624
Oh, yeah?

457
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,863
- Well, go find your own park.
- This is a public park.

458
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,020
You're not gonna kick me out.

459
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,041
- Fuck you! Get out of my park!
- What's the matter with you?

460
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,522
- You have your spot right there.
- Fuck you! Get out of my park!

461
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,982
Okay, that's fine.
I'm moving on.

462
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:49,768
- Get the fuck outta my spot!
- Okay!

463
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,379
Okay. I'm moving
to that one. Okay?

464
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,598
Is that gonna make you happy?

465
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,775
Freaking asshole.

466
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,907
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

467
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:02,389
If I see you back on my spot or
I hear your snoring at night,

468
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,260
I'll beat the shit outta you!

469
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:06,045
-  Fuck me.
- I heard that!

470
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,359
Damn it!

471
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:18,187
Sick and
tired of fucking bums,

472
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:20,842
invading my goddamn park.

473
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:22,211
Every single night,
the same thing.

474
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:25,194
Every fucking park,

475
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:28,850
invaded by bums
and useless scum!

476
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,548
Not one night...

477
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,825
Fuck!

478
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,713
- Sorry.

479
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:10,882
Shit.

480
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:30,118
Hey! Hey!

481
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:33,078
Hey, I'm talking to
you! Where you going?

482
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:35,950
Hey! Hey!

483
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,389
Hey! Hey!

484
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:42,957
Hey! Hey!

485
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,267
Hey! Stop! Stop!

486
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:51,182
Hey!

487
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,969
Hey! Hey!

488
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:56,362
Hey! Stop! Stop!

489
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,190
- I swear!
- What?

490
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,061
I swear if you come any closer,

491
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,039
- I'll stab the shit out of you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

492
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:04,239
- I wanna get my stuff.
- I warned you yesterday,

493
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,459
and you didn't listen.
I told you not to snore!

494
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:08,243
- What?
- Yesterday I said don't snore,

495
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,898
or there will be consequences,
but you little piece of shit...

496
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:13,422
Wait, wait. I'm
sorry that my snoring

497
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,729
is louder than the
city, okay? I'm sorry.

498
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,427
I didn't mean to intrude.
Look, just let me get my stuff.

499
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:20,081
I'm gonna walk away,
and you will never

500
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:23,432
- hear my snoring ever again.
- You stole my place,

501
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,957
I have the right
to steal from you.

502
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:28,437
That's how it works!
A tooth for a tooth!

503
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:30,091
- I didn't steal from you.

504
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:33,878
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

505
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,837
Look, you said
it. You said it.

506
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,989
A tooth for a tooth. I took your
place for a couple of hours.

507
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:41,320
You took my stuff for
a couple of hours.

508
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,844
- We're even now.
- It doesn't work that way.

509
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:47,282
You know, I am Prince
Roman from Asturias!

510
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:49,807
No motherfucker can dare
come and take my place!

511
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,070
Okay! Okay!

512
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:55,595
Okay, Prince Roman from
whatever the place...

513
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,510
Athurius.

514
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,034
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

515
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:02,080
Look...

516
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:04,952
Look, here's the deal. You
can take everything I have.

517
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,000
It belongs to you now.
Just give me Celso.

518
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,436
- What?
- The handkerchief!

519
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:11,698
A fucking handkerchief!

520
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,700
The handkerchief I
have in my backpack.

521
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:17,704
Ha ha! The fucking backpack!
I don't have it anymore.

522
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:21,534
- What do you mean?
- Sold it!

523
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,189
What do you mean, sold
it? Sold it to who?

524
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,452
Some fucking bum needed it
to move to the East Side.

525
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:28,149
It's a good thing he's gone.

526
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,065
I hate these fucking
homeless invading my park!

527
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:33,024
Well, what's his name?
Where can I find him?

528
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:36,027
He's a bum!

529
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:40,945
I know he's a fucking bum!
I know that! I need more.

530
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:43,077
He wears a Yankees cap
all the time. That's it.

531
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:44,731
Get the fuck outta here!

532
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,535
And don't let me see you
back in my park again.

533
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,867
And if I hear you snoring at
night, there'll be consequences.

534
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:52,870
Freaking weirdo!

535
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,827
Sir?

536
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,655
Can I have a chat with you?

537
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:42,745
Excuse me. Can I have a
conversation with you?

538
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:46,488
Sir? Sir?

539
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,971
Hey? Hello!

540
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:52,842
Can I have a-a...

541
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:55,410
Can I have a conversation
with you for a second?

542
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,586
I-I don't want to
bother you, sir.

543
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:00,459
Sir, can I have a chat with you?

544
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:02,504
Look, it's really
gonna be quick.

545
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,419
I just need to know,

546
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,075
did you buy a backpack from
a homeless guy this morning?

547
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:11,035
Why would I buy a backpack
from a homeless person?

548
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:14,386
I don't know. The only
reason why I'm asking this

549
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:17,998
is because the homeless
guy told me that he sold it

550
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:21,045
- to another homeless guy...
- I look like a homeless person?

551
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:24,962
No. No, no. I didn't mean
to say that. I just...

552
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,790
All I'm saying is that...

553
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,619
He told me that he sold it
to this trashy person...

554
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,491
This trashy person?

555
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,667
Look, buddy, I ain't got
what you want, all right?

556
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:36,317
- I didn't buy a backpack.
- I'm sorry.

557
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,193
- Forget about it.
- I didn't mean to insult...

558
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:40,368
Sir!

559
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:11,573
Hey, pops. What's shaking?

560
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,012
You know, um...

561
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,015
Look, um...

562
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:21,235
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

563
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,281
He's my bro.

564
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:26,197
He has a backpack that
he's trying to sell.

565
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,417
I have some gas. I
have some cash on me.

566
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,898
I wanna give it to him.
You probably know him

567
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:35,858
because he's always
wearing this Yankees cap.

568
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,860
- Nice ass, pal.

569
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:42,952
Well, just give us the cash,
and we'll get it to him.

570
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,738
It doesn't work
like that, you know.

571
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,306
I gotta find him.

572
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,872
I thought you said
he was your bro?

573
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:55,356
Yeah. Yeah, he is my bro.

574
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,533
He's my brother, you
know. He's my pal.

575
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,709
He's actually waiting for me.

576
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:01,753
I know the guy.

577
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,417
You do?

578
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:15,724
I blow him whenever he has a
few bucks and a clean penis.

579
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,509
What's in it for me
if I take you to him?

580
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:20,555
- Five bucks.

581
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,731
- Piece of shit.
- Pendejo.

582
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:26,170
Five bucks won't
even buy us a beer,

583
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,259
and I stopped drinking
cheap a while ago.

584
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,522
- Ten, but that's gonna be it.

585
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,741
You gotta get serious.

586
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,788
Nah! Go 20, and we
may have a deal.

587
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:38,573
Top it off with ten,
I'll throw in a blow job.

588
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:40,532
- No, thank you.
- You're the monster.

589
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,969
- Tony!
- Charles, he's a number 12.

590
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:46,233
He's here to fuck
you in the ass.

591
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:49,106
Sir, I'm sorry. I don't
know what's going on here,

592
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,282
but do we have a deal?

593
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:54,415
I'll give you money, give you 20
but you have to take me to him.

594
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:56,461
Hell, no. Can't you
see I'm playing chess?

595
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,551
Just give me the 20, and I'll
tell you where he hangs out.

596
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:15,741
He hangs out over there,

597
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,786
and we all call
him Prince Armand.

598
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,032
Hey! That's mine.

599
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,686
Stop right there,
okay! That's mine.

600
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,818
Stop right there!
Just give me that!

601
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,124
- Hey!
- Just give me my bag.

602
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,214
Come on! Gimme
that! Gimme that!

603
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:56,434
That's all I need.
Just gimme that...

604
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:58,218
- It's what you want?
- Yes. Gimme Celso.

605
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,002
You don't get it.
That's my friend!

606
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:01,569
That's my friend.
Give it to me.

607
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:03,702
What, are you fucking crazy?
It's a fucking rag, man.

608
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:06,444
No, it is not a rag! That's my
friend. You don't understand.

609
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,272
- Just give it to me, okay?
- Fuck you.

610
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:09,011
- Fuck your rag, too.
- No, no, no!

611
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:16,062
Don't come here no more,
you or your rag, okay?

612
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,804
There'll be big trouble.
Big fucking trouble.

613
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,153
Yes.

614
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:01,287
Bravo.

615
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,289
It seems you've got
something special.

616
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,073
Let's hope we hit
the mark tonight

617
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:06,814
like we did in the rehearsal.

618
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:09,513
Well, Jim. We always do.

619
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,776
Well, I'm not
concerned about you.

620
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,612
That music is something special.

621
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,397
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:28,619
Sorry, we're not open yet.

623
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,145
Hey, Joe. Get me another
shot of rum, please.

624
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:34,973
- You got it, boss.
- Thank you.

625
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:43,764
Somebody told me once that
when you play it right,

626
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,419
the music really
turns into magic...

627
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,552
- We're closed.
- Nah, it's okay.

628
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,119
You're not aware of the
instrument that you're playing

629
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:52,860
or the notes that
you're singing...

630
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:57,430
because you're just
another instrument.

631
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:00,912
A channel...

632
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:03,218
to bring it down to earth.

633
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,833
That is what music is
all about. Nothing else.

634
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:14,708
- I wish everybody knew...
- Endowment is not for everybody.

635
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:16,841
That is true.

636
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,244
They always play
Latin jazz here?

637
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:31,159
Mondays and Saturdays.

638
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:33,422
- Mondays and Saturdays.
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:36,338
It's a good thing I come back
to see them Saturday, then.

640
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:41,082
Where you from?

641
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:43,128
Cuba.

642
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,914
Cuba.

643
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,307
Nice.

644
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:53,094
I had a great time in
Havana, a long time ago.

645
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:55,706
You did?

646
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:59,100
Yeah. Yep.

647
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:05,933
I went down there
for a music program.

648
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:07,413
Spent a couple of months,

649
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:11,112
and had the, uh, full
Cuban experience.

650
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,164
You know, food, music, people.

651
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:20,557
Man, I love that place.

652
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:27,564
But reality hit, and here I am.

653
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:34,788
When did you get here?

654
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,663
Like, 24 hours ago.

655
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,796
Twenty-four hours ago?

656
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:45,843
You're still fresh.

657
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:48,410
- Yes.
- Joe, give my friend...

658
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:50,804
Nico.

659
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:57,245
Give my friend Nico a shot.

660
00:59:57,289 --> 00:59:59,770
- Rum?
- Rum is always good.

661
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,470
Come on.

662
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,167
Come on. It's on the
house. It's okay.

663
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:14,436
Thank you.

664
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,180
- Thanks.
- Okay.

665
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,626
Cheers.

666
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:33,804
Salut.

667
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:36,110
So, Nico...

668
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,852
what brings you back?

669
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,290
This place.

670
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:49,471
Somebody told me about
this place a few years ago.

671
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,655
I always wanted to come
and see it by myself.

672
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:14,496
Interesting...

673
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:17,848
how life gives you what you need
at the right time you need it.

674
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:22,069
I remember when I was a kid...

675
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,685
my father used to play sax
right here in this place.

676
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,734
I'd run out from the house
in the middle of the night

677
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:36,954
and stand right there,

678
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:41,262
by the bar entrance
and watch him play.

679
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:46,224
I can assume clearly because
the place was packed,

680
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:51,446
but, oh, I could hear
him play that sax, man.

681
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,276
That was magic to my ears.

682
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,279
Those nights...

683
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:03,807
after watching him
play for two hours...

684
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:10,727
I ran back home
after his last solo,

685
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:14,295
and... I got home and...

686
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:19,387
later on I didn't hear the door
slam behind him like usual.

687
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,567
Never came back home.

688
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,920
That was the last
time I saw him.

689
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,054
You never heard from him?

690
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,537
No. Never again.

691
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:46,153
But the Blue Bird was
always on my mind.

692
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:55,510
I wanted to be a musician,
but I didn't have the skills,

693
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:57,208
didn't have the endowment.

694
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:01,952
But, man, did I have the
skills to make money.

695
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:05,738
That's what I did. I
made a lot of money,

696
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,696
and bought this place.

697
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,089
How did you get that flyer?

698
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,179
My friend, Celso.

699
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:15,835
He gave it to me.

700
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,623
Celso?

701
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,800
- Yeah.
- That's a strange name.

702
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,109
- How'd he get it?
- His mom.

703
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,111
Hmm.

704
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:39,990
So I printed these
flyers back in '82.

705
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,469
After I acquired the place,

706
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,689
I took some of these
down to the island.

707
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:46,387
You know, do a little
advertising, stuff like that.

708
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:50,957
Matter of fact, I was
planning to hire some locals,

709
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:55,614
great musicians, come back
here, but it was the '80s, so...

710
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:00,184
It's a cool thing that
your friend kept this.

711
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:05,232
- He like jazz?
- He loves jazz.

712
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:09,193
That makes sense.

713
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,587
As a matter of fact, he's so...

714
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,506
well...

715
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:23,337
He was... a great composer.

716
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,818
Really? What kinda music?

717
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,429
Rumba Cubana.

718
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,910
Yeah, Rumba Cubana.

719
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:34,653
I love Rumba Cubana.

720
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,873
Yes, I know.

721
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,136
You do?

722
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,052
I do... know a lot
of things about you.

723
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,625
I didn't think I
was that famous.

724
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:52,497
See my friend, Celso...

725
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:59,765
he always wanted to
come here to New York,

726
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:04,422
He was fascinated, he was
mesmerized, he was obsessed

727
01:05:04,552 --> 01:05:06,119
with the idea of the Blue Bird.

728
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:13,213
He passed away a few months ago.

729
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:15,781
Yeah.

730
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,959
Sorry to hear that.

731
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:25,225
You know what's interesting?
This place, the Blue Bird,

732
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:28,750
was the only connection
that he had with his father.

733
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:35,714
He went away without
even knowing about him.

734
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:43,983
It was this flyer right here...

735
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:48,248
the only thing he
ever got from his dad.

736
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:54,080
You gave this flyer to Mercedes,

737
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:58,432
the beautiful woman you
met and fell in love with,

738
01:05:58,563 --> 01:06:00,173
when you went to Cuba.

739
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:03,655
This flyer...

740
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,310
was the only thing that
Celso got to see from you.

741
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,530
You had a son in Cuba.

742
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:13,534
But you never came back.

743
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:17,408
Never came back.

744
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:22,935
And all those years,
Mercedes only hoped

745
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,372
that one day you would
come back to see your son.

746
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:30,987
Almost a year and a half ago...

747
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:37,732
Celso got cancer, and she died.

748
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:41,736
I always knew what
his biggest dream was,

749
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,347
that's why I'm here.

750
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,063
This...

751
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:07,849
is Celso's ashes.

752
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:14,987
This is your son.

753
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,654
It's time for you to leave.

754
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:32,918
Leave.

755
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:39,011
Get the fuck outta here!

756
01:07:40,665 --> 01:07:42,232
Is everything okay, Jim?

757
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:44,277
It's fine. It's fine. Fine.

758
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,151
My friend Nico
is... is leaving.

759
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,157
Take that with you.

760
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:41,899
Hey, shithead.

761
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:44,096
Don't even think about
sitting on that bench

762
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,122
for one more second.

763
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:51,170
Now I gave you your
fucking do-rag.

764
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:54,434
Now I don't wanna
see you in my park,

765
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,038
or these guys are
gonna break your face.

766
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:01,353
- Look, brother, I'm not...
- Do I look like you?

767
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:02,529
I ain't your brother.

768
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,184
We ain't family.

769
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:07,969
So I don't wanna
see you in my park.

770
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:10,450
You understand? I
run these parks.

771
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:12,617
I own these benches, and if
you ain't paying me rent,

772
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,149
I don't wanna see
your face here.

773
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:16,934
- You understand me?
- I do. Yeah.

774
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:20,156
I'm leaving right now, okay?

775
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,505
I'm leaving.

776
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,171
I'm leaving. Just leave
me right now. I'm leaving.

777
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:38,174
Leaving. Easy.

778
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,785
We're cool. Right?

779
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,221
- Are we?
- We're not cool.

780
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:45,005
We're cool. I mean,
I'm leaving right now.

781
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,051
It's your park. The bench.

782
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,532
That's fine.

783
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:55,495
Did you tell her what I
told you to tell her last week?

784
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:58,368
Yes, but she's incapable
of straightening out things

785
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:00,282
on her calendar.

786
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:05,070
We have been planning this
trip to Portugal forever.

787
01:10:05,112 --> 01:10:06,680
Last time we talked about it

788
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:09,727
we both agreed on staying at
Lisboa just for three days.

789
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:12,469
And then the plan was driving.

790
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,688
Now she's afraid to drive
because she's afraid

791
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:17,213
of her insurance
working in Europe.

792
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,388
Who cares?

793
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:24,611
What's up with this guy?

794
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,526
Well, do something!
Tell someone.

795
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,398
Yeah.

796
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:37,842
Sorry, but you gotta leave.

797
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:39,583
Yeah, man. Sorry about that.

798
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:53,570
Hold on.

799
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,919
- How's your coffee?
- Good.

800
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:56,573
- Okay. Milk?
- Yes.

801
01:11:56,702 --> 01:11:57,922
You got a call.

802
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,234
Hello?

803
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:10,848
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm hungry and I'm homeless.

804
01:12:10,978 --> 01:12:14,504
Meet me at the same
place in 15 minutes.

805
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:16,201
I gotta go.

806
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:20,945
Where is Lewis?

807
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:25,732
- He's in the kitchen.
- Tell him that I have to go.

808
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:27,734
- It's an emergency.
- Again?

809
01:12:27,778 --> 01:12:30,084
I have to do this.

810
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,826
He won't let you come back this
time. You know that, don't you?

811
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:37,570
I know, but I really
have to do this.

812
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:44,708
Go.

813
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:47,537
Thanks.

814
01:13:01,028 --> 01:13:03,074
Hey, what'd you think?

815
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:07,121
Are you trying to connect
spiritually with rum?

816
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:11,474
You don't have anyone
else to connect to,

817
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,476
rum becomes the best company.

818
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,695
Can I sit and talk to you,

819
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:19,482
so you have someone else to
connect with besides the bottle?

820
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:30,493
I wanted to...

821
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,192
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me.

822
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:37,108
- What did I do?
- Well...

823
01:13:37,237 --> 01:13:41,068
- You know, my tuition.
- Tuition? What tuition?

824
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:44,157
You covered my semester's
tuition at the university.

825
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:47,987
They called me from the office,
Jim. They said you covered it.

826
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,558
Well...

827
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,996
- Somebody made a mistake.
- Why?

828
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,912
Why do you do that?

829
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:04,264
I mean, I am so thankful
for what you did for me.

830
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:10,271
But why did you help me?

831
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:13,187
Why do you help everybody?

832
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:16,930
You know, everybody
tells stories about you

833
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:19,933
helping them out with something,

834
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:23,894
paying for something
without them asking or...

835
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:28,550
just giving, giving without
being even asked for it.

836
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:31,902
Why did you help me? Why
do you help everybody?

837
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:34,644
I should help.

838
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:36,341
I need to help.
It's an obligation.

839
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,083
- But why?
- Because I can.

840
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:43,870
And because I got
nothing else to do.

841
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,699
And probably because you
have no one else to help.

842
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:50,050
I'm sorry.

843
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:57,188
Can I ask you something? Who
was the guy from yesterday?

844
01:14:57,318 --> 01:15:00,147
You've been acting
weird ever since.

845
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:03,716
Stop. Just a kid
looking for a job.

846
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,588
And you didn't help him?

847
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,678
It's complicated.

848
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:14,727
He brought back
memories that, uh...

849
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:17,948
Bad memories?

850
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:19,602
No.

851
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:24,258
Matter of fact, they were...

852
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:30,700
They were good memories.

853
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:33,790
Probably the best
memories I've ever had,

854
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,270
and that's why I
reacted the way I did.

855
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:40,187
Yeah. I had lost something,
and I didn't notice it, and...

856
01:15:43,059 --> 01:15:46,585
I'm trying to bury the past,
and he just brought it back.

857
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:52,416
That's... buried now.

858
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:54,505
And you don't want
to see those memories

859
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,554
- you enjoyed so much, again?
- No.

860
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,164
No.

861
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:01,513
Why?

862
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,862
It's too late.

863
01:16:05,996 --> 01:16:08,215
No, Jim.

864
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:11,218
It's never too late. Trust me.

865
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:13,830
As long as we're here,

866
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:17,268
it's never too late to reconnect
with your happiest memories.

867
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:20,663
It's okay to make
yourself happy, too,

868
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:24,231
to give to yourself the
way you give to others.

869
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,737
Why didn't you call me before?

870
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,695
I didn't want to bother.

871
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:38,697
You don't bother me.

872
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:41,439
Thanks for the food.

873
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:43,049
Seriously?

874
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:48,901
- Can I take your plate?

875
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,449
Yes. Yes.

876
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:59,718
I want to talk to you
about, you know, us.

877
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:01,546
Nico, don't.

878
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,202
Just forget everything.

879
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:09,859
You can't do anything to
bring him back, right?

880
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,340
You can do something
for yourself

881
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,907
and make him feel proud of you.

882
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:24,047
After that night with you
in Cuba, I felt guilty.

883
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:33,099
But then I thought about him,
and I remember how he was.

884
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:36,233
And I know that if he
would have been watching us

885
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:39,323
from some faraway place,

886
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:42,543
he would have felt happy
that I was with you.

887
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:52,815
- Let me take you home.
- No. No.

888
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,732
Nico. Look at me.

889
01:18:56,818 --> 01:18:59,255
You're homeless.

890
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:02,650
You gotta take a
shower. You gotta eat.

891
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,348
You gotta sleep in a warm place.

892
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,568
You have to move on.

893
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:10,528
- You have to change, Nico.
- I gotta finish first.

894
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,620
Then I'll change.

895
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:49,219
- Twenty five.
- Twenty five? That's bad.

896
01:19:49,262 --> 01:19:52,004
- How about white?
- Uh, 30.

897
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:54,615
Thirty? Cases of beer?

898
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,748
Fifteen, but I think
we started out with 20.

899
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:59,359
- Then Mikey was telling me...
- Shh. Hold on a second.

900
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:23,906
Keep counting. Give
me a total, okay?

901
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:25,255
You got it.

902
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,710
- Thanks, shithead.
- Hey! Hey!

903
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,973
- You don't listen, do you?
- Just gimme that!

904
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:50,628
What's with you and
this stupid rag anyway?

905
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:51,889
Hey, that's him!

906
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:53,718
Crazy motherfucker,
who two days ago

907
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:57,026
assaulted me after
he invaded my park!

908
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,221
- What'd you do to my lady?
- I didn't do anything to her.

909
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,638
- Hold it.
- No, no, no.

910
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:02,814
Hey! Shut up.

911
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:05,469
- You don't belong here.
- He's a monster, a number 12.

912
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:06,905
You have to pay the price

913
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:08,776
if you don't respect
our community.

914
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:10,474
We have rules to follow here.

915
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:13,303
- Can't just invade our space.
- I'm not invading your space.

916
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:14,870
We gave you a few
chances already.

917
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:17,002
You just ignored
us, blew us off.

918
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:19,135
- I wonder what this crazy...
- No!

919
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,096
Hey! Hey.

920
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:27,883
- Stop that now!
- Who the fuck are you?

921
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:32,670
- Hey, Jim.
- Charles, don't do that.

922
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,978
Hey, Jim. He...

923
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:37,936
We're just teaching
this guy a lesson. He...

924
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,677
He doesn't follow the rules.

925
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:42,853
Rules?

926
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,092
What the hell you
talking about, Prince?

927
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:49,165
Um, our rules. He's an intruder.

928
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:52,081
- He is enemy.
- No, he's not.

929
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,693
He's my son.

930
01:21:58,174 --> 01:21:59,218
Your son?

931
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,004
I didn't know you had a son.

932
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:04,005
But he doesn't look
anything like you.

933
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:08,053
- Do you resemble your mama?
- Hey! Hey!

934
01:22:08,184 --> 01:22:09,663
Take it easy, Jim.
We were trying...

935
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:12,144
No, I'm not gonna
take it easy, Prince.

936
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:15,800
I feed you guys and
make everything possible

937
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:17,454
so you have a place to stay.

938
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,673
I give you money,
I give you clothes,

939
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:22,371
and this is the way
you treat my family?

940
01:22:22,415 --> 01:22:26,028
So no, I'm not
gonna take it easy.

941
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:30,728
Give it to me.

942
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:51,487
I... I'm sorry, Jim.
We... We... We're sorry.

943
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:53,969
Yeah.

944
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:57,710
Just don't let it happen again.

945
01:22:57,842 --> 01:23:00,410
It won't. It won't happen again.

946
01:23:00,452 --> 01:23:02,281
Here.

947
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,153
Let's go. Everybody, let's go.

948
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:15,032
Thank you.

949
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:22,780
You need a shower. You stink.

950
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,914
I'm sorry.

951
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:28,960
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

952
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:31,397
Yeah.

953
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:33,965
Come on. Come with me.

954
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,361
Come on. Let's go.

955
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:18,835
- I see my clothes fit you.
- Yeah.

956
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,232
Sit down. Dinner's ready.

957
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:28,019
Okay?

958
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:36,462
When was the last time
you had a decent hot meal?

959
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:38,638
I don't remember.

960
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:46,168
Look, I wanna thank
you for everything.

961
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:47,603
That song...

962
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,868
the one you were
singing in the park...

963
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:54,523
where'd you learn that?

964
01:24:56,787 --> 01:24:58,919
He told me it was his
mom's favorite song.

965
01:25:00,704 --> 01:25:05,621
He said that she used to sing
that song for him every night

966
01:25:05,752 --> 01:25:07,145
to make him go to sleep.

967
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:22,029
When did you guys meet?

968
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,816
About six years ago
when I moved to Cuba.

969
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:29,472
I wanted to learn all about
my roots and my background,

970
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:31,299
plus my father.

971
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:36,000
My father wanted me
to learn Rumba Cubana,

972
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:37,654
but I knew I'm not
gonna get that here.

973
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:39,568
Where's your father now?

974
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:42,093
He's also in heaven.

975
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:44,748
I'm sorry.

976
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:52,321
Go ahead. Eat now.

977
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:00,459
You guys have the
same personality.

978
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,808
I mean, you and my dad.

979
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,161
When I saw you the other day...

980
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,382
it was just like looking at him.

981
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:13,603
Eat. It's getting cold.

982
01:26:20,044 --> 01:26:21,959
- Do you have a place to stay?
- Not really.

983
01:26:25,005 --> 01:26:26,833
I mean, I know somebody.

984
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:30,141
Hmm. But it's complicated.

985
01:26:31,838 --> 01:26:33,840
- A girl.
- Yeah.

986
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:37,975
With them, it's
always complicated.

987
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:42,762
Do you love her?

988
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,856
It's very complicated.

989
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:54,383
I understand.

990
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,605
If you love her...

991
01:27:01,303 --> 01:27:02,521
you go and get her.

992
01:27:04,871 --> 01:27:05,871
Don't be a pussy.

993
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:11,791
You can't change the past...

994
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:15,665
but you can change the
present and the future.

995
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:21,192
Don't make the same
mistake I made.

996
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:22,454
You...

997
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:25,718
You got out and get her.

998
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,418
In the meantime you can stay
here. You can crash here.

999
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:32,334
You sure?

1000
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:35,075
- Of course.
- What about him?

1001
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,904
He's gonna be okay now.

1002
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,169
Besides, he's probably tired

1003
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,867
of you getting him
lost in the city.

1004
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,639
You know, I always
imagined this moment.

1005
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,266
I always knew...

1006
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,530
that one day...

1007
01:28:42,186 --> 01:28:45,842
I would have a shot
of rum with my son...

1008
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,150
and talk about life.

1009
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,681
I never thought it
would be like this.

1010
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:13,130
I...

1011
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:17,352
I've been waiting for this
moment for a long time.

1012
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:28,928
I've even imagined

1013
01:29:30,974 --> 01:29:33,585
every single piece
of you in my head.

1014
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:38,808
Your face...

1015
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:43,465
your eyes...

1016
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:47,120
your hair...

1017
01:29:49,209 --> 01:29:50,472
even your habits,

1018
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:53,952
your words.

1019
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,615
I knew you would come
back because I...

1020
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:09,186
I never had the
courage to go meet you.

1021
01:30:13,712 --> 01:30:16,976
I knew all about you.

1022
01:30:18,717 --> 01:30:19,762
Yeah.

1023
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:24,897
Your mother used to call
me at first and tell me.

1024
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:27,596
She called me to tell
about your illness.

1025
01:30:35,952 --> 01:30:39,389
Your mother is a wonderful
woman, and you know that.

1026
01:30:43,873 --> 01:30:45,048
Your mother...

1027
01:30:47,616 --> 01:30:51,097
was the love of
my life, and I...

1028
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:53,056
never had the strength or...

1029
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:57,669
or balls to go back
to her and to you.

1030
01:31:14,207 --> 01:31:15,252
I...

1031
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:23,478
I'd send the money every year.

1032
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:28,918
And in my stupid mind, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

1033
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:30,572
I was doing...

1034
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:36,360
the same thing my
father did to me

1035
01:31:36,447 --> 01:31:38,493
when he left and
never came back home.

1036
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:44,499
I...

1037
01:31:46,544 --> 01:31:47,675
I...

1038
01:31:49,373 --> 01:31:51,288
I'd love to see
you alive, but...

1039
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:55,553
I never did.

1040
01:31:56,946 --> 01:32:00,906
And I am a fucking selfish,

1041
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,734
full of shit coward.

1042
01:32:07,043 --> 01:32:08,348
And I am so sorry.

1043
01:32:12,264 --> 01:32:13,615
I...

1044
01:32:14,485 --> 01:32:15,746
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:32:19,969 --> 01:32:21,318
I... You...

1046
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:24,407
you did...

1047
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:27,324
teach me a great lesson.

1048
01:32:29,152 --> 01:32:33,548
You taught me, and
you taught Nico there,

1049
01:32:33,635 --> 01:32:34,897
you should never give up.

1050
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:46,778
Because you came all
the way over here...

1051
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:54,133
to teach me that lesson.

1052
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,450
And here we are.

1053
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:08,191
It's never too late...

1054
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,237
to love someone.

1055
01:33:16,025 --> 01:33:18,593
I will always love you, son.

1056
01:33:34,478 --> 01:33:38,047
Our children come into
this world with a mission,

1057
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:40,832
and that mission is to teach us.

1058
01:33:40,876 --> 01:33:43,618
It's time to let go.

1059
01:35:03,523 --> 01:35:06,048
You made his dreams come true.

1060
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:09,355
Now it's time to let go.
