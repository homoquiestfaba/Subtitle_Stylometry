00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,065
<i>Good evening. Thanks for tuning
in to your news at 6:00.</i>

3
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,771
<i>A breaking story for
central Texas tonight.</i>

4
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,166
<i>Police issued an amber alert
for an eight-year-old boy.</i>

5
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:09,041
<i>He was abducted from his home
near Eldorado, Texas, last night.</i>

6
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:12,463
<i>We don' t have a photo of him
yet, but this is what we do know.</i>

7
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,350
<i>His name is Alton Meyer,
he is eight years old,</i>

8
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,073
<i>white, with blue
eyes and brown hair.</i>

9
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,770
<i>- 4 feet and 8 inches tall...</i>
- It’s time.

10
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,822
<i>...and believed this man,
Roy Tomlin, took him.</i>

11
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:35,204
<i>...he is said to be armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

12
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:39,051
<i>If you have any information
please call 911...</i>

13
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:12,655
It’s time. Are you ready?

14
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:14,639
Yeah.

15
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:17,811
Better lose the bedsheet.

16
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:36,172
Okay.

17
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:49,658
<i>Attention all units for a
wanted person broadcast.</i>

18
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,746
<i>Be on the lookout for a 1972 Chevrolet
Chevelle, primer gray in color...</i>

19
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:59,851
<i>...bearing Texas license plate
159AG2 driven by two white males...</i>

20
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,703
- Pop that open.
<i>- ...and is heading on I-30.</i>

21
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,024
<i>Any unit coming into
contact hold and notify.</i>

22
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,260
Hand me those goggles.

23
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,876
Kill the light, Alton.

24
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:26,476
<i>Again no photos have been provided of
the eight-year-old boy, he is white...</i>

25
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>...4 ft 8 inches tall,
weigh roughly 60 pounds...</i>

26
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,339
<i>...with brown hair and blue eyes said
to be traveling with this man...</i>

27
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,581
<i>...Roy Tomlin. Please call
911 with any information.</i>

28
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,724
<i>Stay with us after the break...</i>

29
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,836
Did the ranch put this out?

30
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,297
No. This is something else.

31
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,054
Thank you, Levi.

32
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,102
What you do now...

33
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,234
...will decide our
whole way of life.

34
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,940
You have four days, to
get the boy back here.

35
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:21,249
He won’t give him back easily.

36
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,906
But we must get him back
in time, you understand?

37
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:37,981
The Lord has...

38
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,292
...placed a heavy burden on you.

39
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,552
- Peace be to you.
- And to you.

40
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,398
We’ll begin with a reading
from March 17th, 2011.

41
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:14,377
Gulf Eclipse. And
the numbers came.

42
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:20,328
35, 47, 97, 52.

43
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,350
Buildings tower.
The light comes.

44
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:29,302
To know the source of such things
is to know our place in the world.

45
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
...are guided by a plan,
unknown to us, but...

46
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,180
Friends. These gentlemen are
from the federal government.

47
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,414
I suggest you listen to
them very carefully.

48
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,439
Please remain calm.

49
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:44,048
We are agents from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

50
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:46,789
We have a warrant to
search the premises

51
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,821
and detain all members of this ranch.
There are buses...

52
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,453
...waiting outside to transport
you to the campus...

53
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:55,116
...of Jefferson High
School in San Angelo.

54
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,844
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

55
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,571
You' ll receive further details
when we reach our destination.

56
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,640
Are we good?

57
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,763
It's better to get
across state line.

58
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,616
We’ve passed three counties.
I’d like to slow down.

59
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:45,953
Lucas!

60
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,734
Alton, stay down.

61
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,554
Ma'am.

62
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:07,625
Ma'am.

63
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:15,492
She’s hurt real bad!

64
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,066
She’s gonna need an ambulance!
She’s got a bad head wound!

65
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:36,802
Don’t.

66
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,289
Shoot him!

67
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:43,953
Get back in the car!

68
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,555
Alton is more important!

69
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:47,531
Get back in the car!

70
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:49,961
- Shoot him!
- I’ve got this...

71
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:03,442
Shots fired, officer down.

72
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:05,792
Send medical 10-18.

73
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,130
Country road 36.

74
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:10,648
One mile east of marker 87.

75
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,948
Everything is fine. Buckle in.

76
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,383
It’s okay. Just
settle down, alright?

77
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:54,754
You want your comics?

78
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,241
Here.

79
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,546
He had on a vest.

80
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,343
You didn’t know that.

81
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:25,616
You did the right thing.
He’s more important.

82
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,712
You didn’t just shoot
a state trooper.

83
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:24,896
We had you under surveillance since
members of your ranch acquired...

84
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:28,467
...a sizable number of firearms over
the course of the last six months.

85
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,371
Do you have an
explanation for this?

86
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:37,453
Well, it’s not illegal to own
weapons in this country yet.

87
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,469
What’s the main
economic function...

88
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,550
...of your ranch?

89
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:48,664
We [...], cattle, dairy,
but they are not for profit.

90
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:50,124
We use them ourselves.

91
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,027
Hi. Hello.

92
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,927
Hi, sir. Agent Miller?

93
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:12,653
Hi. Paul Sevier, NSA. Nice to
finally meet you in person.

94
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,016
Hello.

95
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,648
As I said, my name
is Paul Sevier.

96
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,755
I work for the NSA in the
field of communications.

97
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,988
Do these mean anything to you?

98
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,102
Ignore the rest of this.
Polo step?

99
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,375
Meridian Alpha?

100
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:40,892
Red Saber?

101
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:43,859
The number combination...

102
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,078
...53, 23, 77, 1, 27?

103
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,166
Yes. They are excerpts
from my sermons.

104
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,687
That particular one is from...

105
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:00,284
...a reading January 18, 2010.

106
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,462
Yes, it is. Did you write this?

107
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:04,899
Yes.

108
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:11,081
What if I told you that words and
numbers contained in your sermons...

109
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,966
...include sensitive
government information...

110
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,663
...that, given the
dates you provide,

111
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,356
were transmitted solely by satellite
through a heavily encrypted format,

112
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,618
the decryption and
dissemination of which,

113
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,893
other than being
scientifically impossible,

114
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,872
would surely carry punishments
of treason that are so severe...

115
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:28,334
...the government probably
hasn’t invented them yet?

116
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,813
They came from the boy.
It' all from the boy.

117
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,877
- Alton Meyer?
- Yes.

118
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,441
Okay. Well...

119
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:44,005
- We knew that.
- He’s your son?

120
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:45,744
Adopted.

121
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,775
- Do you know the birth father?
- Yes, I do.

122
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,459
Roy Tomlin.

123
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:03,617
So can you tell us how an
eight-year-old got this information?

124
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,800
He would have fits.

125
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,214
Can you explain that?

126
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,226
And speak in tongues.

127
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:20,475
Sometimes other languages,
sometimes unknown languages.

128
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,836
We wrote them down. They
became our scripture.

129
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,734
These are words of the Lord.

130
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,930
Or the Federal Government.

131
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:33,359
What is the significance
of Friday, March 6th?

132
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,297
We need to know where he is.

133
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,784
You all have no clue of what
you’re dealing with, do you?

134
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,688
I’ve prepared a room for him.

135
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:27,734
Alton, it’s wonderful
to see you again.

136
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,558
Yes, sir.

137
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:39,170
Are those windows blacked out?

138
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,884
Yes. It's cardboard
behind the drapes.

139
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,195
Well, I'll... I’ll let
you all get settled in.

140
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:49,703
Thank you.

141
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:54,302
Kick your shoes off.

142
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,738
Get some sleep, Alton.

143
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,808
Night, Lucas.

144
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,987
Goggles.

145
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,285
Try and sleep.

146
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:32,679
We’ll have breakfast
when you get up.

147
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,142
Okay.

148
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,163
That’s National.

149
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:05,542
- What about the State Trooper?
- Nothing.

150
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,306
I can't believe the
ranch released this.

151
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,437
I don’t think they did.

152
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,110
I’ll take first watch.

153
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:21,872
You need to sleep.

154
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:23,960
- You need anything?
- A drink.

155
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,435
You got it.

156
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,150
I’m in this for Alton.

157
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:38,874
All the way.

158
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:43,901
Things with that Trooper didn’t
need to go down like that.

159
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:49,248
Don’t interfere with me again.

160
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,867
<i>The details of that relationship,
extremely not clear.</i>

161
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,054
I've got something
want you to see.

162
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:26,605
Has anyone else from the ranch
decoded the coordinates you gave me?

163
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:28,539
No.

164
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:31,139
They only have the D.

165
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,705
Well...

166
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,700
The place is clear,

167
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:39,281
but I still don’t have an
answer as to why that place.

168
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,849
Have you ever done any studying
on the concept of ley lines?

169
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:54,220
No.

170
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,108
Well, their validity is arguable,
but I've gotta tell you,

171
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:00,773
- they never search...
- Elden.

172
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,433
I’m tired.

173
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:08,957
Of course.

174
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,178
Do you miss it?

175
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,038
Living on the ranch.

176
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:25,942
Yeah.

177
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,648
Very much.

178
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:29,772
Lucas!

179
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,322
Alton!

180
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,296
No!

181
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,313
I got you. I got you.

182
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,464
I got you. I got you.

183
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,730
It's okay. It's okay.

184
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,294
It's okay.

185
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,249
It's okay.

186
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,841
Things are break.

187
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,422
What kinds of things?

188
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,714
Windows,

189
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,611
light bulbs,

190
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,451
cars are shut down,
that kind of thing.

191
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:55,842
It just got worse the
older he got so...

192
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,899
...they just started
lettin’ him sleep...

193
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,979
...in the daytime and
he’d be awake at night.

194
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,708
That’s why our services
are all at night now.

195
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:06,588
And what’s your
job on the ranch?

196
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,359
Childcare.

197
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,158
I help look after all of
Brother Calvin’s children.

198
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:18,697
Alton it’s been with
him, over two years now.

199
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:21,430
And the birth mother?

200
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,013
She abandoned him.

201
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:28,964
- Yes, I’ve done it.
- Communing?

202
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:30,648
That’s what we call it.

203
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:33,533
To be clear,

204
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:40,313
a visible spectrum of
light came from his eyes.

205
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,340
Yes.

206
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,236
Others have described
seeing things.

207
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,545
Did he show you things
during this process?

208
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,739
Yes.

209
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,261
Well, what kinds of things?

210
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:58,611
I wouldn’t know where to start.

211
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,730
And Friday, March 6th?
Why is this date important?

212
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,880
It’s the day of our judgment.

213
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,866
What makes you say that?

214
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:14,109
I believe it.

215
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:19,433
It wasn’t images.

216
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,592
Not what I remember.

217
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:24,373
It was more...

218
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,384
It was like a feeling.

219
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,042
What...

220
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,788
...kind of feeling?

221
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,120
Comfort.

222
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:43,677
And...

223
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:48,836
...what do you think will
happen on Friday, March 6th?

224
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:55,553
If Alton is with us...

225
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:58,361
...we will be saved.

226
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,214
Barbara Meyer?

227
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:17,711
Alright, I need
everyone to stand up...

228
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:19,758
...exit through the
front doors please.

229
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,919
Lucas, can you get
Alton in the van?

230
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,481
Yeah.

231
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:27,475
We’re taking your van.

232
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:36,967
Please. Don’t.

233
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,457
You know where we’re going.

234
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,422
I...

235
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:47,629
I had to see again.

236
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:54,397
You knew better.

237
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,533
We need to stop for gas.

238
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,695
We could use some supplies.

239
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:39,237
I’ll go in.

240
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:42,968
The less people that
see you the better.

241
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,583
I need to use a pay phone.

242
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:51,877
What’s Kryptonite?

243
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,747
It's the only thing
that'll kill Superman.

244
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,185
It’s made up.

245
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,746
I should never let
you given him those.

246
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:03,603
He’s never seen a comic
book in his life.

247
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,992
That’s why he needed ‘em.
Reading’s reading.

248
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,097
He needs to know what's real.

249
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,577
He looks weaker.

250
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,055
He is.

251
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,630
He recovers?

252
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:28,860
He’s fine.

253
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,717
He speaks Spanish?

254
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:54,791
It’s something he does.

255
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,590
Turn on the radio.

256
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:02,488
Scroll through the stations.

257
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:31,945
We’ll be right back.

258
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:34,378
Stay in the van.

259
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,260
Hey.

260
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:43,528
Yeah, we’re okay. We should
be there in a couple hours.

261
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:02,977
Are you okay?

262
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,951
I want to see you.

263
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,185
We’ll be there soon.

264
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,545
Why are you wearin’
those goggles?

265
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:26,818
Stop! Stop!

266
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:32,148
He’s with me. He’s my son.

267
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,748
Yeah. Well, you have
to watch your kid.

268
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,584
Yeah. I got it. Thank you.

269
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:40,229
Everything okay?

270
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:48,645
You cannot leave the van.
You hear me?

271
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,497
I’m sorry.

272
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,502
It’s okay. I shouldn’t
have left you.

273
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,282
No.

274
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,348
I’m sorry.

275
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,448
Roy.

276
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:45,605
Go!

277
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,468
Dad?

278
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,624
Alton.

279
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,424
Lean your head back.

280
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,214
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

281
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:17,566
Roy.

282
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:19,964
Roy, do we need get
him to a hospital?

283
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,914
No. No. Just keep driving.

284
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:24,331
Is this something that he does?

285
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,710
It's okay.

286
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:34,384
It's okay.

287
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,762
Alton?

288
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:16,354
Thank you, God.

289
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,175
Thank you.

290
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:23,733
Let me look at you.

291
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,405
You're so big.

292
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:33,773
So grown up.

293
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:41,530
- Hello.
- Hi.

294
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,817
I’m Sarah.

295
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,633
Lucas.

296
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,566
How are you?

297
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,428
I missed him.

298
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,266
Come on.

299
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:19,937
You all must be exhausted.

300
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:21,764
Let's go inside.

301
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,042
I got a present for you, Alton.

302
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:46,014
I can’t keep my eyes off him.

303
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:19,655
Get some rest.

304
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:22,682
Okay.

305
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:48,911
He okay?

306
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,781
He doesn't look good.

307
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:55,094
He’s sick.

308
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,359
He’s getting weaker,
but he’ll be okay.

309
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,138
Should we do something?

310
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,996
Just stick to the plan and
get him there by Friday.

311
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,097
Do you think that’s wise?

312
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,666
It’s all we have.

313
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,171
This date and place
is everything.

314
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,003
We take him to a
hospital, it’s over.

315
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:16,239
If it’s between
that or him dying?

316
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:18,919
It's three days.

317
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:20,686
He’ll make it.

318
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,359
I think he’s right.

319
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,824
I don’t know.

320
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:44,121
I don’t know if there’s a way out of
all this for y’all, which is a shame.

321
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:47,589
You’d make a nice
family otherwise.

322
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,174
I’m an electrician.

323
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,186
Certified in two states.

324
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:17,748
What do I know about
these things?

325
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:23,489
He wouldn’t have asked you
if you couldn’t do it.

326
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:33,227
Sometimes we’re asked to do
things that are beyond us.

327
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,174
Yes?

328
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:31,453
Are you Sarah Tomlin’s mother?

329
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,077
How could someone cause a
satellite to fall out of orbit?

330
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,911
I don't know. Ask an engineer.

331
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:34,961
Well...

332
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,858
Alton Meyer brought down an Air
Force satellite last night.

333
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:47,238
DSP9712.

334
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:52,050
- It was tasked with detecting...
- A nuclear explosion.

335
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,069
Yeah.

336
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:56,303
This is the last image.

337
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:59,780
Sent to us by the satellite.
We believe that's the boy...

338
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,551
...standing at the center
of that heat bloom.

339
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:04,516
It’s not exactly a heat
bloom, but that’s fine.

340
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:05,939
Whatever it is...

341
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:10,736
The satellites whole purpose
is detecting a nuclear event.

342
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,048
No radiation.

343
00:43:29,795 --> 00:43:31,066
None.

344
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:37,769
Could a drone be programmed to search
for that specific heat signature?

345
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:40,209
Yeah.

346
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:47,242
We've got a field office in Mobile
we can base your team out of.

347
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:48,691
What about the interviews?

348
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:50,835
You’re done with those.
Like it or not,

349
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,408
you’re the new resident
expert on Alton Meyer.

350
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:54,713
Let's go.

351
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,792
<i>Breaking news at this hour.
A weather satellite...</i>

352
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,700
<i>...fell from space and
crushed near a gas station.</i>

353
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:08,542
<i>This happened overnight
in Northern Louisiana...</i>

354
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:11,925
<i>...and as we speak a massive
cleanup is underway...</i>

355
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:16,445
<i>...because the debris field from
the crush is nearly 60 miles wide.</i>

356
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:19,130
<i>The Canadian company
that owns this satellite...</i>

357
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:21,699
<i>...says that it suffered
mechanical failure.</i>

358
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:25,027
Can you tell Lucas to pull
the van around the back?

359
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,556
Roy asked if you’d pull the van
around back when you’re done?

360
00:44:53,948 --> 00:44:55,057
Okay.

361
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:58,436
You’re not...

362
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,438
...from the ranch?

363
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:02,438
No. No.

364
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,459
Then how you know Roy?

365
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:08,898
We grew up together.

366
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:12,386
We were real close
for a long time,

367
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,058
till his parents moved
them out to the ranch.

368
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,896
And then we fell off.

369
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:24,539
Until three nights ago there was a
knock at my door and there's Roy...

370
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:27,900
...standing there with Alton.

371
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,819
And says that they're in
trouble and they need help.

372
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:36,281
And Alton, sat me down.

373
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:39,528
He took those goggles off...

374
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:47,752
You know when that
boy does that...

375
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:52,991
That thing with his eyes...

376
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:04,709
That’s powerful.

377
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:19,456
What do you do in San Angelo?

378
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,388
I’m a State Trooper.

379
00:46:46,626 --> 00:46:48,034
Alton?

380
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:12,603
Alton?

381
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:15,755
Yes?

382
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,219
What happened at
the gas station?

383
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:21,447
Did you mean to do that?

384
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:24,936
Yes.

385
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:27,991
Why?

386
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:30,698
They were watching me.

387
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:34,528
Who was watching you, Alton?

388
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,608
The police.

389
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:43,206
How do you know it’s the police?

390
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:46,459
They talk like the
police on your radio.

391
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:51,541
What do they say?

392
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,064
They’re looking for me.

393
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:20,272
Here's a receipt for
her car insurance.

394
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:23,051
Isuzu Rodeo. ‘99.

395
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,009
There’s a van in the driveway.

396
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:30,598
See if it’s got a
registration in it.

397
00:48:49,942 --> 00:48:50,949
Alton?

398
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:55,117
Alton?

399
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:57,298
Breathe. Can you breathe?

400
00:48:58,238 --> 00:48:59,531
- Roy?
- Pull over.

401
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:02,033
- Breathe.
- Pull over!

402
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,377
Breathe! Breathe!

403
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:11,041
Okay.

404
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:19,634
Okay. Okay.

405
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:35,897
What is it?

406
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:45,959
- Mom?
- I’m okay.

407
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,267
Alton?

408
00:50:07,198 --> 00:50:08,555
Alton!

409
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:12,880
Water. He needs water.

410
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:23,412
Look.

411
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,358
Roy.

412
00:50:31,102 --> 00:50:32,428
He needs water.

413
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:34,615
We need to take him
to a hospital.

414
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:36,610
- No!
- He’s dying!

415
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,687
Hey! Hey!

416
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,694
- He’s sick, right!
- No!

417
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:42,256
- He’s dying!
- No!

418
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:43,452
He will not die!

419
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:47,275
- He’s meant for something else!
- He’s sick and he needs help!

420
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,588
Alton?

421
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,075
We have to go. They’re coming.

422
00:50:59,939 --> 00:51:00,947
Who’s coming?

423
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:04,584
There.

424
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,173
You take the car with Lucas.

425
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:20,609
Dad, we have to go.

426
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,446
That way.

427
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:25,881
Now!

428
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:30,744
What the... Roy?

429
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,931
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:00,987
I can run.

431
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,655
This way.

432
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,798
Alton?

433
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:23,971
How did you know this was here?

434
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:28,363
I didn’t.

435
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,991
Sun will be up in a few hours.

436
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,550
We can wait out the
daylight here.

437
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:43,455
Alton?

438
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,077
I’m okay.

439
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,309
I’m sorry.

440
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,908
No.

441
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,488
I need something.

442
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:29,791
What?

443
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,567
I need to be awake
during the day.

444
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:36,153
In the sun.

445
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:40,530
You can’t.

446
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:47,882
I have to.

447
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:51,231
It could kill you.

448
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:57,395
Dad...

449
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:04,783
I have to.

450
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,613
He’s not going to Atlanta.

451
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:07,525
What?

452
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:13,731
All these places mentioned with
sermons, they don’t matter.

453
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:16,353
They don't?

454
00:56:17,053 --> 00:56:19,595
They just listening to
the government talk.

455
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,858
He's just looking for a
language to describe...

456
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:26,953
...a location an all he
heard was coordinates.

457
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:56,363
That's remarkable.

458
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:08,663
Now, they want to move us
to an office in Atlanta.

459
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,242
Doesn’t matter.

460
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:12,988
- What?
- I know where they’re going.

461
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,623
Old habits die hard.

462
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:36,622
You still staying up nights?

463
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:44,454
What happened to
your head, Elden?

464
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:02,950
Roy will get him here.

465
00:58:03,415 --> 00:58:05,083
If he’s not dead.

466
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,273
I’m sorry.

467
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:16,281
Roy won’t let that happen.

468
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:18,977
Yeah, I hope not.

469
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:24,313
He believes in
something, you don't.

470
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:26,905
It doesn’t matter.

471
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:30,913
Good people die every day believing.
Thanks.

472
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:40,172
Roy spent two years watching
another man raise our son.

473
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,949
He did what I couldn’t.

474
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:53,417
He’ll do anything
to get him here.

475
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,225
Get some rest.

476
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,050
Nobody is coming
with the sun up.

477
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,963
Dad?

478
01:00:38,696 --> 01:00:39,804
It’s okay.

479
01:02:16,657 --> 01:02:18,470
It’s still daylight.

480
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:31,752
Jesus.

481
01:02:43,017 --> 01:02:44,124
He looks...

482
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:48,201
He has something to tell you.

483
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:00,025
You look wonderful.

484
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:05,100
It’s still a daylight.

485
01:03:05,884 --> 01:03:06,892
Yeah.

486
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:09,711
No goggles.

487
01:03:30,955 --> 01:03:33,673
Lucas. Want to sit down?

488
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,772
I saw the sunrise this morning.

489
01:03:54,727 --> 01:03:56,457
I think I know what I am now.

490
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,541
There is...

491
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,438
There's a world...

492
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,058
...built on top of ours.

493
01:04:14,106 --> 01:04:15,638
People live there.

494
01:04:37,282 --> 01:04:38,966
I think they’re like me.

495
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,145
We saw it.

496
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:24,606
They’re like you?

497
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:29,099
Yes. I think so.

498
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,187
I understand.

499
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,465
Lucas?

500
01:05:58,517 --> 01:06:00,084
I believe you.

501
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,522
Good.

502
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,576
- You alright in there?
- Yeah.

503
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:44,009
Roy.

504
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:46,583
I need to talk to you.

505
01:06:48,861 --> 01:06:49,884
Okay.

506
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:56,301
It’s about tomorrow.

507
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:02,530
The world you saw.

508
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:05,698
It didn’t last very long.

509
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:10,375
Seconds.

510
01:07:12,056 --> 01:07:13,497
And then he got better.

511
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:17,103
Yeah.

512
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,028
What are you asking?

513
01:07:23,376 --> 01:07:25,825
What if Alton doesn’t
belong with us?

514
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:32,428
We need to consider that.

515
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:36,098
Come tomorrow,

516
01:07:38,341 --> 01:07:39,648
he may be gone.

517
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:45,634
I’m out.

518
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:54,499
So you've never seen a sunrise.

519
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,188
- No.
- You like it?

520
01:07:59,563 --> 01:08:00,919
What color was it?

521
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:04,058
Red...

522
01:08:04,757 --> 01:08:05,968
Orange.

523
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:10,897
Okay.

524
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:19,196
You just walked out...

525
01:08:20,273 --> 01:08:21,329
Alton!

526
01:08:54,705 --> 01:08:55,746
No!

527
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,344
No!

528
01:08:58,977 --> 01:09:00,267
No!

529
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,300
No! No!

530
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:20,861
Alton!

531
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:42,305
No!

532
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,112
No. No. Please.

533
01:09:58,142 --> 01:10:00,461
No! Stop! Stop!

534
01:10:39,578 --> 01:10:41,282
I’m sorry, Roy.

535
01:10:41,923 --> 01:10:43,977
I didn’t see them coming.

536
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:17,234
Back in the row, guys.

537
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:24,685
Hey! Asshole! Back
in the row, now!

538
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:26,210
Roy!

539
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:32,923
FBI.

540
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,176
CIA.

541
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:40,022
Homeland Security. Someone has him.
Someone knows where he is.

542
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,767
The FBI have field offices.

543
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,262
- We start there...
- We won’t find him.

544
01:13:56,494 --> 01:13:57,502
He’s gone.

545
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,729
The only thing I’ve ever
believed in was Alton.

546
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,194
And I failed.

547
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:21,958
Hello, Alton, my name
is Sharon Davison.

548
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,091
I’m a childhood
development counselor.

549
01:15:24,572 --> 01:15:26,824
I consult with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,

550
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:28,968
but I am not in law enforcement.

551
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:33,304
I need to ask you
some questions, okay?

552
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:39,590
There was a crash at a gas station
you were at. Do you remember that?

553
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:48,114
Who is been with you
the last few days?

554
01:15:52,408 --> 01:15:54,118
Have you been with your father?

555
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:03,204
I’m sorry? I didn’t hear that.

556
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:06,611
Paul.

557
01:16:08,408 --> 01:16:09,416
Who is that?

558
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,461
I want to talk to Paul Sevier.

559
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,638
- My name is...
- Paul Sevier.

560
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:32,192
Lead Operations Analyst.

561
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:37,647
They just gave me that title.

562
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:55,062
Who is this guy?

563
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,027
He's NSA.

564
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:21,814
The place that you and your
father were trying to get to,

565
01:17:21,815 --> 01:17:22,905
what’s the significance
of that location?

566
01:17:22,959 --> 01:17:25,099
I’ll only speak with him.

567
01:17:36,935 --> 01:17:38,424
Okay. Everybody out.

568
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,314
Just get the information.

569
01:18:05,236 --> 01:18:06,768
Okay. So where do we start?

570
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:36,581
That’s impressive.

571
01:19:40,064 --> 01:19:43,403
You know, I have to say, I’ve really
been looking forward to meeting you.

572
01:19:54,095 --> 01:19:55,503
I think you're a weapon.

573
01:19:58,641 --> 01:19:59,848
I'm not.

574
01:20:01,111 --> 01:20:02,987
In the ranch thinks
you are their saver.

575
01:20:04,744 --> 01:20:06,483
I'm not any of those things.

576
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,723
I belong in another world.

577
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,558
There are people there.

578
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:20,373
They watch us.

579
01:20:23,822 --> 01:20:26,214
They've been watching us
for a very long time.

580
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:36,342
I need to go where I belong.

581
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:44,049
Where you belong?

582
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,267
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Roy Tomlin?</i>

583
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:52,220
Yes.

584
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:55,848
<i>I have your son.</i>

585
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,162
Yes. He’s fine. I’m
bringing him to you.

586
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:05,317
Do you have something
to write with?

587
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,188
Okay.

588
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:14,618
Alton?

589
01:22:26,356 --> 01:22:27,464
You ready?

590
01:22:30,955 --> 01:22:34,806
29 degrees, 4 minutes,
31 seconds north.

591
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:37,364
82 degrees.

592
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,186
41 minutes, 48 seconds west. I’ll
have him there in two hours. Bye.

593
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:32,494
What about the
backup generators?

594
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:35,309
They’ve all failed. I’ve
never seen anything like it.

595
01:23:36,097 --> 01:23:37,133
And the exits?

596
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,967
We have three. The gates
to each one were opened.

597
01:23:39,992 --> 01:23:42,540
We can’t get them
closed without power.

598
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:01,956
- Let's move out.
- Alright, men.

599
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,180
Move!

600
01:24:05,103 --> 01:24:08,640
You over there. Take that side.
Let's go, move it, move it, move it.

601
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:58,488
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

602
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:05,845
Alton.

603
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:16,595
I decoded the same patterns
you found in the sermons.

604
01:25:17,814 --> 01:25:19,422
They know where you’re going.

605
01:25:20,588 --> 01:25:22,734
Everything will be blocked
up for five miles.

606
01:25:24,463 --> 01:25:25,770
You won't get through.

607
01:25:31,228 --> 01:25:32,436
I can help.

608
01:25:39,101 --> 01:25:40,422
Come on.

609
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:49,466
Can I come with you?

610
01:25:52,494 --> 01:25:53,499
No.

611
01:25:57,869 --> 01:25:58,877
Thank you.

612
01:26:04,634 --> 01:26:05,742
Are those handcuffs?

613
01:26:07,033 --> 01:26:08,641
I mean, obviously
they're handcuffs.

614
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:11,092
You're Lucas right?
The State Trooper?

615
01:26:12,856 --> 01:26:14,064
Do you mind?

616
01:26:21,274 --> 01:26:22,570
Alright, thank you.

617
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:26,677
Is it too much to ask you
to punch me in the face?

618
01:26:28,473 --> 01:26:30,520
You know, forget it. Nevermind.

619
01:26:31,245 --> 01:26:32,360
Thank you.

620
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,223
It needs to be tighter.

621
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:33,086
Get your arms up.

622
01:27:39,048 --> 01:27:41,470
- How’s that feel?
- Good.

623
01:27:43,895 --> 01:27:45,255
- Dad?
- Yeah.

624
01:27:48,845 --> 01:27:50,053
Are you scared?

625
01:27:55,899 --> 01:27:57,111
Yes.

626
01:28:01,111 --> 01:28:02,716
You don’t have to
worry about me.

627
01:28:05,252 --> 01:28:06,759
I like worrying about you.

628
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:11,939
You don’t have to, anymore.

629
01:28:18,353 --> 01:28:20,277
I’ll always worry
about you, Alton.

630
01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:23,247
That’s the deal.

631
01:28:52,463 --> 01:28:53,770
Can you get this on?

632
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,884
You’ll have to move
fast once we stop.

633
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:04,411
I understand.

634
01:29:45,223 --> 01:29:47,166
There has to be a better way in.

635
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:51,769
There’s not.

636
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:58,922
We can do this alone.

637
01:30:00,216 --> 01:30:01,823
You’ve done enough for us.

638
01:30:05,575 --> 01:30:06,783
No.

639
01:30:12,528 --> 01:30:14,063
Are you driving.

640
01:31:06,642 --> 01:31:08,181
This is it.

641
01:31:09,141 --> 01:31:10,464
You sure?

642
01:31:12,192 --> 01:31:14,144
It has the fewest soldiers.

643
01:31:18,878 --> 01:31:20,569
Get down on the floor.

644
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:27,928
Cover him up.

645
01:32:08,491 --> 01:32:10,371
No room on the shoulder.

646
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:12,202
Water.

647
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:18,328
They’ve seen you.

648
01:32:19,518 --> 01:32:21,140
Yeah, we know.

649
01:32:29,073 --> 01:32:32,272
Don’t shoot! They can
only return fire!

650
01:32:53,227 --> 01:32:54,505
We’re okay.

651
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,550
You are alright?

652
01:33:19,185 --> 01:33:20,394
Yeah.

653
01:33:22,378 --> 01:33:23,605
Here.

654
01:33:33,823 --> 01:33:34,831
Alton?

655
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:00,189
Okay.

656
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:19,112
The steering’s going.

657
01:34:21,006 --> 01:34:24,022
That tread comes off those
tires it’ll get a lot harder.

658
01:35:37,008 --> 01:35:38,303
Can’t keep this up.

659
01:42:33,067 --> 01:42:34,375
You alive?

660
01:42:50,878 --> 01:42:53,168
Can we go back to Texas now?

661
01:43:08,027 --> 01:43:09,950
You say here that he
got out of the car...

662
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:11,881
...with the birth
mother, Sarah Adams?

663
01:43:12,941 --> 01:43:14,108
Yes.

664
01:43:14,925 --> 01:43:16,133
Where is she now?

665
01:43:17,527 --> 01:43:19,335
Your guess is as good as mine.

666
01:43:20,003 --> 01:43:22,977
- You think they just walked away?
- I didn’t say that.

667
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:24,585
Well, then...

668
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:27,466
...just explain to me how,

669
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:30,104
with multiple types of
aerial and ground...

670
01:43:30,105 --> 01:43:32,200
...surveillance
surrounding the area,

671
01:43:32,744 --> 01:43:35,475
they could simply walk
away, undetected.

672
01:43:36,034 --> 01:43:37,442
I don’t know,

673
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:40,598
but if he didn’t
want you to see him,

674
01:43:41,464 --> 01:43:42,872
you wouldn’t see him.

675
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:48,217
Look, I can tell it to you
as many times as you want.

676
01:43:50,011 --> 01:43:52,469
My story’s not changing
because it’s true.

677
01:43:54,308 --> 01:43:56,050
You know.

678
01:43:56,698 --> 01:43:58,961
You all saw the same shit I saw.

679
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:02,543
But keep ask me if you want to.

680
01:44:04,682 --> 01:44:06,043
I’m done.

681
01:44:07,518 --> 01:44:09,485
They’ve sent in a specialist
to speak with you.

682
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:12,359
I suggest that you
answer him more fully.

683
01:44:43,495 --> 01:44:44,713
Hello.

684
01:44:48,952 --> 01:44:50,859
My name is Paul Sevier.

685
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:08,000
