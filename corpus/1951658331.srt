1
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,705
The need for meat.

2
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,039
It is an extreme ecstasy
derived from eating it.

3
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,689
May I sit?

4
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,003
Please.

5
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,316
I want to eat you.

6
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,361
You can.

7
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,952
Really?

8
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,033
Eat me.

9
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,498
We'll do about three at a time.

10
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,236
We can't have too many people.
We can't keep up.

11
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,145
Okay. Roppongi at seven o'clock.
Bye.

12
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,310
We're ready.

13
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,114
- Then can we shoot?
- Yes.

14
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,919
- Let's start.
- Yes.

15
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,551
- Best regards.
- Best regards.

16
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,088
Is everybody ready?

17
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,192
Stand by for a roll.

18
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,395
Camera is rolling.

19
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,665
Five seconds to action.

20
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,038
Four... three... two... one...

21
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,110
Cue.

22
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,271
Wow. Pretty serious from the morning.

23
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,941
I always eat a proper breakfast.

24
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,418
What is this dish?

25
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:35,485
It can be called Escalope,
Gypsy's Daughter.

26
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,825
Is it French food?

27
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,397
Yes, it is.

28
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,237
- Please.
- Thank you.

29
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,275
Let's try it.

30
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,876
- Delicious!
- Isn't it?

31
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,782
This meat is superb!

32
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,822
Moist and with body.

33
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,550
What is this meat?

34
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,319
What do you think?

35
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,692
Well...

36
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,559
Is the meat of a woman.

37
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,462
No! Stop kidding. It's still morning.

38
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,163
I get it from a special connection.

39
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,832
- I can't give it away.
- Is that so?

40
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:27,675
Whoever becomes your wife will be happy
to be able to eat like this every day.

41
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:33,447
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?

42
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,851
I'm looking.

43
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
Did you all hear that?

44
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,319
Not just plastic surgery, he's a great cook!

45
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,260
Dr. Yuji Kotorida is very eligible.

46
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,197
Wow. Superb!

47
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,742
Everything looks so expensive.

48
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,074
Can we shoot the contents later?

49
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,271
Go ahead.

50
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,448
What else can we shoot...

51
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,778
My management changed.

52
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,153
This time, they're more established.

53
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,692
Really. That's great.

54
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,920
Congratulations.

55
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,256
Thank you very much.

56
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,298
Doctor.

57
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,925
This refrigerator...

58
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,001
Hands off!

59
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,369
Sorry.

60
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,638
I have things inside
that I want sealed from the air.

61
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,079
Oh. I see.

62
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,343
Excuse me.

63
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,581
Light is ready.

64
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,848
All right.

65
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,224
- Well, doctor, please step over here.
- Yes.

66
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,744
Since when did people start calling you
"God-Hand"?

67
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,520
I don't know.

68
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:24,822
One after the other, the entertainers
I operated on became stars

69
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,094
and the reputation spread.

70
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,031
Let me take care of this lint.

71
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,082
AKIMOTO COSMETIC SURGERY

72
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,348
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

73
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

74
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,717
- Best regards.
- Hello.

75
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,792
- Hello.
- Hello.

76
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,760
- Hello.
- Best regards.

77
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,798
You are Dr. Kotorida's colleagues?

78
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,739
Yes. I'm Akimoto.

79
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,238
I'm Yanagihara.

80
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,297
She is the daughter
of the owner of this clinic.

81
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,231
Oh, excuse me.

82
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,396
I'm Tomino.

83
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,631
I'm pleased.

84
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,767
Have you known Dr. Kotorida for a while?

85
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,344
Yes. We went to the same university.

86
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,777
Their fates are tied together.

87
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,042
Must have been popular.

88
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,117
What?

89
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,981
When Dr. Kotorida was a student.

90
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,120
I guess you could say that.

91
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,401
- Say...
- Huh?

92
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,333
He was a different person.

93
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,929
We should have shown
his past photos on TV.

94
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,909
I might have our class picture at my house.

95
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,980
Really?

96
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,413
- In her case...
- Yes?

97
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,918
- her jaw bone sticks out.
- Yes.

98
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,356
By carving this, she will have smooth lines.

99
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,017
- It becomes sharp.
- Yes.

100
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,756
I'd like to have that done too.

101
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,161
To make it smooth.

102
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,665
You already are.

103
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,734
You think so?

104
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,459
Doctor?

105
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,202
Oh. Thank you.

106
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,105
Superb, as always.

107
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,877
Your touch is completely different
from other doctors.

108
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,915
Doctor...

109
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,248
Huh?

110
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,687
To me, you are God.

111
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,552
Doctor...

112
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,323
Huh?

113
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,799
That television reporter was our patient.

114
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,496
Yes. That's right.

115
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,832
Are you seeing her?

116
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,204
I'm not seeing her.

117
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,278
Doctor... tonight, if you'd like...

118
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,043
Sorry, I have a previous engagement.

119
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,255
Am I that unattractive?

120
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,589
Not at all.
I really have a prior engagement.

121
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,958
I don't have relations with my patients.

122
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,702
The television people are leaving.

123
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,177
My husband says I'd look ten years younger

124
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:17,688
if I got rid of the wrinkles around the eyes
and a face lift.

125
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,814
Is that so?

126
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,551
That is so.

127
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,820
That's good to hear.

128
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,623
I'm happy.

129
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,196
Well... Can you fix this too?

130
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,992
Yes?

131
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,993
Hello?

132
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,563
Hello?

133
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,517
What do you mean, "urgent business"?

134
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,648
I have my circumstances too.

135
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,352
You could think about me a little more.

136
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,526
I'll wait. Can't you come?

137
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,861
This is the worst.

138
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,773
Would you care to drink with me?

139
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,940
I don't want to drink alone.

140
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,750
Am I intruding?

141
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,021
Please excuse me.

142
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,023
Wait...

143
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,789
Just a little bit...

144
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:10,665
Most women drop their guard when they hear
I'm a cosmetic surgeon.

145
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,701
When I share the cosmetic secrets
of entertainers...

146
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,934
it is more effective.

147
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,534
I first relax them with small talk.

148
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,252
I listen well and they start telling me
their everyday problems.

149
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,718
This woman, who was stood up
by her boyfriend,

150
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,792
does not turn me down.

151
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:41,826
THE NEED FOR MEAT, IT IS THE...

152
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:56,646
THE NEED FOR MEAT, IT IS THE DESIRE
TO EAT THE MEAT OF THE ONE YOU LOVE.

153
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,819
THE DIARY OF A CANNIBAL

154
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,859
DEC. 1 (SAT.): UNTIL I CAME UPON THIS
MEAT, I CONSTANTLY DESPAIRED AND...

155
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,371
...and was on edge all the time.

156
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,194
My parents never loved me.

157
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,198
I was born with bad legs.

158
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,494
I became withdrawn.

159
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:48,438
I was so quiet and introverted
that I hated myself.

160
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,713
I, who was having to repeat the same class...

161
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:05,212
was hired by her father's clinic
out of sympathy.

162
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,909
To be frank, I was baggage.

163
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,012
But on that day...

164
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,783
my fate changed in a drastic way.

165
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,004
I impulsively stole the fat.

166
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,712
I cooked it at home.

167
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,152
It didn't taste good.

168
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,151
The material injected before
the liposuction such as...

169
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,196
the saline solution,

170
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,559
anti-coagulants,

171
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,462
and anesthesia

172
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,866
made it bitter, salty,

173
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,530
...like medicine. It was a peculiar taste.

174
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,271
But for the first time, I was fulfilled.

175
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,677
Now that I think about it,

176
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,115
after having tried eating everything,

177
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,620
it was the forbidden fruit
I always craved.

178
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:03,524
I could no longer think
of eating beef or pork.

179
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:17,577
It became repulsive,
like bestiality with a cow or pig.

180
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,455
A small amount of fat and a salad...

181
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,189
in addition to supplements,

182
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:36,859
breathing exercises to stave off hunger.

183
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,962
My senses became sharper.

184
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,438
It was an incredible experience.

185
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:53,550
But the more I ate,
the more I wanted to eat a real woman.

186
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,530
By accident...

187
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:54,704
No. More like a hyena
smelling out dead meat...

188
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:59,409
my senses, which were
acclimated to flesh,

189
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:03,385
perhaps smelled out its presence.

190
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,317
BLOODLETTING

191
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,102
It took half a day to dismember the body.

192
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,306
I stored the various edible parts
in the refrigerator.

193
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:57,942
Since then,

194
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,012
at least once a day,

195
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,047
I cook and eat a woman's meat.

196
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:10,749
It is the equivalent of having intercourse
with a woman once a day.

197
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,757
Those were days of satisfaction.

198
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,951
I wanted to eat more.

199
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,989
I was limited to the meat I had and saved it.

200
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,838
Don't you think Dr. Kotorida
has been looking good?

201
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,469
That's right. He changed.

202
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,309
I wonder what happened.

203
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,315
Maybe he got a girlfriend.

204
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,783
- That might be true.
- I'm sure of it.

205
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,319
Wow.

206
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,571
That meat may have
changed everything about me.

207
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:10,107
You have become charismatic
in the world of cosmetic surgery.

208
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,944
No, not at all.

209
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,416
Your reputation is impressive.

210
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,647
What do you do on your days off?

211
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,882
I get this meat from a special source.

212
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,588
You're the only other person that's eaten it.

213
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,393
I'd like to show you to our old friends.

214
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,505
I always believed in you.

215
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,208
My parents were opposed.

216
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:02,446
I always believed
you could carry on our clinic.

217
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,656
To eat the housewife that hung herself

218
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,201
took me only ninety days.

219
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,243
There were no more bodies.

220
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,381
Of course, you couldn't buy human meat.

221
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,434
It was then that I was invited
to a world conference in Hong Kong.

222
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,000
I searched for a place
that had been on my mind.

223
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,154
A few years ago in this city,

224
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:10,201
there was a sick incident of a man
killing his lover and eating her.

225
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:18,998
Since then, there have been rumors on the
internet of the availability of human meals.

226
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,282
I searched for three days and nights.

227
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,608
Why are you following me?

228
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,812
From 334 A.D.

229
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,045
to 349 A.D.,

230
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,679
the ruler of the northern regions of China,

231
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,284
when entertaining important guests
at a banquet,

232
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:43,389
would choose a woman amongst the many
women of the court,

233
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,129
decapitate her,

234
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:51,437
and have his chefs prepare a meal
with her meat.

235
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,125
Please eat me.

236
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,169
Christy was also meant for sacrifice.

237
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:01,971
I could eat her exclusively
for thirty thousand dollars.

238
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,443
She came from Kanson.

239
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,074
She was going to send her family her share
of ten thousand dollars.

240
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:59,220
MAY 17 (FRI): I PICKED UP A CO-ED
AND DISMEMBERED HER.

241
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:43,321
I get it from a special connection.
I can't give it away.

242
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,957
Is that so?

243
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:50,836
Whoever becomes your wife will be happy
to be able to eat like this everyday.

244
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,369
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?

245
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,943
I'm looking.

246
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,639
Did you all hear that?

247
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,117
Not just plastic surgery, he's a great cook!

248
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,713
Dr. Yuji Kotorida is very eligible.

249
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,189
Yes.

250
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,159
It's Kanako. Do you have a minute?

251
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,163
Yeah.

252
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:20,925
What is it?

253
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,527
Sorry on your day off.

254
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,106
Were you sleeping?

255
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,174
No.

256
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,038
Is somebody here?

257
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,135
No. Come in.

258
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,214
Thanks.

259
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,582
Still eating breakfast, Yuji?

260
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,026
Want some coffee?

261
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,360
I'd like tea.

262
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,433
Oh?

263
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,998
Let's see, tea...

264
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,594
Tea.

265
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,375
Say...

266
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,245
Can I try this bacon?

267
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,252
Yeah.

268
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,865
This is it.

269
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:28,028
I craved for this meat.

270
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,474
Yuji...

271
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,515
Could you tell me once and for all?

272
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,709
What is this meat?

273
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,485
You came just to ask that?

274
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,228
What's the matter?

275
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,763
I'm... pregnant.

276
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,167
Huh?

277
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,298
Mine?

278
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,841
I don't know.

279
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:11,471
I'm seeing two other guys with O type blood.

280
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,574
So... what are you going to do?

281
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:23,351
I plan to marry Mikiya.
My parents approve of him.

282
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,424
Is that so?

283
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,433
Congratulations.

284
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,457
Thanks.

285
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,764
Let's stay friends.

286
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,273
Of course.

287
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,147
I'll provide that meat you like
for your wedding.

288
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,124
Really?

289
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,318
Yeah.

290
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,620
I'll really shine that day.

291
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,998
I'm the only one that can cook that meat.

292
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,832
Thanks. I'm so happy.

293
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,452
Oh...?

294
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,959
Smoke?

295
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,031
Yes.

296
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,325
A real man's day off.
Nice.

297
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,902
I used to go stream fishing.

298
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,877
I used to smoke the fish.

299
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:55,681
I've been too busy and it's been a while.

300
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,226
This is convenient.

301
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,603
It smells good.

302
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,070
Makes me want a beer.

303
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,732
I want to do it at home.

304
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,812
But the smoke is too much.

305
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,470
I can imagine.

306
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,813
Do you have a light?

307
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:32,888
Oh.

308
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,861
Can't even smoke these days.

309
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,004
Can't do this, can't do that.

310
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,843
It makes us crazy.

311
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,697
Yes... hello?

312
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,577
Hello... it's Rumi.

313
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,043
Rumi Ogawa.

314
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,205
Of the Akimoto Clinic.

315
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,443
Yeah?

316
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,679
Miss Ogawa, what is it?

317
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:44,483
I know your secret.

318
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,124
What do you mean?

319
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,521
I saw...

320
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,003
The other day...

321
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:58,667
I saw you go to a hotel with Kanako Akimoto.

322
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,609
I'm sorry.

323
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,340
I followed you.

324
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,450
And?

325
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:14,214
It's rumored that Dr. Akimoto
is marrying another man.

326
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,791
Well... right.

327
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:23,855
You should pick someone serious about you.

328
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:29,235
I'm sorry. I'm not attracted to you.

329
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,468
That's horrible.

330
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,605
You can tell the hospital director
if you want.

331
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,343
I wouldn't.

332
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,544
Sorry, but forget about me.

333
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,383
Doctor...

334
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,719
I'm holding a scalpel right now.

335
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,056
The one you use for surgery.

336
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,595
If I cut myself...

337
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,435
you'll heal it, right?

338
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:13,611
Doctor, you are a God to me.

339
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,390
All right.

340
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:25,655
Let's just have one meal together. Okay?

341
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,956
You mean that?

342
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,497
I'm happy!

343
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,224
See you.

344
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,372
I saw the TV show.

345
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,775
How was it?

346
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,477
It was good.

347
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,781
You mean that?

348
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,287
I'm so happy!

349
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:57,525
It was popular at the station too.

350
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,255
It looks like I can continue.

351
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,763
Yeah? That's great!

352
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,557
Doctor, I owe it to you.

353
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,398
No. It's your ability.

354
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:15,935
You brought out my attractiveness.

355
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,946
Doctor... I...

356
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,953
MAY 21 (THUR): I DON'T HAVE RELATIONS
WITH MY PATIENTS.

357
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,358
Today is an exception.

358
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,535
I wanted to see your face.

359
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,275
What?

360
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:00,650
It was nice during the day,
but night is even better.

361
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:02,948
May I sit?

362
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,027
Please.

363
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,883
I want to eat you.

364
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,509
I couldn't wait.

365
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,577
Go home.

366
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,236
Somebody here?

367
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,370
None of your business.

368
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,010
You liar.

369
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:12,152
Since I saw you at the clinic,
I never liked you.

370
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,254
Doctor?

371
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,126
Don't be fooled.

372
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,475
What have done to my precious face?

373
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,333
Oh, no.

374
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:57,766
I just wanted to die with you, Doctor.

375
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,368
Doctor?

376
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,605
What should I do?

377
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,254
It's all right.

378
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,654
Relax.

379
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,892
Calm down...

380
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,164
and think about what to do.

381
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,650
Here.

382
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,483
Pull slowly.

383
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,921
There, that's a good girl.

384
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:40,153
AKIMOTO COSMETIC CLINIC

385
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,469
First time here?

386
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,043
Come in.

387
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,611
Excuse us.

388
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,578
You're... the other day...

389
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,117
Tachibana of the Police.

390
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,423
This is Shimoda.

391
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:32,145
From five days ago,

392
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:36,412
a woman named Aiko Suzuki
has been missing.

393
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,714
Aiko Suzuki?

394
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:46,056
She is known as Saki Minemura,
an entertainer.

395
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,892
I remember her.

396
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,124
She is a patient.

397
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,659
She hasn't reported for work.

398
01:07:54,770 --> 01:08:00,072
Concerned co-workers consulted her parents.

399
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:04,670
They asked the Police to investigate.

400
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,142
Is that so?

401
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:15,590
D. Kotorida, have you seen
Ms. Suzuki lately?

402
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:23,096
Recently, she interviewed me
for her TV show.

403
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,025
Other than that?

404
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:31,369
I'm at a loss.

405
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,534
Once, I had dinner with her in Yokohama.

406
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:40,379
Last week, Saturday night.

407
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,849
The night she went missing.

408
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,487
What?

409
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:46,885
Is that so?

410
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:50,891
Why hide the fact about the dinner?

411
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,592
Sorry.

412
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,265
I didn't want to be misunderstood.

413
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:02,963
I don't have personal relations
with my patients.

414
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:08,032
You know...
rumors about fooling with the patients.

415
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,769
I had dinner with Ms. Suzuki

416
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,851
in appreciation for her coverage.

417
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:17,509
After dinner?

418
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,383
I saw her home.

419
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,514
I see.

420
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:26,728
What?

421
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,026
You think I'm involved
in her disappearance?

422
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,032
No.

423
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:36,571
She was last seen having dinner with you.

424
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,140
I thought you knew something.

425
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,176
By the way,

426
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,805
did she have any problems?

427
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,546
Let's see...

428
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,883
Stalking fans...

429
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,447
Stalker?

430
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,525
Yes.

431
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:01,756
She mentioned she was persistently being
stalked by a male fan.

432
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:05,994
Dr. Kotorida, have you seen his face?

433
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,626
No, it was during the conversation.

434
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,801
Is that so.

435
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:18,843
There's an increase in young missing women in
the Kamakura area in the last two years.

436
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:25,843
So I've been looking for a clue to solve it.

437
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,949
Stalker...

438
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:39,797
Thank you very much.

439
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,930
Let me know if there is anything I can do.

440
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,598
That's great.

441
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,478
Sometimes people run away.

442
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,346
It's not always a crime.

443
01:10:56,552 --> 01:11:00,613
There hasn't been one body.

444
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:16,898
Bustling, as always.

445
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:35,450
- Doctor...
- Huh?

446
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,683
Have you heard?

447
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,751
Ms. Ogawa has been
absent without leave for three days.

448
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,295
She doesn't answer her cellphone.

449
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,899
Maybe she went missing.

450
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,232
No way.

451
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,000
You're right.

452
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:56,271
But I was surprised when the Police came.

453
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,837
Better be careful, Ms. Ezawa.

454
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,437
Stop it.

455
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,382
YOU HAVE MAIL

456
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,185
SENDER UNKNOWN

457
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,729
...IT IS THE DESIRE TO EAT THE MEAT
OF THE ONE YOU LOVE.

458
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,949
I had a strange dream.

459
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,945
I dreamed I was eaten by Christy.

460
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,359
Could it be a premonition?

461
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,372
Yes.

462
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,100
It's Tachibana.

463
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:15,415
I was in the neighborhood.

464
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,551
- Come in.
- All right.

465
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,259
Where is your partner?

466
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:31,635
I'm off-duty today.

467
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,234
What can I do for you?

468
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:43,380
I'm embarrassed to say,

469
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,154
I can't forget about that meat.

470
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:51,159
Meat?

471
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,558
You know.

472
01:13:55,431 --> 01:14:00,994
The smoked meat you were making
at the beach.

473
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,004
Oh.

474
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,597
When I smelled that aroma...

475
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,836
I was enthralled.

476
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:17,142
Just once, I wanted to try that meat.

477
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:19,812
I know it's presumptuous.

478
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:24,816
Please.

479
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:30,729
May I try that meat just once?

480
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:33,334
Yes, you can.

481
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:37,030
I recently made some.

482
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,805
Doctor...

483
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,575
You've been single?

484
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:49,818
Yes.

485
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:53,581
My colleagues keep getting married.

486
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,453
Another one is getting married tomorrow.

487
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,049
That's wonderful.

488
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,395
So this is it.

489
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:14,006
I'll eat it with my hands.

490
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,076
Go ahead.

491
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,958
Delicious.

492
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,726
I've never tasted meat this good.

493
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,236
Isn't it?

494
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,809
It's really different.

495
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:08,094
A young woman's meat.

496
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,498
Detective, you're funny.

497
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,741
I always wanted to try it.

498
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:36,784
The meat of a freshly killed young woman

499
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:41,329
as you say in your diary.

500
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:43,490
Diary?

501
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,965
On the internet.

502
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:51,131
I can tell even if you deleted your identity.

503
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,738
That is a fictional...

504
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,867
Doctor...

505
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,109
I've investigated.

506
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:08,045
You are the serial...

507
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:12,024
missing persons suspect.

508
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,323
But, you know...

509
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:23,362
I let you swim.

510
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:30,372
I even erased evidence I had to submit.

511
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:36,010
Do you know why?

512
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,187
No.

513
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,156
I'm also...

514
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,894
a fan of human meat.

515
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,638
From before...

516
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:07,012
I was secretly eating

517
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:12,747
dead bodies from the crime lab.

518
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:17,982
But it didn't taste good.

519
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,326
It was rotten.

520
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,092
It tasted like medicine.

521
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,969
I ate too much.

522
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:36,010
And I became like this.

523
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,540
It was...

524
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,520
perhaps like when you ate...

525
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:51,183
that fat for the first time.

526
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,729
But...

527
01:18:56,031 --> 01:19:01,526
you took it to the next step right away.

528
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,298
I envied you.

529
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,675
So...

530
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,679
what are you going to do to me?

531
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:16,882
It's easy to arrest you.

532
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:24,620
But I don't gain much from it.

533
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,661
Want to make a deal?

534
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,690
I don't arrest you...

535
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,565
from now on...

536
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:40,164
you provide me with fresh women's meat.

537
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,869
Ridiculous.

538
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,642
You could do it.

539
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:54,011
And to you...

540
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,421
it's nothing.

541
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:02,661
Can the police make such a reckless deal?

542
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,031
If it's not possible...

543
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,536
I immediately call for back-up

544
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,541
and thoroughly go through your home.

545
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,280
The police...

546
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,721
we can do anything.

547
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,999
I'll give you half a day.

548
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:46,472
Please think about it.

549
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:55,005
I hope you can make the wedding.

550
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,659
We can do anything.

551
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,050
You're a God?

552
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,592
Not good.

553
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,072
Hello?

554
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:39,312
Yuji? What's the matter?

555
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,286
Sorry.

556
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:45,450
I might not make the ceremony tomorrow.

557
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,050
What?

558
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:50,029
What do you mean?
I don't believe you.

559
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,621
Really, I'm sorry.

560
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,392
What are you doing?

561
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,132
You're supposed to prepare the meal.

562
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,833
I'll prepare the meal.

563
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,002
I'll have it delivered.

564
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:09,307
You really can't come to the wedding?

565
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,285
Yuji, I want you to come.

566
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,547
Kanako...

567
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,020
What?

568
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,316
I still love you.

569
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,662
That's why...

570
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,630
I want you to eat the meat.

571
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,502
The secret of this meat...

572
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,767
I'll tell you.

573
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:18,519
Really?

574
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,548
I'm just a friend?

575
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,286
You thought so?

576
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:29,522
From back then?

577
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,961
I was that showing off?

578
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,934
- Talking about us?
- Yes.

579
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,507
Everybody, the time has come.

580
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:50,345
The food has arrived.

581
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,319
Please enjoy the meal.

582
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:19,907
It looks so good!

583
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,617
This is good.

584
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:28,952
It's tasty.

585
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:31,288
- The colors!
- Isn't it good?

586
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,352
- It's spicy and tasty.
- Really?

587
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,632
- It's good!
- Let's have more!

588
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:39,700
Yeah, let's have some!

589
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,134
- I've never had this meat before.
- I could eat it all.

590
01:25:58,953 --> 01:25:59,977
Excuse me.

591
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,950
A delivery from Dr. Kotorida just arrived.

592
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,083
What could it be?

593
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,421
It's a big box.

594
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:09,326
It must be a present.

595
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,159
Please bring it here.

596
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,290
As you say.

597
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:20,770
A present from Dr. Kotorida,
who contributed today's wonderful meal,

598
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:25,608
and is best friends with the bride and groom.

599
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:23,728
The secret of this meat... I'll tell you.

600
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:17,310
Thought you could get away, Kotorida?
