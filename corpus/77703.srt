1
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:34,557
(siren blaring)

2
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:35,076
(dog barking)

3
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,918
Quigley!

4
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,902
TV Host:
Spin again and risk it all,

5
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:30,465
or walk the plank
and risk your life.

6
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,511
(audience chanting)
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

7
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,207
- Mrs. Darmstetter?
- It is a big one.

8
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,942
Oh, hi!

9
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,644
You left your door open again.

10
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,085
Heaven's sake, I wonder
how that happened.

11
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:43,952
So, how is everything?

12
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:47,015
Well, I'm worried
about my mail.

13
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,789
I think someone's stealing it,

14
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:52,126
because I haven't received
any letters from my kids

15
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:55,565
in a long time,
and they always write.

16
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,763
Are they taking all your mail
or just the letters?

17
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:00,635
No, just the letters.

18
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,574
You'd think they'd take everything else,
wouldn't you? But they don't.

19
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,476
Yeah, well, I'll talk
to the super about it, okay?

20
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:09,037
And if you want,
I'll keep an eye out, too.

21
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,878
Thanks, hon.

22
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,679
I...

23
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,583
I got dessert.

24
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,646
For heaven's sake,
I couldn't eat that whole thing.

25
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:19,351
Okay.

26
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:21,985
I suppose
I could eat some of it now,

27
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,825
and save the rest for later.

28
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:26,797
- I suppose. Here you go.
- Thank you.

29
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,027
I'm gonna be home tonight,
if you need anything, all right?

30
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,592
- Good.
- Okay.

31
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,161
- Bye, me too.
- Yeah? Okay.

32
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:41,170
¶... Like an angel ¶

33
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:43,272
¶ From above ¶

34
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,317
¶ Bring me home ¶

35
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,717
¶ Oh, you bring me love ¶

36
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,448
¶ I was lonely ¶

37
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,387
¶ Until you showed me ¶

38
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,857
- ¶ You made me feel those things... ¶
- Hey, babe.

39
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,622
- Hey.
- ¶ I never felt before... ¶

40
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,563
I know, I'm early.
I'm not gonna stay.

41
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,964
I just can't stop
thinking about tonight.

42
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:05,004
I had to see you.
Are you mad, hmm?

43
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,266
Well, you know, we did say
after rehearsal, right?

44
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,467
I know, and I'll be back
after rehearsal.

45
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,670
I just had to make sure you weren't having
any second thoughts.

46
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,270
This is a good thing
for us, you know.

47
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,516
After rehearsal, Carla.

48
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,649
How hard is it to fix a leak?

49
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,957
My outside key
didn't work again, either.

50
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,997
That guy with the dog
finally let me in.

51
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:35,000
I called the guy eight times already.
Fix the damn leak.

52
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,899
Just fix it.

53
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:40,461
So, you told Dwight you were gonna
be out of town this weekend, huh?

54
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,203
- Is that the story?
- Yeah, I know.

55
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,507
I don't get it.

56
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,570
I don't get it, Tepp.

57
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,206
Why lie?

58
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:53,810
Why not just say,
"Dwight, I can't do it." Huh?

59
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:56,218
There's nothing wrong with that,
if it's how you feel.

60
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,553
- It's easier.
- Yeah?

61
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:01,650
Except now, you can't
even come see my show.

62
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,719
I'll say my plans
fell through.

63
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,458
Why go through all that trouble?
It doesn't make any sense.

64
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:14,034
You know what?
Here's Tepper.

65
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,870
Here's Tepper,
and here's the truth.

66
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,911
And you go
all the way around,

67
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,378
just to end up right back
where you started,

68
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,745
where you could have been
straight up front in the first place.

69
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,842
TV: If these are your numbers,
you're six million richer!

70
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,652
It's silly.

71
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,282
As silly as pretending

72
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,658
to not check your numbers,
when I know you do.

73
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:47,266
- So, I'll see you tonight, right?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,898
- You'll be here?
- Yep.

75
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,840
Yeah?

76
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,174
I'm just confirming that
we have a date tonight.

77
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,840
Carla, you waited
six months, right?

78
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:59,112
- Uh-huh.
- Do you want to spoil the whole thing?

79
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:03,412
No, not if it's
a good thing.

80
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,982
I'll see you tonight.

81
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,363
Have fun with
your poker buddies.

82
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:13,660
Okay.

83
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,996
And I'll see you tonight.

84
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,124
Elephant juice.

85
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,762
I love you too.

86
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,206
Hey, loser, it's Coop.
Can't make it tonight.

87
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,215
Order for delivery, please.

88
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:09,379
Name's Tepper.

89
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:02,171
- What listing, please?
- Avery Phillips.

90
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,301
- What city?
- Manhattan.

91
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,209
Checking Avery Phillips.
No listing in Manhattan.

92
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,910
- Any other boroughs?
- No, sir.

93
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,043
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:18,551
Avery, you should keep
a number in here, buddy.

95
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,664
Recording:
No one is available right now.

96
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:36,469
Please leave your message
after the tone.

97
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,238
Hi, Victor.
If this is you,

98
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,371
I found a wallet tonight.

99
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,506
It belongs
to an Avery Phillips.

100
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,642
Your number
was inside the wallet.

101
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,209
So if you know this guy,
have him call me.

102
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,515
My name is Tepper,

103
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:53,457
and I'm at 555-0186.

104
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:55,960
Actually, I'm gonna
be here all night,

105
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,053
so if you want to tell him
to stop by, he can.

106
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,500
My address is
411 West 13th Ave, apartment #7.

107
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,060
And if this isn't Victor,

108
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,231
sorry to bother you, man. Bye.

109
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:06,488
10.

110
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,624
23.

111
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:11,067
91.

112
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:13,537
(intercom buzzes)

113
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:17,598
Yeah?

114
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,805
It's Fish, I'm standing
in a river out here, let me in.

115
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,939
Come on up, Fish.

116
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:37,795
Recording: Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

117
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:40,297
The winning numbers are: 10...

118
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,596
23... 91.

119
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,795
To hear the numbers again,

120
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,895
press one.

121
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,875
Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

122
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,070
The winning numbers are: 10...

123
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,546
23... 91.

124
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,708
91! 91!

125
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,844
10, 23, 91!
Okay, right!

126
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,280
Hey, Fish, you're not
gonna believe this.

127
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,692
Do you ever check the numbers
before we play?

128
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,492
What?

129
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:15,591
Just say the word. Do you ever check
the numbers before we play?

130
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,795
- No.
- No. Of course not. Why?

131
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,997
'Cause the rule is,
you don't look.

132
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,768
You don't look. I don't look. Bolan
doesn't look. Cooper doesn't look.

133
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:25,242
But that pinhead Quigley,
look, it's numbers time,

134
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,940
and he's got his freaking TV on, so loud
I can hear him from the stairwell.

135
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,608
And look, I'm not saying
he's checking the numbers

136
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:35,085
but that kid put the thought in my head.
You know I don't trust him, right?

137
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:38,248
I don't trust that kid.
Why you're friends with him

138
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:41,191
makes no sense to me at all.
He's gonna rub off on you.

139
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,820
You know that little
rodent mole stink he's got?

140
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:46,592
It's gonna rub off on you.
Wake up one day be like,

141
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,101
"Jesus Christ, Mary, Joseph,
what is that stink?

142
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,160
Oh my God,
I smell like Quigley."

143
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:54,035
Better yet,
wake up in 40 years

144
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,438
and not have a friend,
it's 'cause of him.

145
00:11:57,543 --> 00:12:00,671
Some people, they don't get it.
He doesn't get it.

146
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,839
Give to the Red Cross,
give to the United Way,

147
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,441
but this whole friendship charity
crap has got to stop.

148
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:14,017
I'm done.
I just need a beer.

149
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,153
I need a beer like a crack whore
needs a big fat rock.

150
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:20,562
And please, tell me you did not
just buy them across the street,

151
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,101
from the little punk who's
too cheap to turn on his freezer.

152
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,637
Oh, you're killing me, Tepp.

153
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,468
Cold beer one week,
that's all I ask for.

154
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,840
We're playing unlimited tonight.
None of this 50¢ cents max crap.

155
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,503
You know I owe everyone.

156
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,376
- (intercom buzzes)
- Wanna bet that's Bolan?

157
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:37,472
Bet you it's Bolan and
he's got to take a piss.

158
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,108
- Yeah?
- Tepper?

159
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,517
It's Fishman.
Get your ass and bladder up here.

160
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,591
Fish, let me
ask you something.

161
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,061
I found some guy's wallet
on my way home today.

162
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,000
No phone number.
No driver's license. Nothing.

163
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,094
I left a message with
this guy named Victor

164
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,071
whose number
was in the wallet.

165
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,300
Got any money in it?

166
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:05,309
- No. I don't want the money.
- Don't say you don't want the money!

167
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,867
'Cause if you don't want the money,
I want the money!

168
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,972
Okay, but I'm just trying to figure out what I
should do with it.

169
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,109
In this city what do you do,
give it to a cop?

170
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,346
Better chance of throwing it out
the window and him getting it.

171
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,446
So, what you're saying,
I should just...

172
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,184
forget it?
Don't worry about it?

173
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,784
If the guy's not smart enough to put
his number in the wallet, screw him!

174
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:25,956
- (knocking)
- I'll get it.

175
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,898
You're right.
It's just...

176
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,129
Get rid of it.

177
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:33,694
- Holy cow, I gotta pee.
- You're consistent, I'll give you that.

178
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,865
I've been holding in
so long, it hurts.

179
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,705
Shouldn't hold it in. Wear your
bladder out, have to wear diapers.

180
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,678
That's all I need...
sterile and wearing Depends.

181
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,011
- At least I still got my hair.
- Easy!

182
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:49,182
We're playing unlimited tonight,
none of this 50¢ max bullcrap.

183
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:53,214
Oh boy, I think I may have done
permanent damage this time.

184
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,419
You guys can say what you want
but those pills are working.

185
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:56,984
Thick as muff, this thing.

186
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,455
I feel good.

187
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,397
I look good.

188
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,099
I shouldn't be playing at all tonight,
so much going on with Carla.

189
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,436
We should make it
an early one tonight, okay?

190
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:11,100
So start already!

191
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,272
What the deuce?

192
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,837
10 to one on Five
it says it rains all night.

193
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,043
You know, statistically,
I never win when it's wet.

194
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,881
- (knocking)
- I hate this crap!

195
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:23,148
Yeah, Jake Poster, please.

196
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,349
What's up, Fish?
What's up fellas?

197
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,915
Who do you like tomorrow?
SC or Notre Dame?

198
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,553
- Are you making a bet?
- I'm having phone sex with your wife.

199
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,688
- Who do you like?
- Notre Dame.

200
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:35,199
Poster, it's Fish.
Give me three bills on SC.

201
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,326
- Yeah, that's very funny.
- Thanks.

202
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:39,394
I'm the one who played college ball.
You never ask me.

203
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,530
Suiting up is not playing.

204
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,542
Gotta win some cash tonight.
You know I got guys after me?

205
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,170
That's 'cause you bet
with money you don't have.

206
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:49,646
Stopped by work with a two by four,
missed me by five minutes.

207
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,343
- I brought wine.
- Hey, more pilferage.

208
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:57,480
Bolan, don't! It's not pilferage,
we're allotted so much a month.

209
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,786
Yeah, for business.

210
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:03,157
For whatever, I am a wine salesman.
Everybody does it. It's part of the job.

211
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,891
This a Bar-Mitzvah? You don't bring
wine to poker, for crying out loud.

212
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,434
My friends,
it's time to play.

213
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,197
We need to get it moving here,
I'm popping the question tonight.

214
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,966
So, bet big early with the deuce.

215
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,234
We're here five minutes,
getting grief already.

216
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,367
I'm just saying,
a bottle here, a bottle there.

217
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,435
Please, stop the lecture.

218
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,571
Look, if one of my counselors
takes home a box of pencils,

219
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,411
it's three bucks,
it's no big deal, right?

220
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:27,384
But if everybody takes home a box,
that's 300 bucks,

221
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,580
and somebody's
paying for that...

222
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:33,022
me. Companies lose
billions in employee theft.

223
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:34,150
Oh, now it's theft!

224
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,024
That's his point.
That's what pilfering is, it's theft!

225
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:40,657
You know what? Screw you, guys.
If you don't want to drink it, don't.

226
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,863
- I'm not coming down on you, boy.
- Yeah, you are, Bolan. You always are.

227
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:48,873
- Dance with me.
- I don't want to dance with you, Bolan.

228
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:50,966
When was the last time
you loved yourself?

229
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,101
Okay, Bolan, you've got
to stop with the therapy.

230
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:56,204
No, it's not therapy this time.
It was a seminar.

231
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:58,647
Power of suggestion.
Change your life.

232
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,977
Save your breath, Bolan.

233
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,851
The Quigley Mantra
will always remain the same.

234
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,550
"What they don't know,
won't hurt them."

235
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,560
- Am I right, Tepper?
- Yeah, I'm staying out of that.

236
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,119
You know what? You guys
got to learn to live a little.

237
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,332
Open yourself up
to new things, you know?

238
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,459
Hey.

239
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,198
How was "Jeopardy"?
Or was it "Wheel"?

240
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,244
I forgot.

241
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,575
Hey, Tepp.
What is it that comes on

242
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,979
right after the lottery
numbers?

243
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,280
- I don't watch that stuff.
- Fish?

244
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,048
- Must have been another apartment.
- Did you guys see the ring he scored?

245
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,986
- What the hell's he talking about?
- Under the second drawer.

246
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,082
What is he talking about?

247
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,026
- This is great.
- Got that for two bills.

248
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,154
Look at that.

249
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,164
- Fell off a truck, did it?
- Something like that.

250
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,166
It's a starter ring,
he can move up later.

251
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,633
Looks like
your kind of ring, Quigley.

252
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,033
You're smart not
to invest a lot.

253
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,698
It's nothing towards Carla,
but marriage can really suck.

254
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,207
No, your marriage sucked.
'Cause you're an idiot!

255
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:01,308
Carla's a keeper.

256
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,541
Love that girl.

257
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,640
Give me this.

258
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,013
Hey, Tepp!

259
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,682
- Now, that's class!
- Stolen ring?

260
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:16,250
- Great way to start a marriage.
- It's perfect, it's just what I wanted.

261
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,387
Gimme a hand with this.

262
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:21,024
Depending on what
date you set,

263
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,091
I've got to get you
up to camp.

264
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,658
You hang out
with the kids.

265
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,567
It's an experience,
it will bring you closer.

266
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:29,732
- Okay.
- Okay? One more thing,

267
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,402
Dance class.
Come with me.

268
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,570
- Yeah.
- Okay.

269
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,084
Carla knows something's
happening tonight, right?

270
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:44,611
Something damn well better happen.
She gave him the six-month deadline.

271
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,918
It wasn't a deadline.

272
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,785
Time to think, whatever.
The point is, you made the right choice.

273
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,297
Tepp,
when you do it,

274
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,832
do it right.

275
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,562
Get down on one knee.

276
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,968
Make her feel cherished.

277
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,063
I mean, she'll never forget it.

278
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:05,633
I hope these are okay.
Best I could find on a short notice.

279
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,340
They should have cost 10,
but they were in the $5 bin.

280
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,848
So, we got a deal.
What?

281
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:14,943
The guy says to put them in the fridge
and keep them fresh for tonight.

282
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,079
Hey, Quigley, it's cool,
don't worry about it.

283
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,248
- You guys want a beer?
- Yeah!

284
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,154
Grab mine,
it's on the counter.

285
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,557
- And a water.
- And wine for the whiner.

286
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,564
Tepp, listen,
if you decide that later

287
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,194
you wanna give Carla
something a little more substantial,

288
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,397
let me know, okay?

289
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,440
'Cause I got a guy,

290
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:37,566
and he can hook you up,
he can trade that thing in,

291
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,838
get you something
real special, okay?

292
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,937
- Okay, great!
- Okay.

293
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:45,642
- What?
- "I got a guy."

294
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:47,844
"I got a guy."

295
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,480
- Where's Coop?
- He's not coming.

296
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,150
What do you mean he's not coming?
That putz owes me 50 bucks.

297
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:56,592
Listen to me, Tepper.
He calls and I wanna talk to his ass.

298
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,493
Six million tonight, fellows,
and it's all mine!

299
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:02,159
Mary must have squeezed your brain.
You ain't taking shit.

300
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,702
- All right, I'm bank.
- There's a surprise!

301
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,762
And we're playing unlimited tonight.
None of this 50¢ max bullshit.

302
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,673
Let's get that chair out.
What are you doing? You sit here.

303
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,176
- Will you turn that shit down!?
- I'm sitting here tonight.

304
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:16,146
- That's not your seat. You sit here.
- Who cares where he sits?

305
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:18,149
- I do!
- Yeah, I'm sitting here tonight.

306
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:21,516
That's not his seat, that's
Coop's seat. You sit here.

307
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:24,553
Fine!

308
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,820
Like an old lady.

309
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:30,555
Thank you.
Cough it up, let's go.

310
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,527
Let's go!

311
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,759
What's this? This isn't enough.
We're playing unlimited tonight.

312
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,528
We're not playing
unlimited tonight.

313
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:38,729
Yeah, you know I might have
in the other chair over here.

314
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,272
But not now!

315
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,399
50¢ max,
three raises limit.

316
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,999
Same as always, buddy.

317
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,512
Thank you for your help.
Thank you very much.

318
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,877
You're welcome.

319
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:51,540
Tepp!

320
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:56,285
- The wine.
- Oh. Okay, yeah.

321
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,879
Thanks, Teppo!

322
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,254
- What is this?
- $10.

323
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,297
$10? Quigley, you've got to be
freakin' kidding me!

324
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,890
- That's all I've got. Lay off!
- Every week, it's the same thing.

325
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,696
The cab ride over costs more.
You know that, right?

326
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:14,194
You've got to get married
if only for the food.

327
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,865
- You want me to walk?
- (intercom buzzes)

328
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,739
Now, we're talking.
I got it.

329
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:23,607
You've got big brother
Bolan, come back.

330
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,877
Good evening,
this is Avery Phillips.

331
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:29,647
- I'm here about the wallet.
- Yeah, one second!

332
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:32,519
What happened?
Holy shit, what d'you do?

333
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,391
- Nothing, I just cut myself.
- Well, do you have a Band-Aid or...

334
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:38,326
- peroxide?
- I'm fine.

335
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:41,628
See now this
is the perfect time

336
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,534
to have your sweetie wrap that thing up
for you and kiss your little face.

337
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:48,630
Why don't you get the wine
for Quigley? Bring it in.

338
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,765
Intercom: Hello?

339
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,605
Hey, Tepper damn near pulled
a Bobbit opening your pilferage.

340
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:53,906
I had an opener.

341
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,470
Wine and poker are like horse
and church, they don't belong together.

342
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:59,141
- Tepp, I had an opener!
- Intercom: Hello?

343
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,412
You think I'd show up here
without an opener?

344
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:03,511
Nobody's thinking
about you at all, Quigley.

345
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:07,517
- Yeah?
- This is Avery Phillips.

346
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:13,058
- Yeah?
- You found my wallet.

347
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,860
- Yeah. You're Avery?
- Yes.

348
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,063
You called my
brother-in-law Victor.

349
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:22,197
Can I come up?

350
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,765
Yeah.
Come on up, Avery.

351
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,503
So listen, I cop a squat
and I drop a deuce.

352
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,340
Hey, Tepp, what are you
doing at the door?

353
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,676
The guy with the wallet,
he's coming by to pick it up.

354
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,375
I thought you said
there wasn't anything in it.

355
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,542
How the hell am I supposed to know?
The guy wants his wallet.

356
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,883
This shit was so big,
Mary couldn't believe it.

357
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,820
You call your wife in
when you take a dump?

358
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,950
I'm proud of it.
What? I've got no secrets.

359
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,085
- That's sick!
- That's intimacy.

360
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:20,598
Tepp, stop banging on your freakin'
leg already. You're driving me nuts!

361
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,893
So look,
the point is,

362
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,527
this thing's so big,
I clog the freaking bowl.

363
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,935
It cost me 65 bucks
to snake it.

364
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:28,666
I can't believe your wife
actually has sex with you.

365
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,368
You know what? Twice last night
and once again this morning.

366
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,468
And it's off the charts.

367
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:36,104
Pretty soon she's
gonna be all pregnant,

368
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,445
and I'll be kissing that belly,
rubbing her little feet.

369
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,485
Big brother Bolan's
gonna be big Papa.

370
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:46,053
Tepp, my sperm, they're
screaming for nourishment.

371
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:48,183
What's up with the food?

372
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,487
- Tepper?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:55,090
I'm Avery Phillips. I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

374
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,896
In New York City,
this doesn't happen.

375
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:00,199
- You're a good soul.
- It's no problem.

376
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,261
It's still kind of wet.

377
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,577
It's mine, all right.

378
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,980
I hope everything's in there.

379
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,813
- That's how I found it.
- I'm sure it is.

380
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,954
- Good luck to you.
- Would you mind

381
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,855
if I used your phone, called my wife,
let her know I found it?

382
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,052
She's worried sick
about the credit cards.

383
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,958
Unless you're
in the middle of something?

384
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,589
No, No.
It's no problem.

385
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,326
It's fine. Come on in.

386
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,231
Noah's Arc out there.

387
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:36,498
- Phone's in the kitchen.
- I won't be just a minute.

388
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:41,735
So, what's the deal?
You found this guy's wallet?

389
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,906
- Yep!
- Teppo did his good deed for the day.

390
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:46,382
It's not gonna help him
tonight, though.

391
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,044
Did you take the money?

392
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,986
There wasn't any in it.

393
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,924
That's what most people do.
They take the money, leave the wallet.

394
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,360
It's what the putz
before him did.

395
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,193
No!
That's a solid thing you did.

396
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:02,290
You know what,
that comes back to you.

397
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,858
Yap, yap, yap.
Bolan, it's your game.

398
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,995
Closest to bull
gets the deal.

399
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,437
Let's go!

400
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,499
I'm so zoned in tonight, fellas.

401
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,669
20 minutes, haven't
won a dollar yet.

402
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,270
Can you get ahold of her?

403
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:19,748
No. One phone's not enough
with a house full of girls.

404
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,646
- Darts, huh?
- That's a sign you're hearing.

405
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,088
Yeah, closest to bull.
You want in?

406
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:29,284
His wife is worried.
He's got to get home.

407
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,386
- It takes two minutes.
- Fish, the guy lost his wallet.

408
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,090
He doesn't have
any money on him.

409
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:35,189
- I got money.
- Avery.

410
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,327
You're gonna let this guy sucker you?
He's gonna take all your money.

411
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,735
- Yeah, then lose it.
- It's a buck!

412
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:42,932
I haven't played darts
in years and years.

413
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,236
You know, why don't you
give me the number?

414
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,834
You give me the number
and I'll call her your wife, and...

415
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:48,971
I gotta take a shot
at that bull.

416
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,140
If that's all right?

417
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:55,652
Yeah, that's all right,
you got a buck, you're in.

418
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,984
Tepp, get the man a dart.
Let's go! Chop-chop.

419
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:01,253
- I'm Bolan.
- Avery.

420
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,851
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Fishman, I need a dollar.

421
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:07,925
Let's rock and roll.

422
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,761
So let's start. Come on, guys,
you say you wanna play

423
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:14,896
but then you sit around
and yack all night.

424
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,033
- Quigley, just throw. You go first.
- I'm up. Let's do this.

425
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,011
Don't come from here,
come from here. Feel it.

426
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,877
Yeah, I'm feeling it, Bolan.

427
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:27,576
- The story of my life!
- You weren't feeling it.

428
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,950
You weren't feeling it. Watch me.
Watch where it comes from, okay?

429
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:32,080
Watch where it comes from.

430
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,523
Center.
Center. Center.

431
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:37,819
I'm feeling that.
Tepp throw.

432
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,057
Oh yeah, notice
who's going last.

433
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,190
What's that? I can't hear you
with my dick in your mouth.

434
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,235
Think about what
you're doing, buddy.

435
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,837
See? Now Tepp's feeling it.
See, he's feeling it.

436
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:51,467
Aren't you glad you don't have
to listen to this all night?

437
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:54,774
Are you kidding?
I'm enjoying this.

438
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,246
I haven't been out with
the fellas for a long time.

439
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,716
- This is for the deal, right?
- No!

440
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,844
- Can you just throw the dart, please?
- Yeah, but...

441
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:05,981
You know what? I think that
Avery should get the last shot.

442
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:07,251
- What do you think?
- That's fine.

443
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:10,522
Don't get me wrong,
normally I'd say stay.

444
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:13,962
Tonight, it's gonna be
a little night.

445
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,829
A couple hands, tops.

446
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,164
I nail it, I don't get nothin'?
Wax on, wax off.

447
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:21,933
I can't say no to a game of cards,
even if it's only one hand.

448
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:25,204
You get a shirt.
You get a new shirt. I got new shirts.

449
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:30,941
Fish, look at this guy,
don't take advantage of him.

450
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,246
Come on, Avery!
Kick his ass.

451
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:37,084
Kick his ass. I'm gonna bet you
a dollar that he kicks your ass!

452
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,282
A whole dollar?
You're on!

453
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,122
Yeah! He kicked your ass!
You owe me a buck.

454
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:46,988
Well, easy five bucks,
huh, Avery?

455
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,556
You're still a barely employed
borderline alcoholic with no future.

456
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,431
You know what?
Let's get you out of here.

457
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:54,529
...make your life tolerable,
your little dollar.

458
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:55,595
Let's play cards.

459
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:57,733
- Won a buck.
- Avery, let me get your stuff.

460
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,801
- (sirens blaring outside)
- Hear that? Something's going down.

461
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:02,779
Who's bleeding?

462
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:06,044
- Tepper, bleeding like a little girl.
- Don't get your blood on it.

463
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:09,314
- Let me get your box. The rain thing.
- That's all? Only one game?

464
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:11,480
Why don't you sit down?
We're just getting started.

465
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,080
Check it out.

466
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:15,285
- You did win the deal.
- It's low stakes.

467
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,725
Somewhat friendly.

468
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,060
I can get you an umbrella.
A real one.

469
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:22,565
- Sounds real tempting.
- I got like 100 extra.

470
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,727
This game could use
the money, let me tell you.

471
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:26,134
We got an open chair.

472
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:27,728
Here's your new shirt.

473
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:31,367
Told you. Two cop cars out front.
Middle of the street, baby.

474
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:32,842
You don't have to twist my arm.

475
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,378
No, guys!

476
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:37,273
No.

477
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,049
Not tonight.

478
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,218
It's just not a good night.

479
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,086
A got a lot on my mind
and, uh...

480
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:48,148
I'm getting engaged
tonight.

481
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,319
Any other night,
it would be a good night, but...

482
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,955
tonight's not a good night.
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,329
No, I'm sorry, Tepp.
You're absolutely right.

484
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,494
- You got a lot on your mind.
- There's cops everywhere, guys.

485
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,505
It's all right, Bolan.
It's just, it's not a good night.

486
00:28:01,573 --> 00:28:03,507
Thanks for
understanding, Avery.

487
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,703
I'm the one sorry.
I didn't mean to overstay my welcome.

488
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,906
Oh, for crying out loud.
Is this a poker game or an AA meeting?

489
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,916
- Everyone's so sorry about everything.
- You know what?

490
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:14,281
Another night,
huh, Avery?

491
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:15,910
- Drop by again.
- Sure.

492
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,217
I won't forget
what you did.

493
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,958
- Good night.
- Good night.

494
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,389
Get back in your apartment.
Close and lock your doors, sir.

495
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:30,161
What, are you deaf?
Get your ass back in your apartment!

496
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,169
This isn't his apartment.

497
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:34,398
I don't care whose apartment it is, close the
door!

498
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:38,464
(intercom buzzes)

499
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,706
- Oh, it's got to be the food.
- They're gonna seal her up.

500
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,478
Hello?

501
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:46,346
This is Officer Campbell, NYPD.

502
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,079
We've secured your building
for police investigation.

503
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,714
Do not open your door
until you hear from an officer.

504
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,451
We should get you
out of here now,

505
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,459
before you get stuck
in the building.

506
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,893
No, no.
I'll wait a second.

507
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,862
That is a smart man.

508
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:03,094
Guys, they closed off the building. We're
on lockdown.

509
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:05,500
- Hey, what'd I tell ya?
- Tepp, lock that door.

510
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,867
I don't want to get shot.

511
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,873
The roof is next.
Then they're going to go door to door.

512
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:12,535
There's one guy that
needs to get out,

513
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,078
he needs to get home.
Just real quick, okay, man?

514
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,246
Hello, NYPD?

515
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:19,476
Avery...

516
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,918
I know I know you.
What do you do?

517
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,113
I'm a...

518
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,388
I'm a bus driver.

519
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:31,417
There goes that, huh, Bolan?
Last bus you took was short and yellow.

520
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:33,657
Hey, make sure
that's a cop.

521
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,793
Hey, Mrs. Darmstetter.
How you doing?

522
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,303
Honey, why are
all the police here?

523
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,703
You know, I'm trying
to find that out myself.

524
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:45,470
- They're all over the place.
- Yeah.

525
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:48,603
Go back in your apartment,
I'll find out what's going on.

526
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,511
Okay.

527
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,641
Hey, Mrs. Darmstetter?

528
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:55,686
Lock your door and stay there
until I tell you it's okay.

529
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,653
You'll let me know?

530
00:29:57,722 --> 00:29:59,121
Yeah, I'll tell you.

531
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,460
I can't believe they can
close down an entire building.

532
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:06,759
Only in New York.

533
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:10,892
Look, Avery, I'm sorry.
If you want, I'll walk down with you.

534
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,937
Whatever, you didn't
hear the cop?

535
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:15,302
We're closed up.
He's not going anywhere.

536
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:18,365
He's stayin'
and he's playin'.

537
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,468
Huh? Am I right, Ave?

538
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:22,945
Well, I must say,

539
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,312
it gives a convenient excuse.

540
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,409
Thank you.

541
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,579
Fate throws that in your lap,
you gotta grab it. Am I right?

542
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:33,215
Avery, let me
get that for you.

543
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,759
It's a 50¢ max,
three raise limit.

544
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:37,954
Give me your cash
and I'll give you some chips.

545
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,360
Heretofore known as the bank.

546
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,564
Hey, Tepp?
Where you going?

547
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,229
- Getting something to drink.
- You got drink.

548
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,238
Sit the butt.

549
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,867
Look, I'm not a card player.

550
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:55,538
You just tell me when
to bet and I'll do it.

551
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:58,104
Who-o!
That's what I like to hear!

552
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,082
Why don't you get on
him for 10 bucks, huh?

553
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,278
You grow a set of
balls with that beard?

554
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,879
He did have the lucky throw.
It's your deal.

555
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:07,083
Oh, uh...

556
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,217
Somebody else
should go first.

557
00:31:09,294 --> 00:31:13,230
- Oh, I'll deal.
- Ah! Deal goes to Grizzly Adams.

558
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:22,538
Six of hearts, six of hearts,
six of hearts.

559
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,835
Just deal, Kreskin.

560
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:26,968
Come on, Quigley.
Deal.

561
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:30,481
Tepp, what's with these cards?
They're all the same.

562
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,106
I don't know.

563
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,550
Carla got them at
the MGM Grand in Vegas.

564
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,144
That's the way
they came.

565
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:42,886
It's not a salad.
Deal.

566
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:46,226
- Seven card, no peek.
- Already with the monkey games.

567
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:48,197
Keep it up.
I like wild cards.

568
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,666
(imitates monkey)
Monkey games.

569
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,433
- Tepp.
- Sorry.

570
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:56,268
Tepp, no peekie.

571
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,833
- Guys, it doesn't matter.
- It changes the way he bets.

572
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:02,573
It's okay. I gotta leave a message
with Carla anyway.

573
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,747
See? Now he knows
he doesn't have a hand.

574
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:09,184
Tepps, we're one card in.

575
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:11,577
Hey.

576
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,454
When you talk to her,
don't forget what I said.

577
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:18,222
Way he's acting you'd think he's
getting circumcised, not engaged.

578
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:21,163
He is getting circumcised.
He's getting married.

579
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:28,336
Hey.

580
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,704
- What's up?
- Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

581
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:33,869
No problem,
no problem at all.

582
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:41,710
I gotta get some
new silverware.

583
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:43,811
This is getting ridiculous,
you know?

584
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:46,982
Listen, I want
to thank you again.

585
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,026
My whole life
was in that wallet.

586
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,027
Well, you know,
I'm glad it worked out for you.

587
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,393
Mind if I try again?

588
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:58,399
Oh. Yeah, sure.

589
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,075
Do you mind?

590
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,876
You want some
privacy, I'm sure.

591
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:14,440
- I was on "All My Children" last week.
- No way. That's Mary's favorite show.

592
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,508
Hello?

593
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:17,611
You make some pretty
decent coin doing soaps.

594
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:20,851
A guy in my office hooked up
Susan Lucci, 10 rooms, Upper East Side.

595
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,825
- This guy's on the phone all night.
- What block?

596
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,862
- Can't tell you.
- What do you mean, can't tell me?

597
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,227
- Stalkers and shit, I can't tell you.
- He doesn't know.

598
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:28,322
The fuck I don't.

599
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,629
I know where a lot of people
live and I can't tell you.

600
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:32,896
Come on, Fish.
Mary loves that kind of stuff.

601
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,961
Who's gonna stalk
Susan Lucci?

602
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,269
I don't know, Bolan.
But say I tell you, okay?

603
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:41,402
And some freakin' freak overhears,
goes to her house and she goes down.

604
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,448
Cops, the media, the papers...
what happened? Nobody knows.

605
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:48,349
I know, okay? I know.
'Cause I'm the one that talked.

606
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,444
What are you saying,
that you got code?

607
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:54,287
Yeah, I got code. What's the fuck's
the matter with you? I got code.

608
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:57,191
I don't rat. I don't cheat.
And I don't pay for sex.

609
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,458
Now deal. As a matter of fact,
you lose the deal,

610
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,055
'cause you took
too freakin' long.

611
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,033
- Texas hold 'em.
- You know what, I got a code too.

612
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,797
Yes, you do, Quigley.
It's messed up, but you got one.

613
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,864
Bolan got code.
Bolan got code so pure

614
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:12,637
he don't even have
to think about it. Just is.

615
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,541
But this kid,

616
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:17,809
jury's still out on this kid.

617
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,209
He doesn't even hear me.

618
00:34:22,286 --> 00:34:24,015
You have the number?

619
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:26,454
What are you
looking for, Avery?

620
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,558
I need a pencil.

621
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,686
That's silverware.

622
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,753
Here you go.
Here's a pencil.

623
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,492
What?

624
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:38,057
You know, honey, you're right.
You call him for me.

625
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:40,104
Thank you,
sweetheart.

626
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:43,163
We have to call work and tell
them we won't be in tonight.

627
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:46,176
Hey, Frick and Frack, we're playing Texas
Hold 'em. Are you in or out?

628
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:49,338
- Sure.
- Put a little hip in that hop.

629
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,657
So how old are
your girls, Avery?

630
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,253
One's eight, the other
just turned 10 last week.

631
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,128
October, that's the same as mine.
I got a five-year-old.

632
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,532
They're my grand daughters,
actually,

633
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:13,331
just living with us for a while.

634
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,429
Mine's in Florida.
Lives with her mom.

635
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:17,633
For now, anyways. She's...

636
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,733
she's got this prick lawyer.

637
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,471
Dumb Cuban,

638
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,810
going out of his way
to make me look bad.

639
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:25,974
I got a job.

640
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,644
Got a suit, got a tie.
I'm walking the walk.

641
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,085
I don't know what
the hell else they want.

642
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:34,090
Maybe they want you to move
to Florida and be a real father?

643
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:38,189
I would do that in a heartbeat
if I ever get out of debt.

644
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,923
You don't even know
what debt is, Quigley.

645
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:43,433
You ever been divorced?
Then shut your front door.

646
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,765
Hey, Avery, eight and 10's
a good age, huh?

647
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:48,236
Phyllis is already
into boys and baseball.

648
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:51,833
She's convinced she's gonna
marry this Derek Jeter fellow.

649
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:54,207
I bet against Jeter, once.

650
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,441
Once, never again.
Kid killed me in the ninth.

651
00:35:57,515 --> 00:36:00,382
So good.
Renaissance man, that guy.

652
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,909
Avery...
does she have an autograph?

653
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:06,286
Well, how about that?

654
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:08,916
Think she'd like it?

655
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,392
What's that?

656
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,259
Your granddaughter.
Think she'd like to have it?

657
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,959
Damn Tepp, you already found
the guy's wallet.

658
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,228
Yeah, I think you've done
enough for me already.

659
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,167
I don't have any use for it.
It just sits there.

660
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:21,933
Tepp, you love that card.

661
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:24,702
I don't love the card.
It's just a card.

662
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:26,709
It's a pretty
nice offer.

663
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,007
Yeah, for a guy you wanted
gone a beer ago.

664
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm your best friend. You never gave
my daughter anything like that.

665
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:33,809
- Since when you his best friend?
- And you are?

666
00:36:33,884 --> 00:36:36,580
- More than you.
- Guys. What's the big deal?

667
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:40,681
Avery, it'd make me
happy if you took it.

668
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,354
Damn, Avery.
Take the card.

669
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:46,191
All right.

670
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,463
That doesn't mean
I gotta let you win, does it?

671
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,667
All right,
everyone's happy.

672
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:56,229
Could we play some
freakin' cards now?

673
00:36:56,307 --> 00:36:58,138
Can you never just
enjoy a nice moment?

674
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,039
Bone me.
Play cards.

675
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:06,583
Hey, Tepp, I tried that
elephant juice thing today.

676
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:09,245
- It works.
- What's elephant juice?

677
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,881
When you say "elephant juice,"
it looks like "I love you."

678
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:14,447
I'm the one who
told Tepp about it.

679
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:16,857
Well, it sounds like Dumbo
coming in your hair.

680
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:19,157
It's romantic.

681
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,198
It's 5th grade,
it's talking around it.

682
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:24,200
You're getting married and
you still can't say, "I love you"?

683
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,257
I can say it.

684
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:28,134
- When was the last time?
- When was the last time you said it?

685
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,605
February '89, Paula Valley.

686
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:32,973
Took her to a Prince concert,
we rented a limo,

687
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:36,172
we wore purple,
and I told her I loved her.

688
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:38,681
- To get in her pants.
- No.

689
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,717
I meant it.

690
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:43,913
I did get in her pants.
But when I said it, I meant it.

691
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:46,218
Well, it's not
the same thing.

692
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,848
Okay.

693
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:50,894
But don't think Carla doesn't know
what you're doing, 'cause she knows.

694
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:53,020
I respect you for not saying it
if you don't mean it,

695
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:56,066
but if you mean it,
I think you should say it.

696
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:58,192
Amen to that.

697
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,965
Good or bad...
truth.

698
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:03,472
The only way to go.

699
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,236
Right on.

700
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,709
Cop: Roof is secure.

701
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:09,803
You hear that?
They're on our floor.

702
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,241
NYPD.

703
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:15,581
Doing an apartment search
and going door to door.

704
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:18,247
Doing the old lady
and we are next.

705
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:20,483
I got to use
the facility.

706
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:23,823
If they're checking apartments,
they'll want to check the bathroom.

707
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,486
Not if I was just in there.

708
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:27,656
No need for that.

709
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,860
Well then wait two seconds,
say hello, then go do your business.

710
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,403
No, I'll just say a little
hello through the door.

711
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:34,836
(knocking)

712
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:37,669
- Yeah, don't worry, Avery.
- NYPD.

713
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:39,505
We'll cover for you.

714
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:41,841
Guy's acting like an ass, huh?
Sketchy.

715
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:44,312
Simon says,
open the door.

716
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,481
Campbell, NYPD.
I'm gonna have to look around.

717
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:07,401
All right, Raymond.
Come on out.

718
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,677
Good thing that the game
is not going that late.

719
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,679
Raymond!

720
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,084
I hate the cops.

721
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:39,232
Who the hell are you?
Get out of the tub.

722
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:41,271
I got a bum leg,
just let me, uh...

723
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,896
Get out.

724
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,574
Okay, okay.

725
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,704
Come on, here we go.
Up, up.

726
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:51,805
There you go.

727
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,282
Step out in the other room,
put your hands on the sink.

728
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,718
All right, what's the story here?
Somebody talk.

729
00:39:57,788 --> 00:40:00,780
Tepp, go ahead. You're the one
pointing like an arrow. Talk.

730
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:03,725
I don't know. You guys said
you were looking for someone, right?

731
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,195
And Avery, we just met him tonight.
We don't know who he is.

732
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:08,822
And as soon as
you knocked on the door,

733
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,730
he wanted to go run
and hide in the bathroom.

734
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:13,793
Three Mary two,
three Mary name.

735
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,502
Last of Phillips,
first of Avery.

736
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:20,408
Avery, I didn't know.
You just were acting weird.

737
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,571
Officer, we were
just trying to be cautious.

738
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:26,776
Yeah, that the deal, Officer.
You never know about people.

739
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:29,547
All right, Avery Phillips.
You got a driver's license,

740
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,087
something with
your face on it?

741
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:33,453
I did.
It's not in there?

742
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:35,082
Nope.

743
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,150
Somebody must
have lifted it.

744
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,321
I lost my wallet
earlier tonight

745
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,796
and Tepper here called me
over to pick it up.

746
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:45,233
Yeah, it's true. I was just
trying to do the right thing.

747
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,463
I didn't know
it was missing.

748
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,437
- You're a fireman, huh?
- Retired.

749
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,409
I drive a city bus now.

750
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,642
New York's bravest.

751
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:58,773
Stub your toe,
you're a hero.

752
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:01,977
We get shot,
we had it coming.

753
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:06,717
What's your route?

754
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,189
What's that?

755
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:09,590
Bus route.

756
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,126
Bronx.

757
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:13,959
Specifically where?

758
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:15,862
Broadway.

759
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,930
All right, Avery.

760
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:20,903
You're not who
I'm looking for.

761
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:23,132
And I'm sorry about that,
I'm ready to go home.

762
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:26,301
But I am curious to know
why you were hiding.

763
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,641
Well, it's kind
of complicated.

764
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:31,078
You see, I got a couple
of parking tickets.

765
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,207
Parking tickets?

766
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:35,616
Like I say,
it's kind of confusing.

767
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:38,553
See, l... I'm trying
to get them sorted out.

768
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,089
I don't know the status.

769
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:44,287
Radio: Phillips, first of Avery.
Two warrants out of Queens.

770
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,454
Failure to pay
parking tickets.

771
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,191
Well, I'll give you a little update.

772
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:51,359
They're warrants, that's their status.
You're wanted.

773
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:53,528
City bus driver,
you could lose your job.

774
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,764
I'm aware.

775
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:56,965
- You a family man?
- Yes.

776
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,838
Why would a man
jeopardize his livelihood

777
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,672
over a couple
of parking tickets?

778
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,769
They were unjust and
I'm contesting them.

779
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:05,644
Well, aren't you
the moral one?

780
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,308
You need to arrest me?
Go ahead.

781
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:09,784
If I decide I have to rap you
with my nightstick

782
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:11,844
upside that brave head
of yours, I'll do so.

783
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,617
I don't need
your permission.

784
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,555
All right,
consider tonight a gift.

785
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:19,891
Enjoy it.

786
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:22,194
You know, Avery
really just wants

787
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:24,257
to go home.
His wife is worried.

788
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:26,360
Well then Avery shouldn't
have wasted my time.

789
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,405
I'll tell you when
you can leave.

790
00:42:28,472 --> 00:42:30,269
All of you.

791
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:37,411
Oh, boy, Avery.
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:39,881
You run from the cops,
you got warrants.

793
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,679
You're a black man
in this city and you get off?

794
00:42:41,752 --> 00:42:44,812
That doesn't happen.
Toto, wake me up.

795
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:47,379
There were some definite
power issues going on.

796
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,720
Look, Avery, l...

797
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:51,124
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying
to get you in trouble.

798
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,184
I understand.

799
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,389
Hey, what were
you trying to do?

800
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:56,228
- What?
- What were you trying to do?

801
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,235
What do you mean? You guys
weren't thinking the same thing?

802
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:00,861
Soon as he heard the knock he wanted
to go run and hide in the bathroom.

803
00:43:02,006 --> 00:43:04,304
You know what, Tepp,
I don't care what went on, but

804
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,935
with all he's got on his mind,
I guess it's expected.

805
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:10,037
The fireman's fine, all right?
False alarm.

806
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:12,207
Zip it, skip it.
Let's play some cards, huh?

807
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,116
- You okay?
- Yeah.

808
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:25,218
You sure?

809
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,990
Yeah.

810
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:30,960
Wait a second.
Avery Phillips.

811
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:35,300
Avery Phillips.
I knew I recognized that name!

812
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:37,465
You're Mr. Fire Safety.

813
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,304
You spoke at my dad's
summer camp.

814
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,139
Echo Lake.

815
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,873
Oh, sure.

816
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:46,882
You're a hero.
Hey, this guy's a hero.

817
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:50,283
- Tepp, I told you about this, right?
- Yeah, yeah, that's wild.

818
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:52,083
He saved
his partner's life.

819
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:56,554
Pulled his partner out of a hole
with his leg, this man.

820
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,618
With his freaking leg,
he pulled him out.

821
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:00,755
- That was a long time ago.
- Still a hero.

822
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,129
If you're a hero,
why are you driving busses?

823
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,258
Quigley!

824
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:09,263
I got a pretty big family
to feed, and...

825
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:15,234
disability just doesn't
go far enough, so...

826
00:44:16,547 --> 00:44:20,506
Say, Mr. Fire Safety,

827
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:23,985
I don't know if you heard
about it, but...

828
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:27,854
- my dad passed a year and half ago.
- Oh, gee, I'm sorry, man.

829
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:29,119
Oh, no, thank you.

830
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:34,019
But anyway, I'm running the camp now, and
we're doing great.

831
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:36,862
We got all these kids
with special needs, and...

832
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:39,027
we just got to get you
back to camp!

833
00:44:39,103 --> 00:44:41,799
Okay.
Story time's over.

834
00:44:41,872 --> 00:44:44,534
What do you say we play
a little poker, huh?

835
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:46,872
Any poker at this point!

836
00:44:46,944 --> 00:44:50,038
Wild card, seven card, peekie,
no peekie, I don't give a deuce!

837
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:52,810
I just wanna play
some cards, please?

838
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:53,975
Thank you.

839
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:57,748
You know, I say we play Last Man.
Juice things up a bit, huh?

840
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,551
We haven't played
a game of regular yet.

841
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:03,457
- You're not the boss. Come on.
- Yeah, you're not the boss of us.

842
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:04,926
- So we'll play regular after?
- Yeah.

843
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:07,759
- I thought you didn't give a deuce.
- That's fine. Avery...

844
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,925
We play for lottery tickets.
Last man standing takes them all.

845
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:13,731
- Do you have a ticket?
- Yes.

846
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,171
Actually, Avery, why don't
we trade places here?

847
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,143
I think this seat's going to be a little more
comfortable on your knee.

848
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:24,544
Then I can sit over here
in Coop's seat.

849
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,482
Oh, that's nice.
I like that. It's soft.

850
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,448
You are unbelievable.

851
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:33,012
Tepp, let's go.
Ante in.

852
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,218
Oh, yeah...

853
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:38,420
- I'm not in this week.
- The hell you aren't.

854
00:45:38,495 --> 00:45:40,019
What do you mean,
you're not in?

855
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:42,224
- I forgot to buy a ticket.
- That's bullshit! You're in.

856
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:45,359
I'm serious.
It just slipped my mind.

857
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:47,494
You don't have
a ticket at all?

858
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:49,004
Sorry,
I had a busy day.

859
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:50,937
I meant to buy one
on my way home.

860
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:52,407
But then I found
Avery's wallet, and...

861
00:45:52,476 --> 00:45:53,943
I don't know,
I guess I just forgot.

862
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:56,104
Well, then I guess
you don't mind

863
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,648
if we check in
your little hiding spot.

864
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:00,615
Go ahead.
Knock yourself out, Sherlock.

865
00:46:00,684 --> 00:46:04,120
- It's not that we don't believe you.
- I've got nothing to hide, Quigley.

866
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:08,484
How do you live
with yourself?

867
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,584
How'd you forget?

868
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:14,119
For the tenth time, Bolan,
I just forgot, it happens.

869
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:18,791
That's lame. You should
be penalized for that.

870
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,769
What's the big damn deal?

871
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:23,170
The big damn deal is,
that's the way we play.

872
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,403
Yeah, that the way
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh, we play it. ¶

873
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:28,569
Front pocket.

874
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:33,872
What's that?

875
00:46:39,022 --> 00:46:40,489
Left side.

876
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:42,286
Shirt pocket.

877
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:44,792
What are you
talking about?

878
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:49,992
Empty the pocket.

879
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,591
Fuck you.

880
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:54,500
- Yo, Tepp.
- Yo, Bolan. What?

881
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:56,300
Empty the pocket.

882
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,603
What's in the pocket?
What's in the pocket?

883
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:02,607
- What's in the pocket?
- Get away!

884
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:05,147
For cryin' out loud!

885
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,241
Guys, it's time
to settle down, okay?

886
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,447
We're supposed
to be having fun.

887
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,422
This isn't camp, Bolan.

888
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:16,118
I came here to play cards.

889
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:18,252
I am so sick and tired
of screwing around.

890
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:20,592
Tepper, you're acting
more Quigley than Quigley.

891
00:47:20,664 --> 00:47:22,529
I am so sick of you guys
bagging on me.

892
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,000
Why are you doing this?
We know you got a ticket.

893
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:27,502
You guys are the biggest
bunch of dicks.

894
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:29,334
- Oh, we're dicks.
- Oh, we're dicks.

895
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:31,874
Like you never bought
an extra ticket, right, Fish?

896
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:33,773
Extra tickets?
What are you talking about?

897
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:36,711
You can buy a freakin' 100
extra tickets for all I care.

898
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,248
All you need is one.
For here.

899
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,511
Well, I didn't have any time
to buy extra ones.

900
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:42,882
All right?
This one's...

901
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:45,080
this one's for Carla,
for tonight.

902
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:49,187
Maybe he's got a winner.

903
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:51,557
Yeah.
That's it.

904
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:53,357
That's it.
I got a winner.

905
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,091
No, he doesn't have
a winner.

906
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:57,565
If he had a winner,
he wouldn't be here.

907
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,629
Wait a minute, you really
think I do, don't you?

908
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,038
I just hope you're getting
frequent flyer miles

909
00:48:05,108 --> 00:48:06,769
'cause you're all over
the freakin' map tonight, kid.

910
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,640
Call 'em if you do.
Go ahead, call 'em.

911
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:10,805
I don't want this shit
hanging over my head.

912
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:13,850
- For crying out loud.
- Seriously, Fish. Call 'em up.

913
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,942
Fine, all right!

914
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,920
You want me to call 'em?
Fine, I'll call 'em.

915
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:21,583
Forgive me for wanting to do
something special for my girlfriend.

916
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:23,592
If I may.

917
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:30,464
When trust between friends is broken,
it can never be repaired.

918
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:33,901
If you challenge him
and you're wrong,

919
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,098
that could haunt
this group forever.

920
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:51,546
Avery's right.

921
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:54,488
This is stupid.
So freakin' ridiculous.

922
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,452
Sit the butt.
Let's settle this.

923
00:49:17,314 --> 00:49:19,475
The rule is,
you don't look.

924
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:22,950
Ever.
For any reason.

925
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:27,188
That's the rule and it's very simple.
Quigley...

926
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,887
look me in the eye.

927
00:49:31,995 --> 00:49:34,088
Did you check the numbers?

928
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:39,662
I never have.

929
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,901
Bolan?

930
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:45,703
I know the answer,
but I have to ask.

931
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,737
No.

932
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,147
- Tepp?
- No.

933
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,316
Avery?

934
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,551
I don't know you,
but I'll trust you.

935
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:06,791
If you know the numbers,
you can't be in the game.

936
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:09,161
- Do you know the numbers?
- No.

937
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,568
Okay, then.

938
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:18,932
What about you?

939
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,605
No.

940
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:26,876
I never have
and I never will.

941
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:32,954
Let's play
Last Man Standing.

942
00:50:33,023 --> 00:50:36,186
Avery, you get this, right?

943
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,250
You know you could
lose your ticket?

944
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:40,886
Winner or not.

945
00:50:40,964 --> 00:50:42,898
I think I understand
the game.

946
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:45,764
No mistaking
which is yours.

947
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:56,769
I'm sorry, guys.

948
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,042
I don't know what
my problem is tonight.

949
00:50:59,116 --> 00:51:01,448
I know what your problem is.
You're scared.

950
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:04,119
And you ought to be.

951
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,212
Doing what you're doing.

952
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:07,813
It's risky.

953
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:11,759
No, it's only risky if you pick
the wrong woman.

954
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:13,728
You haven't.

955
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:15,424
It's just marriage.

956
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:17,467
It doesn't mean forever.

957
00:51:18,502 --> 00:51:22,438
One way or the other,
it'll be over soon.

958
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,572
Not soon enough.
Let's play some cards.

959
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,312
All right, Avery.
It's a very simple game.

960
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:39,082
Five-card draw.
I deal counterclockwise,

961
00:51:39,156 --> 00:51:40,817
low man out on each hand.

962
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,325
Stay off the bottom
and you stay alive.

963
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,123
That deck ever make
its way around to me?

964
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,096
No, Fish always
deals Last Man.

965
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:49,863
He doesn't trust anybody.

966
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:51,662
For some reason,
we indulge him.

967
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:55,736
New rule: Anyone gets up
for any reason, you're out.

968
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:57,568
All right?
Agreed?

969
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:00,640
Hey, you guys,

970
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,610
does anybody smell that?

971
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:06,115
That's cat piss.
Tepp, you need some Renuzit.

972
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:09,277
Uh-oh. Witch doctor's
got a good hand.

973
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:12,853
What you got,
witch doctor, huh? A pair?

974
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,686
Maybe two?

975
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:16,658
Why do you call me that?

976
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:19,661
You call me that every week.
What's it mean?

977
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:21,458
You want to know?

978
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:23,522
Okay.

979
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,295
All right.

980
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:27,893
Seeing how everyone's
coming clean, starting fresh,

981
00:52:27,971 --> 00:52:29,700
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret,

982
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:33,265
all you guys... one of the reasons
why I constantly kick your ass,

983
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:35,743
and you're gonna remember me
come Christmas-time.

984
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:37,837
Quigley, every time
you have a good hand,

985
00:52:37,914 --> 00:52:40,439
you get so excited
you start spinning things,

986
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:42,314
just like this,
twisting it around.

987
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,252
Yeah.
Dead give-away.

988
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:49,019
It's a tell.
Tells me all I need to know.

989
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:52,459
Everyone's got one. You don't know
you're doing it, you just do it.

990
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,357
Perfect example... Bolan.

991
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:58,492
Every time Bolan
is bluffing, he starts

992
00:52:58,568 --> 00:53:01,196
tapping his foot like
he's got palsy or something.

993
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:04,934
Like he's screaming,
"Look at me, I'm lying!"

994
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:08,774
I guarantee you he's got nothing,
first one out, I bet you anything.

995
00:53:08,845 --> 00:53:10,813
Tepper,
on the other hand,

996
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,144
like a Russian novel.

997
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:15,616
Very hard to read.

998
00:53:15,685 --> 00:53:18,654
Especially tonight.
I need a Geiger counter for him.

999
00:53:19,756 --> 00:53:23,283
Yeah, you don't show much.
Haven't figured yours out. Yet.

1000
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,884
What's yours?

1001
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:28,158
Quigley, I just got done
telling you, it's unconscious.

1002
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:29,721
If I knew,
I wouldn't do it.

1003
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:32,359
That's why it's called
a give-away.

1004
00:53:32,435 --> 00:53:34,767
Unbelievable. I hand you
the keys to the kingdom

1005
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:37,238
and you can't even walk
through the freakin' door.

1006
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,969
All right, big man Avery.
How many do you want?

1007
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:42,568
Three.

1008
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:45,171
Three for the big man.

1009
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:46,806
Witch doctor?

1010
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:48,544
Quigley!

1011
00:53:48,618 --> 00:53:51,951
What you got, two pair?
Going for that little full house?

1012
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:53,455
- Just play.
- Bolan?

1013
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:01,191
One, two, three, four cards.

1014
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:02,856
Thank you.

1015
00:54:02,966 --> 00:54:04,627
Tepp?

1016
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:06,794
Don't need a tell
to read that.

1017
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,498
Man takes three,
dealer takes three.

1018
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:14,440
That stinks, I can't believe
you guys don't smell that.

1019
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:17,275
What you got, Ave?
Turn 'em.

1020
00:54:17,347 --> 00:54:19,247
Oh, pair of sixes.

1021
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:22,513
Not too strong, but strong enough
to stay in the game, I'm betting.

1022
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:24,985
Huh, Bolan?
What you got, Quigley?

1023
00:54:25,055 --> 00:54:26,249
What's that right there?

1024
00:54:26,323 --> 00:54:28,052
Witch doctor,
working the mojo.

1025
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:30,490
Two pair. All you got
to do is beat two sixes.

1026
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,187
What you got, Bolan?

1027
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:34,492
Oh.
The queen.

1028
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:38,829
Tepp, all you got to do is beat
a queen to stay alive. And he does.

1029
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,164
Pair of three's.

1030
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,363
It's a tough way to start
the game, huh, Bol?

1031
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:43,929
What do you got?

1032
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,441
Oh, let's see here.
What do I have?

1033
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:50,536
- There's one boy.
- Here we go, starting early.

1034
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:52,808
Oh!
And there's another.

1035
00:54:52,882 --> 00:54:55,976
The pair of boys kicks
the shit out of your bitch.

1036
00:54:56,052 --> 00:54:57,986
Bluffer holds true to form.

1037
00:54:58,054 --> 00:55:00,955
One down.
Three to go.

1038
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:03,117
See how it works?

1039
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:05,787
Last man alive
gets the pot.

1040
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:08,558
All right that cat piss is killing me.
I'm gonna open the window.

1041
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,061
You're out.

1042
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:12,328
Yes!

1043
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:15,866
- What?
- It works!

1044
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:17,634
You're up,
you're out.

1045
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:19,834
No, no, no.
It's you can't get up during a hand.

1046
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:22,207
- Bye, bye.
- Guys, it worked.

1047
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:25,441
What? Bullshit.
No, Bolan, it didn't work, okay?

1048
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:27,779
That was a domestic thing.
I was doing it for everybody.

1049
00:55:27,851 --> 00:55:29,682
No, Quigley.
Check it out.

1050
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:31,778
It didn't smell like cat piss.
I just said it did.

1051
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:34,255
I suggested it.

1052
00:55:34,324 --> 00:55:36,918
You should have been
at that seminar, buddy.

1053
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:39,826
What the fuck are you talking about?
Come on!

1054
00:55:39,896 --> 00:55:42,558
- You guys are rough.
- No kidding!

1055
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,463
Look enough of this
Mickey Mouse crap.

1056
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:47,196
This coming from a guy
who calls seven card no peekie.

1057
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,737
Hey, guys.
Can I get a little credit here?

1058
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,830
I mean I think I should have
been on "All My Children."

1059
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:55,939
Come on, Tepp.
Back me up here, huh?

1060
00:55:57,981 --> 00:55:59,608
It's called tough love.

1061
00:55:59,682 --> 00:56:01,843
Embrace it.

1062
00:56:03,753 --> 00:56:05,721
Whatever.
I don't care anymore.

1063
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:07,814
Yeah-huh.

1064
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,882
That leave three of us.

1065
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:15,427
All right.
We got A: Old and wise.

1066
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,932
B: Good looking and young.

1067
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,128
And C: All of the above.

1068
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:22,569
Let's just see what happens,
shall we, boys?

1069
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,073
Pow.
How you feel about that one?

1070
00:56:25,141 --> 00:56:26,506
Bingo!

1071
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:30,103
Yo, yo, yo. I got a little
something-something in the window.

1072
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,045
He's peeping again.

1073
00:56:32,115 --> 00:56:35,312
Bolan, please.
Go suggest he jump.

1074
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:37,945
Two girls.
One's clothed.

1075
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,455
One's in a bra,
they're trying on clothes.

1076
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,491
She is definitely 18.

1077
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,084
Bolan, check that out.

1078
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:46,594
No, thank you.

1079
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,130
What's the matter with you?

1080
00:56:48,198 --> 00:56:50,257
They've got the window thing up.
They want you to look.

1081
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,732
How high up do you
think we are?

1082
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,200
How high are you?

1083
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:57,200
You sure you don't want
to take a look there, Fish?

1084
00:56:57,273 --> 00:56:59,833
A little coquette in the window
just for you.

1085
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:02,377
We are playing for
six million bucks in here.

1086
00:57:02,445 --> 00:57:04,345
No time for high school
peep shows.

1087
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:18,618
Okay, we're down
to panties now.

1088
00:57:18,695 --> 00:57:20,356
We're down
to panties now.

1089
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,864
And you can see right through them.
Come on, Bolan.

1090
00:57:22,932 --> 00:57:25,492
Three stories up, straight across.
I won't tell anyone.

1091
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:28,366
- Give it a shot.
- Maybe I'll spot the food guy.

1092
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,837
Spot the food guy.

1093
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,208
You know, I've always questioned
the fascination with voyeurism.

1094
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:39,907
Must be one's lack of...
holy mother of God!

1095
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,915
Oh, shit!

1096
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:44,715
You knew! You knew!
The one time I looked.

1097
00:57:44,787 --> 00:57:46,152
The one time.

1098
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:49,089
Welcome to my seminar.
Come here.

1099
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,593
Avery, how many you want?

1100
00:57:52,662 --> 00:57:53,754
Two.

1101
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,492
Ein, zwei.

1102
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:00,661
How'd those feel, Avery?
They feel sexy those cards?

1103
00:58:00,737 --> 00:58:02,136
Tepp.

1104
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:04,264
- God.
- Oh, Christ.

1105
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,364
Oh, God.

1106
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:08,205
You know what?
Just go ahead, deal.

1107
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:10,473
- No, go clean that thing up.
- I'm not leaving the table.

1108
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:12,606
I'll watch the tickets.
Go clean that thing up.

1109
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:14,547
For crying out loud,
it's making me sick.

1110
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:17,017
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Hurry. Go.

1111
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:21,920
This means you're out.

1112
00:58:21,991 --> 00:58:24,687
It's worse than puberty in there.
This kid's like a rabid dog.

1113
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:26,695
Just going on what you said.

1114
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:28,754
I think under the given
circumstances...

1115
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:31,095
Right. Sort of like a home court advantage,
I guess.

1116
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,294
- You can call it that.
- Hold up.

1117
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:36,634
Avery, you want
the tickets that bad,

1118
00:58:36,706 --> 00:58:38,401
just take 'em.

1119
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:41,534
Oh, no wait.
Hold on a second. Clip the lip.

1120
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:43,476
First of all,
I'm still in this game.

1121
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:46,379
Second of all, no one's out.
I said he could go.

1122
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:49,509
You the king?
I didn't agree to anything.

1123
00:58:49,586 --> 00:58:51,816
Maybe it's because
you don't have a vote.

1124
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:53,150
Fish...

1125
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:55,622
I got a ticket in that pot
and I figure I got a vote.

1126
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,090
You figure wrong, old man.

1127
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,684
'Cause you're an outsider
and you're outnumbered.

1128
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:00,991
So don't come to my game
and tell me how it's played.

1129
00:59:01,064 --> 00:59:02,088
Back off!

1130
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:03,792
You're out.
He's up, he's out.

1131
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:06,528
- He's not out.
- Whatever. If I'm out, he's out.

1132
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:08,070
Fuck that.
You're out too.

1133
00:59:08,137 --> 00:59:09,832
He's not out.
I told him he could get up.

1134
00:59:09,906 --> 00:59:11,271
When did you
become a pit boss?

1135
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:14,174
Fishman, how can you do this?
Every single time you change the rules.

1136
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:15,232
You're not the boss.

1137
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,245
- I've had it...
- Guys, guys!

1138
00:59:17,313 --> 00:59:19,213
You know what we do
when the kids can't get along?

1139
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:22,410
- We end the game.
- Hey, hey! Bolan!

1140
00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:23,645
- Relax.
- Don't panic.

1141
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,518
Then stop your freakin' whining.
You're worse than my kids.

1142
00:59:29,993 --> 00:59:32,154
Now, I'll be the arbiter.

1143
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:33,490
Okay?

1144
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:38,099
That's fine.

1145
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:41,633
What I say goes.

1146
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,729
No arguing, no debating.

1147
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:45,967
- Just ca...
- Just shut up for once!

1148
00:59:49,646 --> 00:59:51,170
Avery...

1149
00:59:53,282 --> 00:59:55,580
are you going to be okay
with my call?

1150
00:59:56,486 --> 00:59:57,976
Sure.

1151
01:00:15,004 --> 01:00:16,232
He's not out.

1152
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:21,341
He's not out.
Meaning he's still in.

1153
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,944
So. I'm in. Right?

1154
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:26,811
Yes. You're in.

1155
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:32,013
Oh, this is fun.

1156
01:00:36,526 --> 01:00:38,357
Do you have to say that
every five minutes?

1157
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:39,417
What?

1158
01:00:39,495 --> 01:00:41,895
For crying out loud.
You say it every other sentence.

1159
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:43,693
- So what?
- So, it's annoying.

1160
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:47,566
- So, grow up.
- You're an ass, Fishman.

1161
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:49,867
And you can moonwalk
back to fuckland.

1162
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,175
Having fun yet, Avery?

1163
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,715
It must be great
having kids, huh?

1164
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:14,358
Kids are wonderful.

1165
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,557
First time around...

1166
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,734
it was great.

1167
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:22,896
Now that I got
the grand-daughters,

1168
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,440
light of my life.

1169
01:01:25,508 --> 01:01:27,635
I'd do anything
for my girls.

1170
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,803
I bet you would.

1171
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:33,841
You know, all day,

1172
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:36,510
I'm at camp, working
with my kids, but...

1173
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:41,714
but I don't have
any of my own. Yet.

1174
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,487
I got all these people
telling me that

1175
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:46,755
I'm not ready.

1176
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,329
But I feel like you're
only not ready

1177
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:53,698
if you haven't lived
enough life for yourself.

1178
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,533
I have.

1179
01:01:57,774 --> 01:01:59,366
I want 'em.

1180
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:03,508
My wife and I are having

1181
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:06,275
a little trouble
getting pregnant.

1182
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:09,942
I was at this clinic today.

1183
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:13,921
And this nurse puts me
in this little room

1184
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,753
and gives me...

1185
01:02:18,027 --> 01:02:20,393
a big butt magazine.

1186
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:30,361
So I do my thing,

1187
01:02:33,242 --> 01:02:36,075
and when I'm done,
I peep my head out

1188
01:02:36,145 --> 01:02:37,271
and l...

1189
01:02:39,282 --> 01:02:41,409
what do I do
with this container?

1190
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:49,352
This nurse says,
"Leave it on the shelf."

1191
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,123
I'm sorry?

1192
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:57,758
I mean, my self-esteem
is at an all-time low.

1193
01:02:59,502 --> 01:03:03,131
I'm in a little green closet
with big butt magazine,

1194
01:03:04,941 --> 01:03:07,239
suspecting that
my semen isn't potent.

1195
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:11,178
And you want me
to leave it on the shelf?

1196
01:03:16,886 --> 01:03:19,411
So I left it on the shelf.

1197
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:32,668
What'd you do
with the magazine?

1198
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:35,932
What's he doing in there?

1199
01:03:41,444 --> 01:03:42,706
(knocking)

1200
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,542
Uh, yeah?

1201
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:48,675
Hey, how can you
stand Fishman?

1202
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:50,548
He's ridiculous.

1203
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:53,780
- D'you mind? I gotta whiz.
- Sure, go ahead.

1204
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:56,788
Fishman!

1205
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:02,486
Tepp. I literally can't do this
with you standing behind me.

1206
01:04:12,742 --> 01:04:14,437
There he is.
About time.

1207
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,138
Avery and I made up.
BFF. Best friends forever.

1208
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:18,510
Sit it.

1209
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:20,344
We'll play some cards.

1210
01:04:22,852 --> 01:04:24,342
(music plays)

1211
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:34,296
That's disgusting.

1212
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,065
What do you guys suppose
the chances are

1213
01:04:40,136 --> 01:04:41,433
that one of these
is a winner?

1214
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:43,438
One in 900 million.

1215
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:45,098
Sh-h.

1216
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:52,440
Tepp, I'm gonna use your phone.
I'm gonna call my daughter.

1217
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:54,312
I've got one
of those calling cards.

1218
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:56,943
All right, Tepp.
How many you want?

1219
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:58,577
- Three.
- Three.

1220
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:01,256
Dealer takes three.

1221
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:06,420
That's right, Avery.
I'm coming to get ya.

1222
01:05:06,495 --> 01:05:07,621
All right.

1223
01:05:12,068 --> 01:05:14,468
Let's turn 'em, boys.
Avery, what you got?

1224
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,040
Oh.
That's not bad.

1225
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:22,043
That's not bad
for a fireman hero

1226
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:25,046
turned bus driver with
two outstanding warrants.

1227
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,358
A, B, C.
Tepp, your turn.

1228
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:40,429
Roll 'em or show 'em.

1229
01:05:40,496 --> 01:05:43,590
Tepper?
Roll 'em or show 'em. Let's do it.

1230
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:45,531
Aw! Bitch!

1231
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:50,495
I get my daughter her own phone line
so I can talk to her once in a while,

1232
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,939
her mother takes it
off the hook every night.

1233
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:54,476
Nice, huh?

1234
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:56,443
Fantastic.
Tepp!

1235
01:05:56,512 --> 01:06:00,346
Stop with the drama.
Roll your cards, please.

1236
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:03,283
Tonight would be fantastic.

1237
01:06:03,352 --> 01:06:05,081
I will.

1238
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:10,655
Am I missing something?

1239
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:13,852
All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll make it easy on you, Tepper.

1240
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:16,489
See you start
with a pair of threes.

1241
01:06:16,565 --> 01:06:18,465
Then you go right in

1242
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:20,729
to the pair of eights.

1243
01:06:20,803 --> 01:06:24,762
Bang, bang, boom.

1244
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:30,642
Come on, Tepp.
Can you do it?

1245
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:32,611
Well,

1246
01:06:33,315 --> 01:06:35,180
I think I can.

1247
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:36,513
Fish.

1248
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:38,519
Oh. I think he's pulling
a Fishman.

1249
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:40,578
I believe I have

1250
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,650
these two aces, Fish.

1251
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,389
And... oh, what's this?

1252
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,491
What's happening?

1253
01:06:52,568 --> 01:06:54,729
Oh, and a third one.

1254
01:06:58,074 --> 01:06:59,905
What'd you have?
Two and draw one?

1255
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,034
Yeah, something like that.
I got lucky.

1256
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:03,578
Something I never
have been.

1257
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:06,240
Unbelievable.
I lose with two freakin' pair?

1258
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:09,113
I can't buy a freakin' break.
Where's the phone?

1259
01:07:09,185 --> 01:07:10,880
I gotta cancel a bet.

1260
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:11,942
I'll deal.

1261
01:07:12,021 --> 01:07:14,148
Yeah, let Houdini deal.
I gotta get a plan.

1262
01:07:14,223 --> 01:07:15,952
- Now there's a surprise.
- What'd you say?

1263
01:07:16,025 --> 01:07:18,050
Nothing.
I'm gonna deal.

1264
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:28,265
Damn. Feels like a deck
and a half in here.

1265
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:33,832
What do you say we use
a new deck for the last hand?

1266
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:36,036
Tell him Paul Fishman's
on the line.

1267
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:38,910
Yes, I'll hold.

1268
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:42,041
You know, the funny thing
about lottery tickets,

1269
01:07:42,118 --> 01:07:43,779
it's such a leap of faith.

1270
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:48,348
I've been playing
the lottery for 10 years now,

1271
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:50,949
one ticket every week
for 10 years.

1272
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:54,092
And I always play
the same numbers.

1273
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:57,030
I'd sooner forget my birthday
as my lottery numbers.

1274
01:07:57,099 --> 01:07:58,657
And I always buy them

1275
01:07:58,734 --> 01:08:01,328
from the same little
Korean fellow.

1276
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:04,964
He's got a place right across
the street from our church.

1277
01:08:07,276 --> 01:08:10,439
Every Sunday, after I thank
the Lord for my blessings,

1278
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:15,006
I sneak in a little
prayer for myself.

1279
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:19,180
And I say,
"Dear Lord, this week let me win."

1280
01:08:21,457 --> 01:08:23,482
Then I take the girls
across the street,

1281
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:26,687
and buy them juice
from the little Korean fellow,

1282
01:08:26,762 --> 01:08:29,162
and buy me
a lottery ticket.

1283
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,222
The odd thing
about this Sunday,

1284
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,165
the little fellow
wasn't there.

1285
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:34,998
Sick or something.

1286
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:38,335
First time in 10 years.

1287
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:40,568
But I buy the ticket
anyway from his wife.

1288
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:43,373
Same numbers,
different hand

1289
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:46,471
punching them
into the computer.

1290
01:08:46,549 --> 01:08:48,642
And I say to myself,

1291
01:08:49,718 --> 01:08:51,549
Is this a sign?

1292
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,713
Could this be the week
I'm going to win?

1293
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:56,485
Maybe the good Lord knew

1294
01:08:56,559 --> 01:09:00,461
I needed a different hand
typing in the tickets.

1295
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:03,054
So he made
the little guy sick,

1296
01:09:03,132 --> 01:09:04,724
just so I could win.

1297
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:09,029
Then I go and
lose the ticket.

1298
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:11,902
And you find it.

1299
01:09:11,974 --> 01:09:16,206
And here you are
gambling it in a poker game.

1300
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,508
Now here's where
the faith comes in.

1301
01:09:18,581 --> 01:09:20,776
If the good Lord
intended me to win,

1302
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:25,614
and mine is the winning ticket,
I'm walking out of here with it.

1303
01:09:25,688 --> 01:09:28,350
Because,
He wouldn't do that,

1304
01:09:28,424 --> 01:09:30,415
play a trick on me
like that.

1305
01:09:30,492 --> 01:09:33,222
Because he's too busy
screwing with me. Deal, Quigley.

1306
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:35,661
You listen to me,
you little rat bastard.

1307
01:09:35,731 --> 01:09:38,564
You tell him Fishman's
calling back in two minutes

1308
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:40,261
and he better
pick up the phone.

1309
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:41,360
That's unbelievable.

1310
01:09:41,437 --> 01:09:44,270
I have the only bookie in New York
with a freakin' receptionist.

1311
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,171
Hands on the table, fellas.

1312
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:48,506
I don't want
any controversy.

1313
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,745
Hey, guys. You think we'll still be playing
poker in 50 years?

1314
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:56,648
God, I hope not.

1315
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,619
And take your time.

1316
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:01,417
Six million reasons
not to screw this up.

1317
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,855
(music plays)

1318
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,151
I think we should split it
if someone wins.

1319
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:09,493
- Since when?
- I've always thought that.

1320
01:10:11,734 --> 01:10:13,725
Especially after everything
that's gone on tonight.

1321
01:10:13,802 --> 01:10:15,702
Then why even play?

1322
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:18,171
I don't know, Fish.
For the fun of it.

1323
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,970
What is it with fun tonight?
This isn't supposed to be fun.

1324
01:10:21,043 --> 01:10:23,511
This is gambling.
There's winners and there's losers.

1325
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,103
Yes, I'll hold.

1326
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:42,195
How many, Ave?
One for Ave.

1327
01:10:45,634 --> 01:10:47,124
Hi, Mrs. Darmstetter.

1328
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:48,999
Tepp?
How many?

1329
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:51,766
Well, sure you can,
you've done it for me before.

1330
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,330
Honey...

1331
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:54,569
What?

1332
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:56,008
Do you think they'd know
to check the basement?

1333
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:57,568
- How many, Tepp?
- The police.

1334
01:10:57,646 --> 01:10:59,511
Draw time. Let's go.
How many?

1335
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:01,344
Tepp.
Mrs. Darmstetter.

1336
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:02,782
I don't know.
I'm sure they do.

1337
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:05,911
Are you telling me all the money I bet, you
can't do me this one thing?

1338
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:08,718
- Remember the exterminator?
- Come on. How many?

1339
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:10,281
- He didn't know.
- Tepp, pay attention.

1340
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:13,590
- He's worked this building for years.
- Pissing me off, this guy.

1341
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:17,223
If he didn't know,
how are they gonna know?

1342
01:11:17,299 --> 01:11:19,824
- Unbelievable.
- Draw, Tepp, how many?

1343
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,699
I don't know, but
they know, okay?

1344
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:24,432
How many?

1345
01:11:24,506 --> 01:11:26,667
- Hello?
- I want to double my bet.

1346
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:30,178
I want six bills on SC tomorrow,
do you understand me?

1347
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:33,180
- Maybe you should say something.
- I want you to count 'em out for me.

1348
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:35,716
- She's trying to talk to you.
- I'd say something,

1349
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:38,252
but they're not going
to listen to me, an old lady.

1350
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,220
- Where are you?
- Bitch.

1351
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:42,086
- Tepp, Tepp.
- Tepper.

1352
01:11:42,157 --> 01:11:44,455
- Pissing me off this guy.
- The exterminator.

1353
01:11:44,526 --> 01:11:46,721
Tepp.
Where's your head?

1354
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:48,626
Maybe if you said something?

1355
01:11:48,697 --> 01:11:51,461
Would you put
a fucking sock in it!?

1356
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:04,977
I'm sorry.

1357
01:12:05,047 --> 01:12:07,379
Mrs. Darmstetter, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1358
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:08,973
Oh God,
I didn't mean that.

1359
01:12:09,051 --> 01:12:10,814
I'm having a rough
night here.

1360
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:12,444
I would never hurt you.

1361
01:12:12,521 --> 01:12:15,046
I would never ever hurt you,
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:12:16,658 --> 01:12:19,684
You know that, right?
You believe me, right?

1363
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:22,856
This isn't about you.
What happened just now is not about you.

1364
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:27,522
You scared me.

1365
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,091
I know I did.

1366
01:12:30,169 --> 01:12:32,603
I've never seen you like this.

1367
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:36,766
Yeah.

1368
01:12:36,843 --> 01:12:38,572
Yeah, me neither.

1369
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,112
Could you please forgive me?

1370
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,620
I forgive you.

1371
01:12:51,124 --> 01:12:52,989
You want to stay here
and watch some TV?

1372
01:12:53,059 --> 01:12:55,493
No, I guess
I better get back,

1373
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:57,859
in case somebody calls.

1374
01:12:59,932 --> 01:13:01,991
Are you sure you're all right?

1375
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:05,835
I'm okay.

1376
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:20,147
Good night.

1377
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,562
I dealt you already.

1378
01:14:27,453 --> 01:14:28,886
Ave?

1379
01:14:36,195 --> 01:14:37,924
(whistling)

1380
01:14:40,066 --> 01:14:41,658
Tepp?

1381
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:47,468
I got nothing.

1382
01:14:53,813 --> 01:14:55,542
You got a flush.

1383
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,946
Hey!

1384
01:14:57,016 --> 01:15:00,315
You don't draw a three for a flush
in a two-man game. That's idiotic.

1385
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:01,683
You don't deserve to win.

1386
01:15:01,754 --> 01:15:03,949
You don't draw a three
for a flush ever.

1387
01:15:04,023 --> 01:15:05,888
I mean the chance of that
happening are like zero.

1388
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,892
Unbelievable.
Quigley, get out of my seat.

1389
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,518
Tepp, take your tickets.

1390
01:15:09,595 --> 01:15:13,031
Why don't you ever play like that
when my money's on the freakin' table?

1391
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:15,294
Take your tickets, Tepp. Here you go.
I'm gonna check the numbers.

1392
01:15:15,368 --> 01:15:17,131
- I'll do it.
- That's okay, I got it.

1393
01:15:18,404 --> 01:15:19,962
Quigley, give me
the phone now.

1394
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:21,631
It's ringing.

1395
01:15:21,707 --> 01:15:23,470
Still want to split it?

1396
01:15:26,546 --> 01:15:30,380
Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

1397
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,146
The winning numbers are: 10,

1398
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:35,050
23,

1399
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:36,520
91.

1400
01:15:36,589 --> 01:15:39,183
To hear the numbers
again, press one.

1401
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:42,187
No winners.

1402
01:15:42,261 --> 01:15:44,957
Hey, thank God for that.

1403
01:15:45,031 --> 01:15:46,293
(knocking)

1404
01:15:46,365 --> 01:15:48,799
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

1405
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:50,699
Will you get the door,
Bolan?

1406
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,676
All right, turns out
you guys are not

1407
01:15:57,743 --> 01:16:00,143
the biggest idiots
in the building.

1408
01:16:00,213 --> 01:16:03,307
Raymond got himself stuck
in the garbage chute,

1409
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:04,940
ass end up.

1410
01:16:05,017 --> 01:16:08,475
I live off 229th.
I'm gonna keep and eye out for you.

1411
01:16:09,555 --> 01:16:11,921
Now you can leave.

1412
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:17,225
Thank you, Officer Campbell.

1413
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:21,528
Finally, we can play
some freakin' cards.

1414
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:23,865
Too late, Tepp.
No take backs.

1415
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:25,665
What's done is done.

1416
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:29,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm going home.

1417
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:31,967
Well, no.
It's still early yet.

1418
01:16:32,044 --> 01:16:33,944
Not for me.

1419
01:16:34,013 --> 01:16:36,345
- Bolan!
- Yeah, guys. I gotta call it too.

1420
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:37,677
What, are you kidding me?

1421
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,218
We've only played one
freakin' hand all night.

1422
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:42,083
Well, we can go
again tomorrow night.

1423
01:16:42,154 --> 01:16:45,214
I can't play tomorrow.
Tonight's my poker night.

1424
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:50,893
Hey, guys, I'm cabbing it.
Anybody wanna share?

1425
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:54,262
I'm so tired of humping
this freakin' ride.

1426
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:57,734
Guess it wasn't in the cards
today, huh, Fish?

1427
01:16:57,803 --> 01:17:01,239
And the sun just set on another
day you gave head to, Quigley.

1428
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:03,366
But what does that
do for me? Huh?

1429
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:07,077
Avery, it was nice
to meet you.

1430
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:10,644
- Guys.
- Later, Bolan.

1431
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:13,082
Hey, you want your cash?

1432
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:19,250
I guess that's for me.

1433
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:22,522
You probably want to get
going too, huh, Avery?

1434
01:17:22,595 --> 01:17:26,087
Let me... let me get
your jacket and stuff.

1435
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:34,404
No need to rush off just yet.

1436
01:17:42,882 --> 01:17:44,076
God, I thought
they'd never leave.

1437
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,446
Sorry, Tepp,
this had to happen.

1438
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,750
Did you see that?
Did you see how smooth I was?

1439
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:51,585
Three clubs right off the bottom.
Like butter, I'm smooth.

1440
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:52,919
Avery, I'm going
to get a towel.

1441
01:17:52,992 --> 01:17:55,984
No, you didn't catch that because
I'm Kreskin, mother-fucker.

1442
01:17:58,064 --> 01:17:59,554
What the fuck?

1443
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:00,929
It's okay,
it's okay.

1444
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:05,399
We got an emergency,
411 West 13th, apartment 7.

1445
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:06,995
Tepp, Tepp, hey,
hey, no, no.

1446
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:08,700
- That doesn't work!
- Get away!

1447
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,939
We got $6 million,
God damn it!

1448
01:18:18,551 --> 01:18:20,576
We got a winner here.
I'm protecting our money.

1449
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:22,450
Tepp, our money.
We've got a winning ticket.

1450
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:25,149
- You said no winners, Tepp.
- He lied. He had to.

1451
01:18:25,224 --> 01:18:28,421
- And Bolan would never go for it.
- Why are you doing this, Quigley?

1452
01:18:28,494 --> 01:18:30,655
Because it's his ticket.
And he can prove it.

1453
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:33,028
- What are you talking about?
- Because Fireman Frank here

1454
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:34,862
plays his grand-daughter's
birthday.

1455
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:37,334
But neither one of you
caught that did you?

1456
01:18:37,403 --> 01:18:38,927
I did.

1457
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,269
I did.
Quigley did.

1458
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,739
Show him the ticket, Tepp.
Show him the ticket.

1459
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:48,575
First number: 10.
Month: October.

1460
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:51,708
Second number: 23, day.
Last number: 91, year.

1461
01:18:51,784 --> 01:18:54,776
October, 23, 1991.
He plays his grand-daughter's birthday,

1462
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:56,685
and he's been
doing it for 10 years.

1463
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:59,850
And don't you think
for a fucking second

1464
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:02,416
that all his neighbors in the hood
don't know about it,

1465
01:19:02,495 --> 01:19:04,929
probably planning
a big ol' barbeque right about now.

1466
01:19:04,997 --> 01:19:08,125
We got no choice,
we got no choice here.

1467
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,328
Think about it, think about it.
Four white boys.

1468
01:19:11,404 --> 01:19:13,964
Four white boys
rip off a...

1469
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,405
a Black man.

1470
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:18,136
A hero no less.
We're fucked.

1471
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,475
At the very least we have Al Sharpton up
our ass for the rest of our lives.

1472
01:19:21,547 --> 01:19:23,708
Plus, this is the kind of guy
who doesn't even quit his job.

1473
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:28,513
Screw that.

1474
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:33,449
Screw that.

1475
01:19:35,294 --> 01:19:37,228
I'm quitting.

1476
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,560
I'm getting
my daughter back.

1477
01:19:39,632 --> 01:19:42,829
You're getting those guys off your ass,
and Tepp, you can do whatever you want.

1478
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:47,038
Oh, God.

1479
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:49,767
It's him or us.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1480
01:19:52,945 --> 01:19:54,810
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

1481
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,711
- This was your idea.
- Please.

1482
01:19:56,782 --> 01:19:58,272
(intercom buzzes)

1483
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,183
- You guys, shut up.
- Stop it.

1484
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:04,815
Carla:
Hey, hey. It's me.

1485
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:07,859
Let me in, baby.
I'm drenched.

1486
01:20:11,664 --> 01:20:14,258
I wanted to look
so good for you, too.

1487
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:20,528
Can I tell you something?
I am really nervous.

1488
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:24,733
I know it probably
sounds silly, but...

1489
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,904
I don't know. It's like
our first date all over again.

1490
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,881
You're going to have to let me in.
My key is jammed again.

1491
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:33,976
Tepp.
Don't bring Carla up here.

1492
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:36,146
It's not a good place for her.
Not now.

1493
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:38,884
What are you doing up there?
I am freezing.

1494
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:40,721
Let's go, let's go.
Let me in.

1495
01:20:45,197 --> 01:20:46,562
Help me with him.

1496
01:20:46,632 --> 01:20:49,829
If it's about the guys,
I don't care if they're still there.

1497
01:20:49,902 --> 01:20:52,962
I'm sure they know everything
that's going on anyway.

1498
01:20:56,642 --> 01:21:00,703
I'm trying real hard to give you
the benefit of the doubt right now.

1499
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:04,272
Come on, I've waited
six months for tonight.

1500
01:21:05,818 --> 01:21:09,345
Tepp, if you have something
to say to me, then just say it.

1501
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:11,889
Don't leave me
standing out here.

1502
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,224
You know what
the problem is?

1503
01:21:17,296 --> 01:21:20,390
You never chose me.

1504
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:22,934
I asked you out.

1505
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:25,596
I kissed you first.

1506
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,540
I wanted to get married.

1507
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:35,272
You never once took
the initiative with anything.

1508
01:21:37,516 --> 01:21:39,746
You just let it happen.

1509
01:21:41,887 --> 01:21:44,981
Now you're doing it
again, aren't you?

1510
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,728
Well, I'm tired of waiting.

1511
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:54,992
I'm tired of spending every
moment trying to figure out

1512
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,501
what it is you want
and how I can be that.

1513
01:22:02,408 --> 01:22:04,740
I'm just tired.

1514
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:43,907
We'll straighten it all out
tomorrow, all right?

1515
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:47,177
I promise you we'll
straighten it out tomorrow.

1516
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,217
No we won't.

1517
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:55,652
Fish, you won't be
straightening it out tomorrow.

1518
01:22:57,596 --> 01:22:59,291
What are we doing, man?

1519
01:23:00,966 --> 01:23:02,797
We're friends, Fish.
What are we doing?

1520
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:04,836
Oh, come on.

1521
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:07,436
You're friends.

1522
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:12,639
Since when do friends
cheat each other?

1523
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,175
Yep.
I caught that too, Tepp.

1524
01:23:17,249 --> 01:23:20,582
And since you're feeling all righteous then
why don't you tell Fish?

1525
01:23:20,653 --> 01:23:23,918
Tell Fish just how good
a friend you are.

1526
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:26,048
See, Tepp.
I figured out your tell.

1527
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:29,253
When you're lying,
you look him straight in the eye.

1528
01:23:30,462 --> 01:23:31,793
Yep.

1529
01:23:31,864 --> 01:23:33,422
He cheated you, Fish.

1530
01:23:33,499 --> 01:23:36,593
He looked you straight in the eye
and he cheated you. Three aces?

1531
01:23:36,669 --> 01:23:38,500
Three aces, my ass.

1532
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:45,775
You cheated me, Tepp?

1533
01:23:55,688 --> 01:23:57,679
I did.

1534
01:24:03,095 --> 01:24:04,926
I'm sorry, Fish.

1535
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,926
You dumb-asses.

1536
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,999
30 years I've been waiting for a break like
this, you screw it up in a night.

1537
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:21,012
It's what the wall
was all about?

1538
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,479
Jesus, Tepp.

1539
01:24:22,548 --> 01:24:25,642
And Quigley, you smashed his head
'cause he's a threat to you?

1540
01:24:25,718 --> 01:24:27,515
Did you listen to a word
he said all night?

1541
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:29,554
He's got a wife
and kids, man.

1542
01:24:29,621 --> 01:24:32,886
We know where he lives.
You don't have to hurt a guy like that.

1543
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:37,889
Now...

1544
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:41,899
you know, now,
it's a problem.

1545
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:43,764
Avery.

1546
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:46,867
You're a problem.

1547
01:24:48,407 --> 01:24:50,238
Not if we split it.

1548
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:54,503
Look, I'm a poor man today.

1549
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:57,913
Tomorrow,
I'll be a millionaire.

1550
01:24:57,983 --> 01:25:01,146
Either way.

1551
01:25:02,721 --> 01:25:05,417
Just want a fair share.

1552
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:09,052
You see, Quigley,
there's a man who's thinking.

1553
01:25:09,128 --> 01:25:11,858
He's living in the moment.
Half his head is freakin' gone,

1554
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,898
and he's smarter than
all three of us put together.

1555
01:25:18,537 --> 01:25:20,004
Avery.

1556
01:25:20,072 --> 01:25:22,336
I don't want to threaten you.

1557
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:24,467
I know what that feels like.

1558
01:25:24,543 --> 01:25:26,807
But if we do this,

1559
01:25:26,879 --> 01:25:29,347
and you turn on us...

1560
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:33,617
I don't want anybody else hurt.

1561
01:25:35,087 --> 01:25:36,850
Right.

1562
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:42,188
- I got no problem with that.
- I'm good with that too.

1563
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:45,761
No.

1564
01:25:47,366 --> 01:25:49,266
We're not splitting it.

1565
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:51,766
What?

1566
01:25:51,837 --> 01:25:53,998
10 minutes ago,

1567
01:25:54,073 --> 01:25:56,371
you were Johnny-split-it-all.

1568
01:25:56,442 --> 01:26:00,310
What are you, the Moral Majority now?
What, am I in the freakin' 700 Club?

1569
01:26:00,379 --> 01:26:01,778
We're splitting it, Tepp.

1570
01:26:01,847 --> 01:26:03,371
It's his.

1571
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,474
It was his to begin with.

1572
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:07,576
No, Tepp.
You found the wallet.

1573
01:26:07,653 --> 01:26:11,487
That ticket became yours,
and then you bet it in a game.

1574
01:26:11,557 --> 01:26:14,117
- We're splitting it.
- We're splitting it, Tepper.

1575
01:26:14,193 --> 01:26:17,526
And you damn well ought to be happy
about it, seeing as how you cheated me.

1576
01:26:17,596 --> 01:26:19,655
Don't complicate this,
Tepper, please.

1577
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:21,858
Just don't complicate it.
This is the best way to do it.

1578
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:24,926
We've all got something
on each other.

1579
01:26:25,003 --> 01:26:26,994
No one's going to talk,
it would only hurt us all.

1580
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,803
I'm going to take the ticket,
I'll cash it out, I'll divvy it up.

1581
01:26:30,876 --> 01:26:33,037
See, I can handle that.

1582
01:26:33,112 --> 01:26:35,808
We're not splitting it.

1583
01:26:37,749 --> 01:26:39,910
It's his and
he's leaving with it.

1584
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:44,346
No, what is this?
What is this, Tepper, huh?

1585
01:26:44,423 --> 01:26:46,755
Come on. This is about...
you feel guilty, Tepp?

1586
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:50,455
'Cause if you feel guilty,
give us the ticket.

1587
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:53,895
Give us the ticket, Tepp.

1588
01:26:55,734 --> 01:26:58,032
I'm doing this 'cause
it needs doing.

1589
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:01,200
Take your ticket,
Avery.

1590
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:04,509
I appreciate
the gesture, but...

1591
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:07,602
it just doesn't seem
decided yet.

1592
01:27:10,282 --> 01:27:12,250
It's not that simple, is it?

1593
01:27:13,185 --> 01:27:14,345
(knocking)

1594
01:27:14,419 --> 01:27:16,284
Campbell: Guess who?

1595
01:27:16,355 --> 01:27:18,949
Tick, tick.
Open the door.

1596
01:27:20,392 --> 01:27:21,950
(knocking)

1597
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:30,835
I was two blocks away
from getting clocked out.

1598
01:27:31,937 --> 01:27:33,495
I should have run the light.

1599
01:27:33,572 --> 01:27:36,598
What did I tell you, Tepp?
Officer, I'm sorry.

1600
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:39,769
This is a little embarrassing.
I'm the one who called, actually.

1601
01:27:39,845 --> 01:27:42,109
L... I panicked.

1602
01:27:43,182 --> 01:27:44,843
What happened to you?

1603
01:27:47,986 --> 01:27:50,181
Like he said.
He panicked.

1604
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:52,917
We were rough-housing and

1605
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:57,291
I took a header,
and the little shit panics.

1606
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:01,192
- Yeah, I thought he was hurt.
- He just panicked.

1607
01:28:01,266 --> 01:28:02,927
So he said.

1608
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:07,772
I've grown tired of you guys.

1609
01:28:07,839 --> 01:28:10,000
I'm the one who called 911.

1610
01:28:10,075 --> 01:28:13,203
Well, I'm all out of gold stars.
Work it out with your buddies.

1611
01:28:13,278 --> 01:28:16,770
Well, that's 'cause I've done
something illegal.

1612
01:28:16,848 --> 01:28:18,406
And I want to confess.

1613
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:22,711
I'm sorry, Fish.

1614
01:28:22,788 --> 01:28:24,312
You wise guys...

1615
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:26,482
I'm finishing
a double shift

1616
01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:28,583
at the end of
a very long week.

1617
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,857
I've got daughters home from school
waiting to spend time with their dad.

1618
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,229
You are cutting into my quality time
and I do not appreciate it.

1619
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,029
This ticket...

1620
01:28:37,102 --> 01:28:39,502
belongs to Avery.

1621
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:41,334
Not me.

1622
01:28:41,406 --> 01:28:43,067
And not us.

1623
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:45,473
Well then, I suggest
you give it to him.

1624
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:48,202
The problem is,

1625
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,544
it's a winner.

1626
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:54,618
It's worth $6 million.

1627
01:28:59,858 --> 01:29:01,382
If I give this to you,

1628
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,258
will you see that Avery
gets home safely with it?

1629
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:10,635
Courtesy, professionalism
and respect.

1630
01:29:11,703 --> 01:29:13,227
That's me.

1631
01:29:14,106 --> 01:29:15,437
Nice.

1632
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,578
This your ticket?

1633
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,640
Yes, sir.

1634
01:29:25,717 --> 01:29:27,947
Does that mean
it's stolen property?

1635
01:29:29,621 --> 01:29:31,680
Look, I just want
what's fair.

1636
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:33,748
There's no problem.

1637
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:35,383
Oh, but there is a problem.

1638
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,690
See, I wanted
to get out of here.

1639
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:40,231
I wanted you guys to settle
this thing on your own,

1640
01:29:40,299 --> 01:29:41,994
on account
I've got family at home.

1641
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:45,264
But like a boil on my ass,

1642
01:29:45,337 --> 01:29:46,599
you guys just
wouldn't go away.

1643
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:49,334
So, whether you want
to press charges or not,

1644
01:29:49,408 --> 01:29:53,367
I have all the paperwork to do.
Procedure, I'm sure you know about that.

1645
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:58,482
I'll do it Monday morning.

1646
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:02,042
You'll find it in lost property
with your name on it, Avery.

1647
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,452
Yeah, and I'm 10 inches.

1648
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:08,822
Are you bragging,

1649
01:30:08,894 --> 01:30:11,089
or are you
doubting my word?

1650
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:16,492
Yeah, just another
dirty cop, huh?

1651
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:19,532
Maybe you're right.

1652
01:30:21,006 --> 01:30:23,167
Paperwork does have a way
of getting misplaced.

1653
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:29,576
You girls have
a nice night.

1654
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:40,089
Tepper,

1655
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,184
please tell me you just
pulled a fast one.

1656
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:46,230
And we're about
to work this out

1657
01:30:46,298 --> 01:30:47,788
like men.

1658
01:30:49,901 --> 01:30:51,129
Right?

1659
01:30:53,004 --> 01:30:56,405
You didn't just give
a New York City cop

1660
01:30:56,475 --> 01:31:00,036
a six million dollar
lottery ticket, right?

1661
01:31:03,548 --> 01:31:04,572
Right?

1662
01:31:11,156 --> 01:31:13,784
I did the right thing, Fish.

1663
01:31:23,869 --> 01:31:26,064
You did.

1664
01:31:29,908 --> 01:31:33,275
Oh, for crying out loud.

1665
01:31:36,415 --> 01:31:38,713
You did.

1666
01:32:10,549 --> 01:32:13,040
Congratulations, Tepp.

1667
01:32:15,854 --> 01:32:17,947
You just got code.

1668
01:32:20,058 --> 01:32:22,185
I just wish it could
have been tomorrow.

1669
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:36,166
Nice knowing you, Avery.

1670
01:32:41,379 --> 01:32:42,778
Call her.

1671
01:33:42,007 --> 01:33:44,874
I appreciate what
you tried to do.

1672
01:33:59,524 --> 01:34:01,515
You did the right thing.

1673
01:34:05,897 --> 01:34:07,387
What?

1674
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,270
Oh-h!

1675
01:34:18,577 --> 01:34:20,841
Son of a...

1676
01:34:27,686 --> 01:34:29,813
There's no mistaking
my ticket, is there?

1677
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:45,898
Son of it!

1678
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:48,201
Go home to your wife,
okay, Avery?

1679
01:34:53,545 --> 01:34:55,206
What's this?

1680
01:34:56,348 --> 01:34:57,610
Hey, oh!

1681
01:35:04,022 --> 01:35:05,046
Oh, God.

1682
01:35:21,506 --> 01:35:23,701
CD:
This is big brother Bolan

1683
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:26,175
sending the good love out
to my two favorite people.

1684
01:35:26,244 --> 01:35:27,734
(music plays)

1685
01:35:32,884 --> 01:35:35,352
Hey, it's Carla.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

1686
01:35:37,155 --> 01:35:39,487
Hey, it's me.

1687
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,857
I love you.

1688
01:35:52,537 --> 01:35:56,564
And I hope it's not
too little too late.

1689
01:35:58,943 --> 01:36:00,911
I love you.

1690
01:36:02,614 --> 01:36:03,808
(knocking)

1691
01:36:15,994 --> 01:36:17,427
How you doing?

1692
01:36:17,495 --> 01:36:19,759
You called my brother-in-law
Victor about my wallet.

1693
01:36:27,672 --> 01:36:29,435
I'm Avery Phillips.

1694
01:38:16,314 --> 01:38:18,544
¶ I can't hide ¶

1695
01:38:18,616 --> 01:38:20,709
¶ I can't deny ¶

1696
01:38:20,785 --> 01:38:24,812
¶ The way you change,
change my life ¶

1697
01:38:24,889 --> 01:38:29,053
¶ Like an angel full of love ¶

1698
01:38:29,127 --> 01:38:33,154
¶ You bring me home,
oh you bring me love ¶

1699
01:38:33,231 --> 01:38:35,495
¶ I was lonely ¶

1700
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:37,501
¶ Till you showed me ¶

1701
01:38:37,569 --> 01:38:41,733
¶ You made me feel pain
I've never felt before ¶

1702
01:38:41,806 --> 01:38:45,640
¶ I was broken ¶

1703
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:47,905
¶ Took my weakness ¶

1704
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:50,004
¶ Made me feel secure ¶

1705
01:38:50,081 --> 01:38:52,242
¶ Every time I needed you ¶

1706
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:54,410
¶ You were always there ¶

1707
01:38:54,485 --> 01:38:55,850
¶ When I didn't feel
like giving love ¶

1708
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,787
¶ Ooh, I didn't have a prayer ¶

1709
01:39:00,658 --> 01:39:04,321
¶ I want to show you how much ¶

1710
01:39:04,395 --> 01:39:06,454
¶ You mean to me ¶

1711
01:39:06,531 --> 01:39:09,056
¶ No, I can't sleep,
no, I can't eat ¶

1712
01:39:09,133 --> 01:39:12,762
¶ No, I can't think
without you ¶

1713
01:39:12,837 --> 01:39:16,136
- ¶ Yeah! ¶
- ¶ Baby, don't you know ¶

1714
01:39:16,207 --> 01:39:21,372
¶ I can't live without you? ¶

1715
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:25,712
¶ Oh, in my life ¶

1716
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:33,952
¶ Yeah ¶

1717
01:39:34,025 --> 01:39:39,986
¶ What would I do
without you? ¶
