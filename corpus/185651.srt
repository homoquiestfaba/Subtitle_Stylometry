Attaboy. Attaboy, sniff it out.

Pick it up, boy. Pick it up.

Come on. Come on.

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,795
Lennie.

Get down.

14
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,476
Hurry up.

15
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,036
Get up there.

16
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,155
- George?
- What d'you want?

17
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,714
Where are we going?

18
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,796
To get away from here.

19
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,115
l'm all wet.

20
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
Come on, let's take off your coat.
Come on.

21
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,196
Come on.

22
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,996
Just lay down and get some rest.

23
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,237
George?

24
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,271
Go to sleep, Lennie.

25
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,356
l'm sleeping, George.

26
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,079
- George, where are we going?
- We're going to a ranch to work.

27
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,596
<i>(driver)</i> Come on. You get off here.

28
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,315
George, wake up.

29
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,829
You're in Soledad.

30
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,951
We're going to the Tyler ranch.

31
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,152
You gotta get off here.
The ranch is down the road.

32
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,670
- How far?
- Just down the road a stretch.

33
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,434
- <i>(George)</i> Where the hell is it?
- George?

34
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,391
- Yeah?
- Where are we going?

35
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,476
Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard.

36
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,909
l forgot, George.
l tried not to, then l forgot.

37
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,191
l spend all my time telling you things,
then you forget 'em.

38
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,276
l remember about the rabbits.

39
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,910
The hell with them rabbits.
That's all you can remember.

40
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,319
OK, listen. This time don't forget.
We went into Murray and Ready's.

41
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,797
- They give us work cards and bus tickets.
- George, l remember that now.

42
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,319
But George, l ain't got mine.
l must've lost it.

43
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,035
l got both of 'em. You think l'd let you
carry your own work card?

44
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,549
l thought l had it in my own pocket.

45
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,875
What did you take out of that pocket?

46
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,510
There's nothing in the pocket, George.

47
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,953
l know it ain't. You got it in your hand.
Now, what you got in your hand?

48
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,469
George, that's just my mouse.

49
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,831
But l didn't kill it, George.
Honest, l found it dead.

50
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,109
Oh, jeez.

51
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,435
- Give it here.
- George, leave me have it.

52
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,677
Give it here. What do you want
with a dead mouse anyway?

53
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,549
l was just petting it with the fingers
while we was walking along.

54
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,389
Yeah, well, you ain't petting no mice
when you walk with me.

55
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,069
You gonna give me that mouse,
or am l gonna have to sock you?

56
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,116
Come on.

57
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,000
Blubbering like a baby, a big guy like you!

58
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,079
Lennie, l ain't taking it
away for meanness.

59
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,716
That mouse ain't fresh, Lennie.

60
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
Get another mouse that's fresh,
l'll let you keep him.

61
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,029
l don't know where
there is no other mouse.

62
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,793
The lady used to give me some,
but that lady ain't here no more.

63
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,275
Lady?

64
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,960
Don't you even remember
who that lady was?

65
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,999
That's your Aunt Clara.
She stopped giving 'em to you.

66
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,271
You was always killing 'em
by petting 'em too hard.

67
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,116
l'll tell you what l'll do.

68
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,509
First chance l get, l'll get you a puppy.

69
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,636
Huh? That'd be better than mice.

70
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,756
You could pet 'em harder.

71
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,876
OK?

72
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,794
Huh?

73
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,238
Hey.

74
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,476
Hey! Hey!

75
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,078
Son of a bitch!

76
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,156
What did you say, George?

77
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,676
l said ''son of a bitch''.

78
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,198
The bus driver lied to us. Just too
damn lazy to stop at the ranch gate.

79
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,877
- Son of a bitch!
- <i>(Lennie)</i> Son of a bitch!

80
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,395
Jesus Christ, George, l said it too.

81
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,637
- Yeah, l heard you.
- George, we wasn't supposed to say that.

82
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,637
Yeah, why not?

83
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,990
Aunt Clara don't like it.

84
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,076
Yeah, well, she's dead.

85
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,396
Lennie.

86
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,071
Don't drink so much.

87
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,716
Hey.

88
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,833
That's good, George. You have a drink.
You have a good, big drink.

89
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
lt's nice here.

90
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,639
l think we'll just spend the night
and go to the ranch tomorrow.

91
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,234
Ain't we gonna get no supper?

92
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,239
Yeah, sure we are.
l got three cans of beans in my bindle.

93
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,876
l like beans with ketchup.

94
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,076
l like beans with ketchup.

95
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,156
We ain't got any.

96
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,398
Go on. Go get some wood
so we can build a fire.

97
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,998
- We got enough beans here for four men.
- l like 'em with ketchup.

98
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,436
We ain't got any.

99
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,872
Goddamnit!

100
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,477
Whatever we ain't got,
that's what you want.

101
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,833
George?

102
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,072
George?

103
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,718
- What d'you want?
- George, l was only fooling.

104
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,434
l don't... l don't want no ketchup.

105
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,836
lf it was here, you could have some.

106
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,358
George, l wouldn't eat no ketchup.

107
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,315
l'd leave it all for you
and you could cover your beans with it.

108
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,396
l wouldn't touch none of it.

109
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,276
When l think of the swell time
l could have without you, phew, l go nuts.

110
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,036
l never get any peace.

111
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,396
lf l was alone, l could live so easy.

112
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,034
l could get a job and work and no trouble.

113
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,197
And when the end of the month come,
l could take my 50 bucks,

114
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,630
l could go into town,
l could get whatever l want.

115
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,955
l could stay in a cathouse all night.

116
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,309
What do l got?

117
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,032
l got you.

118
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,391
You can't keep a job.
Lose me every job l get.

119
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,030
Keep me shovin' all over
the country, all the time.

120
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,396
That ain't the worst.

121
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,037
You get in trouble. You do bad things
and l got to get you out all the time!

122
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,196
Crazy son of a bitch, you keep me
in hot water all the time.

123
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,677
George, you... you want l should
go away and leave you alone?

124
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,036
Where the hell would you go?

125
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,516
l could go...

126
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,278
l could go off in them hills there
and find a cave.

127
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,274
Yeah? How'd you eat?

128
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,154
You ain't got sense enough
to find nothin' to eat.

129
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,796
l find things. l don't need
this nice food with ketchup.

130
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,513
George, if you don't want me,
l go off in them hills and get a cave.

131
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,633
And l wouldn't get no mice
stole off me either.

132
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,790
Jesus Christ, your Aunt Clara wouldn't
like you running off by yourself.

133
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,836
Hey!

134
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,035
Well, go get some wood
so we can build a fire afore it gets dark.

135
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,199
- George?
- What?

136
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,515
Tell me like you done before.

137
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,514
- Tell you what?
- About the...

138
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,032
- About the rabbits.
- Not tonight.

139
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,119
Come on, George. Tell like you done
before. Please? Please? Please?

140
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,435
You get a kick out of that, don't you?

141
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,237
OK.

142
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,316
l will.

143
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,954
Guys like us that work on ranches
are the loneliest guys in the world.

144
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,110
They ain't go no family
and they don't belong no place.

145
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,872
- They got nothin' to look ahead to.
- But not us, George. Tell about us now.

146
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,230
Well, we ain't like that.
We got a future.

147
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,989
We got somebody to talk to
that gives a damn about us.

148
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,749
lf them other guys gets in jail,
they can rot for all anybody cares.

149
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,711
But not us, George, because l...

150
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,038
See, l got you to look after me,
but you got me to look after.

151
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,515
But, George, tell about how it's gonna be.

152
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,709
OK.

153
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,796
Someday...

154
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,275
we're gonna have us
a little house and a couple of acres,

155
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,792
- and a cow and a pig and chickens.
- Pig and chic...

156
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,753
We gonna live off the fat of the land,
and have rabbits.

157
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,393
And have rabbits.

158
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,557
- George, tell what we got in the garden.
- OK.

159
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,471
Then tell about the rabbits in winter,
and about the stove and, uh...

160
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,356
- how thick the cream was on the milk.
- Yeah.

161
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,558
- Go ahead, tell it.
- Why don't you do it? You know all of it.

162
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,275
George, no! George, no,
it's not the same when l tell it.

163
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,072
That's not the same.

164
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,398
Tell, um, what...
how l get to tend the rabbits.

165
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,550
We're gonna have a big vegetable patch
and we're gonna have a rabbit hutch.

166
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,037
- And down in the flat, we'll have a...
- ..little field of alfalfa for the rabbits.

167
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,914
- And l get to tend the rabbits.
- Yeah, you get to tend the rabbits.

168
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,996
When it rains in the winter,

169
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,349
we'll just say
''The hell with going to work,''

170
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,439
and we'll just build a fire in the stove,
and we'll just sit there

171
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,516
and we'll listen to the rain.

172
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,595
Lennie, l want you to look around here.

173
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,430
lf you get in any trouble,
l want you to come right here.

174
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,638
- You hide over here in the brush.
- Hide in the brush.

175
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,276
You hide in the brush until l come
for you. Can you remember that?

176
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,551
Sure l can, George.
Hide in the brush till you come for me.

177
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,990
lf you do get in trouble,
l ain't gonna let you tend the rabbits.

178
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,476
l'm not gonna get into any trouble.

179
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,476
OK.

180
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,475
l can remember, by God.

181
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,395
Let's get some rest.

182
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,396
lt'll be nice sleeping here,

183
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,230
just looking up at the leaves.

184
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,789
George?

185
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,392
What do you want?

186
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,717
l... l think we should get
them different colour rabbits.

187
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916
Sure.

188
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,554
Red rabbits and blue rabbits
and green rabbits.

189
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,035
- Leave 'em alone.
- Be quiet, dogs. Be quiet, goddamnit.

190
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,350
Be quiet!

191
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,837
Shut up, Smiley! Shut up.
Smiley, down.

192
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,030
- You fellas looking for something?
- Yeah. We come here to work.

193
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,913
- Where's the boss?
- He's up at the ranch house.

194
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,759
l'm Candy. Come on,
l'll take you up there.

195
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,111
He was expecting you last night.

196
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,277
He was sore as hell that
you wasn't here to go out this morning.

197
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,356
He come in
when we was having breakfast.

198
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,040
He said ''Goddamnit,
where the hell is them new men?''

199
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,948
And he gives the stable buck hell too.
You see, the stable buck's a nigger.

200
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,390
Ah! There he goes.

201
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,717
He got a crooked back
where a horse kicked him one day.

202
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,798
The boss gives him hell
every time he gets mad.

203
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,354
But the stable buck... <i>(laughs)</i>

204
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,552
The stable buck
don't give a damn about that.

205
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,671
Boss's office in here.

206
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,955
<i>(knock)</i>

207
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,718
Come in.

208
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,436
These guys just came.

209
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,392
l wrote Murray and Ready...
for two men to work this morning.

210
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,995
Where's your work slips?

211
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,676
ls my slip in there?

212
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,276
lt wasn't Murray and Ready's fault.

213
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,109
Says right here you were supposed
to be ready to work this morning.

214
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,118
Bus driver lied to us.
We had to walk ten miles.

215
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,994
l don't give a damn about that.

216
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,157
- What's your name?
- George Milton.

217
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,595
- What's yours?
- His name's Lennie Small.

218
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,798
- Where you boys been working?
- Up around Weed.

219
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,916
- What about you?
- Yeah, him too.

220
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,397
He's not much of a talker, is he?

221
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,993
No, no, he ain't. But he's a hell
of a good worker. He's strong as a bull.

222
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,076
Strong as a bull?

223
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,956
Uh, he can do anything
you tell him. He's a..

224
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,912
He's a good skinner. He can wrestle
grain bags, drive a cultivator.

225
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,713
Cultivator. Ah, but...

226
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,471
l ain't sayin' he's bright - he ain't.

227
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,957
But he's a... he's a damn good worker.

228
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,717
Say... what you selling?

229
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,636
What's your stake in this guy?

230
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,156
Are you taking his pay from him?

231
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,276
Hell, no.

232
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,952
He's my cousin.
l told his old lady l'd take care of him.

233
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,152
He got kicked in the head
by a horse when he was a kid.

234
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,915
All right.

235
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,992
But you'd better not try
to put anything over on me.

236
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,228
Now catch your grain teams after dinner.

237
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,070
Well, l wasn't kicked in the head
with no horse, George.

238
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,715
Be a damn good thing if you was.
Save everybody a hell of a lot of trouble.

239
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,115
You... you said l was your cousin.

240
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,313
Well, that was a lie. lf l was
a relative of yours, l'd shoot myself.

241
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,039
Come on, l'll show you the bunkhouse.

242
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,396
Come on. Come on, boy.

243
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,149
Come on, come on.
You can take these two bunks right here.

244
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,156
That's a hell of an old dog.

245
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,557
Yeah.

246
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,514
And he's getting older too.
l had him since he was a pup.

247
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,552
God, he was a great sheepdog
when he was younger.

248
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,833
Hey... what the hell is this?

249
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,195
Says ''Positively kills lice,
roaches and other scourges''.

250
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,709
What the hell kind of beds
are you giving us?

251
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,037
Now, wait a minute there, young fella.
Wait a minute.

252
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,435
Let me see what you're talking about.

253
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,956
Oh, yeah, yeah. Now l remember.

254
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,389
Last guy that had this bunk
was a blacksmith.

255
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,478
He'd squirt this stuff around
even if there was no bugs.

256
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,912
He used to... he used to wash
his hands even <i>after</i> he ate.

257
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,074
Candy!

258
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,113
- You seen my old man?
- Yeah, he's up at the house.

259
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,835
- You the guys the old man's waiting for?
- Yeah, we just came in.

260
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,555
- Let the big guy talk.
- Suppose he don't wanna talk?

261
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,989
What the hell you gettin' into this for?

262
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,350
We travel together.

263
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,792
- Oh. Oh. So it's that way.
- Yeah, it's that way.

264
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,639
And you won't let
the big guy talk, is that it?

265
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,196
We just come in.

266
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,990
Yeah, well, next time
you answer when you're spoken to.

267
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,399
Say, what the hell...?
Lennie didn't do nothing to him.

268
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,838
That's the boss's son.
Curley's pretty handy with his fists.

269
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,475
- Done a lot of fighting in the ring.
- What's he got against Lennie?

270
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,596
Well, l'll tell you what.

271
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,560
Curley's like a lot of little guys.

272
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,559
Hates big guys. Kinda like
he's mad at 'em cos he ain't a big guy.

273
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,389
Yeah, yeah. Well, he better
make no mistake about Lennie.

274
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,310
Lennie ain't handy. This Curley's gonna
get hurt if he messes around with Lennie.

275
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,759
Yeah, well.

276
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,553
Hey, come here. l wanna show
you something. Come on.

277
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,909
Come on, boy. Come here, come here.
l wanna show you something.

278
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,473
- You see that glove on his left hand?
- Yeah.

279
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,592
- Well, that glove's full of Vaseline.
- What the hell for?

280
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,951
Curley says he's keeping
that hand soft for his wife.

281
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,634
That's a real nice thing to tell around.

282
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,716
Come on, boy. Come on.

283
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,036
Lennie.

284
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,273
- Look. See that guy?
- Yeah.

285
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,789
- The one that was just in here?
- Yeah.

286
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,072
He figures he got you scared. He's gonna
take a sock at you first chance he gets.

287
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,795
George, l don't want no trouble.
Don't let him sock at me.

288
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,956
Just try to keep away from him, will ya?

289
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,470
lf he comes in the bunkhouse again,
move to the other side of the room.

290
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,195
George... George,
you ain't mad at me, are you?

291
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,153
No, l ain't mad. Just try to keep away
from Curley. Don't let him pull you in.

292
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,874
Sure. George, l wasn't gonna say a word.

293
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,551
You get in any trouble,
you remember what l told you.

294
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,956
lf l get in any trouble,
l don't get to tend them rabbits.

295
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,957
No, that's not what l mean.

296
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,629
Remember where we slept
last night, down by the river?

297
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,160
l'm looking for Curley.

298
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,192
He was here a minute ago, but he went.

299
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,316
Oh.

300
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,156
Sometimes Curley's in here.

301
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,716
He ain't now.

302
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,794
Well, if he ain't,
l guess l better look someplace else.

303
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,553
lf l see him, l'll tell him
you was lookin' for him.

304
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,668
Nobody can't blame a person for looking.

305
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,476
See ya around.

306
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,910
- She's pretty.
- Lennie...

307
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,477
- Don't you think she's pretty?
- Listen to me, goddamnit!

308
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,556
- Don't you even look at her.
- But...

309
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,513
l don't care what she says
or does, she's a rat-trap.

310
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,995
But l wasn't doing nothing.

311
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,194
When she was shoving her legs around,
you weren't looking the other way neither.

312
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,390
Keep away from her.

313
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,876
l don't like this place.

314
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,789
- You the new guys?
- Yeah.

315
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,480
l'm Slim. You're gonna be on my team.

316
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,398
l'm George Milton.
This here's Lennie Small.

317
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,718
- You travel around together?
- Yeah.

318
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,038
There ain't many guys travel
around together. l don't know why.

319
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,436
Maybe everybody in the whole damn
world's scared of each other.

320
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,232
Maybe.

321
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,715
So, you ever bucked barley before?

322
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,551
Hell, yes. l ain't nothin' to scream about,
but... Lennie's strong as a bull.

323
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,352
Good.

324
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,076
l got a pair of punks on my team, they
don't know a barley bag from a blue ball.

325
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,560
These guys just came.

326
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,309
l meant to ask you, Slim.
How many puppies your bitch have?

327
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,591
Well, she slung eight of 'em.
l drowned four right off.

328
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,559
She couldn't feed that many.
l just kept the biggest.

329
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,829
<i>(dog barks)</i>

330
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,716
Candy's dog is old and no good.

331
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,595
You oughta get Candy to shoot that dog.
Then you could give him one of the pups.

332
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,275
All right.

333
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,313
George, ask that man,

lt's nice and cool here in the barn,
and quiet.

378

Everybody out in the fields

Let go of that old mule and talk to me.

Pretty far.

How far is far away?

What's the town you came from?

You wouldn't know it if l told you.

You're kidding me.

395
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,752
A good-looking guy like you
must have had a million sweethearts.

396

Your name's George, ain't it?

He's all stiff from rheumatism.

He ain't no good to ya.
Hell, he ain't no good to hisself.

Well!

Right there.

439
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,590
Hell, he'd never even know what hit him.

Then it won't be you that done it.

How'd you two meet up?

494

Well, l knew his Aunt Clara.

495
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,960
She took him when he was a boy.
She raised him up.

496

When she died,
Lennie just come along with me working.

497

Uh-huh.

498
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,669
l used to play jokes on him cos he's
too damn dumb to take care of himself.

499

He'd do any damn thing l told him.

500
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,515
Put that on back in here.

501
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,794
One day, a bunch of guys standing
around on the Sacramento River,

502
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,718
l turns to him and
l says ''Jump in, Lennie.''

503
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,473
And he jumps.

504
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,192
Couldn't swim a stroke. He damn near
drowned before we could get to him.

505
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,836
He was so damn nice to me for pulling
him out, he forgot l told him to jump in.

00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,516
He's a nice fella.

507
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,670
A guy don't need no sense
to be a nice fella.

508
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,636
Yeah.

509
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,036
He gets in trouble all the time
cos he's so goddamn dumb.

510
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,879
Like what happened up north in Weed.

511
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,190
What'd he do in Weed?

512
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,396
He seen this girl,

513
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,753
in a red dress,

514
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,997
and the dumb bastard that he is, he just...

515
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,989
He wants to touch everything he likes,
so he reaches out to touch this red dress.

516
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,871
So the girl starts screaming,
and that gets Lennie all mixed up,

517
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,992
so he holds on and he won't let go,

518
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,759
cos that's the only thing
he can think to do.

519
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,116
So what happened?

520
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,794
Well, she runs off
across the field, screaming.

521
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,273
So me and Lennie take off running.

522
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,075
Pretty soon we hear a bunch of
guys with dogs coming after us.

523
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,235
Had to hide in the irrigation ditch
until it was safe to get away.

524
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,189
He didn't hurt the girl none?

525
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,355
Hell, no. He just scared her.

526
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,348
Well... he ain't mean.

527
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,716
l can tell a mean guy a mile off.

528
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,434
<i>(boss)</i> Milton!

529
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,796
l ain't payin' you to stand around.

530
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,151
- Get back to work.
- He just come over for a drink of water.

531
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,637
You get back to work. You get
these men moving. They're way behind.

532
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,040
You men get moving here. Let's go.

533
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,275
Goddamnit, stop that racket!

534
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,636
Lennie.

535
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,593
l told you not to bring that pup in here.

536
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,676
l ain't got no pup.

537
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,714
- Any of you boys seen my wife?
- She ain't been here.

538
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,718
- Where the hell's Slim?
- Went out to the barn.

539
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,833
Carlson, do you think he's gonna find
Slim in the barn with his wife?

540
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,315
Better not tangle with Slim.

541
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,991
Curley's lookin' for a fight.
l gotta see this. Come on.

542
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,475
No, l'll stay here. Thanks.

543
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,189
- Was Curley's wife in the barn?
- lf she was, l didn't see her.

544
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,676
George.

545
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,556
Both the ends is the same.

546
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,911
- Why both the ends is the same?
- lt's just the way they make 'em.

547
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,430
You sure she didn't come in the barn,
like she come in here?

548
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,437
No, she never.

549
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,630
Give me a good whorehouse every time.

550
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,716
A guy can go in, get drunk,

551
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,718
get it all out of his system
all at once, and no messes.

552
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,789
- George.
- Yeah?

553
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,632
How long is it gonna be
till we get the little place

554
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,751
and live off the fat of the land?

555
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,715
Gotta get some money together first.

556
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,434
l know a little place where you can get
cheap, but they ain't giving it away.

557
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,391
Tell about that place.

558
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,996
lt's ten acres.

559
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,675
lt's got a windmill. Got a little shack
on it, and a chicken run.

560
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,432
Got rabbits, George?

561
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,348
l could easily build a few hutches
and you could feed 'em alfalfa.

562
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,472
You're damn right.
You're goddamn right l could.

563
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,398
But, George, tell about the house.

564
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,749
Well, we have a little house,
and we have a room to ourself.

565
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,117
And we have a little, fat, iron stove, and
in the winter we keep a fire going in it.

566
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,075
And rabbits, George. And that... But
l tend 'em. How do l tend them rabbits?

567
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,431
Well, you go out to the alfalfa field.
You have a sack.

568
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,832
You fill up that sack and you bring it
in and you put it in the rabbit cage.

569
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,073
You have a few pigeons
that fly around the windmill,

570
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,634
like they done when l was a kid.

571
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,950
And it'd be our home.

572
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,911
Nobody could can us.

573
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,237
We don't like a guy,
we just say ''Get the hell out.''

574
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,555
lf a friend come, we'd have an extra bunk.

575
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,593
We'd say ''Why don't you spend
the night?'' and, by God, he would.

576
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,311
We'd have a dog and a couple of cats,

577
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,115
but you got to make sure
them cats don't get them rabbits.

578
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,753
<i>(mumbles)</i>

579
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,792
But... you just let them try.

580
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,755
l'm gonna break them goddamn cats'
necks. l smash them cats with a stick.

581
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,916
You know a place like this?

582
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,390
Suppose l do. What's it to you?

583
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,835
How much they want for a place like that?

584
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,834
- Could get it for 600 bucks.
- 600.

585
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,190
Old people that owns it is broke.

586
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,280
l ain't much good with only one hand.

587
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,119
That's why they give me a job sweeping.
And they give me $250 cos l lost my hand.

588
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,149
And l got 50 more saved
in the bank right now.

589
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,236
That's, uh... 300.

590
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,078
And l got 50 more coming
at the end of the month.

591
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,315
Suppose l went in with you fellas.

592
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,829
That'd be $350 that l'd put in.

593
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,430
Now, let me tell you something.
l could cook,

594
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,516
and l could tend the chickens,

595
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,036
and l could hoe in the garden. Huh?

596
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,390
- Now, how would that be?
- OK.

597
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,038
l got to think about that.
We was gonna do it by ourselves.

598
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,355
We were gonna do it by ourselves.

599
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,199
Well, now, wait a minute.
l'll tell you what.

600
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,356
l'd make a will and leave my share
to you guys in case l kick off.

601
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,515
l ain't got no relatives or nothin'.

602
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,949
You fellas got any money?
Maybe we can do it now.

603
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,878
- We got ten bucks between us.
- We got ten bucks.

604
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,434
- Ten bucks.
- Yeah.

605
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,234
You seen what they done to my dog?

606
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,033
They said he wasn't no good no more.

607
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,038
l wish somebody'd shoot me
when l ain't no good,

608
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,195
but they won't do that.

609
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,471
They'll can me, and l ain't
gonna have no place to go.

610
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,356
Look, if me and Lennie work a month
and we don't spend nothin',

611
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,153
we'll have 100 bucks.
And you got 350?

612
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,510
Yeah, and you can have every cent of it.

613
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,596
That'd be 450.

614
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,630
Jesus Christ, l bet we could get it for that.

615
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,672
You two could get her started.
l'd work and make up the rest.

616
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,995
l'm gonna take that goddamn pup.

617
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,429
Sure, sure, sure.
You know what l'm gonna do?

618
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,233
l'll write those two old people
that we'll take it.

619
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,271
Candy will send $100 to hold it?

620
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,029
l sure will. l'll have 30 more dollars
the time you guys is ready to quit.

621
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,436
l get to tend the rabbits.
Tell him, George. Tell him he can't do it.

622
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,791
l'll get to hoe in the garden,
even if l ain't no good at it?

623
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,356
- They got a nice stove there?
- Yeah, yeah. They got a real nice stove!

624
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,391
But l bet that pup will like it there.

625
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,479
We're gonna do it, goddamnit. We can fix
up that little old place and live there.

626
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,511
When we gonna do it?

627
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,597
One month. Right smack in one month.

628
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,153
<i>(men talking outside)</i>

629
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,111
Now, don't tell nobody about it.

630
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,391
- Just us three and nobody else.
- Don't tell nobody.

631
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,559
George, l ought to have
shot that dog myself.

632
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,148
l should not let no stranger shoot my dog.

633
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,874
- <i>(Slim)</i> Shut up. l'm tired of...
- l just asked you!

634
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,549
You've been asking me too often
and l'm damn sick of it.

635
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,194
lf you can't look after
your goddamn wife,

636
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,788
what do you expect me
to do about it, huh?

637
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,236
- Lay off me.
- Didn't mean nothing by it.

638
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,033
- l said lay off.
- Just thought you might have seen her.

639
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,549
- Tell her to stay home.
- You keep out of this.

640
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,513
You goddamn punk.
You're yellow as a frog belly.

641
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,835
You may be the best welterweight
in the country,

642
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,669
- but l'll kick your goddamn head in.
- <i>(man imitates a chicken clucking)</i>

643
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,355
What the hell you laughing about?

644
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,914
Huh? You!

645
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,676
Come on, you big bastard, get up.

646
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,118
No big son of a bitch
is gonna laugh at me. Get up.

647
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,559
- l'll show you who's yellow.
- You got no cause for...

648
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,398
Get up!

649
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,829
- <i>(man)</i> Come on, Curley!
- Get up and fight.

650
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,318
- He didn't do nothing. Leave him alone.
- <i>(Lennie)</i> l didn't.

651
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,396
<i>(man)</i> Cut it out, Curley.

01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,275

- Get him, Lennie.
- <i>(Lennie cries)</i>

Get him, Lennie! Get him!

Lennie.

Slim, help me.

658
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,398
- Lennie.
- Oh, God!

659
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,956
Lennie! Lennie!

660
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,279
Lennie! Let go!
Lennie! Let go of his hand.

661
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,029
Let go.

662
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,912
Jesus.

663
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,713
You told me to, George. You told me to.

664
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,035
l know, l know.
Take it easy now. Calm down.

665
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,830
We gotta get him to a doctor.

666
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,314
Carlson, get the wagon hitched up. We'll
take him into Soledad to get him fixed up.

667
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,000
l didn't wanna hurt him.
l didn't wanna hurt him.

Well, suppose he get hurt
or killed and he can't come back.

755

George can't get killed
cos George is careful.

Well, just suppose. Suppose he don't
come back. What you do then?

You got George.
Suppose you ain't got nobody.

Suppose you can't go into the bunkhouse
and play rummy because you's black.

Suppose you have to sit out here
with the mules and read books.

01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,596
What you got there, sonny boy?

837
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,513
George says l ain't got
nothing to do with you.

838
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,590
George giving you orders
about everything?

839
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,995
l ain't gonna talk to you or nothing.

840
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,435
The guys got
a horseshoe tournament going on.

841
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,516
None of them guys is gonna leave.

842
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,431
Why can't l talk to you?
l never get to talk to nobody.

843
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,356
l get awful lonely.

844
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,434
l ain't supposed to talk to you.

845
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,396
You can talk to people,
but l can't talk to nobody but Curley,

846
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,476
or else he gets mad.

847
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,475
How'd you like not to talk to anybody?

848
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,475
What you got covered up there?

849
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,516
l...

850
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,718
That's the pup.

851
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,671
That's the little pup.

852
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,876
Why, it's dead.

853
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,798
But l was just playin' with him.

854
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,156
Don't you worry none.

855
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,195
He's just a mutt.
You can get another one, easy.

856
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:50,633
Well, it ain't that so much, but George
ain't gonna let me tend them rabbits now.

857
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,957
- Why don't he?
- Well, he said when...

858
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,116
l did any bad things, then l wouldn't
be able to tend them rabbits.

859
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,995
Don't you worry about talking to me.

860
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,877
Listen to the guys yell.
They ain't gonna leave till it's over.

861
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,198
l ain't supposed to talk to you. George
said he'd give me hell. He told me this.

862
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,630
Well, what's the matter with me?

863
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,830
Ain't l got a right to talk to nobody?

864
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,114
George says you get
the people in a mess.

865
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,436
Oh, nuts.

866
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,797
What kinda harm am l doing to you?

867
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,478
l tell ya, l ain't used to living like this.

868
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,068
l could've made something outta myself.

869
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,950
Maybe l will yet.

870
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,711
A show come through Salinas,
and l met one of the actors.

871
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,796
He says l could go with the show.

872
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,796
My old lady wouldn't let me,
but this guy says l coulda.

873
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,552
lf l went, l wouldn't be
living like this. You bet.

874
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,275
Say, we were supposed to get
a little place and then get rabbits.

875
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:23,875
Another time, l met a guy -
he was in the pictures.

876
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,958
Went out to the
Riverside Dance Palace with him.

877
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,634
He says he was gonna put me
in the movies.

878
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,716
He says l was a natural.

879
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,473
As soon as he got back to Hollywood
he was gonna write to me about it.

880
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,196
l never did get that letter.

881
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,511
l always thought my old lady stole it, too.

882
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,596
She said no.

883
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,311
So, um... l married Curley.

884
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,149
Met him out at the Riverside Dance Palace
that same night.

885
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,230
- Are you listenin'?
- Sure.

886
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,476
l ain't told this to nobody before.

887
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,436
And maybe l oughtn't to.

888
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,156
l don't like Curley.

889
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,274
He ain't a nice fella.

890
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,555
l could've been in the movies.

891
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,636
Had nice clothes.

892
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,716
This guy said l was a natural.

893
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:38,719
Maybe if you took this pup
and you throwed him away,

894
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,834
then George would never know and l'd
get to tend them rabbits with no trouble.

895
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,275
What makes you so nuts about rabbits?

896
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,871
l like to pet nice things
with the fingers. Soft things.

897
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,389
Well, who don't? Everybody likes that.

898
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,036
Do you like to feel velvet?

899
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,958
You bet, by God.

900
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:09,710
l had me some too. The lady
give me some and then l lost it.

901
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,271
You're nuts.

902
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,550
But you're kinda a nice fella.

903
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,636
Just like a big baby.

904
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,836
Sometimes when l'm doing my hair,
l just sit and stroke it cos it's so soft.

905
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,276
Feel right here.

906
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,309
That's nice.

907

908
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,470
l like it too. lt feels nice.

909
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,556
That's nice.

910
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,476
That's nice.

911
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,956
Don't mess it up.

912
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,676
Look out now. You'll mess it up.

913
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,070
Don't muss it up.

1008
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,396
Jesus Christ, Lennie.

1011
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,800

<i>(dogs barking in distance)</i>

1026
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,994

Guys like us, they got no family.

They ain't got nobody
who gives a hoot in hell about 'em.

1035

- Cos l got you.
- And l got you, George.

01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,278
That's what gives a hoot in hell about us.

1040
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,119
George, but tell now how it's gonna be.

1041
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,196

We're gonna have a cow, and some pigs,
and we're gonna have maybe a chicken.

1045
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:29,796
- Down in the flat, we'll have a...
- Field of alfalfa for the rabbits.
