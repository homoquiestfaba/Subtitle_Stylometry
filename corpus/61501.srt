1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,100
This afternoon at 5:00...

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,700
Il Duce will speak
to the nation!

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,700
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,860
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,780
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,780
Mussolini will speak
to all Italians!

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,620
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,060
to interrupt your work.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,740
This afternoon at 5:00...

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,900
Il Duce will speak
to the nation.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,300
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,660
Even though I'm older now...

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,980
and my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,420
That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,940
and I got my first bicycle.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,620
The frame is British...

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,860
the gears are French...

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,060
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,420
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,060
- Are you sure it's safe?
- I have new bikes too.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,740
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,660
Fighting men...

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,900
on land, on sea
and in the air...

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,940
Black shirts of the revolution...

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,900
men and women of Italy...

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,780
and the Kingdom of Albania...

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,260
hear this. '

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,460
The hour...

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,900
of decisions from which
there is no return.

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,500
Pino, think this ant knows
he's dead meat?

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,620
Who knows?

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,860
If he's like you,
he doesn't know shit.

33
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,300
Hey, guys!

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,300
Lucky bastard,
he's got a new bicycle!

36
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,860
Man, she's beautiful!

37
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,140
It's almost brand-new.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,140
Custom-made,
just like the racers.

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,100
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

40
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,300
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

41
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,540
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,300
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,220
And you, "Don Sasa"?

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,220
I don't want some kid
poking into our business.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,380
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
She's coming!

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,340
What's going on?

48
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,100
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

49
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,500
Who is she?

50
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,220
The deaf guy's daughter,
our new Latin teacher.

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,420
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

52
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
What I wouldn't give
for an hour with her!

53
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,500
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't... What's her name?

54
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,180
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

55
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,500
The sun is bigger
than the moon.

56
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart? Yes, but hurry.

57
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,620
I love honesty
more than wealth.

58
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,500
- Seven thumbs long!
-Seven and a half thumbs!

59
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,580
- Mine's a bazooka! - I got eight!
- Eight is nothing!

60
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,220
That's just tickling a woman!

61
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,220
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine. Torpedo!

62
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,820
My submarine
will rip Malena in half!

63
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,420
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

64
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,220
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

65
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,940
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

66
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,540
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

67
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,140
And there she was naked as the day
she was born. Holy shit!

68
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,700
She did it on purpose
to excite me.

69
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

70
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,700
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

71
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,500
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

72
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,700
You little runt,
you've been here for two hours,

73
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,660
and you still haven't
measured yourself.

74
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,460
Measure it!

75
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,940
One, two...

76
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,500
three, four, five...

77
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,540
only six!

78
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,900
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

79
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,540
Short pants: short dick!

80
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,820
Fuck off. My thumbs are twice
as big as yours!

81
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,140
Bullshit!

82
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,380
Who's got the biggest dick
now, runt?

83
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,340
You do!

84
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,580
No, I am Il Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

85
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,780
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

86
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,700
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

87
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,500
What cigarettes do you want?

88
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,540
Macedonia Extra.

89
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,660
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

90
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,860
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

91
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,580
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

92
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,660
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

93
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,580
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

94
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,700
- I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

95
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,300
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

96
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,500
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

97
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,500
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

98
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,940
Fine. Who didn't at your age?
Leave him alone!

99
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,940
I know what I'm doing.

100
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,580
And you let your friends
beat you up.

101
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,540
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

102
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,180
But stealing trousers
from your father...

103
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,460
and getting them altered
for yourself is just plain wrong!

104
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,500
But, Papa,
you don't understand!

105
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,300
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

106
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm ashamed
to wear short pants!

107
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,540
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

108
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,580
Enough! He's still a child!
I'll tell our party secretary...

109
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,340
you won't
Let me go to the fascist exercises.

110
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,340
Let's make a deal:

111
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,940
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader"...

112
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,460
then you'll get long pants.
Swear it.

113
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,460
chi...

114
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,580
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

115
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,780
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

116
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,260
She must have somebody on the side...
it's inevitable!

117
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,460
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

118
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,700
Right. Nino brings her from her village
with her ailing father.

119
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,180
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

120
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,580
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone? Not me!

121
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,580
Why don't you let me sit with the others?
You're too young to sit in the adult chair.

122
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,380
- But, son, if you don't know the title, how can
I help you? - It's that pretty, romantic one...

123
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,620
"Ma L'Amore No."

124
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,700
Why didn't you say so?

125
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,740
Ten lire. Pay at the cashier's.
- Don't you test it?

126
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,460
- What for? - It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

127
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,940
Miss Malena,
this heart of mine, on fire...

128
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,540
has written so many letters...

129
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,140
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you

130
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,540
it was only because I didn't want
to do you harm.

131
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,460
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

132
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,460
I want you to know
that this town has many gossips...

133
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,660
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

134
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,300
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.

135
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,980
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

136
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,700
What an ass!

137
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,140
I have to go. I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

138
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,460
So long!
Don't get lost!

139
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,900
little boy, let me get by.

140
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,540
Hey, baby, give a soldier a break!
Mind your own fucking business!

141
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,940
Mr. lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

142
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,500
Good morning, Signora Malena,
are you well?

143
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
How is your father?
May I?

144
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,620
The show's over!
She's gone now!

145
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,180
I forgot the key!

146
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,740
So it's true what people say! I

147
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,940
What's the matter with you? You look so strange.
You've poisoned me with your lies.

148
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,220
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

149
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,300
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

150
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,460
But I've never
done anything wrong.

151
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,180
Liar! I've been following you on my bicycle!
I know where you went. I know everything!

152
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,500
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you! - Liar!

153
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,500
- Amoroso. - Here! - Cali. - Here!
- Costanza. - Here!

154
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,940
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

155
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,220
Can I put mine in her mouth?

156
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,340
Can I put mine between her legs?
Okay, but one at a time!

157
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
You must oil the bike regularly
Don't give me edible oil.

158
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,500
Bullshit, it's oil for machine.

159
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,540
The butter is better.

160
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,340
Why didn't she marry someone from her
own village? I'm sure no one wanted her.

161
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,020
- They say she's a seamstress.
- But she's so vulgar.

162
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,420
My son says she looks fake. My husband
says he wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole.

163
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,620
The Baron Bonta's mistress is much nicer.
At least Gina does everything in the open.

164
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:00,620
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

165
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,900
Malena acts so superior. Like we don't know
what she's up to. Wait and see. She'll get hers.

166
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,580
The headquarters
of the armed forces communicates. '

167
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,620
- It's OK now. - Thank you.

168
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,500
"Our brave and invincible fighting men
have delivered a powerful

169
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,420
blow to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

170
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,540
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality of our forces at the front

171
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,940
all payment of civic pensions
will again be postponed..."

172
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,700
Renato, you've got the biggest gun in the West!
You're going to go bind!

173
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,140
Malena

174
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,220
Right rank!

175
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,220
Eyes front! Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

176
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,300
Have you heard? Malena's husband was killed.
My father told me. He read the telegram.

177
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,060
Malena is available!

178
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:41,620
Comrades of Castelcuto
we are gathered here today

179
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,900
to share in the tragic but honorable mourning
which has struck our town.

180
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,460
To express our deepest condolences
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

181
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:55,940
heroically killed in action
in Northern Africa...

182
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,540
and to his bride Maddalena who, stricken
with grief, unfortunately isn't here with us.

183
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:05,260
But she is with us in spirit
because Sicilian women...

184
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,460
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices...

185
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,380
march shoulder to shoulder
with fighting men.

186
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,420
The martyrdom of our fellow citizen in defense
of his country was not a useless sacrifice.

187
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:30,020
- It. Cadei is so handsome.
- A lucky girl will catch him!

188
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,980
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

189
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,460
Long live Il Duce!

190
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,780
From now on I'll be at your side.
Forever. I promise.

191
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,060
Just give me time to grow up.

192
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,900
Now she'll take a lover for sure!
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

193
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,500
She knows her way
around the block!

194
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,700
Cusimano, the dentist, has gone crazy for her.
One day he was distracted as she walked by...

195
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,980
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

196
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,740
Dentist or not, why haven't we seen her lately?
Guess she's too busy!

197
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,900
They say she's fooling around with a shopkeeper
in Catania with subversive tendencies.

198
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,420
Some say Cusimano,
the dentist.

199
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,980
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

200
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,780
I hear the priest
has received anonymous letters...

201
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,460
saying her lover is this man, that man.
The voice of the people is the voice of God!

202
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,260
I can't talk to anyone
about my persona problems.

203
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,420
They're too intimate.

204
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,700
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.

205
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,180
Every day, I'll light a candle for you.
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

206
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,580
But you must protect Malena Scordia from the town.
Yes, the widow... at least for a few years.

207
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,140
Then I'll take over.

208
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,460
- Do you really want me? -OK, go.

209
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,220
- May I see you today? -I really don't want leave!

210
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,460
- Be quiet! -Just leave!

211
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:16,540
What will we to be? leave her! It will be Ok.

212
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,940
It's a kind of pain. Forgive me.
- Don't you like this movie?

213
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,620
Dam it

214
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,780
I am always at your service.

215
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,020
Renewed condolences, Malena.

216
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,740
What a piece of ass!

217
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,500
Son of a bitch!

218
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,460
You little runt!
Come back here!

219
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,580
Look at me

220
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,580
Where are you going?

221
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,460
Get up, it's late

222
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,260
Renato, get up. It's late.

223
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,740
Monster! You're a fetishist
a sadomasochist, or even worse, a pervert!

224
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,820
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

225
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,500
Shame on you!

226
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,100
- How pretty. Can I keep them?
- You shameless girl!

227
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,900
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

228
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,940
Come here, you little pig!

229
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,460
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

230
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,220
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

231
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,700
- Answer me!
- Okay!

232
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,460
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

233
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,460
Lock me up! I'll show you!

234
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,100
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

235
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,100
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

236
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:16,260
Pietro, he hasn't eaten for three days.
In the Soviet Union, they never eat.

237
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,620
What is this shit? The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

238
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,700
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

239
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,300
Everything they give us is terrible!
Look at these pockets.

240
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,940
They're always ripping open!
This cheap thread doesn't hold the stitches!

241
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,180
The thread isn't the problem!

242
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,060
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

243
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,540
What does that mean?

244
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,740
Do you get it now?
Just as well! Don't fix them.

245
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,940
Sew the pockets closed!
But he'll have no pockets?

246
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,900
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

247
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,380
Lights out!

248
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,980
"...that the weary spirit may ne'er
repose in more restful harbor..."

249
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,020
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone bind.

250
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,420
"While upon women's work
you sat intent...

251
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:15,140
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

252
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,180
was the scented May,
and thus you used to spend your days."

253
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,460
- This child needs air.
- Air? Air.

254
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,660
Dentist

255
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,260
Good morning, Professor.
This letter is for you. It says "urgent."

256
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,940
"You're dishonored.

257
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,140
Your daughter Malena
is sleeping with the whole town."

258
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

259
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,660
It says Malena is a whore with everyone in town!
So there's hope for us too!

260
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,780
Take it back!
I'll bust your ass, Mr. Short Pants!

261
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,420
Tonight was wonderful.

262
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,220
For me too.
I know it's been only ten months since.

263
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,180
But maybe I can see you again.

264
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,620
All right. You win. Tomorrow.
Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

265
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,660
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

266
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,500
Take care of yourself.

267
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,940
So see you tomorrow?

268
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,580
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

269
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,020
What time?

270
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,780
- Good evening, sir. - Good evening, my ass!
How dare you pester my fiancee!

271
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:42,180
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited. You're a liar and a bastard!

272
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,500
Because I'm in uniform,
I cannot retaliate, sir.

273
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,340
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime. Anywhere.

274
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,540
Coward, scoundrel!

275
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,140
Get up. Come here! I'll tear you apart,
you coward!

276
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,060
I'll break you in two!

277
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,620
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

278
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,900
Here's the adulterer!

279
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,380
My wife! - Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

280
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:19,300
With a traitor! You said you wouldn't
touch her with a ten-foot pole!

281
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,780
It's the dentist! I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

282
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,580
And as for you go steal husbands
from your own village, you whore!

283
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,100
Go to the police station

284
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,740
We'll record all in files.

285
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,860
We knew she had one lover,
but two?

286
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:50,060
But where does the dentist fit in?
He fits in between her legs!

287
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,300
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

288
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,980
He never wants
to see his daughter Malena again.

289
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,180
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

290
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,540
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

291
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:11,020
What's the dentist got to do with it, poor guy?
Malena's the whore! She should be taken to court!

292
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,180
That It. Cadei seemed like such a gentleman.
How could he get mixed up in this?

293
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,980
Everyone knows she's a home wrecker.
The lieutenant was asking for it!

294
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,220
will they go to court?

295
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,540
The dentist's wife
accuse her husband's lover.

296
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,020
The dentist needed three stitches in his head.
But the dentist swore at the soldier first.

297
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,620
That's insulting an officer.

298
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,500
They are all bastards.

299
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,020
While we were watching her caboose
the lieutenant and the dentist were riding the train!

300
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,940
Good morning!
Nice to meet you again!

301
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,460
Malena.
Good morning, madam

302
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,340
At your service anytime.

303
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,620
Greeting to you, Malena

304
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,900
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

305
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,460
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

306
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,740
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

307
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,860
May I speak to lawyer Centorbi?
Please have a seat.

308
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,700
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!
Can it be true? Beautiful Madonna!

309
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,220
Have her come in.
Please sit down.

310
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,020
Charmed.

311
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,700
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore...

312
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,380
the widow Scordia called Malena.

313
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,500
She could get two years in prison.

314
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,540
Everything will be fine, trust me.

315
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,900
Please

316
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,260
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

317
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,540
in a secret and amorous relationship
aimed at the breaking up of his family.

318
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,500
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

319
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,220
Yes.

320
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,980
Are you or have you ever been
his fiancee?

321
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,620
Absolutely not.
How could I be engaged to a married man?

322
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,500
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

323
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,460
on his way to your house?
I don't know.

324
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,500
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

325
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,420
Yes, once.

326
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,100
Where?
At my house.

327
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,940
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

328
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,940
How long did he stay?
Not long.

329
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,700
What did you do?
He brought me some medicine for my father.

330
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,820
If it was for your father, why did he bring it to you?
I don't know.

331
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,460
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

332
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,260
He said good-bye and left.

333
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,460
Then why has Cusimano,
a reputable professional...

334
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,740
who, five years ago had the honor
of extracting one of Il Duce's teeth...

335
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:11,580
publicly declare that he is your fiancee?
He made that up. I had nothing to do with it.

336
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,900
Your husband's crazy. What kind
of relationship did you have with It. Cadei?

337
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,300
I'm a widow.

338
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,380
My business and that of Lt. Cadei
are no concern of the law.

339
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,180
All right.

340
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,660
Did you know that, as a result of these affairs
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?
