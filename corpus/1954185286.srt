1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,868
Stand up, asshole.
I don't want any trouble. Leave me alone.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,773
I can kick your ass while you're sitting
down or standing up. It's your call.

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,110
Fuck his shit up, Raymond. Yeah.

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,813
You might remember him
as Bad Ass,

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,283
the bearded hero who stood
up for an elderly gentleman...

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,651
on an S.C. Transit bus...

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,221
and became an overnight
Internet sensation.

8
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,897
Because of his heroic
efforts, Vega was made

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,595
an honorary police
officer this morning.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,646
Mmm. Mmm.

11
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,349
Oh, God,
you're better than an alarm clock, Baxter.

12
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,419
Mmm.
Good boy. Good boy.

13
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,155
Good boy.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

14
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,791
Enough kisses.

15
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,493
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi!

16
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,421
Goddamn.

17
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,224
Hey, okay!

18
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,792
Cut the crap out, boy.

19
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:17,429
No need to get your nuts in my face.
Damn.

20
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,932
You know what?
There's a pharmacy two doors down.

21
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,569
They started selling hearing aids.
You oughta get yourself some.

22
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,537
Having a sale this week
on Depends.

23
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,940
Your chance to stock up
so you don't crap yourself.

24
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,710
Wow, Bernie.
That's the nicest thing you've said to me in three years.

25
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,846
Yeah. You goddamn
welcome. Shit.

26
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,995
Stay in the middle.
That's it.

27
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,998
Watch it. There we go.
Right there.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,734
Defense! Defense!
That's it. That's it.

29
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,503
Stay up there.
That's it. That's it.

30
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,573
Let's go. Let's go to the body now.
Come on.

31
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,875
Do some body work.
Do some body work.

32
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,010
Let's go! Body!

33
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,679
Body. That's it.
That's it. That's it.

34
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,413
That's it. Okay.

35
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,885
All right, Manny. Two jabs and a right hand.
Two jabs and a right hand.

36
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,288
Oh! Oh, shit.

37
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,924
Damn, Manny.
You tore his head off.

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,395
Salts.

39
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,573
Jesus Christ, Frank.
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,975
Come on.

41
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,477
Come on, Raymond.
Hey!

42
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,513
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah. He's okay.

43
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,749
Come on, Raymond.
You all right?

44
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,818
Come on.

45
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,555
I think I'm gonna stick
with Ping-Pong.

46
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,358
No, you'll be all right.

47
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,663
- Round one begins.
- Now, check this out.

48
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,998
Look. Look right there.
Look. See?

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,501
See how he favors
his right?

50
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,502
He does it
every time.

51
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,905
You gotta make him use his left.
That'll open him up.

52
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,274
That's what she said.

53
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,512
Aw, come on, Frank.
We watched this, like, 23 times.

54
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,579
I got this.

55
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,815
Alvarez doesn't have
a chance on Saturday.

56
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,619
But remember, you can--
...never be too prepared.

57
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,454
I know.

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,824
I got something for you.

59
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,862
Oh, Manny, you didn't
have to get me anything.

60
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,665
Just wanna say thank you
for helping me get here.

61
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,401
I never thought I'd have
a chance to turn pro.

62
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,437
Hmm. It's wrapped
and everything, huh?

63
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,106
Shut up.
Just open it.

64
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,577
Oh, man.

65
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,946
Now, what the hell
am I gonna do with this?

66
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,915
Well, I don't know.
How about everything?

67
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,351
It's time you joined
the rest of the world.

68
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,086
Hey. I'm 68 years old.

69
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:57,089
I've gotten along without one of these up until now.

70
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,591
Besides, this must've
cost you a bundle.

71
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,862
How did you afford it?
Just saved up for it.

72
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,799
I gotta jump.

73
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,569
You got a date?
Something like that.

74
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,137
Um, I forgot.

75
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,972
I put something
on there for you.

76
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,109
Just turn it on there
and-- and tap the screen.

77
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,012
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right. Get some sleep.

78
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,154
Hey, Frank.
Pretty nice, huh?

79
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,089
Now you won't have
to freak out anymore

80
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,491
when you can't find
a pay phone.

81
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,761
So I just wanted...

82
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:40,365
to say thank you
for being there for me...

83
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,904
and for believing in me
when nobody else would.

84
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,641
I don't know where I'd be
if it wasn't for you.

85
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,111
You've been like
a second dad to me.

86
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,416
And I love you.

87
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,686
I love you too, mi hijo.

88
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,945
Manny! Hey!

89
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,981
Adolfo. Purvis. Drake.
What's up, brothers?

90
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,951
I just got your text.
Got here as quick as I could.

91
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,052
Came from across town.

92
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:39,458
Oh. Muchas gracias.
I really appreciate that.

93
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,692
So, uh,

94
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,060
maybe you could
help me out here,

95
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,830
but I'm a little confused
about something.

96
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:49,100
Um, have we not
taken care of you?

97
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,103
Yes, of course.
Oh.

98
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,073
So why do you
take from me?

99
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,043
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,277
Come-- Please.

101
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,713
Come on.
Don't insult Adolfo.

102
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,917
Look, I'd rather you stick a
needle in my eye than insult me.

103
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,689
So I'm gonna give you one more
chance to answer correctly.

104
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:15,961
And you'll feel liberated,
which is a wonderful thing to feel, Manny,

105
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,129
before you die.

106
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,945
It's just you and me now.

107
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:44,022
Oh, goddamn it.
Miro la concha de tu hermana.

108
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,057
Seriously?

109
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,727
My bad.

110
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,862
Let's get the hell
out of here.

111
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,897
Look--

112
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,900
Don't just leave him there.
Pick him up!

113
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,202
What the hell
are you thinking?

114
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,290
Hey, Malark.
Come by for a beer?

115
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,725
Frank, I'm sorry.

116
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,594
It's Manny.

117
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,327
They were
two peas in a pod.

118
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,195
I'm sorry?

119
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,931
Manny and his dad.

120
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,667
They were inseparable.

121
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,205
Once his dad passed away,

122
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,608
his world shattered.

123
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,111
And then
you came along.

124
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,980
You changed
his world.

125
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,715
He was a great kid.

126
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,116
Mommy.

127
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,286
Will you play Barbies
with me?

128
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,954
Oh, honey.

129
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,924
Not now, okay?
Maybe later.

130
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:30,095
Hey, you know, I've played
a few Barbies in my day.

131
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,396
Can I play?

132
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,999
Okay, I'll be the purple one?
Mm-hmm.

133
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,667
Okay. Come on.

134
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,135
Is this like
Mermaid Barbie?

135
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,005
Uh-huh.
You want anything?

136
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:45,977
One, two, three, four,

137
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,246
five, six,

138
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,049
seven, eight--

139
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,385
Don't peek! Don't peek!

140
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,354
Okay.
My eyes are closed tight.

141
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,390
Nine, 10.

142
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,792
Here I come,
ready or not.

143
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,162
Where's Julia?

144
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,365
Okay. Where is--
I hear something.

145
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,436
Uh-oh. I hear something.

146
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,138
Where is she?

147
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,407
Where is she?

148
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,009
Ah! There she is.
No fair.

149
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,212
I wouldn't have found you
if you had a secret door.

150
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,716
I want a secret door.
Please!

151
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,751
Well, we'll have
to talk to your mom.

152
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,986
Talk to your mom about what?

153
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,189
A secret door, Mommy.
It's great for hide-and-go-seek.

154
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was the hit of the neighborhood.

155
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,796
Well, that sounds like fun.

156
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,266
Thank you, Mommy!

157
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,409
That's the first time I've seen
her smile since it happened.

158
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,145
That's a wonderful little girl.

159
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,452
You're gonna find the animals who killed my baby,
aren't you?

160
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:04,856
The police are doing everything they-- No, they're not.

161
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,127
Mrs. Parkes-- I know who you are,
Mr. Vega.

162
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,098
What happened to you on that bus wasn't an accident.

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,769
You were meant to do good in
a city that desperately needs it.

164
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:22,507
You know, I-- I've got to go.
I have to-- I have to go.

165
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,909
Good night, Mrs. Parkes.

166
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,340
Hey, Bernie, you all right?

167
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,544
You all right?

168
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,279
Don't you got enough
to worry about...

169
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:38,516
than to come in here
and meddle in my business, huh?

170
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,154
You know,

171
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,857
they got medication
for that problem of yours.

172
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,025
Boy, what you know
about my problem?

173
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,496
I know that you haven't been out
of this place since I've lived here.

174
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,933
They call that
agoraphobia.

175
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,569
I know.
I-- I googled it.

176
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,604
So all of a sudden
you a doctor.

177
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,340
Where you study--
Tijuana Tech?

178
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,145
Why don't you just get yourself
out of here and don't come back.

179
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,546
Go find yourself
another store.

180
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,648
Hands up!

181
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,286
Hey, get the hell out of my
store before I blast all of you!

182
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,888
Feisty old bastard, huh?

183
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,356
We ain't got no money.
Just get out of here.

184
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,925
We'll forget the whole thing ever happened.
Or what?

185
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,460
You're gonna run me over
with your walker?

186
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:26,130
Open the damn register,
Morgan Freeman. Screw you!

187
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,266
You wanna be a hero, too, gramps?
Oh, no.

188
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:32,971
All right, back the fuck up then.
I got you. Okay, okay. Sorry.

189
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,909
Bernie!
Bernie, you all right?

190
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,613
I didn't need your help.

191
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,316
Aw, you could've
fooled me.

192
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,231
All good.
Thank you.

193
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,701
What is it with you
and liquor stores?

194
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,404
It's just not a good mix.

195
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,572
This one wasn't
worth it, is it?

196
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,046
Grumpy old son of a bitch.

197
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,542
If you damn fools would
patrol the neighborhood...

198
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,513
instead of stuffin' your faces
with pastry every now and then,

199
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,148
this crap wouldn't happen!

200
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,684
You heard anything
about Manny?

201
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,720
No. But we know
it was drug related.

202
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,588
No way. Not Manny.
Not drug related.

203
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,993
Frank, we found 300 Hapacol pills on
his body the night that he was killed.

204
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,763
That's five grand street value.
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,300
But it looks like
he was a major seller.

206
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,175
All right, everybody,
listen up!

207
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:20,311
Hey, everybody!

208
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,479
Get in here.

209
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,183
What's up, man?
Come on. Listen up!

210
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,251
If I catch anybody here...

211
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,187
making, selling or using drugs,

212
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:33,291
I will personally break both your
legs and use your arms as crutches.

213
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,560
- Now, do you hear me?

214
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,696
- Now, do you hear me?
- Yes!

215
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,466
Drugs are for losers.

216
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,135
Only winners come in here.

217
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,038
Don't make me say it again.

218
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,440
Tucson, come on.

219
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,752
Sit down.

220
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,224
All right,
let's have it. What?

221
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,725
Don't bullshit me.

222
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,227
How long
was Manny dealing?

223
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,596
I swear, Coach.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

224
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:17,201
Manny would've never got involved in any of that stuff.
You know that.

225
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,639
You better not be lying to me.
I'm not lying.

226
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,676
Go on. Get out of here.
Yes, sir.

227
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,428
Yeah?
Ginobli.

228
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,126
Coach?

229
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,796
Expecting a cold?

230
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,532
Look--
Coach, I can explain, man.

231
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,469
Please don't break my legs.
Please don't break my legs.

232
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,405
How long was Manny selling?
I don't know.

233
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,307
I'm running real thin
on patience.

234
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,379
How long was he selling?
Okay, okay. A few months.

235
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,348
But he was only doing it
to support his family.

236
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,917
He was gonna quit once he turned pro this weekend.

237
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,852
Man, he didn't
want you to know.

238
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,355
He knew how
disappointed you'd be.

239
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,624
And what about you?

240
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,229
Come on.

241
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,231
Where we going?
To see your friends.

242
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,334
Wait, wait. No.
No, I can't, man. They'll kill me.

243
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,369
Uh, no, they won't.
Why not?

244
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,606
Because if you don't take me to 'em,
I will kill you first.

245
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,475
Now come on.

246
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,682
You sure I need
to be here for this?

247
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,551
Step back.

248
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,522
Oh, shit!

249
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,508
Hey, hey, we're pacifists.
And vegans.

250
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,231
No-- No, no.

251
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,548
All right,
listen up, gentlemen.

252
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,584
Anybody in here
tries to get in touch...

253
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,852
with my friend,
Mr. Tucson--

254
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:59,557
either by phone, text,
e-mail or Instagram...

255
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,593
or any other form
of communication--

256
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,962
I'll kill you.

257
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,331
Now, do we understand
each other?

258
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:13,704
Okay. I'll take that as a "Yes,
Mr. Vega, we understand."

259
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:17,508
Come on, Tucson.
Let's go. Coming.

260
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,696
Well, no.

261
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,064
Not exactly
to that extent.

262
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:43,901
But what I can tell you is that
we are making great strides...

263
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:48,706
implementing safety and law enforcement measures to--

264
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,940
How should I say it?

265
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,043
Preserve peace
and extend the lives...

266
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,046
of the citizens
of our great country.

267
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,414
Ah, hijo mío, Adolfo.

268
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,549
I want you to meet the senator
and his lovely wife, Mrs. Raskin.

269
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,453
- This is my son, Adolfo.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Senator. Mrs. Raskin.

270
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:06,824
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to speak to you in private.

271
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,959
Es importante.
Of course.

272
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,663
Please excuse me
for just one moment.

273
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,598
I do apologize.

274
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,906
Shut up!

275
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,656
You've given me
a place to go...

276
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,126
and a reason
to get up in the morning.

277
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:18,429
You've been like
a second dad to me.

278
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,499
And I love you.

279
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,711
Bernie!

280
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,479
Hey, come on! Open up!

281
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,882
I-- I wanna buy a case!

282
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,917
Bernie!

283
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,254
Aw, sh-- Hey!

284
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,923
Come on!
Are you in there?

285
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,192
Bernie!

286
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,629
I'll take my business
somewhere else!

287
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,901
Bitch. Damn.

288
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,046
Hey!

289
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:14,084
One, two, three,
four assholes in front of me.

290
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,922
Five, six--
I'd better find a big stick.

291
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,461
This smart-ass
is him.

292
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,698
Hey. Didn't I beat your ass,
like, a few days ago?

293
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,867
You made a big mistake by coming over.

294
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,937
Next time
I'll bring a dessert.

295
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,674
Smart-ass old bastard.

296
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,709
Hell of a way to go out.

297
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:43,581
You know, your boy Manny,
he went out crying like a little bitch.

298
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,191
Get up!

299
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,535
Clear out, guys.

300
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,076
It's time to meet
your maker, old man.

301
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,245
You okay, Vega?

302
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,882
I didn't need your help.

303
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,252
You could've fooled me.

304
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,056
Come on.

305
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,991
Yeah, here we go.

306
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,913
You broke
my fucking ribs.

307
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,082
Okay, who killed Manny?

308
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,651
Fuck you.

309
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,088
Fuck me?

310
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,299
Who killed Manny?

311
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,370
Stop!

312
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,740
You're a little
sensitive there.

313
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,676
All right, now,
who killed Manny?

314
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,279
Okay!

315
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,914
God-- Stop!

316
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,949
Okay, okay.
It was Adolfo.

317
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:04,421
It was Adolfo.
He ordered the hit.

318
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,358
Where can I find Adolfo?

319
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,994
Fuck you.

320
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,268
Oh, God.

321
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,803
Don't.

322
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,238
I don't know.

323
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,042
I don't know, man.
I don't know. Shit.

324
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,378
I guess he couldn't
take the ribbing.

325
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,917
There were two things
I was good at growing up.

326
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,287
Hockey and fighting.

327
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,623
Hockey?

328
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,693
Yeah, hockey, fool.

329
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,261
You have a problem
with that?

330
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,429
No. I mean,
I just never seen--

331
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:49,933
A black man play hockey?
I had to deal with that shit my whole life.

332
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,301
Nobody wanted to see it,

333
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:57,041
so I had to fight my way all the
way up to the minor leagues.

334
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:01,779
Had at least
two fights a night...

335
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,048
with some honky...

336
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,887
who didn't like colored folks on the ice.

337
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,357
Yeah.

338
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,295
And then the day
I dreamed of finally came.

339
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:22,766
I was gonna get called up
to-- to the big leagues.

340
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:26,036
I was gonna be
the first African-American...

341
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,906
to play in the N.H.L.

342
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,812
And just like that, it was over.

343
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,949
In my final
minor league game...

344
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:39,917
with the Quebec Mounties,

345
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,022
the Cracker brothers blindside
checked me into the boards...

346
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,393
and blew out my knee.

347
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,430
I never played again.

348
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,934
My life was never the same.

349
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,537
At least you walked away
with your health.

350
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,073
Well, I don't--
I don't have that either.

351
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:08,979
Yeah, I've got some rare liver
disease that no one ever heard of.

352
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,013
Doctors are confused.

353
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:14,017
I'm too old to be on
a donor list for a transplant.

354
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:19,957
And, uh--
So I got six months tops.

355
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,059
I'm sorry, Bernie.

356
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,129
What you sorry about?
It wasn't your fault.

357
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:28,265
I'll be fine. Yeah.

358
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:33,237
The way you going,
you'll be dead before me anyhow.

359
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,307
Yeah.

360
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,977
Why'd you help me?

361
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,546
I owed you one.

362
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,349
Now-- Now we're even.

363
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,118
I sure
appreciate it.

364
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,353
And I'm impressed.

365
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,121
You finally got out
of your place.

366
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,158
Yeah, well, it's about time
I changed my life.

367
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,463
Yeah, I figure, what do
I got to lose, right?

368
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,265
Yeah.

369
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,434
Manny was a good kid.

370
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,337
Don't see that
a lot.

371
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,809
So, you gonna find this Adolfo?

372
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,812
Oh, yeah.

373
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,447
Need a hand?

374
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,086
Could always use an extra one.
Good.

375
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,825
So let's go get
those son of a bitches.

376
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,413
Boy, what the hell
you got on?

377
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:27,184
You look like
a Guatemalan tourist.

378
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,921
Well, rather that than a walking billboard for 7UP.

379
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,257
And what you got
in that packet?

380
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,625
Oranges and Chiclets?

381
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,526
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

382
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,996
Here. I got a fanny pack
for you too.

383
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:43,066
Not me. You keep that for yourself.
I ain't putting that on.

384
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,308
Whoo.

385
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,012
Whose is this?

386
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:58,949
It's mine.
Who the hell you think it is?

387
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,619
"Whose is this?"

388
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,693
I would've thought D.M.V. took
away your license by now.

389
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:12,329
They did.

390
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,936
Come on, baby.

391
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,675
Well, what you expect?

392
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:29,246
It's been 25 years since I been down in this shithole.

393
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,269
Goddamn.

394
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:56,606
I've forgotten how uncomfortable the damn city bus is.

395
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,076
Damn hemorrhoids
is flaring up. Shit.

396
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,678
Come on. Come on.
Just walk it off.

397
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,720
Now what, Kojak?

398
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,422
We get 'em
to let us in.

399
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,667
What's next?

400
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:29,773
Uh-- Oh. Here.

401
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,041
Hello.

402
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:38,582
Damn.
Age before beauty.

403
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,053
- What now?

404
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,755
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

405
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,591
No need to always
get violent.

406
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:03,306
Ah. Looks like they knew
you were coming.

407
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,475
What's the next move,
Columbo?

408
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:09,413
Listen, Carmen.
You're gonna help me.

409
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,414
I can't do it, Frank.

410
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,583
The last time I helped you,
it almost cost me my job.

411
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,453
And as of today,
I have 17 years,

412
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,555
62 days, 14 hours,

413
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,090
32 minutes
and 55 seconds...

414
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:24,494
before I retire and receive my
extraordinarily fat pension.

415
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,762
You will not mess that up.

416
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,766
Carmen, sweetheart, look,
you will help me because--

417
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,776
Franklin, don't start nothing you can't finish.

418
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:44,081
You know this booty can go two or
three rounds before I really get started.

419
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,550
And if you're good,
you can bring your friend.

420
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:49,252
I like threesomes.

421
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,389
Carmen.

422
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,726
He was like a son to me.

423
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,631
He was gonna do big things.

424
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,534
They took his life.

425
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,636
I can't let 'em
get away with that.

426
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,473
And neither would you.

427
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,346
I mean it, Frank.
You cannot take any of this stuff out of here.

428
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,814
Don't do like you did
last time.

429
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,383
Do not take
this stuff out of here.

430
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,818
God, I love you,
Carmen.

431
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,787
Well, I'll leave my door open this evening...

432
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,389
so you can show me
just how much you love me.

433
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,192
And bring Green Machine
with you.

434
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,729
I told you
about that outfit.

435
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:38,201
Look. He's got a pickup
from some guy named Hammer.

436
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,669
Yeah, I see.

437
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,205
And here's his address.

438
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,508
Hmm.

439
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:26,449
Holy shit. Hey, fellas,
this is E.B.M., not A.A.R.P.

440
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,585
We're looking
for Hammer.

441
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,689
He's busy right now.

442
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,691
Well, you best tell us
where he is...

443
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,195
before I put my foot
up your ass.

444
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,198
I thought you said there was no need for violence.

445
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,800
Different situation,
different measures.

446
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,435
Listen, Social Security.

447
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,939
This is a fraternity rush party for freshman students...

448
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,575
in the year 2014,
not 1932.

449
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,678
So if I were you,
I would get the hell off my property...

450
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,280
before I put my foot
up your ass.

451
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,919
Where's Hammer?

452
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,789
Okay, okay, okay.
He's, uh-- He's-- He's--

453
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,960
Upstairs, third floor,
room five. Room five!

454
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:13,730
See? It wasn't
that hard, was it?

455
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,318
Fuck off! I'm busy!

456
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,723
I'm here for a pickup!

457
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,293
Screw you!

458
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,496
What the hell?

459
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,632
- You Hammer?
- Get the hell out of here!

460
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,008
Hey, little lady.
What's your major?

461
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,619
Where can I find Adolfo?

462
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:43,753
Fuck you.

463
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:47,457
Didn't anybody teach you
to respect your elders?

464
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,001
Okay.

465
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,938
Let's take a little off the top.
Where can I find Adolfo?

466
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,810
So I'll probably score a double
major and graduate in five.

467
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,712
I mean,
what's the rush, right?

468
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:12,015
The real world's
not going anywhere.

469
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,018
I couldn't agree
with you more.

470
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,786
I'd do the same thing.

471
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,757
Don't! Help!

472
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,592
Okay, okay, okay.

473
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,061
He has a beach-- He has a beach house in Malibu.

474
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,965
- Okay. Where in Malibu?
- I don't know!

475
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,033
Okay.

476
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,970
No! It's called--

477
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,772
It's called Villa Costa
or some shit.

478
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,775
But he's only there on weekends.
Just stop!

479
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,548
Nice cut.
Mazeltov.

480
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,551
Give me that.

481
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,863
Hey, Bernie!

482
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,564
I like you, Bernie.

483
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,834
I like you in that "I've never had a father figure,

484
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,870
so now I'm trying
to overcompensate...

485
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,506
by getting with an older man" type of way.

486
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:12,409
Bernie, let's go!

487
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,077
Okay!

488
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,947
I'm sorry.

489
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,417
I gotta run,
Jessica.

490
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,152
Oh, so soon?

491
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,090
Well, Facebook me!

492
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,454
We got big issues.

493
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,656
You're interrupting Adolfo
during his me time.

494
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,957
Not in the mood
for issues, Big Black.

495
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,895
And you know I wouldn't if it wasn't important,
but this shit's important.

496
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,163
Okay. Come on.
Out with it.

497
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:11,701
Looks like one of our highest profiting
distributors just shut down today.

498
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,235
Sorry?

499
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:15,104
That old dude came in and
kicked the shit out of everybody.

500
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,106
What old dude?
You know.

501
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,875
The old dude.
Bad Ass.

502
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,611
I thought
we had eliminated him.

503
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,979
We almost did.

504
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,082
Then some other old dude
came in and--

505
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,851
What? Came in and what?

506
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,552
Came in and kind of
kicked all our asses.

507
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:34,858
Excuse me? You're saying a couple of
old dudes beat the shit out of our guys?

508
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,759
Yeah. But they're not
your typical old guys.

509
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,595
Trust me.
They're more like bad asses.

510
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,763
I don't fucking care
who they are!

511
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,571
Okay, well,
this is simple.

512
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,707
If you can't take out
a couple of geriatrics,

513
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,976
then I'll bring in
someone else who will.

514
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,845
And then I'll
have them kill you.

515
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,580
That sound fair? Huh?

516
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,250
Now, you're cutting
into my seaweed-wrap hour,

517
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:03,086
so get the fuck
out of my face.

518
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,999
Hey. Did somebody call
for a secret door?

519
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,601
Yay!

520
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:23,306
So I put all your apps
in their own personal folder.

521
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,842
- What's that?
- The family tracker app.

522
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,277
I linked it
with my mom's phone...

523
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,879
so you can always know
that we're safe and sound.

524
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,950
My brother used
to do that with us.

525
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,823
Look, your brother
really loved you,

526
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:46,729
and just because you can't see
him doesn't mean he's not here.

527
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,931
So you got to remember...

528
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,867
that no matter what you do
or where you go,

529
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:54,003
he'll always
be watching over you.

530
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,940
Really?

531
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,775
Really.

532
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,310
Knock, knock.

533
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:01,878
Hey there.

534
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,981
I thought you two might be thirsty.
Perfect.

535
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,650
So, how's it coming along?

536
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,686
We're ready
for the big unveiling.

537
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,688
Come on.
Ooh!

538
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,023
Voilà!
Oh, wow!

539
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,758
It's so cool!
I love it.

540
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,962
I exactly know where I'm gonna put my Barbie jumper,

541
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:21,965
my American Girl
and my Blue's Clues!

542
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:25,134
So cool.

543
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,006
Okay, you've got
a broken head gasket,

544
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:34,877
three dead spark plugs,
a busted radiator and no gas.

545
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,380
- And what about this gun?
- Boy, put that back.

546
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:41,217
I'm not even sure
that thing even works anymore.

547
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,219
Yeah, that's what she said.

548
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,225
Okay, so besides
everything you said,

549
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,159
what kind
of shape's it in?

550
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:55,231
Look, Coach, it's a lot of work.
It's gonna take some time.

551
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,867
Well, get to it.

552
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:01,104
Yeah. Get to it.

553
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,240
I guess I'll get to it.

554
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,386
Yeah, I don't get it.

555
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:17,787
What's that?

556
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,256
That-- That's not a child.

557
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,860
I mean, why you putting
that dog in a day care?

558
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:26,863
Well, Baxter's more
than just a dog.

559
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,131
He's my best friend.

560
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,267
Best friend, my ass. In Korea,
they'd be eatin' him right now.

561
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,137
Don't listen
to him, Baxter.

562
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,772
He's got
emotional issues.

563
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:39,175
Yeah, that's for sure.

564
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,177
Aw, shit.

565
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,912
Ooh.

566
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,717
You all right?

567
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,253
Yeah, I'm fine.

568
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:53,156
Lasts a couple of minutes,

569
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:56,459
then--
I'm good as new. Okay.

570
00:44:56,461 --> 00:45:02,298
You know, they got people all over that'll...
donate like a...

571
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,368
kidney or lung
or something, man.

572
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,870
Man, I'll give you
a piece of my liver.

573
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,073
Who you-- You kidding?

574
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:13,443
Yeah, you think I want
a 69-year-old...

575
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,079
tequila-soaked organ
of yours?

576
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:19,916
And forget about six months.
I'll be dying in six weeks.

577
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,928
You okay?
What?

578
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,431
Baxter.

579
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,284
Yeah.

580
00:45:55,286 --> 00:46:00,089
If it's any consolation,
mine looks worse.

581
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,258
This is all that's left.

582
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,394
Drink up.

583
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,266
Yeah.

584
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,903
I'm assuming you got some good insurance coverage.

585
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,973
I got insurance.
I don't know how good.

586
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:19,909
What are you doin',
Frank?

587
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:21,911
Hey.

588
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,948
I'm not in the mood for a Malark lecture right now.
All right?

589
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,449
Oh, yeah?

590
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,852
Well, the people you're dealing
with are extremely dangerous.

591
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:32,121
You're lucky you weren't here when it happened.

592
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,991
Not to mention
those kids.

593
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,159
It's a sign, Frank.

594
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:39,428
Leave it alone and let Homicide deal with it.

595
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,497
Actually, Officer,

596
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,332
it was my fault.

597
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,400
Excuse me?

598
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:48,871
Uh, yeah.
You see, it was my idea.

599
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,309
And my man Frank here,
he was just along for the ride.

600
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,214
Are you kidding me?
You're teaming up with the grumpy old man?

601
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,016
I'm not that grumpy.

602
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:02,185
He's gotten less grumpy.
Okay.

603
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,953
Just lay off the case.
You hear me?

604
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:08,291
I don't wanna hear about you guys stepping
anywhere near it. You understand?

605
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,330
You fellas need
a place to stay?

606
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,266
No.
No, we're all right.

607
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,939
It's okay.
¡Ay, Dios mío!

608
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,540
Frank!

609
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,210
Are you okay?
Yeah.

610
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,011
He's Bernie.
Bernie.

611
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,346
Hey. Rosaria.

612
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

613
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,588
All right.
There you go.

614
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,358
I'm gonna bring in some extra blankets
'cause it gets colder in this room.

615
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,594
A bunk bed?
You gotta be sh--

616
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:46,262
You know what?
This is great.

617
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:48,631
Thank you so much for bringing us in.
Are you kidding?

618
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,100
It'll be nice to have
a little company around here.

619
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,436
Not to mention how much I
appreciate what you both are doing.

620
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,744
All right. Looks like
I'll take the top bunk

621
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:58,074
'cause I don't want your
butt falling on me.

622
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:01,177
Make sure they use the gate
for safety.

623
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,378
Don't need a gate.

624
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,447
Slept in a bunk or two
in my day.

625
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,983
They had bunk beds
back then?

626
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,154
All right, little lady.

627
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:15,458
So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

628
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,472
Hey, Bernie.
You up?

629
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,142
No.

630
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:37,413
You know, I can keep doing this thing.
You don't have to--

631
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:42,985
Boy, you better shut your mouth
before I cold cock your ass.

632
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,990
Good night, John-boy.

633
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,260
Shut up.

634
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,177
Rise and shine, boys.

635
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,213
Jules, honey, don't.
Let them sleep.

636
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,982
I'm so sorry.

637
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:16,085
Bernie,
how'd you end up there?

638
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,089
I don't know.

639
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,058
I must have fell.

640
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,193
Told ya
you needed the gate.

641
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:27,129
- Okay, honey. Come on.

642
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,332
Sorry, guys.

643
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,581
You all right?
Doesn't that liver ever give you a break?

644
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,283
It's not my liver.

645
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:50,252
I had some of Rosaria's
leftovers this morning...

646
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:54,056
and I've been pissin'
out my ass ever since.

647
00:49:54,692 --> 00:50:00,196
I don't know if I'll be able to do
that beach house thing with ya.

648
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,098
I gotta get to
a bathroom,

649
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,034
and I'm gonna be there
for a long time.

650
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:10,039
We'll find you a bathroom.
Just don't do it here. Don't do it here.

651
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,655
You all right?
Yeah.

652
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,476
Can I help you?

653
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,545
Oh, hey.

654
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:54,550
Yeah, I was supposed to meet my friend here.
Guess he hasn't made it home yet.

655
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,652
Resident's name?

656
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,155
Uh, Adolfo Herrera.

657
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:00,689
You look familiar.

658
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:03,159
Yeah, I been here
a couple times.

659
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,861
No, no, no. From someplace else.
TV or somethin'.

660
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:09,665
Are you an actor?
Who, me?

661
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,500
Are you kiddin'?
Wish I was.

662
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,236
Those guys make all the dough, huh?
Tell me about it.

663
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,945
I've got a cousin,
he shot one of those

664
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:19,675
insurance commercials.
Took in five figures.

665
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,111
He worked one day.
Can you believe that shit?

666
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:26,582
Meanwhile, I'm driving around in this
piece of crap for 10 bucks an hour.

667
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,684
Sucks balls.

668
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,154
Anyway, if no one's
comin' to let you in,

669
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,823
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

670
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:35,825
He told me to wait
for him out front.

671
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,694
I'm sorry.
It's homeowners' rules.

672
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:43,199
Well, rules were
made to be broken.

673
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,362
Shh. I'm not gonna hurt you.

674
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,235
Who the fuck are you?

675
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:56,438
I told you
I didn't want to fight.

676
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,606
Bad Ass!

677
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,713
What do you want?

678
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,249
You killed my friend
Manny Parkes.

679
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:09,752
How do you want to die,
motherfucker?

680
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:11,353
Oh, finally...

681
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,890
I get the pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Señor Vega.

682
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,701
I didn't order the hit.

683
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,405
- Who did?
I don't know.

684
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:31,674
Freeze!

685
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,711
Back away, Vega.

686
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:43,352
I'm really sorry to barge in here, Mr.
Herrera. The side door was open.

687
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:44,553
You done good,
Steven.

688
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,690
Really? 'Cause I was
hoping for a raise.

689
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,792
Hey, hey! Hey!

690
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,727
Don't push it.

691
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,863
Now,

692
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,700
as for you,
Señor Vega--

693
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:03,439
I don't appreciate you barging
into my place of residence.

694
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,512
I'm a-- I'm a recluse,
you know.

695
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,382
I'm not big on visitors.

696
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,884
But you can relate.
Right?

697
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:18,854
So, my friend,

698
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,889
I'm gonna have to
say good-bye.

699
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,400
If I were you, asshole,
I'd step the hell back.

700
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:34,870
Actually, I think you better
step the hell back.

701
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:41,744
You motherfucker!
Oh, you motherfucker!

702
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,985
Now, where were we?
Who made the hit?

703
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,721
My father,
you fuckin' asshole!

704
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,323
My father.
Okay, good.

705
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:57,893
Now that we're seein' eye to eye,
where can we find him?

706
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,029
The consulate!

707
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:03,666
- What consulate?
- The fuckin' Argentinean consulate!

708
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:07,536
A lot of security at them consulates, Frank.

709
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,806
My uncle used to work at
the Uganda consulate.

710
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,409
They ran that joint
like Fort Knox.

711
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,077
Where else can we find him?

712
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,745
I don't know.

713
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,049
Well, then text him!

714
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:24,586
Are you fucking insane?
You want me to set up my own father?

715
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:25,487
Yeah.

716
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,757
Text him now.
Oh, shit!

717
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,907
Buenos tardes, señores.
Care to sit?

718
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,577
If I wasn't
an officer of the law,

719
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,679
I would kill you right now.

720
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:55,517
Well, that never stopped
the rest of the L.A.P.D.

721
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,619
You have the right
to remain silent.

722
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:01,023
Anything you say can be held
against you in a court of law.

723
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,093
It's never going to stick,
gentlemen.

724
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,996
You have the right
to an attorney.

725
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,632
Leave a nice tip.

726
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,809
We got him.

727
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,711
Thank you.

728
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,683
Can we go to Chuck E. Cheese?

729
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,452
Can we go to Chuck E. Cheese?
Please? Please?

730
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:33,956
Sure.
Of course we can. Sure.

731
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,980
Thanks, Uncle Frank.
That was so much fun.

732
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:01,717
Hey, that was so much fun
we're gonna do it again.

733
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,118
I want you to have this.

734
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,888
Oh, wait. You won that.
That's yours.

735
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:11,627
I know. That's why I want you to have it.
It can keep you safe and sound.

736
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:16,098
Oh, it's beautiful.
I'll never take it off.

737
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:21,637
It was so sudden.

738
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:25,507
He had been complaining of
chest pains earlier in the day,

739
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:29,144
and then three hours later
he had a heart attack.

740
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:32,648
I'm so sorry.
He was so young.

741
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,016
Yeah.

742
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:36,585
It was toughest on the kids.

743
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:40,689
Thank goodness for work.
Kept my mind off things.

744
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,826
What exactly do you do?

745
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:47,663
Residential real estate.
I can help you buy your next home.

746
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,965
Boy, I'm sure
in the market for one.

747
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,237
What about you?

748
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,473
What did you do
before all this?

749
00:57:57,475 --> 00:58:00,142
I owned a hot dog cart.

750
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,078
A hot dog cart?
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

751
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,582
Same location
for almost 40 years.

752
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:09,084
And then Baxter got cancer,

753
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:12,588
and I sold the house
to pay for his treatments.

754
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,058
With the money left over,
I bought the center.

755
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,294
Well, the kids absolutely
adore you there.

756
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,030
Well, they're great kids.

757
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:28,070
Manny was the closest thing
I ever came to having a son.

758
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,207
I know, Frank.

759
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:35,110
There was
a strong connection.

760
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:36,979
Same with Julia.

761
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:40,015
You have a wonderful
little girl there.

762
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,851
Oh, man.
She is a pistol, right?

763
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,255
And she's only five.
I can't imagine her at 16.

764
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:50,559
Boys don't stand a chance.

765
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:57,799
You're a very special man,
Frank Vega.

766
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:00,669
You have
a genuine spirit.

767
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,838
People gravitate to it.

768
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,773
Me included.

769
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:09,745
Well, you know, I just--
I try to do the right thing.

770
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:14,016
Well, then the right thing
would be to kiss me.

771
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:24,660
Never mind me.
I'm just lookin' for some fro-yo.

772
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:30,699
So you are covered-- water damage,
fire damage and electrical.

773
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,702
And we'll also cover the expenses
of a temporary new space...

774
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,037
until the renovation
is complete.

775
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,140
So I won't have to pay a thing?
No, you're covered.

776
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,943
- Vega, you got a minute?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

777
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,412
I don't have to pay a dime.
Fully covered.

778
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:47,015
Hey, that's great, Frank.
Congratulations.

779
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,650
But listen, Frank.

780
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:49,952
They let Herrera go.

781
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,020
- What?
- He's an untouchable.

782
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,221
He's got
diplomatic immunity.

783
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:58,760
You mean he can murder somebody,
deal drugs in our neighborhood,

784
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,162
and they let him go?

785
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,296
You got any real proof?

786
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:04,066
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
How could you let him go?

787
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,802
I've made my peace that you're
gonna do whatever you want.

788
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,370
God knows you're not
gonna listen to me.

789
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:12,240
But this thing-- Unless you have
undeniable concrete proof,

790
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:14,109
this guy's never
gonna go to jail.

791
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,044
It's a no-win.

792
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:20,282
You hear what I'm sayin', Frank?
It's a no-win.

793
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:37,065
Looks like your boy
brought himself some protection.

794
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,638
Follow that Escalade.

795
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,412
You bring your wallet?

796
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:50,979
Yeah.

797
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:55,384
Good.
'Cause I think this shit's gonna be expensive.

798
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,366
Meat packing?

799
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,869
What the hell
is Herrera doing here?

800
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:18,073
We're gonna find out.
But first pay the man.

801
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:19,975
Hey!

802
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,277
- What do I owe you?
- 83.85.

803
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,112
Jesus Christ!

804
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,682
Wait here.
Okay.

805
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,383
Thank you.

806
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:56,812
Bring it over here.

807
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:01,383
No, you gotta pick 'em up--
You gotta pick 'em up.

808
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,752
There.

809
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,845
What the hell
we doing, man?

810
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,047
Oh, shit. Wait.

811
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:34,282
What's wrong?

812
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:37,085
Nothin'.
Just-- Just keep goin'.

813
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:07,415
Boy, we ain't got no time
for checkin' inventory.

814
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,923
Check this out.

815
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,394
They were importing the stuff
through the meat.

816
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:23,398
Straight from Argentina
into our neighborhood.

817
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,134
Has a bill, has a--

818
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,506
What, uh--
What are you doing?

819
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,144
Uh, good day, gentlemen.

820
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,079
I'm Agent Black,
this is Agent Brown...

821
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:42,150
from the F.D.A.-C.D.A.
Health Commission.

822
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,387
We've been here
all of 15 minutes...

823
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:50,592
and we've discovered two severe health code violations.

824
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:53,161
You wanna tell me
how you got in here?

825
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,563
Boy, don't worry about
how we got in.

826
01:03:54,565 --> 01:04:00,302
If I were you,
I'd worry about how we shut this toxic shithole down.

827
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,871
Now go get your supervisor
for me.

828
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:07,108
And if I were you,
I'd show me a fuckin' badge.

829
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,447
Mr. Brown,
show him the badge.

830
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,915
What?

831
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,116
Just show it to him.

832
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:18,987
Badges? We don't need
no stinkin' badges.

833
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,394
What the hell type of answer was that?
I didn't know what to say!

834
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:30,565
It's called improvising. You'd better learn
how to do it 'fore you get us both killed.

835
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,100
You'd better learn
to shut your mouth!

836
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:36,972
Is that the kind of respect I get for helpin' your ass?
I don't need your help!

837
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:39,441
We give up!

838
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,048
So what time is dinner
being served?

839
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,053
I can't imagine
it's gonna be chicken.

840
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,356
Why have chicken...

841
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:58,059
when you Americans
love my fresh meat?

842
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,596
You gentlemen
just don't give up, do you?

843
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,498
That's commendable.

844
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,301
But I told you
it wouldn't stick.

845
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,669
Yeah, it's gonna stick.

846
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:11,406
Oh, you see,
that's where you are wrong, Mr. Vega.

847
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:15,043
I am what you might call
untouchable.

848
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:18,346
I can do whatever I want
in your pathetic country.

849
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:22,384
If I want to go 120 down P.C.H.,
I can do that.

850
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:28,456
If I want to sell drugs to the neighborhood,
I can do that.

851
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,258
If I want to kill...

852
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,195
one of my dealers
who's stealing from me,

853
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,135
well,

854
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,237
you know I can do that.

855
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,371
So what you're saying...

856
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:47,342
is that you're just
a low-life drug dealer.

857
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,587
I'm an entrepreneur.

858
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,459
I'm building an empire
for my family,

859
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,195
just like
your beloved Kennedys.

860
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:10,198
They made their millions
bootlegging alcohol.

861
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,634
I'm doing the same thing,
but with drugs.

862
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,669
Es lo mismo.

863
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:18,640
The only difference is
I'm above the law.

864
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:26,581
You see?
Untouchable.

865
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,183
Now,

866
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:31,686
you and I have
a little score to settle.

867
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,725
Replace the inventory
you destroyed,

868
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:41,129
or pay me one-quarter million dollars in damages.

869
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,199
Reach into my fanny pack
and get my checkbook.

870
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,438
Mi abuelo
had an old saying--

871
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,641
"Un testiculo
por un testiculo."

872
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:55,744
Now,

873
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:59,447
I know it's similar to
the "eye for an eye" thing,

874
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,717
but it's more graphic,
more relatable.

875
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,488
And besides,
I just like it better.

876
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,056
So...

877
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:11,659
in exchange for you
taking something from me,

878
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:15,096
I'm going to take
something from you.

879
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,365
Sound fair?

880
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,301
My people
on the inside...

881
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:25,707
tell me you've become pretty
close with Manny Parkes's mom.

882
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,077
Yeah.

883
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,312
I find that very sweet.

884
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:33,214
I don't know
what you're talking about.

885
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,550
Oh, but you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

886
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,486
Leave her out of this.
She's got nothing to do with it.

887
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:41,790
She has everything
to do with this.

888
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,530
Just like clockwork.

889
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:50,765
Unfortunately,
I must leave.

890
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:55,270
But I'm sure you'll find you're in good
hands with these two gentlemen.

891
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:59,808
Let's make it real cozy
for them, guys.

892
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,744
Drop it down
to three degrees.

893
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,647
Caballeros.

894
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,384
I bid you adiós.

895
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,425
"'I love to hear the wind,'
Patty says."

896
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:21,896
"'And I love how things look beautiful in the rain,'
says Alice."

897
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,599
"'Well, I love snowflakes,'
says Jasmine."

898
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:29,604
"'When I watch them float around,
I want to dance.'"

899
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,307
Did you just read that?

900
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,609
Yes, I did.

901
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:38,580
You, mi chica,
continue to amaze me.

902
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,687
Uh, stay here, honey.
Okay?

903
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:08,176
Get the fuck up and check
the rest of the house!

904
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,616
Shit.

905
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:17,485
Christ!

906
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,387
Shit don't look good.

907
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:22,257
There's gotta be a way outta here.
Yeah.

908
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:28,863
Not until we freeze over and they slide
our asses out in one big ice cube.

909
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:33,868
Oww!

910
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,504
Yeah, that c-c-cold hurts,
don't it?

911
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,706
No.

912
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,241
I cut myself.

913
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:43,244
With what?
With Julia's bracelet.

914
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:46,481
Th-Th-The charms
are as sharp as razors.

915
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,353
Hey. Hey.

916
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,893
No!

917
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:02,597
You've made progress,
but still not enough.

918
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:05,433
You still want it?

919
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,451
Damn Mexican MacGyver!

920
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,753
Hang on, buddy.
Hang on.

921
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,689
Hurry up, man.

922
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:30,825
My left nut is frostbit.
Shit.

923
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,432
Okay, guy. Ready?

924
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,502
Oh, shit.

925
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,438
All right, man.

926
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,906
You got it. You got it.

927
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,641
Oh, shit.
You all right?

928
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:51,913
Okay-- Oh, sh-- Whoo.

929
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,282
It's just my fake hip.

930
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,017
I gotta realign it.

931
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,589
Yeah. All right.
I'm okay.

932
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,725
All right, let's go.

933
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,442
Out cold, bitches.

934
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,445
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

935
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:36,624
You made him wait?
You a clever Mexican, man!

936
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,059
Yeah, and you're
gonna pay, bitch.

937
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:41,763
Hey, hey, you--
you taco-eatin' motherf--

938
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:50,738
I'm really sorry things ended up the way they did,
Señora Parkes.

939
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,374
Especially with your son.

940
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:57,078
But it's time for
a new chapter in your life.

941
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,782
I think you'll make somebody
very happy in Argentina.

942
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:05,687
Or the Middle East.
I hear they go crazy for Latinas. Who knew?

943
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:18,633
Julia! Julia!

944
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,503
Rosaria! Julia!

945
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,639
Julia!

946
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,045
Julia! Julia!

947
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:34,916
Help! Help!
Help! Help!

948
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:35,950
Ooh. Oh, baby.

949
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,354
Oh-oh! Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. It's all right.

950
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:43,424
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

951
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,394
I heard
a few different voices.

952
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,497
They made a lot
of scary noises...

953
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:52,100
and took Mommy
with them.

954
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,803
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We're gonna find your mommy.

955
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:58,873
They could be anywhere
by now, Frank.

956
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,977
You can always find her
on your phone.

957
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,580
What? Remember?
Let me show you.

958
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:07,682
Oh!

959
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,884
That's right!

960
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,792
You're a good neighbor,
Diane.

961
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,994
It's okay.
Don't worry, Mr. Vega.

962
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,496
She's in good hands.

963
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:23,531
Yeah, I know.
Thank you so much.

964
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:26,401
You'll be all right.
Okay, sweetheart?

965
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,139
Please bring back
my mommy.

966
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,008
I promise.

967
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,880
Come on.

968
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,550
Hey-hey! Hey!

969
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,885
What happened to the cab?

970
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,788
Are you kiddin'?
That was a $90 fare.

971
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,756
I couldn't afford to
keep it here any longer.

972
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,192
How we supposed to get there now?
I didn't see you--

973
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,128
Someone call for a Bronco?

974
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:00,101
They're heading
towards the mountains.

975
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,936
Doesn't this thing
go any faster?

976
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,605
You're lucky
this thing even runs.

977
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:14,482
We fuckin' hired
the dumbest people.

978
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:16,484
Shit!

979
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:21,222
Oh, you stupid
motherfucker.

980
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,057
Vega and his fuckin' buddy
got away.

981
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,725
We need to find them
before they find us,

982
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:28,162
and we gotta figure out what the
fuck we're gonna do with her.

983
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,997
Put Drake in the sky.

984
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,741
We getting close?

985
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,977
I can't tell.
There's three dots on the screen.

986
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,147
- I don't know which is which.
- Just pick one.

987
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:52,220
There they are!
Stay on their tail!

988
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,160
What the hell?

989
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:03,064
They got a ghetto bird
after us!

990
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,100
- Damn!
- Hold on.

991
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:17,011
I knew the four-wheel drive
would come in handy one day.

992
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:30,691
Shit!
Where'd those old bastards go?

993
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:37,732
D.M.V. don't know shit!

994
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,133
This boy's
got mad skills!

995
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,170
Hold on, baby.
We're goin' suicide!

996
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,807
Oh, shit!

997
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:56,217
Ain't no 20-year-old
got reflexes like that.

998
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:11,532
All right, let's see 'em follow us through this.
Oh, yeah.

999
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:26,213
Yeah! I think
we lost those assholes!

1000
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,018
Oh, shit!

1001
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:35,222
We gotta shake 'em off!

1002
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,825
Where the hell you get that?

1003
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:40,761
Parting gift
from The Expendables.

1004
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,299
Ah! Take that!

1005
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,368
How you like us now,
bitch?

1006
01:16:50,673 --> 01:16:55,042
Did I ever tell you I really like that fanny pack?

1007
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,387
Mama always said,
no driving like a maniac 30 minutes after you eat.

1008
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:09,690
- Here.
Okay.

1009
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,225
You all right?

1010
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:13,260
I don't how much
longer I got,

1011
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:18,899
but if I'm gonna go out,
I'm gonna go out in style.

1012
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:36,050
There they are.

1013
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,889
I think they're on us.
What?

1014
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:45,159
Goddamn it!
This motherfucker won't stop!

1015
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,329
Pull up next to him!

1016
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:52,867
Come on!
Go, go, go!

1017
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,335
- Shoot him!

1018
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,804
Son of a bitch!
Shit. Come on! Catch him!

1019
01:17:56,806 --> 01:18:00,174
- Come on! Catch up to him!
- I ain't gettin' my ass shot at again.

1020
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:05,079
- I said catch 'em!
- You a mean son of a bitch. You know that?

1021
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:23,097
Shit!

1022
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,710
Hey, you fuckin' pussy!
I got a fuckin' ice pick in my eye!

1023
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:39,013
So suck it up and let's get the hell out of here!

1024
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:40,247
Hey, muchachos.

1025
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:43,250
I call shotgun!

1026
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,930
Hey. Hey.

1027
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:58,165
Hey! Hey!

1028
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,801
Where is she?

1029
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:04,872
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

1030
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:07,942
and then this finger
is goin' in your good eye.

1031
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:12,279
- No, no! Okay! Okay.
- Okay. Shit.

1032
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,085
Hola, hijo.

1033
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,987
It's me. Vega.

1034
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,957
I got your boy.

1035
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:25,926
What do you want?

1036
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,295
An even trade.
Rosaria for your son.

1037
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:33,134
Meet me at the Elysian Park
helipad in an hour.

1038
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:35,770
Just you and her.

1039
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:36,837
Bring anybody else,

1040
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:40,341
and you'll never see
your little "mi hijo" again.

1041
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:04,498
He's gonna be
a no-show.

1042
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,234
Would you leave your kid
high and dry?

1043
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:11,438
If he was a scum-sucking
son of a bitch, I would.

1044
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:18,379
Guess he didn't want to miss out
on his Father's Day gift, huh?

1045
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,036
You've got bolas, Vega.
I like that.

1046
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:45,506
I might have some opportunities for you,
my friend.

1047
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,575
Could be
very rewarding.

1048
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:48,843
Where is she?

1049
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:51,512
Wanting to get
right down to business.

1050
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,447
I respect that.

1051
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:59,186
Hey! Take it easy!

1052
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,555
Your turn.

1053
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:11,932
Had an accident
on the way.

1054
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:14,501
You might want
to mop him up.

1055
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:16,904
That's embarrassing.

1056
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:18,372
Okay. On three.

1057
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,307
One, two, three.

1058
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:25,446
It's gonna be all right.

1059
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:29,016
- Someone's in the back!
- Adiós, señor Vega.

1060
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:00,047
Shit still works.

1061
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:01,649
Huh.

1062
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,553
So, what are you
gonna do now, Vega?

1063
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:09,690
You can't put me in jail.
I'll be out within an hour.

1064
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:12,993
And we all know
you can't just shoot me.

1065
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,429
I'm a diplomat,
for Pete's sake.

1066
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:19,633
But... I do know
you can fight.

1067
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:22,102
Just like
your boy Manny.

1068
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:25,005
You would've been
so proud of him.

1069
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:29,176
But in the end,
he was no match for my men.

1070
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,321
Frank!

1071
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:41,922
Frank, stop!

1072
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,566
Hey! Drop it!

1073
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,614
Not bad, Vega,

1074
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,551
for un viejo conchudo.

1075
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:17,157
Come on, Vega!
Show me something!

1076
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,664
Yeah!

1077
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,202
It's my turn now,
bitch!

1078
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,728
That's for Manny, puto.

1079
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,264
Somebody...

1080
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:59,266
please call...

1081
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:01,468
ambulance.

1082
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:29,663
All right, drop your weapons!
Everybody put your hands on your head!

1083
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,236
Little late, aren't ya?

1084
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,638
Sorry. AT&T.

1085
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,275
I didn't get your text until 10 minutes after you sent it.

1086
01:24:41,277 --> 01:24:44,545
Don't matter
if it's AT&T or Verizon.

1087
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,547
The police don't show up
for shit.

1088
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:49,283
They got their heads
so far up their asses...

1089
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:52,152
worrying about black men
jaywalking in white neighborhoods,

1090
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:57,791
they don't have time to worry
about serious crap like this.

1091
01:24:57,793 --> 01:25:01,128
I thought you said
he was less grumpy.

1092
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,429
He is.

1093
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,597
Frank, where's Julia?

1094
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,533
She's safe and sound.
She's with Diane.

1095
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:09,703
Thank you, Frank.
Thank you.

1096
01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:14,141
He's dead.

1097
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:16,243
Huh.
Well, goddamn then!

1098
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:17,845
Looks like I found me
a liver.

1099
01:25:17,847 --> 01:25:19,680
Hey, fellas,
just don't stand there.

1100
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:22,382
Hurry up
and get that shit on ice!

1101
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,726
All right, honey,
time for bed.

1102
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:34,461
Good night,
little one.

1103
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:37,364
Good night, big one.

1104
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,400
Mommy?
Yeah?

1105
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:45,305
How do we work it out for Frank to stay here forever?

1106
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,875
Um--

1107
01:25:47,877 --> 01:25:50,177
Go to sleep, sweetie.
Okay?

1108
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,546
Okay.
Good night.

1109
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:02,890
You know,

1110
01:26:02,892 --> 01:26:05,259
she does have
a good point.

1111
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:06,793
What's that?

1112
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,829
Living here.
What?

1113
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,466
Just until the center's ready and
Bernie recovers from surgery.

1114
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:17,638
And if you decide you wanna stay longer,
I'm fine with that too.

1115
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:22,676
I have to tell you,
I'm a terrible roommate.

1116
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,578
Really messy.

1117
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,747
Perfect.
I like to clean.

1118
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:30,617
I go to bed late
and I wake up early.

1119
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:33,187
Hello. I'm a mother.

1120
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,958
You know,
this could just work out.

1121
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,160
I think so.

1122
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:47,834
Don't mind me.
I'm just grabbin' myself some pie.

1123
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,470
Well, I think you're in
the wrong room for that.

1124
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,806
Yeah.

1125
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,878
What?

1126
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,546
Bernie's nurse,
huh?

1127
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,348
Oh, my God!

1128
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,250
To Bernie.
To Bernie.

1129
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,682
And then the man said...

1130
01:28:08,684 --> 01:28:12,452
"Do you take this man
to be your man?"
