1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:10,577

It's a basic human need
to ask, "Who are we?"

2
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,580
"Where do we come from?"

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,083
"How did we get here?"

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,086
"Why do we look the way we do?"

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,592

The story of our evolution

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,595
is just a small chapter
in a much larger story:

7
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,599
the evolution
of all living things.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,604

Evolution shows us
that we're much more connected

9
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,607
to the rest of the world,
the rest of animal life

10
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,609
than we could ever
have imagined.

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,613

We can recognize the connection
to our closest relatives

12
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,115
but when we know how to look

13
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,118
we can also find it
in other mammals:

14
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,620
birds...

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,121
reptiles...

16
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,123
fish...

17
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,626
even insects.

18
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,131
The deeper we dig,
the farther back we go

19
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,635
the more we see that
everything alive has evolved

20
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,637
from a single starting point.

21
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,140
The tree of life
has been branching

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,142
for four billion years.

23
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,148
And we can now follow its
branches back to their roots.

24
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,651

When we look back over time

25
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,654
we find certain signposts,
certain key events

26
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,157
the great transformations,
the big evolutionary steps.

27
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:35,662

In the history of our planet,
a few great transformations

28
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,665
have opened the door
for new ways of life

29
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,167
and new forms of life.

30
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,171
50 million years ago

31
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,175
land mammals evolved
into sea creatures.

32
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,179
Long before that,
fish colonized land.

33
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,184
At the dawn
of animal life itself

34
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,187
the first bodies appeared.

35
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:07,193
These are some of the chapters
in life's story... our story.

36
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,698

And... and part of the fun
of studying this

37
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,200
is understanding each
different chapter

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,202
because by understanding
those chapters

39
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,705
we can begin to see
the unity of life,

40
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,707
the common history
of all life on Earth.

41
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,752

Human civilization stretches
back thousands of years.

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,257
But compared to the age
of the earth

43
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,260
we humans have only
just arrived.

44
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,263

The earth is really old.

45
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,265
If you take the entire history
of the earth

46
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,768
from 4.6 billion years ago
to the present

47
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,770
and sort of call that an hour...

48
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,275

The first 50 minutes
are largely spent

49
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,279
in a world of microbes,
single-celled organisms.

50
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,785
Animal life appeared in the
last ten minutes of that hour.

51
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,791
All of human history, our
civilization, our evolution,

52
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,795
happened in the last hundredth
of a second of that hour.

53
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,799

 Ring-around-a-rosy... ?

54
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,301

We've come quite late
to the party

55
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,804
but we've been shaped
by the same forces

56
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,306
that have helped shape
all life on Earth.

57
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,309

...We all fall down. ?

58
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:07,313

To understand how we fit in,
we need to look back

59
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,315
to long before our own origins

60
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,818
to see how other
living things evolved.

61
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,825

Whales are the largest
living animals.

62
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,328
Like us, whales and dolphins

63
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,331
took on their present forms
relatively recently.

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,336
For a long time, the origin
of these marine mammals

65
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,838
was a scientific mystery.

66
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,341

Whales are so different
from every other kind of mammal

67
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,845
that we can't easily relate them
to anything else

68
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:43,349
and so they're off by themself
as a branch of mammal evolution.

69
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,354

Mammals first appeared on Earth
around 200 million years ago...

70
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,356
on land.

71
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,359
Mammals are warm-blooded

72
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:59,866
they give birth to living young
and they breathe air.

73
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,870
These are all adaptations
to living on land.

74
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,878

But whales and dolphins
are mammals, too.

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,381

They're mammals that live
in the water

76
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,885
but we know that mammals
evolved on land.

77
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,389
So it's a real puzzle
how whales originally evolved.

78
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,892
By understanding
how that happens

79
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,895
we'll begin to understand
how these big jumps

80
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,898
these big transformations
happen generally.

81
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,903

People are interested in whales,
and I can understand.

82
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,405
They're so beautiful.

83
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,909
Their origin is such a mystery.

84
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,912
Whales are one of
the few groups of mammals

85
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,916
that have really large,
complicated brains like we do.

86
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,420
And so in a sense, they're our
alter egos living in the sea

87
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,922
while we live on land

88
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,925
dominating the sea
while we dominate land.

89
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,426
And I think for that reason

90
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,429
we're very interested
in what goes on there

91
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,933
how they got there, as a
reflection of our own history

92
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,935
through geological time.

93
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,440

When Phil Gingerich began
his career 30 years ago

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,444
he knew nothing about whales,
and that was just fine with him.

95
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,949
He was drawn to geology
mostly because

96
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,452
he couldn't imagine a career
spent behind a desk.

97
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,955

I think I was interested
in geology

98
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,957
because it was a science
outdoors.

99
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,460
And in geology, I became
interested in paleontology

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,964
because it was about life
and the history of life.

101
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,967

Gingerich's early interest
in primitive land mammals

102
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,470
eventually took him to Pakistan.

103
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,976
It was there that he made
the kind of find

104
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,979
most paleontologists
only dream about:

105
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,483
a fossil that would rewrite one
of evolution's greatest stories.

106
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,988

I found the back of a skull
that I couldn't identify.

107
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,991
It had a very good,
well-preserved ear region

108
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,493
and that offered the clue
to what it was.

109
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,497

The shape was familiar

110
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:16,002
but in other ways it was like
nothing Gingerich had ever seen.

111
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,004
This is the original specimen.

112
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,006
It's the one we found
in about 1978.

113
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,008
There's several things
that strike you.

114
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,010
One is it's very similar
in size and shape

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,013
to the back of a skull
of a wolf.

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,517

But there was something odd
about this skull.

117
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,022
On its underside
was a walnut-sized bump.

118
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,024

If this wasn't here

119
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:42,028
I would think that this was
an archaic carnivorous mammal

120
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,031
or what we call a creodont,
but it is here.

121
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,035

It was part of
the animal's inner ear

122
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,537
and it had a distinctive shape,

123
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:59,045
a shape found today in only
one kind of animal: whales.

124
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,550
What was the ear of a whale
doing on the skull of an animal

125
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,552
that resembled a wolf?

126
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,059
Gingerich was intrigued,
so he constructed a model

127
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:18,064
of what the creature's full
skull might have looked like.

128
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:22,068
He wondered, was his find
a crucial missing link

129
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,071
the first fossil evidence
ever found

130
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,074
for one of Darwin's
most daring claims,

131
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:32,078
that whales had evolved
from land mammals?

132
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,582
To know for sure

133
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,085
Gingerich would need
to find more fossils...

134
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:46,592
ones that would show each stage
of the whale transformation,

135
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,097
what scientists call
"transitional forms."

136
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,598
I want to line them all up.

137
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,600
I want anyone
to be able to see it

138
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,103
and believe it
because they've seen it.

139
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:05,177

Gingerich tried to return
to Pakistan to resume his search

140
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,180
but war had broken out,
and the borders were closed.

141
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,686
Frustrated, Gingerich decided
to look elsewhere.

142
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:18,691
He had heard stories
about whale skeleton sightings

143
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,693
in a very unlikely place.

144
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,696
So he decided to check it out
for himself.

145
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,202
The Sahara Desert is one
of the driest places on Earth.

146
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:38,210
But 40 million years ago, things
here were quite different.

147
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,714

This used to be the sea.

148
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,716
Just think of this being

149
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,219
the current Mediterranean
coast of Egypt

150
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,222
backed up about 40 million years

151
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,226
but about 100 kilometers to
the south of where it is today.

152
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,232

Here, in what had once been
the Southern Mediterranean Sea

153
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:05,237
is a 100-square-mile stretch
of layered sandstone

154
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,740
with a surprising name...

155
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,244
Valley of the Whales.

156
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,750
The name is well suited.

157
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,255
Scattered everywhere
across this arid landscape

158
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,259
are what look like heaps
of rose-colored stones.

159
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,261
Here's
aBasilosaurus.

160
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,764

But they're not stones...

161
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,767
You can see how big
the vertebrae are.

162
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,770
Here's a lumbar
partly weathered away.

163
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,275

They're whale skeletons
40 million years old.

164
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,779
There's another one
back here coming out
of the mushroom.

165
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,280
There's one
over here.

166
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,285
And back over there
is one.

167
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,291
This whole place
is full of whales.

168
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,797

Why were there so many whales
concentrated in this one spot?

169
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,301
Gingerich believes
that Whale Valley

170
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,303
was once a protected bay,

171
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:16,308
a lagoon hidden from the open
sea by underwater sandbars.

172
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,815
Perhaps the whales
birthed their young here

173
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,817
and came here to die.

174
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,824
But even with hundreds
of whale bones at his feet

175
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,826
Gingerich was disappointed.

176
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,328
Nearly all of the skeletons

177
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,332
belonged to a whale
called "Basilosaurus--"

178
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:44,336
a 40-million-year-old creature
already known to science.

179
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,842
Basilosauruslived full time
in the water.

180
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,343
This is Basilosaurus.

181
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,345
I got all excited...

182
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,348

If whales had evolved
from land mammals

183
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,851
they had done so
long beforeBasilosaurus.

184
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:05,858
So Gingerich didn't think the
bones would be of much interest

185
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:10,362
but he couldn't
have been more wrong.

186
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,866
After only a few days
of digging

187
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,369
he made his second amazing find.

188
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,873
It turned out that Basilosaurus

189
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,877
had something modern whales
have long since lost.

190
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,381
For the first time,
we've got whales that have legs.

191
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,384

The bones were small
but unmistakable.

192
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,888
A pelvis.

193
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,892
A kneecap.

194
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,896
Even toes.

195
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,901
This whale had a complete set
of leg bones.

196
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,405
Gingerich brought back
as much of the skeleton

197
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,907
as he could carry.

198
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,409
It was dramatic evidence

199
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,913
that whales had once
been four-legged animals.

200
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,418
Since Gingerich's finds

201
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:11,423
he and others have filled in
more of this fantastic story.

202
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,927
Scientists now think

203
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,430
that the earliest ancestor
of whales was similar

204
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,935
to this 50 million-year-old
wolflike mammal called sinonyx.

205
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,439
Sinonyx was
a predatory scavenger

206
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,944
that lived and hunted along
the shores of an ancient sea.

207
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,447
Perhaps its descendants
found the water

208
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:40,452
a source of abundant food,
and a haven from competition.

209
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,956
Over millions of years
front legs became fins

210
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,459
rear legs disappeared,
bodies lost fur

211
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,463
and took on their familiar
streamlined shape.

212
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,970
Since Gingerich's first find,
named Pakicetus

213
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,974
the list of known
transitional whales has grown.

214
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:07,980
It now includes Ambulocetus...

215
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,983
Rhodocetus...

216
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,987
Durodon...

217
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,990
as well as Basilosaurus.

218
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,494
They reveal another element
of whale evolution

219
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,497
the gradual migration of
nostrils to the top of the head

220
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,000
as whales adapted to breathing
in the water.

221
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,004

How did whales
lose their legs?

222
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:38,510
As the years went by, they
evolved into newer types of...

223
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,514

Gingerich's work demonstrates
what Darwin himself insisted

224
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,019
that the evidence for evolution
is all around us

225
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,022
if we choose to look for it.

226
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:57,529
And bones aren't the only
evidence of whale evolution.

227
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,534
Their ancestry is also visible
in the way they move.

228
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:09,541
Frank Fish studies how today's
marine mammals swim.

229
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,047
He looks for their
evolutionary heritage

230
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,050
in the way they move
through the water.

231
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,052

The big question is:

232
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,554
How do you go
from a terrestrial mammal

233
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,057
that ran around
on all four legs

234
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,059
to something such as a dolphin

235
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,561
which now doesn't have
any legs at all

236
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,064
and is well adapted
to swimming in the oceans?

237
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:40,072

Even though whales look like
fish, they don't swim like them.

238
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,076
Fish swim by flexing
their spines from side to side

239
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,578
like this shark.

240
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,581
But mammals swim differently.

241
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:57,589
This otter swims by undulating
its spine up and down...

242
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,592
in exactly the same way
that whales do.

243
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,596
And, as it turns out
in the same way

244
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,600
that land mammals use
their spines when running.

245
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,606
Whales took with them
into the water

246
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,109
their ancestral way of moving

247
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,113
and we can still see it...
50 million years later.

248
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,621

In one sense, evolution didn't
invent anything new with whales;

249
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,124
it was just tinkering
with land mammals.

250
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,126
It's using
the old to make the new

251
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,128
and we call that tinkering.

252
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,130
And it does this
in every animal group

253
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,133
at every time during
evolutionary history.

254
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:47,139

The starting point for whales
was a four-legged land animal

255
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,142
that lived
over 50 million years ago.

256
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,646
But land animals were also the
product of a transformation,

257
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,649
a much earlier one.

258
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,153
Hundreds of millions
of years ago

259
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,155
there were no animals on land.

260
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,158

Before then

261
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,660
all our distant ancestors
lived in the water.

262
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,165
So at some point you had
this shift from life in water

263
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,666
to life on land.

264
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,668
That's a huge change.

265
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,172

It was the moment when fish
crawled out of the water

266
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,673
and onto land.

267
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,177
WO
If these early animals hadn't
made the transition

268
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,678
we wouldn't be here today.

269
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,682
And it's important
to understand how and when

270
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,186
and possibly, where
that transition took place.

271
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:40,192

The first creatures to leave the
water really started something.

272
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,696
Their descendants eventually
evolved into today's reptiles...

273
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,199
birds...

274
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,700
and mammals.

275
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,704
And these creatures'
common origins

276
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,707
are still visible
in their bodies.

277
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,215
Just like us, they all have
bodies with four limbs,

278
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,218
they're all tetrapods.

279
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,722

What that means is that all
these different creatures

280
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,459
are descended
from a common ancestor

281
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,463
whichhadsomething very similar
or akin to limbs.

282
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,968

Just what was
that common ancestor?

283
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,972
And how did it leave the water
370 million years ago?

284
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,475
(men conversing)

285
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,978
Those are the questions that
paleontologists Neil Shubin

286
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,981
and Ted Daeschler
are trying to answer.

287
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:40,486
They think that the cliffs
here in Central Pennsylvania

288
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,488
may offer some clues.

289
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,495
DAESCHLER:
All right, I think
it's a good day for fossils.

290
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:50,996
What do you say?

291
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,498
Great day;
let's find some.

292
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,499
Hey, Doug.

293
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,500
Hey, Doug.

294
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,501
Good trip up?

295
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,002
What you say
we go over here?

296
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,004
That's good.

297
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,506
Get some good digging in today.

298
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,509

An unlikely spot to hunt
for early tetrapod fossils.

299
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,012
But they're here because
the rocks in these hills

300
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,514
are just the right age,

301
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,517
laid down during the period
in Earth's history

302
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,018
called the Devonian.

303
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,020
(men conversing)

304
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,524

Back in the Devonian,
this place was very different.

305
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,025
It was south of the Equator,

306
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,028
remember the continents are
continually moving around,

307
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,030
and back this time
we're actually dealing with

308
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,533
a much more tropical climate
in Pennsylvania.

309
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,035

Hundreds of millions
of years ago

310
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,538
the fossils and sediments
in these layers

311
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,541
were collecting
on the bottom of a stream.

312
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,547

What we have here

313
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,549
is a snapshot
of life in a stream

314
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,051
about 370 million years ago.

315
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:53,058
These are fossilized... broken
fossils of scales, of teeth.

316
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,560
This little bone here,

317
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,063
it's a spine of a creature
known as a spiny shark.

318
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:03,569

Most of the fossils are too
fragmented to be of much value.

319
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,071
But in 1995, right at this spot

320
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,576
Daeschler came across something
he had never seen before.

321
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,082
It was a small shoulder bone,
but not from a fish.

322
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:24,590
It was a tetrapod shoulder,
370 million years old.

323
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,098
Shubin and Daeschler
had unearthed the remains

324
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:37,102
of one of life's first
four-legged creatures.

325
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,606
DAESCHLER:
It was the first evidence
of these early tetrapods

326
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:44,610
from all of North America,
and that made it very exciting.

327
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,616

And there was another surprise.

328
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,618
Since it was found
in the stream bed

329
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,621
this tetrapod most likely
livedin the water.

330
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,623

And it's
a very surprising discovery.

331
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,624
It's not something

332
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,626
we necessarily
would have predicted.

333
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:05,130

Why would an animal with limbs
live in the water?

334
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,633
Limbs were thought
to have evolved

335
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,635
for getting around on land.

336
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,138
The old idea was that
the fish came on shore first

337
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,140
and then developed the legs.

338
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,142
And what we now think

339
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,646
is that the tetrapods
developed the fingers first

340
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,648
and then left the water.

341
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,651

Jenny Clack
of Cambridge University

342
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:30,656
suspected that the theory taught
in many textbooks was wrong.

343
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,159
The story that you will find
in many of the old textbooks

344
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,161
and the pictures
that you will see

345
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,664
in children's books
and museum galleries

346
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:43,669
is a picture of a fish
stranded in a drying pool

347
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,672
trying to support itself
out of water.

348
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,676
And it looks really odd if you
look at it objectively.

349
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,680

Clack thought there
had to be a better explanation

350
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,682
but where to look?

351
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:01,186
Only a handful of early tetrapod
fossils had ever been found,

352
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,189
most of those
in a remote part of Greenland

353
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,691
at the turn of the century.

354
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:12,197
All she had to guide her was
a note scribbled in a journal

355
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:16,201
from a scouting trip
to Greenland years earlier.

356
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:20,706
It referred to tetrapod fossils
on an unnamed mountain.

357
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,213
Clack flew to Greenland
to search for those bones.

358
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:33,218
CLACK:
Eventually we found the spot,
800 meters up on a hillside.

359
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,722

Clack returned
with four tons of rock...

360
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:42,227
And spent
the next four years drilling.

361
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,732
At the end

362
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,235
she had the most complete early
tetrapod skeleton ever found;

363
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,238
and it forever
changed the textbooks.

364
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,741
CLACK:
One of the first things

365
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,245
that we found was this forelimb.

366
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:04,249

At the end of the animal's limb

367
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,753
was an unmistakable
array of bones.

368
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,756
This was a hand.

369
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,257
CLACK:
This is a life reconstruction..

370
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,260
The artist is using imagination
on the color scheme

371
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,262
and on the eyes

372
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,265
but we think this is
as accurate as you can get.

373
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,769

The creature,
named Acanthostega

374
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,271
was clearly a water-dweller:

375
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:33,779
It had a fishlike tail and gills
for breathing in the water.

376
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,783
But the ends of its arms
were petal-shaped...

377
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,286
possibly the first hands
on Earth.

378
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:45,791
CLACK:
This was a swimming creature.

379
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,793
We don't know whether it could
ever have come out on land

380
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,295
but it certainly
wouldn't havewalked

381
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,797
in the conventional sense.

382
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,801
Basically, it's...
a fish with fingers.

383
00:23:55,801 --> 00:24:01,306

Clack's find was
a scientific breakthrough.

384
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:06,812
It proved that some fish had
arms and legs in the water.

385
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:13,819
So tetrapods didn't need to grow
limbs after they got onto land.

386
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,826
The limbs had already evolved

387
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,328
and helped them survive
out of the water.

388
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,331
The basic pattern for limbs
had been in place

389
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,834
for millions of years.

390
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,336

Here we have the fin

391
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:36,341
of a 370-million-year-old fossil
fish and an arm of a human.

392
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,345
In a human arm, what
you have is one bone...

393
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:45,851
then two bones,
the wrist and the digits.

394
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,853
In this fin what do you have?

395
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,355
You have one bone,
two bones...

396
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:57,362
even little bones that can be
compared to a wrist

397
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,864
and then rods that face away

398
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,366
from the rest
of the appendage itself

399
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,869
just like our fingers or toes.

400
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,871
So you have, in a fish fin

401
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,374
already set up
about 370 million years ago

402
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,378
many of the bones that are used
in a tetrapod limb.

403
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,882

With the basic pattern
already there

404
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,384
the fin-to-limb transition
took place

405
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,887
in a series of small changes

406
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,389
occurring over
millions of years.

407
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,391

There's really no goal
to evolution.

408
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,894
Evolution wasn'ttrying
to make limbs

409
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,396
it wasn'ttrying
to push our distant ancestors

410
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,398
out of the water.

411
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,401
What was happening
was a series of experiments.

412
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,405

In the crowded,
freshwater streams

413
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,907
where tetrapods first evolved

414
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:46,411
the competition for survival
was intense.

415
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,414

These small streams
were like an engine

416
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,416
or a crucible
of evolutionary change.

417
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,922

Fish experimented with all sorts
of survival strategies.

418
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,426
Some became predators.

419
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:05,430
The owner of this jaw
was a 12-foot-long killer.

420
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,435
Its teeth were the size
of railroad spikes.

421
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,942
Smaller fish developed elaborate
defenses, like this heavy armor.

422
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:24,449
Others packed weaponry,
like this sharp spike.

423
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,452
It protruded from behind
its owner's neck.

424
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,459
These armaments
were all tools for survival

425
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,462
in a dangerous world.

426
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,466
Perhaps their new arms and legs
gave the first tetrapods

427
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,969
another way to survive.

428
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,972

It was to get out of the way;
it was to get onto land.

429
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,974
And what enabled those animals

430
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,977
to get out of the way,
that is, to get out of the water

431
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,478
were these new features,
like limbs.

432
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,985

Those that did escape
found a new world

433
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,487
filled with opportunity.

434
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,363
The transformation
from water to land

435
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,365
was only the latest example

436
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,868
of evolution experimenting
with radically new forms.

437
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,374
An earlier transformation,

438
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,876
perhaps the most
significant of all,

439
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,380
occurred just over
half a billion years ago...

440
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,386
And it led
to all animals as we know them.

441
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,392
Evolution tinkered with fish
to make limbs.

442
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,894
But fish carry the baggage
of their own past.

443
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,897
Think of a fish

444
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:50,402
It has a head, it has a tail
and a bunch of fins in between.

445
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,905
That's a body plan,
the way the body's put together.

446
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,409
But that's just one of many ways
of putting animals together.

447
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,912
I mean, some animals are
like disks, like jellyfish.

448
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,915
Other animals have
lots of little legs.

449
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,417
The question is

450
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,421
what sort of tinkering led
to these body plans?

451
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,924
I mean, really
what we're dealing with here

452
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,426
is the origin of animals.

453
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,929

According to the fossil record

454
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,932
animals appeared upon the earth
in a short burst

455
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,436
around 570 million years ago.

456
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,941
Scientists call
this crucial transformation

457
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,944
the Cambrian Explosion.

458
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,946

The Cambrian Explosion
was effectively

459
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,448
one of the greatest
breakthroughs

460
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,949
in the history of life.

461
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,954
About half a billion years ago,
suddenly, things change

462
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,958
and we have this extraordinary
explosion of diversity.

463
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,961
And this sudden appearance
of the fossils led to this term

464
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,463
the Cambrian Explosion.

465
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,965
And Darwin, as ever,
was extremely candid.

466
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,968
He said, "Look, this is
a problem for my theory.

467
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,472
How is it that suddenly, animals
seem to come out of nowhere?"

468
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,975
And to a certain extent, that is
still something of a mystery.

469
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,979

Most of what we know
of the Cambrian Explosion

470
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,482
is a result
of a single discovery

471
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,485
probably the greatest
fossil find in history.

472
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,990
In 1913, while climbing
in the Canadian Rockies

473
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,994
paleontologist Charles Walcott
discovered a layer of shale

474
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:27,499
containing thousands
of exquisitely detailed fossils.

475
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,004
These animals, all sea dwellers

476
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:37,008
were caught in a catastrophic
underwater mudslide.

477
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,514
Over the next 500 million years

478
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,016
the sea floor
which entombed them

479
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,519
rose to become
the top of a mountain.

480
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,024
Walcott removed over 60,000
fossils from the site

481
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,528
which he named
the Burgess Shale.

482
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,534
Simon Conway Morris has studied
the fossils for over 30 years.

483
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,538
It's almost as if
you've gone to another planet.

484
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,039
You've been given a fishing boat
and a net

485
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,041
and you've been allowed
to throw that net

486
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,543
over into the deep ocean

487
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,044
and you'd no idea
what was going to come up.

488
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:17,048

Some of the Burgess Shale
creatures were familiar.

489
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,050

And here, we've got
one of the trilobites.

490
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,053
We see the delicate soft parts,
also preserved.

491
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,057

Trilobites
are extinct arthropods

492
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,060
creatures
with external skeletons.

493
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,064
Today's arthropods,
like crabs, lobsters

494
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,066
insects and spiders

495
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,069
are all descendants
of creatures like these.

496
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:43,575
Other Burgess Shale animals
were bizarre, alien-seeming.

497
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,579
An animal with five eyes
and a long retractable nozzle.

498
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,585
One with long, sharp spines
protruding from its back.

499
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,591
Another with a circle of prongs
around its mouth.

500
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,098
And yet, as alien
as these creatures seem

501
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,601
they are also surprisingly
familiar.

502
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,106
Like living animals,
they have bodies

503
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:19,611
with heads, tails, appendages,

504
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,616
specialized segments performing
specialized functions.

505
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:30,121
All the basic body plans found
in nature today are here.

506
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,626
Every animal that has lived
for the last half billion years

507
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,630
has come from tinkering
with these initial designs.

508
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,637
We might even see
our own ancestor here.

509
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,641

Maybe this is the crown
of the Burgess Shale.

510
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,643
This is Pikaia.

511
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,647

A tiny creature,Pikaiais one
of the rarest fossils

512
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,148
from the Burgess Shale.

513
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,652
It's the only one
with an internal nerve cord

514
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,655
resembling a spine.

515
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,157
That might mean
that creatures like Pikaia

516
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,662
were the earliest ancestors
of all animals with skeletons.

517
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,666

The idea is that this might be
the precursor of the fish

518
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,668
and so, ultimately

519
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,671
through a long evolutionary
story, ourselves.

520
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,173
The Cambrian Explosion matters
for lots of reasons.

521
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,675
Basically,
it's part of our history.

522
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,678
It's where we came from
and that matters very much.

523
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,681
This is the time
when the animals first appear.

524
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,685
We look back and we can see
part of our history unfolding.

525
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,691
So what do we learn by looking

526
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,193
at 600 million years
of animal history?

527
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:47,198
Evolution's tinkering
with mammalness to make whales.

528
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,200
In the same way,
it's tinkering with fishiness

529
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,203
to make tetrapods

530
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,205
and it's tinkering
with animalness

531
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,208
to make all the different
body plans that we see.

532
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:03,214
All these different creatures
are variations of the same theme

533
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,718
restated over and over again.

534
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:11,723
The question was, what was
evolution tinkering with?

535
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,725
One of the remarkable
discoveries

536
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,226
of the last 20 years

537
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:19,731
is that evolution's not
tinkering with the bodies.

538
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,733
It's tinkering with the recipe

539
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,235
the machinery
that builds bodies.

540
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,237
What is that recipe?

541
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,238
What is that machinery?

542
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,239
It's the genes.

543
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,747

Fossils record the changes
in animals' bodies over time

544
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,751
but just how bodies change
was unknown.

545
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,756
The search for the genetic
mechanism of evolution

546
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,759
took most of this century.

547
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,262
When scientists finally found it

548
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,264
they were astonished...

549
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,268
by just how simple it was.

550
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,775
One of the key players
was Mike Levine.

551
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,278

I was, um, I guess,
kind of a weird kid.

552
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,780
I always liked bugs.

553
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,783
We had a nice, big backyard,
and I could go back there.

554
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,284
It was kind of a sanctuary.

555
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,287
And, uh, I played with bugs...

556
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,790
dissected them,
manipulated them.

557
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,792
That's really
the most pleasant memory I have.

558
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:26,297

Levine's affinity for bugs led
to his study of biology.

559
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:31,302
One insect in particular
became an object of fascination.

560
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,806

They have
a quick generation time

561
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,808
and they have lots of pattern.

562
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,310
I mean, you wouldn't know it
if you look at a distance

563
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,812
but when you look
under a microscope

564
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,814
at an adult fruit fly

565
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,818
you'd be astounded
by the number of bristles

566
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:51,322
the intricacies of their wings,
the patterns of their eyes.

567
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,826
But the embryos
are something else.

568
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,327
I do love the embryos.

569
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,329

Scientists had long suspected

570
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,334
that embryos held clues
to how animals evolve.

571
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,340
All embryos start out
as clusters

572
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,342
of nearly identical cells.

573
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,849
But soon,
an embryo partitions itself

574
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,852
into specialized segments

575
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:25,356
which develop into
the final form of the animal.

576
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,360
What controlled this process?

577
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,864
How did the embryos know
what shape to take?

578
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,368
One of the first people
to study these questions

579
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,872
was a 19th-century naturalist
named William Bateson.

580
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,377
Bateson wrote
that animals' skeletons revealed

581
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:50,882
an underlying structure
of repeating segments.

582
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,393
He also observed that animals
occasionally developed

583
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,396
with some segments
in the wrong places.

584
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,901

Insects with legs
in the wrong place.

585
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,404
Crabs where a claw
was transformed into a leg.

586
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,805
Pythons with extra ribs

587
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,807
or frogs
with extra cervical vertebrae

588
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,309
and all these sorts of things.

589
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,314

To Bateson,
these developmental errors meant

590
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,816
that the underlying blueprint
for the animal

591
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,819
was being disrupted.

592
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,322
He had no idea how it happened

593
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,824
but he suspected
that these random changes

594
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:37,828
might provide the fuel
for evolution.

595
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,335
By the 1940s, scientists working
with fruit flies

596
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,837
had learned
how to cause disruptions

597
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:50,341
in the developmental blueprint:

598
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:55,846
by dousing growing embryos
with radiation and poison.

599
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,348

And so when they did that

600
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:01,352
they found flies with changed
wing structures, changed legs

601
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,354
and these very special flies

602
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,857
that have one part of the body
in the wrong place

603
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,860
or a copy of a normal part
of the body in another place.

604
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,869

The scientists
had triggered the changes

605
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,873
by damaging the flies' DNA.

606
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,877
Within each cell
of the developing embryo

607
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,382
is a chainlike molecule
called DNA.

608
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,385
The experiments showed
that DNA was somehow

609
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,388
causing the embryo
to divide into segments.

610
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,893
But how?

611
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,396
Scientists were just beginning
to grasp

612
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:51,402
that the DNA itself was made up
of segments, called genes.

613
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,907
The question was: how did
the genes shape the body?

614
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,914
One researcher,
Dr. Ed Lewis of Caltech

615
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,418
studied this question
for 30 years

616
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,921
by crossbreeding
thousands of flies.

617
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,926
Lewis's work led him
to a controversial idea.

618
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:19,430
He proposed that a surprisingly
simple mechanism

619
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,434
was shaping embryos.

620
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,936
He wrote that each segment
of the fly

621
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:29,940
was being directed to grow
by a single gene.

622
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,944
A small set of genes,
a kind of genetic toolkit

623
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,947
appeared to be laying out
the entire body.

624
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,950
And as he looked at these genes,
he said

625
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,952
"This one affects
this part of the body.

626
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,454
"This affects
the next part of the body.

627
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,456
And this affects
the next part of the body."

628
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,958
That was
an astonishing observation.

629
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,464

It was astonishing
because it seemed too simple.

630
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,966
Nobody else thought single genes
were powerful enough

631
00:38:55,966 --> 00:39:00,471
to control something as complex
as the structure of the body.

632
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,477
Skeptics argued
that Lewis's idea was guesswork.

633
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,980
Of course, he had never seen
the genes

634
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,983
because the techniques to do so
didn't exist.

635
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,487
From the 1920s to the 1970s

636
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,490
it was not possible
to physically isolate

637
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,991
any specific gene.

638
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,495
That opportunity first became
available, fortunately for me

639
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,497
at the time
that I was a student.

640
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,500
And so, many of us
thought, "Wow.

641
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,503
"We can finally dig in there

642
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,506
and identify
these really mysterious genes."

643
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:41,512

Levine enlisted his friend and
fellow scientist Bill McGinnis.

644
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,517
The first gene they went after
had an unusual name.

645
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,523
Antennapedia,
which means "antenna leg."

646
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,529
The gene was thought
to control the growth of legs.

647
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,533
When the gene misfired

648
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,537
flies grew legs
in the wrong place:

649
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,540
on their heads,
in place of antennae.

650
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,545
In normal flies,
legs grow from the midsection

651
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,548
the area called the thorax.

652
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:22,052
So Levine and McGinnis decided
to hunt for the gene

653
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,054
in the thorax
of a normal embryo.

654
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,558

The expectation

655
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,561
is that antennapedia
would be active

656
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,563
expressed in the thorax

657
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,064
the developing thorax,
of the embryo.

658
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,066
But who knew?

659
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,569

Levine and McGinnis had
to do something

660
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,072
no one had ever done before.

661
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,576
They had to find a way to see
a gene in action.

662
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,080

We wanted to light up the gene

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,083
and it was very
painstaking work.

664
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,087

The project called
for new and untested methods.

665
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,091

At first, it didn't work
very well

666
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,595
and there were a number
of technical problems to solve.

667
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,600

The team had to find
a delicate balance

668
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,103
of radioactive probes
and toxic enzymes.

669
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,610
Too much of either
would destroy the embryos.

670
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,614

The process
was not very gratifying

671
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,617
on a day-by-day basis.

672
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,619
Unbelievably tedious.

673
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,625

It took months
of trial and error.

674
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,133

People often said, "You know,
you should try something else.

675
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:47,638
"You know,
this is too long-shot.

676
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,141
You know, you're going to...
you're just wasting your time."

677
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,142
But we kept going.

678
00:41:56,146 --> 00:42:01,151

Finally, late one night,
all the work paid off.

679
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,163

And there was this moment...

680
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:17,668
when we saw that the gene
was turned on in a band

681
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,671
in the middle
of a very early embryo.

682
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,173
This had never been seen before.

683
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:28,679

The antennapedia gene was acting
like a master switch

684
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,181
turning on the segment
of the embryo

685
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,684
that would become the thorax.

686
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,187
The implications
were mind-boggling:

687
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,691
if single genes like
antennapedia could define

688
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,193
whole segments of an animal

689
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,197
these genes were acting
like architects of the body.

690
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,704
And if one of these genes
turned on in the wrong place

691
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,707
striking changes
to the body could result.

692
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,712
It seemed that Levine and
McGinnis had uncovered

693
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,715
the genes responsible
for the evolution of bodies.

694
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,219
But there were still doubts.

695
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,723
The work had all
been done in fruit flies.

696
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,725
What about other animals?

697
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:19,229
Did they use the same mechanism
to build their bodies?

698
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,234
An answer would come
from Switzerland.

699
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:28,238
In 1994, Walter Gehring
of the University of Basel

700
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,741
isolated the gene that triggered

701
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,243
the growth of eyes
in fruit flies.

702
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,748
The gene was called Eyeless

703
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,251
because flies without it
developed with no eyes.

704
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:48,759
Gehring knew of a gene in mice
that worked in the same way.

705
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,765
He wondered,
were the two genes the same?

706
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,267

And this question we tested

707
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:02,272
by taking the mouse gene and
putting it into fruit flies

708
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,275
to see whether flies
can understand

709
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,277
the message of the mouse.

710
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:12,783

Gehring replaced a fly's gene
for eyes with the mouse gene.

711
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:17,287

And to everybody's surprise

712
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,290
the mouse gene works
perfectly well

713
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,795
and can induce a compound eye
in the fruit fly.

714
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,301

The fruit fly grew
normal fruit fly eyes

715
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,804
using a gene from a mouse.

716
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:38,308
Not only did the two creatures
use the same mechanism;

717
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,310
they used the same gene.

718
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:46,817
This was the mechanism
behind extra wings

719
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:52,823
legs sprouting from heads,
and Bateson's deformed animals.

720
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:58,328
The century-long search
was complete.

721
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,832
The genetic engine
of the body's evolution

722
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,836
turned out to be a tiny handful
of powerful genes.

723
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,337

So what this means is

724
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,174
in some ways, some sense,
evolution is a simpler process

725
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,675
than we first thought...

726
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:17,181
when you think about all of the
diversity of forms out there.

727
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,184
We first believed
that this would involve

728
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,186
all sorts of novel creations

729
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,189
starting from scratch,
again and again and again.

730
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,192
We now understand
that no, that evolution works

731
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:31,195
with packets of information,
and uses them

732
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:35,199
in new and different ways and
new and different combinations

733
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,202
without necessarily
having to invent

734
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:42,206
anything fundamentally new,
but new combinations.

735
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:47,211

Suddenly, the commonality
of form among animals

736
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,712
was understood:

737
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,716
animals resembled each other
because they all used

738
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:56,220
the same set of genes
to build their bodies

739
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,224
a set of genes
inherited from a common ancestor

740
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,227
that lived long ago.

741
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,231
And what we see now among all
the animals are just variations

742
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,234
on a body plan that existed
half a billion years ago.

743
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,237
And there's only one
inescapable conclusion

744
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,739
you can draw from that,
which is

745
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,741
if all of these branches
have these genes

746
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,244
then you have to go
to the base of that

747
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,247
which is the last common
ancestor of all animals

748
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,250
and you deduce,
itmust have had these genes.

749
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,252
So the whole radiation
of animals

750
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,754
the whole spring
of animal diversity

751
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,258
has been fed by essentially
the same set of genes.

752
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,763

Ed Lewis shared
the Nobel Prize in 1995

753
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:43,767
for the discovery of
the universal set of genes

754
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,770
that builds the bodies
of animals.

755
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,275
And so, yes, it came
as a huge surprise

756
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,278
not only to people
like my mother, who says

757
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,280
"My God, an earthworm
and a mouse?

758
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,783
An earthworm and me, you know,
share things in common?"

759
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:03,287
But it came as a surprise to
other scientists that there was

760
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,790
this profound conservation of
mechanism of building embryos

761
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,293
among all these different
kinds of animals.

762
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,299

What about us?

763
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,800
Our bodies are built

764
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,305
from the same genes that build
all other animals.

765
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,808
Yet we are different.

766
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:32,816
No other animal designs...
or creates like we do.

767
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,821
We seem so special
it's hard not to think

768
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:42,326
that we're somehow an exception
to evolution...

769
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,828
but of course, we're not.

770
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,332
The transformation
that led to us

771
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,835
was no different
from other transformations.

772
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:58,342
Our crucial turning point
seems to have occurred

773
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,844
when our ancestors
left the trees

774
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,347
and began to walk on two legs.

775
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,850

We don't know exactly when,
or even where

776
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,853
our ancestors became
upright and bipedal.

777
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,357
We think it goes back
well over four million years.

778
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,859
When these ancestors
came out of the trees

779
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,862
and began to exploit
food sources on the ground

780
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,364
in terrestrial habitats

781
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:24,368
one of the key elements that
would've been so useful to them

782
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,371
would've been freeing
their forelimbs, their hands

783
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,874
to be able to gather and carry
foodstuffs over long distances.

784
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,377
Once that happened, it opened up

785
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:37,881
an extraordinary breadth of
possibilities and opportunities.

786
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,385

Most bipedal hominids
went extinct

787
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:45,389
but one branch went on
to evolve larger brains.

788
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,893
That branch eventually
led to modern humans.

789
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,896
So how did this
crucial transition

790
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,399
to two-legged walking begin?

791
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,903
Liza Shapiro of
the University of Texas

792
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,406
looks for clues
in living primates.

793
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,408

When you look
at the fossil record

794
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,910
all you have really
is a pile of bones.

795
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,412
It's a nonmoving entity.

796
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,414
There's not much
you can know about it

797
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,916
unless you look
for living analogs.

798
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,422
So if you look at living
animals, you've got the bones

799
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,425
but you can also look
at how they're moving.

800
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,930

In their movements,
living lemurs resemble

801
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,931
tree-dwelling primates

802
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,933
that lived
up to 50 million years ago.

803
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,935
We didn't evolve from lemurs

804
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,439
but they may be
the best living analog

805
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,442
for those distant ancestors.

806
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,945

When we're trying
to reconstruct the scenario

807
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:45,449
about how humans evolved
bipedally from this ancestor

808
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,951
we have to know
what it was we started from

809
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,455
if we're going to come up
with an explanation

810
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:55,459
for not only how we made
that transition, but why.

811
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,963

Today, Shapiro is gathering data

812
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,466
on the movement style
of the lemur.

813
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,469
Small reflectors
have been gently placed

814
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,970
on the animal's back.

815
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,474
An array of infrared cameras
will record the lemur

816
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:14,478
as it walks across
this makeshift bridge.

817
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,483
Of course, getting a lemur to do
just about anything on cue

818
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,984
takes a bit of doing.

819
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,986
There you go.

820
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,502

Finally, the animal
makes it across.

821
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,003
Here you go...
oh, good!

822
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,505
All right.

823
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,506
Got that.

824
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,007
And he's down.

825
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,511

The motion of the lemur's spine
can now be analyzed

826
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,514
in three dimensions.

827
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:56,520
The data reveal that lemurs'
spines are extremely flexible

828
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,023
capable of many
kinds of movements.

829
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,526

Lemurs walk quadrupedally

830
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,528
but they're also
very good at leaping.

831
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:10,534

Like these lemurs, the early
primates probably moved

832
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,035
in all sorts of ways:

833
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:17,541
down on all fours,
scampering up trees...

834
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,546
even leaping in
an upright position.

835
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,050
They weren't limited
to just one style of movement

836
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,553
so they could serve
as the starting point

837
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,055
for a number of evolutionary
experiments.

838
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,062
And most likely,
that's just what happened.

839
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,065
We weren't the only ones

840
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,568
to evolve
from those early ancestors.

841
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:49,072
So did most of today's
living primates.

842
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:53,076
Our closest living relative
is the chimpanzee.

843
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,579
We didn't evolve from chimps

844
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,081
but we do share
a recent common ancestor.

845
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,083
Can you walk
over here?

846
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,087

That's why our DNA is nearly
identical to theirs...

847
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,092
and why our skeletons
have the same number of bones

848
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,094
arranged in nearly the same way.

849
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,600
But the few physical differences
that set us apart

850
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,603
seem to have made
a great difference.

851
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:24,608
Chimps don't walk on two feet.

852
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,611
They've evolved a different
style of getting around

853
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,112
called knucklewalking.

854
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,614

Knucklewalking

855
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:34,117
is a very specialized adaptation
that we see

856
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,620
among chimps and gorillas today.

857
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,123
It's an adaptation
to walking on the ground.

858
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:44,628

Knucklewalking was as valid
an evolutionary experiment

859
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,129
as two-legged walking.

860
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,132
But the difference
in our walking styles

861
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,135
which may have affected
our intellects

862
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:56,139
is seen in the few slight
differences in our skeletons.

863
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,645
Here are two skeletons
of modern primates.

864
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,147
This skeleton I'm sure
you'll all recognize

865
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,650
because it's a skeleton
like yours and mine.

866
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,151
This is a modern human.

867
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,653
But this smaller skeleton

868
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,156
is one of our closest living
relatives, the chimpanzee.

869
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,160
We began walking on two legs

870
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,664
and that made a whole series of
modifications in the skeleton.

871
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,165
In humans, the spinal chord

872
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,668
comes out of the base
of the skull

873
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,670
and points straight downwards

874
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,673
rather than coming out
of the back of the skull.

875
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,675
The pelvis is shaped
very differently.

876
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:35,679
A chimpanzee has
a long, narrow pelvis.

877
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,682
Ours is short and squat.

878
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,184
We walk with our knees
close together.

879
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:46,189
Chimpanzees walk
with their knees wide apart.

880
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,691
These are minor differences.

881
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,194
These are the sorts of tinkering
that evolution did

882
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:55,699
to change us
into a modern biped.

883
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,703

What if our ancestors
hadn't stood up?

884
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,207
What if they had taken
one different turn

885
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:07,210
along the path
to becoming human?

886
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:15,218

One of the great misconceptions
that most people have is that...

887
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:19,222
that once our ancestors stood
up, it was almost inevitable

888
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,224
that we would be here today

889
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,227
that the egocentric species,
Homo sapiens

890
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,229
would evolve in this manner.

891
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,231
But what we see is

892
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,234
that evolution has worked
the same way with us

893
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,237
as it has with every, single
organism on this planet.

894
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,241
We're here through a series
of chance coincidences

895
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,245
specific adaptations,
chosen opportunities.

896
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,749
So I think that when we
look at our own origins

897
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,751
we see that it is extraordinary

898
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,254
that humans are here to look
back and ponder their past.

899
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,258

Does that mean we are not unique

900
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,259
in many ways?

901
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,761
Of course not.

902
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,263
We're the ones
telling this story.

903
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,265
And that's very important...

904
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,268
that evolution, that life
has gotten to the point

905
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,770
where it can tell this story.
