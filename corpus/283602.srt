1
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,314
Oh, what a time for a song

2
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:01,087
A song for a new beginning

3
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:07,565
We start into our lives with a new melody

4
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:16,666
We turn to the river of eternity

5
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:21,076
Oh, what a day for a walk!

6
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,845
Along the sunlit pathways

7
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:32,187
We hold each other's hands
with a soft tender look

8
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:41,132
We radiate our love with a simple smile

9
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:47,833
It's a new beginning,
it's a brand new start

10
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,705
We're born again to be someone else...

11
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,144
From this moment on we'll be one

12
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,240
We'll be one in two,

13
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,582
...we'll be two in one

14
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:08,184
And we'll make through our lives
hand in hand

15
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,955
Oh, what a moment to rejoice

16
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:19,061
For our yearning future

17
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:25,236
All our roots treasured within our dreams

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:33,719
All our dreams on their way to success

19
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,384
It's a new beginning,
it's a brand new start

20
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,485
And we're born again to be someone else

21
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,828
From this moment on, we'll be one...

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:54,396
We'll be one in two, we'll be two in one

23
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:06,385
We'll make through our lives hand in hand

24
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,789
The car's broken?

25
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,157
Call the mechanic

26
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,523
l can fix it myself

27
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,933
Prepared for the London University
entry-exam?

28
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,237
No

29
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,471
Then how can you study abroad?

30
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,752
Step on the gas please, dad

31
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,531
Right on

32
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,578
You want to go for a spin?

33
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,619
Ask me like you mean it

34
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,836
l know... don't drive too fast

35
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,512
You're home?

36
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,356
Bye

37
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,971
Dad

38
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,040
Go upstairs

39
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,350
Cindy

40
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,196
Where did you go?

41
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,361
We were practising... singing

42
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,634
How many times have l told you?

43
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,138
Why don't you listen?

44
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,141
Never mind, she's good at school

45
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,738
She loves singing

46
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,340
Shut up, you've spoilt her

47
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,477
That's why she won't listen

48
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,680
Do you know what her friends are like?

49
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,314
The boys are wearing ridiculous clothes

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,484
The girls in the shortest pants

51
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,151
l bumped into them once

52
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,753
There was a girl
whose mid-riff totally showed

53
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:19,662
If she hangs around with them,
she will...

54
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,171
Give that to me

55
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,741
Come on

56
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,607
Don't ruin my guitar

57
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,416
l bought it with my own money

58
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,455
Give it to me. You can't sing anymore

59
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,422
No, l love to sing

60
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,017
Well, l don't want you to

61
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,257
Daddy, but l do

62
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,400
Cindy, you're my daughter

63
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,834
Give it to me

64
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,275
Don't make your dad angry

65
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,146
You are daddy's baby girl

66
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,747
No, l'm not anyone's baby

67
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,339
l'd rather you hate me now...

68
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,603
than to blame me in the future

69
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,051
Cindy

70
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,065
Cindy, what? The guitar's broken?

71
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,395
We can buy another one

72
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,436
Don't cry

73
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,836
Who are you?

74
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,207
L'm Ling Xi. You must be Cindy's dad

75
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,243
Come, let's go for a drive in my new car

76
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,879
l don't want to go out today

77
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,922
Because of the guitar?

78
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,895
Don't worry, on your 16th birthday...

79
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,794
l'll buy you a new one

80
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,365
Let's go

81
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,440
This is Ling Xi

82
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,505
It doesn't matter who he is,
they're all the same

83
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,441
No, he's different, dad

84
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,484
Get out

85
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,018
Dad

86
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,407
Mr. Xin, l'm Cindy's friend

87
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,707
If she's unhappy...

88
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,612
it'd be better if l talk to her

89
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,277
She tells me everything

90
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,417
If she wants to talk...

91
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,489
she can talk to her own parents;

92
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,955
But certainly not you

93
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,067
You'll need a new one

94
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,412
Do you want me to get a saw?

95
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,151
Then we must talk like this

96
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,087
Look at my car. L fixed it, you know

97
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,392
It's ugly

98
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,397
Beg your pardon?

99
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,435
It can almost fly

100
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,684
Ling Xi, those two who just walked past;

101
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,185
Do you think their heart
will cry out for...

102
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,346
Romeo and Juliet?

103
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,423
Most definitely

104
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,820
But l think if they were
the parents of Juliet...

105
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,956
they would have forced her to death

106
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,234
Great. You look best when you smile

107
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,501
We're grown-ups, aren't we?

108
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,513
L am, of course

109
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,708
At the same time, you ain't a child either

110
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,681
Don't be sad, l'll buy you a new guitar

111
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,350
You can practise at my place

112
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,257
l'll listen with my heart

113
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,962
Go now, l'll see you later

114
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,342
Bye

115
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,072
Hey!

116
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,069
It seems that...

117
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,873
we can only see each other
in front of the garage

118
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,746
You like to work with machines

119
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,347
You should've opted for
mechanical engineering

120
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,484
Just like your elder brother, get a Ph.D.

121
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,734
Dad

122
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,500
Not everyone ought to get a doctorate

123
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,575
l mean, Mankind has existed for
such a long time

124
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,974
And how long have
the Ph.D. Programs been around?

125
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,110
You bear such extremist views!

126
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,342
L don't care for the others

127
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,577
But you're my own son

128
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,152
Ling Xi

129
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,438
Dad, l want to...

130
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,344
l don't wish to further my studies

131
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,114
No second thoughts?

132
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,663
You'll regret this

133
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,596
Maybe

134
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,163
No one knows whether
they've made the right decision

135
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,670
There are so many paths
in the course of life, dad

136
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,146
In the future...

137
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,648
You will know that
those paths are all dead-ends

138
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,848
But l want to try anyway

139
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,961
l'm going to see Cindy today

140
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,026
Cindy's dad held my shoulder like this

141
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,229
...and kicked me out

142
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,173
Cindy is my girlfriend

143
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,215
How old is she? What does her father do?

144
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,358
It's so strange

145
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,194
That's the typical reaction of folks
at your age

146
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,900
As soon as you know
your son has a girlfriend

147
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,631
...you've got nothing else to ask

148
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,772
Why don't you ask me...

149
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,502
how important she is to me?

150
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,286
What her dad does...

151
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,947
is it that important?

152
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,486
Fine, tell me then

153
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,458
How important is she to you?

154
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,853
She is THE most important

155
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,397
Then come my cars

156
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,790
What about me?

157
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,326
What kind of question is that?

158
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,699
You know, only girls...

159
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,569
would ask such a question

160
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:08,616
All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

161
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,254
l can't sleep through the night time

162
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,562
And l weep when dawn arrives

163
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:24,473
All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

164
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,535
The seasons spinning round again

165
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:33,346
The years keep rolling by

166
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,181
l guess l've been here before

167
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,556
l can't remember when

168
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,028
But l've got this funny feeling

169
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,465
That l'll be there once again

170
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,369
There's no straight lines that
make up my life

171
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:58,409
And all my roads have bends

172
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,241
There's no clear cut beginnings,

173
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:07,182
and so far no dead ends

174
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:16,219
All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

175
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,957
l can't sleep through the night time

176
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,263
And l weep when dawn arrives

177
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:31,901
All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

178
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,844
The seasons spinning round again

179
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,408
The years keep rolling by

180
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,478
l've found you a thousand times,

181
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,957
l guess you've done the same

182
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,621
But then we'll lose each other

183
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,064
It's just like a children's games

184
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,002
As l see you here again,

185
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,064
the thought runs through my mind

186
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,237
Our love is like a circle,

187
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:13,649
Let's go round one more time

188
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:22,183
All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

189
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,060
l can't sleep through the night time

190
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,067
And l weep when dawn arrives

191
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:37,632
All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

192
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,577
The seasons spinning round again

193
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,980
The years keep rolling by

194
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:53,456
All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

195
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,017
l can't sleep through the night time

196
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,259
And l weep when dawn arrives

197
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:09,137
All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

198
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,041
The seasons spinning round again

199
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:18,105
The years keep rolling by

200
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,381
Let's sing a joyful song, and be happy

201
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:25,052
Great...

202
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:32,059
l have a never ending love for you

203
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:37,124
From now on that's all l wanna do

204
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,935
From the first time we met l knew

205
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,841
l have this never ending love for you

206
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:52,008
l have a never ending love for you

207
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:56,986
From now on that all l wanna do

208
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,856
From the first time we met l knew

209
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,125
l have this never ending love for you

210
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:11,692
After all this time of being alone

211
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:16,797
We can love one another
live for each other

212
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:21,572
From now on...

213
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,982
Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

214
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,283
Never ending love for you

215
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,157
From now on that's all l wanna do

216
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:40,891
From the first time we met l knew

217
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:46,437
l have this never ending love for you

218
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,590
After all this time of being alone

219
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:13,393
We can love one another live
for each other

220
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,958
From now on...

221
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,474
Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

222
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,773
Never ending love for you

223
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:32,373
From now on that all l wanna do

224
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,887
From the first time we met l knew

225
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:41,687
l have this never ending love for you

226
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,594
l have a never ending love for you

227
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,226
From now on that's all l wanna do

228
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:55,739
From the first time we met l knew

229
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:00,505
l have this never ending song
of love for you

230
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,651
Your singing has improved a lot

231
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,351
So, any news
about the record company's contract?

232
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,059
L'm still under-age

233
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,097
Without my parents' signature,
l can't do a thing

234
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,907
Why don't you kiss me?

235
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,459
It's better to be a rock

236
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,534
Then l don't have to go home

237
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,239
Ling Xi, l must continue to sing

238
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,142
Can you help me?

239
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,076
But your dad doesn't approve

240
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,374
l can speak to your dad about you

241
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,809
l'd rather speak to a rock

242
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,249
Well, one must try

243
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,087
Don't worry. We'll definitely try

244
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,792
Come on

245
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,259
Don't bite your nails

246
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,807
Cindy's a talented singer

247
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,542
If she gets a chance to cut a record...

248
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,709
l'm sure she'll succeed

249
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,716
Please let her sign
with the record company

250
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,685
Sure

251
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,357
You can take her there right away

252
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,430
Me? But you are her dad

253
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,159
That's right

254
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,394
You know that l'm her dad

255
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,027
Let me remind you:

256
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,538
She's still under age

257
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,734
If you try anything with her,
you might go to jail

258
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,005
Uncle, l'd appreciate some respect

259
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,914
Respect? For a loser like you?

260
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,451
Now on, you'd do well
to stay away from him

261
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,856
Anything else you've got to say?

262
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,690
Yes

263
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,963
Dad, you are so mean

264
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,899
Don't cry, Cindy

265
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,942
What's going on?

266
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,279
Please don't interfere

267
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,552
Cindy

268
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,424
What should l do now, Ling Xi?

269
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,430
You'll leave now,
or should l call the police?

270
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,669
L'll leave now

271
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,370
Don't go, Ling Xi

272
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,217
You can take her with you

273
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,982
Dad, don't force me

274
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,522
l'm forcing you?

275
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,488
If you think he's more important than
your parents...

276
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,684
then you can go with him

277
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,994
Why must l choose?

278
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,588
Because it concerns your whole life

279
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,331
Yes, that's right

280
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,840
Cindy

281
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,043
Please forgive me

282
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,583
l must go now

283
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,518
You...

284
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,813
You won't see me again?

285
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,785
How can that be?

286
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,535
Absolutely not

287
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,669
Why not?

288
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,207
She isn't happy at home

289
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,783
Why can't she move here?

290
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,243
If the world ran like you think it does...

291
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,718
everything will be so simple, huh

292
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,255
But that's the truth

293
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,882
People like you complicate things

294
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,061
A person has got to be happy

295
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,496
If not, then one should be able to choose

296
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,528
Humans live in groups

297
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,332
There are many interactions between them

298
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,840
Don't you think all that is important?

299
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,435
It seems that...

300
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,843
we have different point-of-views
on everything

301
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,314
This is tragic, dad

302
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,875
It isn't... it's all your illusion,
l'd say

303
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,755
Naive, and simple

304
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,157
Thanks for telling me

305
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,953
Ling Xi

306
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,629
If you insist

307
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,665
Go ahead

308
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,629
But l won't support you

309
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,095
You should know what l mean

310
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,270
Of course

311
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,470
You should know that...

312
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,444
l despise those,

313
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,015
who are all-talk-but-no-deed

314
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,720
Yes. At least we have one thing in common

315
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,873
l hope you don't really mean it

316
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,505
l hope so too

317
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,206
l'll introduce Cindy to you

318
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,841
You will like her

319
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,980
It doesn't matter
whether l like her or not

320
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,590
The society isn't that simple

321
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,186
You're not independent... she's under-age

322
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,494
She'll be an obstacle in your future

323
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,961
You could be quite a man

324
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,695
You could be...

325
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,135
Enough

326
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,403
l don't value materialism
and reputation like you do

327
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,279
And l've raised you
because l have those values

328
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,440
That's your business

329
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,577
Ling Xi, l could tell that
you weren't happy

330
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,016
You're much better now

331
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,183
Me too

332
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,832
Someone's at front

333
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,424
Let's take a look

334
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,442
Let's go

335
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,773
Oh no, look what we've done

336
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,044
We've disturbed them

337
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,553
Right, we should have just sneaked up

338
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,956
You're blocking the way, pal.
L want to reverse

339
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,094
When wooing chicks
you must always go forward

340
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,165
That's right

341
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,098
There's a cliff up ahead

342
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,162
Go on

343
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:07,760
If you've got guts

344
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,840
Move over, l'm making a reverse

345
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,644
Sure

346
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,878
Maybe this lady will give us a good time

347
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,585
He doesn't want to let her go

348
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,124
What was that?

349
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,128
Go

350
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,004
Ling Xi

351
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,355
Ling Xi

352
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,843
Go

353
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,484
Hurry

354
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,950
Hurry

355
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,400
What's the matter with him?

356
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,736
Move over

357
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,840
Hurry

358
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,753
Start the engine

359
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,023
Bye

360
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,232
Uncle!

361
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,474
L know l ain't looking too good, but...

362
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,313
What happened?

363
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,217
L was in a fight

364
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,979
You shouldn't

365
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,577
Our daughter's grown up,
you can't beat her up

366
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,283
It's a father's fault
not to teach properly

367
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,619
If l don't teach her a lesson now...

368
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,092
it will be too late when she's pregnant

369
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,693
She knows what she's doing

370
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,729
If she does...

371
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,668
then she wouldn't hang out with him

372
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,332
Did you see him? All swollen?

373
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,036
L can't let Cindy see him anymore

374
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,214
Cindy isn't happy at home

375
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,748
l'm afraid if she might run away

376
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,347
Really? If she chooses...

377
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,252
to leave her parents, fine

378
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,949
l'll pretend that l don't have a daughter

379
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,569
Master, there's a young girl here for you

380
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,842
Your father is with her...

381
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,125
You look pale

382
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,128
Ling Xi, l...

383
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,200
l've got to leave for the office

384
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,634
Ling Xi, l know what happened

385
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,335
...to Cindy

386
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,038
Remember, l stand firm on my decision

387
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,911
...we spoke about last night

388
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,099
Ling Xi, l got out, do you understand?

389
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,700
L left the house

390
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,504
l understand. So you're not going back?

391
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,746
L want to be with you

392
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,622
Are you sure?

393
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,350
Yes. L can sing in the bars

394
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,552
And with the money l earn,
that will sustain us

395
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,288
What are you talking about?

396
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,728
L don't need you to support me

397
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:13,866
l have a never ending love for you

398
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,840
From now on that all l wanna do

399
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:23,607
From the first time we met l knew

400
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:28,481
l have this never ending love for you

401
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:33,751
l have a never ending love for you

402
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:38,659
From now on that all l wanna do

403
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:43,597
From the first time we met l knew

404
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:48,638
l have this never ending love for you

405
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:53,301
After all this time of being alone

406
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,313
We can love one another
live for each other

407
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:03,045
From now on...

408
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:08,489
Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

409
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,892
Never ending love for you

410
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:17,764
From now on that all l wanna do

411
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,532
From the first time we met l knew

412
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,634
l have this never ending love for you

413
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,239
Mr. Ling, are you kidding?

414
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,577
No, boss. L'm serious

415
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,846
You've always said that
l'm a first-class technician

416
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,353
Yes, l did

417
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,253
You're talented, but your father...

418
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,018
Don't worry about my father

419
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,321
He has his own businesses

420
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,522
And l want to earn my own living

421
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,529
Will you hire me?

422
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,997
Sure

423
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,833
How much salary do you want?

424
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,301
Doesn't matter, but...

425
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,032
l'll need one month's salary in advance

426
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,609
Sure

427
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,327
Mr. Ling

428
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,055
Hey guys, call me Ling Xi

429
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,690
Orjust "Ah Xi"

430
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,667
l look forward to working with you

431
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,934
Sure... the same here

432
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,808
Here you go

433
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,645
Bye

434
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,946
See you

435
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,331
You know we have a lot to do?

436
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,667
No. Since l'm with you...

437
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:41,836
l'm not worried

438
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,614
We must look for a place to live first

439
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,239
We can only afford a small place

440
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,283
It doesn't matter

441
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,444
As long as we can squeeze in

442
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,290
Dad, l remember what you said

443
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,487
l've done something
you thought l couldn't do

444
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,257
If you want an apology

445
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,663
l'm sorry

446
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,428
l must take care of Cindy

447
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,437
l love her. L won't try to explain;

448
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,836
Because you might not understand...

449
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,033
the love between me and her

450
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,406
Your son-Xi

451
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,084
What do you think?

452
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,084
L like it

453
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,370
What about these two things?

454
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,999
Both are your favorites

455
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,915
But l like you more

456
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,923
What did you buy for yourself?

457
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,323
A karate jacket

458
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,170
My second favorite pastime,
other than cars

459
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,611
Show me some moves

460
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:58,578
Sure

461
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,382
Great...

462
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,717
Oh no, that was our only table!

463
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,382
We couldn't even afford chairs

464
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,158
Now we don't have the table

465
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:50,256
Don't worry, we can eat on the floor

466
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,153
Go to bed, you've had a long day

467
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,156
You must be tired

468
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,732
You...

469
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,070
l'll sleep on the floor here

470
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,798
We'll try to save up more money

471
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,707
If you can't sleep, sing for me

472
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:13,877
You are 21, l'm 16

473
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:23,188
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

474
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,626
l like the house that you put me in

475
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,894
l adore the table and the bed

476
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,801
l like the doll and the perfect guitar

477
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:38,534
l like the way you do your show

478
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:46,174
But finally l like you most of all

479
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,741
You are 21, l'm 16

480
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:58,591
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

481
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,928
Forget the clouds & the butterfly

482
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,867
Watch the star that twinkle in the sky

483
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,371
Gather the flowers and in a nice bouquet

484
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:14,274
l put all the stars into your heart

485
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:21,113
Just to show l like you most of all

486
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:25,413
You are 21, l'm 16

487
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:39,368
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

488
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,500
Ling Xi, l'll grow up very soon

489
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,580
Then l can be your good wife

490
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:37,926
You are 21, l'm 16

491
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:47,232
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

492
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,829
l like the house that you put me in

493
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,775
l adore the table and the bed

494
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,712
l like the doll and the perfect guitar

495
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:02,478
l like the way you do your show

496
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:10,254
But finally l like you most of all

497
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,955
You are 21, l'm 16

498
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:22,836
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

499
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:27,069
Forget the clouds & the butterfly

500
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,874
Watch the star that twinkle in the sky

501
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,576
Gather the flowers and in a nice bouquet

502
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,484
l put all the stars into your heart

503
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:44,720
Just to show l like you most of all

504
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,758
You are 21, l'm 16

505
00:52:49,866 --> 00:53:03,473
This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

506
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,523
Let's go to my place after
you've picked up the car

507
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,891
Is my car ready?

508
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,025
Look, still working on it

509
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:21,995
What's wrong with you people?

510
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,089
Just a small problem
& you've worked on it for days

511
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,463
It's not exactly a small problem

512
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,901
He discovered a small crack
in the main axle

513
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,369
It will take a while

514
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:33,306
Bullshit. My car is a famous make

515
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,570
A crack on the main axle?

516
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,509
Who's he? The automobile authority?

517
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,483
Ling Xi

518
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,690
Ling Xi, what's going on with you?

519
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,522
Several times your dad
has asked me about you

520
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,618
l'm fine

521
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,392
Sorry, my hands are dirty

522
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,596
Come on, let's go

523
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,069
Let me know,
l'll send someone to pick it up

524
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,634
Sure, Mr. Wang

525
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,747
Ling Xi, l'm about to leave
for U.K., you...

526
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,243
Bon Voyage

527
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,545
Let's move

528
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:26,659
You know them?

529
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,661
Classmates

530
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,730
What's the hurry?

531
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,499
L wanted to talk to Ling Xi

532
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,265
You know what he's been up to

533
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,342
Living with an under-age singer...
what a mess!

534
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:40,767
L wonder what's going on

535
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:41,434
l don't believe it

536
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,774
It's the truth, he's so thin

537
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,938
He must be using drugs

538
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,982
We better stay away from him

539
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,910
No matter what, we were good friends

540
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,454
If he's done bad things...

541
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:53,783
we should help him

542
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,318
That's easy for you to say. Think about it

543
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,484
If his dad can't persuade him, can you?

544
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,589
He likes the flirtatious type,
a songstress

545
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,663
He's not interested in you

546
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,696
What are you talking?

547
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,578
Ling Xi, are you on drugs?

548
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,283
L can barely afford regular meals

549
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,320
You knew that Mr. Wang?

550
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,014
He said you're living with a singer

551
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,750
She's under age

552
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,783
None of his business

553
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,627
None of their business

554
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,665
Ling Xi, but it concerns me

555
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,064
l don't want my staff to get into trouble

556
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,094
There won't be any

557
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,435
See, if there's something wrong
with my work...

558
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,868
l'm satisfied with your work

559
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:48,068
No troubles, remember

560
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,660
Manager, Cindy hasn't been
making a lot by singing

561
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:08,219
And besides, she has him to support.
Poor girl!

562
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:21,274
Streets full of people, all alone

563
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:28,807
Roads full of houses, never home

564
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:36,324
Church full of singing, out of tune

565
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:42,956
Everyone's gone to the moon

566
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:54,101
Everyone's gone to the moon

567
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:19,957
This is it?

568
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,007
Auntie, cousin Cindy is singing
in this club

569
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,275
l saw her, l followed her

570
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,816
l know where she lives

571
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,579
She's living with a teddy boy

572
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,016
Excuse me

573
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,820
Why would you come to places like these?

574
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:48,761
No big deal

575
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,793
If l've never been here
how can l find Cindy?

576
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,541
Got to feel that she seem younger

577
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:06,706
Lovely hair flowing free

578
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,149
As l sit there watching all

579
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:15,919
l wonder if that girl can be me

580
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,467
Loving river flows across...

581
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,593
Cindy

582
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,902
Why did she stop?

583
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,999
We were in the middle of dancing

584
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,172
What's that woman doing?

585
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,817
Cindy

586
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,700
Come home, Cindy

587
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,003
It's not too late to reform yet

588
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,912
Why? L didn't do anything wrong

589
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,781
How could you say that?

590
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,817
You hang out with a teddy-boy

591
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,783
Who?

592
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,982
Ah Qiang saw you

593
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,955
He doesn't wear anything decent

594
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,855
You must be supporting him

595
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,451
What happened to you, Cindy?

596
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,430
Cindy

597
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,398
l won't go back

598
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,174
He's like a poisonous snake

599
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,642
He won't let you go

600
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,580
We better call the police

601
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,617
You are the poisonous snakes

602
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,426
Are you alright, Cindy?

603
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:00,658
L'm fine

604
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,025
Well then. Everyone's waiting...

605
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,530
for you to go back on stage

606
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,460
l should head back

607
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:10,905
Cindy

608
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,734
Cousin

609
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:33,523
l saw Cindy. She's bugged by a Teddy Boy

610
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,531
That's Ling Xi

611
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,025
l don't want to know, she's not my child

612
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,674
Check it out

613
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,972
l heard his father runs a factory

614
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,105
Yes, l know. He's called Ling Yuanneng

615
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,116
He's a business associate of mine

616
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:56,913
What do you want?

617
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,751
Go beg him to be strict with his son

618
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,449
To let go of our Cindy

619
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,499
Fine, l'll make a fool of myself

620
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:31,785
Congratulations

621
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:32,183
Thanks

622
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,778
Even after a 20 hour flight...

623
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,653
you look pretty good

624
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,859
As long as the plane doesn't crash

625
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,291
...l'd be fine

626
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,557
Dad, Xi should know that l'm back

627
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,158
How come he's not here yet?

628
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,015
It's been 3 years,
do you think he's changed?

629
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,023
Dad

630
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,596
Let's have a chat, Ling Zhao

631
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,697
Please don't mention
your brother to your dad

632
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:24,838
Why not?

633
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:31,911
What happened to Ling Xi?

634
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,644
Was he in an accident?

635
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,452
No, he doesn't live at home anymore

636
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,163
Why don't you entertain the guests?

637
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,328
L want to speak with Yunling

638
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,832
Ling Xi, you have a visitor

639
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,508
Ling Xi

640
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,623
Brother

641
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:51,621
When did you come back?

642
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:52,659
This afternoon

643
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:56,323
Ling Xi, there's a welcome party at home

644
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,660
l want you to be there

645
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,834
So? No guts, huh?

646
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,709
L don't know the details

647
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:13,111
Everyone makes mistakes,
but it can be corrected

648
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:15,375
l didn't do anything wrong

649
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,419
You didn't? Come with me then

650
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,452
Fine, l'll go. Welcome back

651
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:31,792
Your shirt

652
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,285
Mr. Ling

653
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,858
Congratulations

654
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,326
Mr. Ling, l'm Xin Zhenqiang

655
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,062
Pleased to meet you

656
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,465
We've met before, you are...

657
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,065
Sorry, l didn't know you have guests

658
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,661
We...

659
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,505
What can l do for you?

660
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:24,319
It concerns your son, Ling Xi

661
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,380
You are...

662
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,281
l'm that miserable father

663
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,359
My daughter is with Ling Xi

664
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,420
Please tell your son
to leave my daughter alone

665
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,761
Ling Xi doesn't live here anymore

666
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,271
l'll take some legal actions

667
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,838
Do you think
you can avoid responsibilities?

668
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,100
L'm going to hire a lawyer...

669
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,799
and declare that l've disowned my son

670
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,744
Sorry to disturb you

671
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,444
Dad, look whom l've brought here

672
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,688
Mr. Ling, you're a man of status

673
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,487
l couldn't believe that you lied

674
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,094
What are you doing back?

675
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,234
Ling Xi, let me warn you...

676
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,305
If you don't bring my daughter back,
l'll sue you

677
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:18,537
Don't hit him

678
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,700
What? L'm not hitting a human

679
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,175
He's an animal

680
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:23,840
Cindy is not even 16

681
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,243
And they are living together

682
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:31,149
Ling Xi, tell me it's not true

683
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:38,055
We're living together

684
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,230
And we're happy

685
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,231
You...

686
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,309
He threw his own life down the drain

687
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,079
He's been brought up in a good family

688
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,814
He's supported by a singer. So shameless

689
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,216
His next step might be towards a murder

690
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,855
2 boys from same family.
His brother is doing so well

691
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,429
He'll end up in jail if he keeps this up

692
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,224
He deserves to be locked up

693
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,266
...more than anyone

694
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:23,203
Shameless teddy-boy, living off a girl

695
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,636
Loser, useless, hopeless...

696
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,109
Shameless, good-for-nothing

697
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,077
lives off a girl

698
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,648
Goes to jail...

699
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:38,977
Ruffian, teddy boy

700
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,687
Ling Xi

701
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,593
Ling Xi

702
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,127
Let him go

703
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,247
Mr. Xin, don't worry

704
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,345
l'll bring back your daughter

705
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,516
What are you doing?

706
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,224
Hereafter l don't want to see you around

707
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,066
Look at yourself

708
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,659
What?

709
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,671
Lives off a girl?

710
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,745
Move over, we're running a business here

711
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,820
Don't block our way

712
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,920
So? What have l done to you?

713
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,097
Let go

714
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,362
If l see you here again...

715
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,730
l'll fire Cindy

716
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,667
Look, one mention of Cindy

717
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,265
...and he has nothing to say

718
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,338
What would he live on
if Cindy's not working?

719
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,391
Get hold of him

720
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,825
Go, come on

721
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,504
Stop it, Ling Xi

722
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,105
Ling Xi

723
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,078
Ling Xi

724
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:29,682
Ling Xi

725
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,165
Freeze

726
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,125
Stand still

727
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,240
There he is

728
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,074
Dad, l think this is a bit too much

729
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:01,520
"...disowning his son..."

730
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,217
Read this before you judge me

731
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,975
Ling Xi, get up. Time to work

732
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,781
Get up

733
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,286
Forget it. What happened last night...

734
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,793
It's going to be in the papers

735
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,495
Guess the garage
won't be keeping me anymore

736
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:49,557
"Teddy Boy Rages a Night Club"

737
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,394
"Young Songstress
boards the Police Car in Tears"

738
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,694
How could they write that!

739
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,230
Who cares what they say

740
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,264
How many people...

741
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,207
would want to find out the truth?

742
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,177
They judge people
without much understanding

743
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,161
"Notice on Mr. Ling Yuanneng
disowning his son"

744
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,827
Punks like him should be put in jail

745
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,534
Not only that we'll need to find work

746
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:08,735
...we'll also need to find
a new place to live

747
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,403
Let them be

748
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,975
This is your revenge to the society

749
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:17,882
l don't want a revenge

750
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,647
It's just the way l live

751
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,149
They are against me

752
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,782
But l don't care

753
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,687
Get in the car, Ling Xi

754
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,001
You must be Cindy, right?

755
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,417
L don't know how to address him now

756
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,046
He used to be my elder brother

757
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:57,590
Get in

758
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,495
What are you doing?

759
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,311
Cindy, this is your home

760
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,607
l'm sending you home

761
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,347
You... No

762
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,843
Don't touch her, Ling Zhao

763
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,650
She's a good girl,
she shouldn't be with you

764
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,220
She can choose...

765
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,224
who she wants to be with

766
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,554
No one can speak for her

767
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,026
She doesn't know what she's doing now

768
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,495
How do you know?

769
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,691
It's hard to judge...

770
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,324
whether one's mature enough

771
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:16,529
But legally, she's under age

772
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,666
Damn the law

773
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:19,869
Come on

774
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,209
Move away

775
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:22,701
You...

776
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:29,108
Don't make me beat you, Ling Zhao

777
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,116
You can try

778
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,365
Cindy

779
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,162
Cindy

780
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,641
Cindy

781
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:16,426
Cindy

782
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,195
Ling Xi

783
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:19,926
Come with us

784
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,865
Drag her inside

785
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,762
Cindy, go home

786
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,542
Call the police if you have to

787
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:31,202
Thanks

788
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:31,938
Ling Xi

789
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:32,979
Come with us, Cindy

790
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,811
l don't want to go home

791
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:51,591
Cindy

792
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,689
Come with us

793
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,665
l don't want to return

794
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,293
Come on, Cindy

795
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:56,798
Go on

796
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,536
No, l don't want to go home

797
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:05,977
Hurry

798
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,404
Ling Xi, l hope you'll get back
on the right track

799
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,634
l didn't do anything wrong

800
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:22,845
Take a look

801
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:24,818
Get down...

802
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,161
Ling Zhao

803
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,670
Can you stay on for a few more days?

804
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:55,211
No, it's the beginning of the semester

805
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:57,444
What do you want me to do?

806
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,684
You're leaving tomorrow

807
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:03,690
But Ling Xi won't be out in another 3 days

808
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:06,027
l think you should go pick him up

809
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,755
Talk to him, try to persuade him

810
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,526
What's the point?

811
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,232
He insists that
he didn't do anything wrong

812
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,635
He won't listen to me

813
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,638
Ling Xi doesn't admit that he's wrong

814
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,236
How can he make things right?

815
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:29,349
Dad is ignoring the whole thing

816
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:32,682
But l know he's worried about it

817
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,819
Everyone's worried

818
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,950
Ling Xi, get back on the right track

819
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,561
l didn't do anything wrong

820
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,562
You beat up two cops

821
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,972
Hu Bing

822
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:32,772
l don't want to see you again

823
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,113
If l don't get caught, you won't

824
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,152
Ling Xi, look, everyone's here

825
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:17,884
Come look for me should you need help

826
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:23,928
Ling Xi

827
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,766
Just leave, l don't need pity

828
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,162
You...

829
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:37,944
l need to be understood;
Don't you get it?

830
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,417
At least you admit that you don't

831
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:51,023
But the others with their own opinions

832
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,150
They think they understand

833
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,488
Ling Xi, who are you talking about?

834
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,656
You throw your own life away

835
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,288
You have ruined your own name

836
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:01,795
It's our bad luck
to have a classmate like you

837
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,704
What?

838
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,802
Ling Xi, you want to get locked up again?

839
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,613
It's your fault. Why did you drag us here?

840
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:14,647
L've already told you

841
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,046
He's hopeless

842
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,223
Ling Xi, are you mad?

843
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:28,091
No, miss. It's my fault

844
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:33,728
Since everyone says that it's my fault

845
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,826
l've just got to admit it

846
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:39,373
Just run, or l might rape you

847
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:42,269
Get out

848
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,883
Go

849
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,311
Get out

850
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:50,503
Is that him?

851
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:56,869
L recognize him.
His picture was in the paper

852
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,705
How's your songstress girlfriend?

853
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:10,050
Playing tough, huh?

854
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,560
Brother Zhou, his name is Ling Xi

855
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:22,701
What can you do?

856
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,633
Drive, fix the cars

857
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,238
What do you do?

858
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,313
Us?

859
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:35,513
We do big business

860
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:43,748
Good, we could use you

861
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,123
And l could use you

862
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,359
Interested in fighting?

863
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,591
You...

864
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,568
Yes, it's me.
The guy who lives off a woman

865
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,366
What do you want?

866
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,455
Why should l do now?

867
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,614
No...

868
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:39,484
Let's go

869
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,821
Come on

870
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:09,050
Look, Cindy.
It's lucky that you're not with him

871
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,350
Just imagine

872
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:14,757
"Violent gang robs night club"

873
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,594
Don't believe this, it's not true

874
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:22,902
"Manager beaten up"

875
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:24,335
"Suspect Ling Xi wanted by Police"

876
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,677
Ling Xi, l could use your help today

877
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:44,083
Get me a car

878
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,679
l thought we were just supposed to
pick a fight

879
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:48,652
Why did you rob the place?

880
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:51,384
Otherwise what would we live on?

881
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:54,118
L need a car

882
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:57,320
Open up, it's police

883
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,192
Open up

884
01:34:01,035 --> 01:34:02,263
The door?

885
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,234
Hurry

886
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:11,243
Stand still

887
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:12,273
Over there

888
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,210
Hands up

889
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:14,803
Stand still

890
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,345
Hands in the air

891
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:19,917
Over there

892
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,151
Don't move

893
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,557
Stop washing your face

894
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,057
No water can cleanse your faults

895
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:33,364
He's the one

896
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:38,900
Don't move

897
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:53,213
Put down your gun, Xiao Zhou

898
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,287
Let's go

899
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,723
Ling Xi, this is your last chance

900
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,166
Hand over the gun, and await your trial

901
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:14,372
Squat down

902
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:21,907
Let's go

903
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,093
If not for Ling Xi earlier...

904
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:01,477
Hand over the gun to the police

905
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:14,790
Go

906
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:42,289
Stop it

907
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,022
Ling Xi, you should know that...

908
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:46,565
we'll listen to Brother Zhou

909
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:47,565
Don't try to be smart

910
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:51,668
Hand over the gun to the police

911
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:54,565
You can't kill

912
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,632
Who wants to kill?

913
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:57,438
But with this gun...

914
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,240
we could've achieved a lot more

915
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,083
l'll kill you first if you keep nagging

916
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:20,863
Have you got the bullets?

917
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,286
Go

918
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:49,254
Robbery

919
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:36,836
Where are you going?

920
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:37,968
Wait

921
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:38,976
Bye

922
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,730
So, you do smile

923
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:38,236
l've never seen you smile before

924
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,877
Special report by the police

925
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,714
The police urges the public
to watch out for Ling Xi

926
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:55,516
He and his accomplices
robbed a police revolver

927
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,420
He's allegedly connected to
three accounts of robbery

928
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:01,153
The police say
he is considered highly dangerous

929
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:03,058
The police has intensified their search

930
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,063
Should you have any information,
please contact...

931
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:26,911
We ought to try our hand at something big

932
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,141
Ling Xi

933
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:36,986
Ling Xi

934
01:41:42,996 --> 01:41:43,894
Brother Zhou's talking to you

935
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,503
Get a car

936
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:54,166
A good one, luxurious sedan

937
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:56,265
You've already hurt two men

938
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:58,139
You might kill someone next

939
01:41:58,679 --> 01:41:59,976
What if l do?

940
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,414
No, l'm backing out

941
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:07,619
Ling Xi, you're not a friend

942
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:09,188
You've got your share already

943
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:11,748
l just think this is getting too messy

944
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:14,327
l didn't do anything wrong...

945
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:17,787
in the beginning.
But now l'm getting trapped

946
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:19,627
Damn it, even you're educated

947
01:42:19,733 --> 01:42:21,030
But you're the same as the rest of us

948
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:30,974
So what if your dad's rich?

949
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:32,436
Don't mention my dad

950
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:41,848
Just go get the car ready

951
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,286
Give me the bullets

952
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:51,998
What do you want?

953
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:55,494
Selling us out to the police, huh?

954
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,402
L...

955
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:06,711
l might turn myself in

956
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,650
Ling Xi, run

957
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:18,988
Damn

958
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:05,698
Ling Xi, get down here

959
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,102
Or l'll shoot

960
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:20,444
Sounds like a shoot-out

961
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:21,452
No way

962
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:23,747
Call the cops

963
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,132
Go

964
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:17,307
Ling Xi, you've been surrounded

965
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:19,003
Surrender and drop your gun

966
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,040
Looks like they're fighting each other

967
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:23,875
Get the marine police to help

968
01:46:23,977 --> 01:46:25,035
Yes, sir

969
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:31,010
Ling Xi, you can't get away. Surrender now

970
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:33,052
This is your last chance

971
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:04,506
Last warning, surrender now

972
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:08,577
Surrender

973
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:37,199
Go, Ling Xi

974
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:35,272
Maybe he tried to break away from them

975
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:36,712
But it's too late
