1
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,177
- Thanks a lot, man.
- You bet.

2
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,095
- Cool. Take care.
- You, too.

3
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:36,147
Harp, how's it goin', brother?

4
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:47,364
Robin, baby, I got some good news.

5
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:51,034
- Try this. Tell me what you think.
- Come on, girl. You know...

6
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:55,540
Grilled ginger shrimp
with cranberry-orange-mango chutney.

7
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:59,291
- Damn, that's good.
- Yeah, man, 'tis good.

8
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:08,754
Thanks for letting me use your kitchen.
I almost died when my stove broke.

9
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,631
No problem, baby.

10
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,050
But then I remembered
what a loving boyfriend I have.

11
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,848
Sorry about the mess.

12
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,805
I have three jobs goin' on at once here.

13
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,767
- It's so crazy.
- So I see.

14
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,771
What's the news?

15
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,488
What's the dealie, yo?

16
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:36,949
Oprah Winfrey wants my new book,
Unfinished Business...

17
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:40,455
for her January
Book of the Month Club Show.

18
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,996
- You're kidding.
- I ain't kiddin'.

19
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:45,794
Oh, my God! Your first novel?

20
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,669
I was nervous when I heard
she wanted to read a preview copy.

21
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,837
But she read it and loved it.

22
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,586
- When's the release date?
- We go into print next month.

23
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:59,759
Oh, baby! I'm so happy for you.

24
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,054
I'm so happy for you!

25
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,512
That is so great. So great.

26
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,563
- I'm on my way, girl.
- The callaloo.

27
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,651
I missed you.

28
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,533
I'm glad you decided to come back
to town before heading to New York.

29
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,536
Yeah. Me, too, baby.

30
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,503
Did I tell you about the
20-city book tour I got going?

31
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:41,875
I'm psyched. I gotta make sure
my shit's on point, though.

32
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,169
- Harper, come on.
- "Harper, come on," what?

33
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:48,965
You never live enough for today.

34
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,935
For once, just enjoy the moment.

35
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,727
At least for a little while?

36
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,604
I got to stay focused.

37
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,815
All work and no play
makes Harper a very dull boy.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,234
- Yeah, whatever, man.
- "Yeah, whatever, man."

39
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,271
You're not feelin' me, huh?

40
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:10,447
I felt you getting your freak on a
couple minutes ago. That's what I felt.

41
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:13,370
- Only with you.
- That's what I like to hear.

42
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,624
Oh, girl.

43
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,540
I could be like this
with you forever, Harper.

44
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:25,209
What?

45
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,497
Relax.

46
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,137
All I mean is that I
love being with you.

47
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,217
You said yourself I was the
best girlfriend you ever had.

48
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,678
You've never been with somebody
this long or had this much fun.

49
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,894
Face it. We fit together.

50
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,057
- Yeah, but...
- You love me, don't you?

51
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,647
Of course I do. But
it's not that simple.

52
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,613
It is to me.

53
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,698
Dead silence.

54
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,246
Nice. Excuse me.

55
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,121
What's "Excuse me"? Wait.

56
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,043
No. I think I'll get some sleep.

57
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,415
Wait, Robin.

58
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,402
Honey, about last night. I didn't...

59
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:40,437
Harper, it's okay. I know you love me.

60
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,365
- I do, you know.
- I'm not insecure.

61
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:47,524
- I just have doubts sometimes.
- About what?

62
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,241
Like this wedding reunion
with your friends.

63
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,289
I don't know what I'm walking into.

64
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,494
Oh, baby! They are gonna love you.

65
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:59,255
Don't worry. They are gonna love you.
You'll be fine.

66
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,501
- Really?
- Really.

67
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,000
Even Kendall?

68
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:11,426
I can't believe you're jealous of
a character I wrote in my book.

69
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:14,352
Not just a character. An icon. An ideal.

70
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,388
Your soul mate. Jackson's soul mate.

71
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,316
- She's nothing like me.
- She's not like anybody.

72
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:28,107
She is a combination of a bunch of women
that I knew in college.

73
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:32,402
- Why would I lie to you about that?
- I don't know. That's what scares me.

74
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:37,234
Okay, here it is. Here is the drama.

75
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,995
I thought I had finally avoided it
in this relationship.

76
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,041
I'm not perfect.

77
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,997
Could we stop talking
about this, please?

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,671
I had to let you know how I feel.

79
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,877
- Are you still coming to the wedding?
- Of course I am.

80
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:54,334
Nothing has changed about that.

81
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:57,796
I want you to have fun.

82
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:00,548
Hang out with your boys, reminisce.

83
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:04,386
I'll still be there on Sunday.

84
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:06,603
That's great. Fine. Good.

85
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:15,817
Atlantic Airlines welcomes you
to New York City's La Guardia Airport.

86
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:18,442
I'm coming!

87
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,582
Harper!

88
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,083
Murch! My man!

89
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:41,375
It's the Doug Banks Show
with DeDe McGuire.

90
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,885
Can you believe those Giants?
Lance Sullivan, my man!

91
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:48,222
That man really is. He's fine.
Big old chocolate thing.

92
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,559
- No, DeDe, he's a good football player.
- I know. I'm a fan.

93
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,601
Right. Here's Lauryn Hill.

94
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,728
What do you say about that?
So, they're fine.

95
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,767
They're young, that's all.

96
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:01,393
And I had to take a gun away
from one kid last week.

97
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,695
Hell, no! A gun?

98
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,782
Damn it, Murch!

99
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,400
Didn't the firm you worked for last
summer offer you a six-figure salary?

100
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,866
- Yes, they did.
- So what's up?

101
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,912
I have to pass the bar first.

102
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,535
Whatever, man.

103
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,703
Brother, all I'm saying is,
if you're gonna be stressed...

104
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:22,795
get paid for it, man.

105
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,631
Now you sound like Shelby.

106
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,832
Shelby.

107
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,673
Lockdown!

108
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,680
You are lucky I love you
like an adopted brother.

109
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,801
I'm playing. Shelby's cool.

110
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,223
You certainly didn't make her sound cool
in your book.

111
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,355
I mean, not that I read your book.

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,063
- You read my book?
- No.

113
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,192
- How did you get ahold of my book?
- I don't have your book. Jordan does.

114
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,902
Jordan has my book?

115
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:58,695
Camera two,
I need a close-up on Dr. Gayle.

116
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:01,320
Zoom in slowly, slowly.

117
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,783
Great. Hold it right there.

118
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:06,412
Camera one, stand by
for audience reaction.

119
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,874
Give me audience reaction, camera one.

120
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,049
Jordan Armstrong.

121
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:17,417
She's already runnin' things, ain't she?

122
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,546
You should not be surprised.

123
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,469
She's the only one more driven
than you are.

124
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,380
That's all right.

125
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:29,268
- When's the last time you saw Jordan?
- Last March, actually.

126
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:32,731
We didn't have much time to hang
'cause she had a deadline.

127
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,774
And I had to move...

128
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,609
What, nigger?

129
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,942
You, my brother,
are withholding information.

130
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,527
Here we go.

131
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:47,115
You and Jordan got busy
in undergrad, didn't you?

132
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,614
No, we didn't.

133
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:52,116
What about the book?
Jackson and Kendall.

134
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,917
That's you two. I know it!

135
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:57,452
They picked the prime opportunity
to make grass sandwiches.

136
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,373
"A passionate night
of lovemaking so intense..."

137
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,218
I know my words.
Embellishment sells books.

138
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,462
So, then what really happened?

139
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:13,381
- Nothin'.
- You are lying! I know it.

140
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,347
- Out with it.
- What?

141
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,512
- Tell me. Tell me.
- Nothing.

142
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:25,685
It was senior year during finals.

143
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,677
The year-end issue was
off to the printer

144
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,783
and the staff had left for the night.

145
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:34,567
We both had studying to do,
but we were mad tired.

146
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:38,540
Only Stevie Wonder
was gonna help us that night.

147
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:15,537
- And you didn't tell any of us?
- There wasn't much to tell.

148
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,701
And you know, you can't keep a secret.

149
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:20,462
What do you mean I can't keep a secret?

150
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:23,713
Were you supposed to tell me
that you had my book?

151
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,010
Just finish the story.

152
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:03,284
In retrospect, it was one of those
moments you wish you could have back.

153
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:07,745
- But at the time, it just wasn't right.
- Wasn't right?

154
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:10,121
- No.
- You two are ridiculous.

155
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:11,127
Why?

156
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:14,714
You forget. She was off to LA
to do that internship...

157
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,794
I was headed straight to grad school.

158
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:21,429
In other words, the two control freaks
couldn't lose control and get freaky?

159
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,435
I almost forgot how corny you could be.

160
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,141
Almost.

161
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:32,765
- I thought it was a good play on words.
- It was kind of corny.

162
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:34,016
Okay.

163
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:38,940
Jordan, stop it.

164
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:41,155
This is business.

165
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,150
This is your boy. This
is strictly business.

166
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,651
- It's all good. You don't have...
- Good job.

167
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:49,416
Thanks, Anita. I think it was good,
but we could've...

168
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,697
Is that him?

169
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:55,450
Yes, indeed. That is Harper Stewart,
Lance Sullivan's best man.

170
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:59,211
You sure we can't get a camera
at that wedding? It could be huge.

171
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,583
I know. I've been working on that,
but they're adamant about it.

172
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:03,840
Keep trying.

173
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,551
Right.

174
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,129
You ready?

175
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,098
Ready.

176
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,606
- Here she is.
- Harper Stewart.

177
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,647
Jordan Armstrong.

178
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:29,029
I've always enjoyed your writing.
But that book of yours? You nailed it.

179
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,991
And your girl here. Talk about a fan.

180
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,946
She's got her nose
in that preview copy every moment.

181
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,872
It's my job to keep up
with what's current.

182
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,498
Of course you do.

183
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,790
Can we get you on Teen Summit,
or profile you on Tonight With Tavis?

184
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:46,915
- Absolutely. Sure. I would like that.
- Great.

185
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,499
We'll get Jordan to produce it.
What do you think?

186
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:52,084
Absolutely. We've got the inside track.

187
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,970
This is gonna be fabulous.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

188
00:14:57,057 --> 00:15:00,427
- I've got to run. Take care, Harper.
- All right. Bye-bye.

189
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,768
That's gonna be Jordan
in a little while.

190
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:07,429
- She's well on her way.
- True.

191
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:10,059
Come on, now. Give me love.

192
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:12,237
Yeah, of course.

193
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:17,655
Okay. Yeah. So, you know...

194
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:22,445
Like Anita was saying,
we want to get you in the studio.

195
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,955
You know me. I'm all yours.

196
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:31,831
Right.

197
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,962
Yeah. So, you guys ready to go?

198
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:40,636
I'll talk to you later. 'Bye.
Damn, this wedding shit! It never ends.

199
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,759
- Who wants ham hocks?
- Lance's uncles.

200
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,133
Mia's cousins have the nerve
to be calling me, driving me nuts...

201
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,384
asking me to hook them up with guys.

202
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,929
- You should introduce them to Quentin.
- I did. Big mistake.

203
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,353
He's got the poor girls open.

204
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,358
- Charming motherfucker.
- That's what he's good at.

205
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:01,526
If they gave college credit for that,
he'd have his Ph.D. By now.

206
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,982
You know, Dr. Feelgood has your book.

207
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:08,700
Quentin has my book?

208
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,266
- Go on, baby.
- Quentin Spivey!

209
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:08,375
Quentin Spivey from
our nation's capital.

210
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:13,045
I'm gonna have to do a story on him.

211
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:15,667
- I'll be right back.
- All right, cool.

212
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:17,678
- You want a drink?
- No.

213
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,712
- What's wrong with you?
- You talk too much.

214
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,554
- See you later. Peace.
- Why'd you tell him everything?

215
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,687
So, Q, what's up with the guitar?

216
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:33,436
This? Just a little something
to add to the repertoire.

217
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:37,693
- You know a nigger got gifts.
- The nigger's scatterbrained.

218
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,406
I had to pull strings to get you
that photography gig at the Post.

219
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:44,529
- What happened?
- Don't get all bent.

220
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,782
You know I read your book.

221
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:50,328
I heard. So?

222
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,751
So, you got skills, Joe.

223
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:58,088
I ain't gonna front.
You about to blow the fuck up.

224
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,905
Get me wanting to
be a writer and shit.

225
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,093
See, man, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

226
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,969
First it was photography.
Then you got this music thing going.

227
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:11,005
Back in January,
you wanted to direct music videos.

228
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:15,141
- Now you want to be a writer.
- Don't sweat none of that shit, Joe.

229
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,481
Seriously, that book is like that.

230
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,899
I still think you might have exaggerated
a brother's character a little bit.

231
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:27,819
My Mama not being around ain't got shit
to do with how I treat these bitches.

232
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,817
How do you know I'm talkin' about you?

233
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,826
Come on, now.
Give a nigger some credit, all right?

234
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:37,950
I ain't stupid. I was more focused
than that when I was in school.

235
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,785
You're still in school.

236
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,875
But I'm sayin'...

237
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,456
couldn't you have embellished
a nigger a little bit?

238
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,465
Ain't that that buttery shit
about being a writer?

239
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,132
You know, rewritin' history?

240
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:56,757
Tailorin' shit to fit
your own ideal self?

241
00:18:56,976 --> 00:19:00,593
I know where you're going,
so just chill with that.

242
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,769
The frontal lobe, shorty?

243
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:07,227
- Ain't nothin' there. Just leave it be.
- All I'm sayin' is...

244
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:10,189
it brought back some wild memories.

245
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,155
You know, shit I ain't thought about
in years.

246
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,989
Know what I'm sayin'?

247
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,610
Yeah, man. Where's the book now?

248
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,835
Running back!

249
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,475
- You know what? You play too much.
- You're spilling your stuff.

250
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,725
- That was a great show.
- Thank you.

251
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,610
Can you imagine? Look at him.

252
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,106
L-Boogie!

253
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:03,695
- They love him in the Big Apple.
- You know they're talkin' Super Bowl.

254
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,443
What are they now? 6 and 0?

255
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,570
He's been carryin' them
all the way to the bye week.

256
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,326
We gotta move back here.
I got you all set up back here.

257
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,750
- I'm gonna go get the superstar.
- What you up to?

258
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:21,673
- I'm not up to anything.
- Still got your mama's jacket on.

259
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,583
Will you stop, you two?

260
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:27,255
- Excuse me. Mr. Lance Sullivan?
- Thank you.

261
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,885
- Harper, man! What's up?
- How you feelin'?

262
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:34,508
- I'm all right, but I am stressed.
- You ought to be.

263
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:37,685
Why are you planning a wedding
in the middle of the season?

264
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,476
- You got Dallas next week.
- I wasn't even thinking.

265
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,356
It's what the little lady wanted.

266
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,015
The best man is here.
I'm gonna hook you up.

267
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,317
I'll get you over that
broom if it kills me.

268
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,065
Good to see you, man.

269
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,231
How are you?

270
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:55,702
- Sorry I missed your show.
- Congratulations, big man.

271
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:58,952
- You doing all right?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,873
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

273
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,989
Julian!

274
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,537
Hi, Shel.

275
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:09,380
Hello, honey.

276
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,591
Well, well, well.
The gang's all here, back in effect.

277
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:19,589
- Break out the forties.
- Hey, Shelby.

278
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,676
It's nice to see all of you, too.

279
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:27,306
Harper Stewart.

280
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:32,353
- Richard Wrong, Langston Snooze.
- Hi, Shelby.

281
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:35,901
I heard about your book,
and I don't think it's cute.

282
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:40,860
Next time you want to characterize me
in one of your projects, do me a favor.

283
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:43,366
- What would that be?
- Don't.

284
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:48,287
Drive me to Saks. I can't decide
what I should wear for the wedding.

285
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,957
- I thought you were wearing...
- No, no. I decided against that.

286
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,419
I thought I told you I had plans.

287
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:59,880
What kind of plans?

288
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:03,466
- I'm hanging out with the guys tonight.
- Honey, that can wait.

289
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:07,551
You have all weekend for that.
This'll only take a few hours. Come on.

290
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:17,770
I see.

291
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,726
It's "Gang up on Shelby" day.

292
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:22,607
Fine.

293
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:25,822
If you'd rather be with them than me,
that's fine.

294
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:28,277
Here it comes.

295
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,952
Am I being that unreasonable?

296
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,155
No.

297
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:40,085
Honey, no. No, no. I'm sorry.

298
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,501
Murch, we'll catch up with you later.

299
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,628
Yeah, I'll see you guys later.

300
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:47,467
- Baby, you're the best.
- She be givin' young one drama.

301
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,634
- Seven years of the same shit.
- She makes it hard for sisters.

302
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,341
- I know she gotta have a LoJack on him.
- Harper!

303
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,052
I'm watching you.

304
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,109
Damn, Lance.

305
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,361
- That contract is fat, huh?
- Obese, player.

306
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,055
- Hey, mama.
- Come here.

307
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:43,175
It's so good to see you.

308
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:46,475
- How are you?
- I'm good. You look really great.

309
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,304
- So do you.
- How can you tell?

310
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:50,685
You got him so hemmed up.

311
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,973
Lance, shut up. Don't
pay him any mind.

312
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,544
I won't.

313
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:55,937
I don't see why you
love this fool so much.

314
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,399
He ain't shit. You ain't shit, dog.

315
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,653
It's because he's a true friend.

316
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:04,741
And he dedicated his first novel to us.

317
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:09,077
- So you read my book, too.
- No, but I heard great things.

318
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:10,785
That's good.

319
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,666
When's that girlfriend coming?
I can't wait to meet her.

320
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,917
- You've kept this one under wraps.
- And for good reason.

321
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,338
Bringing her around y'all
might taint her image of me.

322
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:22,923
She's comin' on Sunday.

323
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:25,458
You're always so secretive, Harper.

324
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:30,881
Oh, no! Look at the size of this rock!
I'm gonna go blind lookin' at it.

325
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:34,058
She's got to do finger curls
just to hold that mug up.

326
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:36,473
- Stop it, y'all.
- Don't be jelly.

327
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:38,769
Nothin's too good for my little Mia.

328
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,015
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

329
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:45,727
Damn. Would you cut it out
with that Leave It To Beaver shit?

330
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,942
What happened, Mia?
You called me earlier.

331
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,699
The caterer's trippin'...

332
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:54,117
the florist screwed up the order
and Mama hasn't found a dress.

333
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,991
Girlfriend, don't worry.
Superwoman is here.

334
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,658
- All right.
- Let's go.

335
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:02,581
Y'all hurry. We ain't got all night.
Got men stuff to do, right?

336
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,290
Lance, go away.
Show Harper the rest of the house.

337
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,337
- Come on, cat.
- All right, man.

338
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,257
- It's great to see you, Harper.
- You too, sweetie.

339
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,126
This is where we're gonna put
the big screen with that DVD system.

340
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,680
Yeah, front page, kid.

341
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,857
We were almost used the one
of you draggin' those five dudes...

342
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,860
over the goal line,
but we thought this told it all.

343
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:36,314
I'm surprised you took the holy road.
You're not a spiritual person.

344
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:39,989
You know I'm not into that mess.
It's just about the story.

345
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:43,490
Someday you'll believe in my God.
Our God.

346
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,035
- Whatever, man.
- What's up?

347
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,998
You got to tell me, man.
What happened in Pittsburgh?

348
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:54,170
- Dog, twins. Two sets.
- Shut up.

349
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:58,083
Yes. They were waiting for me
in the hotel room, right?

350
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:02,963
This agent sent them. They had these
big-ass titties, like punching bags.

351
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:07,674
- Four of them?
- Four was nice. It was nice.

352
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,812
- Praise the Lord and pass the panties.
- Words to live by, dog.

353
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,636
Harper?

354
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,435
I don't mean to interrupt,
but here are the ads.

355
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,149
I convinced Friday's to place one...

356
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:21,105
provided it's next
to Lance Sullivan's photo.

357
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:24,280
You got Friday's. Cool. Okay.
Thank you, Mia.

358
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:27,901
Pardon me. I'm Mia Morgan.

359
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,361
The pleasure's all mine, baby.

360
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,611
How nice. But what is your name?

361
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:34,907
This is Lance Sullivan.

362
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:37,197
You're Lance Sullivan!

363
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:41,124
I apologize. I didn't recognize you.
You look bigger on television.

364
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,131
Harper, I gotta get to Econ...

365
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:48,502
but I can take those deposits
to the bank if you want.

366
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:51,555
Thank you, Mia.

367
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,429
That was a great game on Saturday.

368
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:56,805
Okay. So, you've seen me play.

369
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:00,062
- I love the game.
- She's seen me play.

370
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,025
I think you'd get more yardage
if you used your offensive line more.

371
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,897
And you would want to stop planting
so hard on turf.

372
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:12,522
Your knees won't last through
junior year if you keep that up.

373
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,654
Just think about it.

374
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,159
- Okay. See ya.
- 'Bye, Mia.

375
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:24,617
- Who is that? Is that you, player?
- No. We're just friends.

376
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,042
- Word has it, she's savin' it.
- A virgin?

377
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:31,209
- Yeah, man.
- Really, man? You got to hook me!

378
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,376
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yes.

379
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:38,342
She's a good girl. She comes to work
on time, she's dependable. No.

380
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,801
Come on. She could be Mrs. Sullivan.

381
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,787
So could those four
freaks from Pittsburgh

382
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,058
with the saddle-back
titties, bionic dick.

383
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:47,343
I got ya.

384
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:49,763
You gonna pay for that though.

385
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,942
There you go.

386
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,400
The station will buy
us lunch tomorrow.

387
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,359
I'll pick you up around 11:00.

388
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:59,316
Splendid, Ms. Armstrong.
That fits well into my schedule.

389
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll call to confirm.

390
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,857
So, what, a sister
can't be professional?

391
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:07,619
Here we go.
I guess some things never change.

392
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,114
Change is overrated, Harper.

393
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,864
All you had to do was ask me
for a copy of my book.

394
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,751
You wouldn't have given it to me.

395
00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:18,454
True. But at least I would have known
that you were interested.

396
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:21,630
Don't play yourself, Harper.

397
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:25,003
I want the exclusive. You can save
the sloppy seconds for Oprah.

398
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:28,595
If that's the case, how come you
can't look at me in my face?

399
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:38,272
Harper, why'd you really leave your girl
at home this weekend?

400
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,584
'Cause I wanted to hang
out with the guys.

401
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:44,434
You know, cut up with the boys...

402
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,028
before she came, that's all.
It's been a while. You know?

403
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,578
Good night, Harper.

404
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:55,984
Damn.

405
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:59,825
Come on, Harp! Let's go!

406
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,979
I'm about to run a
Boston on you niggers.

407
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,870
Y'all about to be set.

408
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:11,378
Do you always have to talk trash?
Come on. It's just a game.

409
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:16,011
- That's what all punk-ass losers say.
- Easy, Mojo, leave the boy alone.

410
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:18,303
"Mojo." I haven't heard that in a clip.

411
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:20,051
"Mo" to the "jo."

412
00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:23,144
That's what I'll be puttin' on my ladies
when I do my thing.

413
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,771
Got them turned the hell out.

414
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:28,474
They be makin' breakfast for this fool,
buyin' him jewelry.

415
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:32,066
Then they try to figure out why,
'cause they really hate his yellow ass.

416
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:34,478
Then he drops them like a bad habit.

417
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,409
Hold up, man.

418
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:42,616
I know you ain't talkin' about a
nigger leavin' a whore strung out.

419
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:46,203
- True. You're the serial monogamist.
- Serial what?

420
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,726
Yes.

421
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:49,161
Nigger, you be having
these girlfriends.

422
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:52,455
Better yet, these jive-ass
public relationships.

423
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:55,333
Talkin' about, "This
is my queen" and shit.

424
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:59,511
And the first moment she steps out
of your little boundary, she's gone.

425
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,005
Dismissed with the quicks.

426
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:05,306
That's because none of them
have ever measured up to Jordan.

427
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,726
Excellent point, Counsel Murchison.

428
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:12,646
There it is right there. Sustained.

429
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,767
- Get out of here!
- You know that's true.

430
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,481
Jordan's the best
girlfriend you never had.

431
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,239
Wait. Did you guys know they kissed
in undergrad?

432
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,895
Up in the newsroom. I remember that.

433
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:28,118
- You knew about that?
- Yeah, we knew about that shit.

434
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,112
You know damn well
you can't keep a secret.

435
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,533
That is so messed up.

436
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:39,200
- Come on, man.
- Is that the case there?

437
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,213
You waitin' for Jordan to slow down
from that career path...

438
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,130
- for the Harper rest stop?
- You're trippin'. Let's play the game.

439
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,887
I still can't believe you
ain't never hit that.

440
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:49,884
Me, neither.

441
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:53,221
Hey, y'all.
I'm in a very fulfilling relationship.

442
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:57,389
A virtually drama-free two
years tomorrow. Okay?

443
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,559
That's right. She's a stand-up comic.

444
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,224
No, no. She makes jewelry.

445
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:05,977
- She is a teacher.
- She is a caterer, goddamn it!

446
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,193
For the last time.

447
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:12,150
It took her a while
to find her creative niche.

448
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,738
She found it. She's a caterer.

449
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,400
I can definitely relate to that one.

450
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:20,326
But she still don't sound like Jordan.

451
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:23,748
- 'Cause she ain't Jordan. She's Robin.
- I'm glad she ain't Jordan.

452
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:27,749
- Why you say that?
- She's too damn sassy and independent.

453
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,710
And she might make more cheese
than you someday.

454
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,084
- Yeah? And?
- I love Jordan. You know that.

455
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:37,012
But let's face it.
A woman like that don't need no man.

456
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,005
She's one step from lesbian.

457
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:45,301
No, hold on. That's a nice thought.

458
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:50,264
The only way a relationship works...

459
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:53,940
is if the man provides the loot,
and the woman takes care of the home.

460
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,588
You're talkin' like you
from the Stone Age.

461
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:57,147
You're a caveman.

462
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,564
- Admit it, man.
- Isn't that ironic?

463
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:02,368
Brothers are always talking
about gold diggers...

464
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:05,535
yet you can't take an educated sister
who makes more money?

465
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:08,491
- No, I can't.
- Murch, we know you don't care.

466
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:11,036
Your woman gonna run
your ass regardless.

467
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:14,085
Bite it. Okay? Bite it.

468
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,504
Grow it, Murchie.

469
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,337
When me and Mia get married,
her only job's gonna be...

470
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:25,919
being my wife and raisin' our kids.

471
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:29,049
- She's gonna be content with that?
- Are you kiddin'?

472
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:33,595
Mia's straight-up old school. She can't
wait to drop this Mandingo's babies.

473
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:37,720
- Consummate mother-whore.
- Word is bond, dog. Word is bond.

474
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:39,938
- Every man wants one.
- Right.

475
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,351
- Let me ask you a question.
- What's that?

476
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:48,032
What made you decide to up
and get married now?

477
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:52,275
'Cause you been dippin' out on Mia,
no offense, for a while.

478
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,577
- And with the new contract...
- Oh, yes.

479
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:58,163
You'll need a catcher's mitt to catch
all the new pussy comin' your way.

480
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,793
I done have all the ass 10 men can have.
My wild oats are sown.

481
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:05,960
How much ass can one man have anyway?

482
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,626
A lot.

483
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,755
It's just time.

484
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:14,964
Marriage is sacred.
My folks have been together 35 years.

485
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:16,966
It means something to me.

486
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,380
I hear that.

487
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:22,554
Besides, marriage is gonna curb
my appetite for more women.

488
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:27,815
In case you didn't know,
marriage is the cure to promiscuity.

489
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,734
- In what world?
- I can't believe you said that.

490
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:34,523
Goddamn, Lance.

491
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:39,533
You'd never known you graduated summa
cum laude. You say some dumb-ass shit.

492
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:44,697
There's a time for everything, players.
We're in the real world now.

493
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:48,124
The real world. Real things.

494
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:50,826
Bang.

495
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,705
I don't give a damn what y'all say.

496
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,590
Ain't nothin' natural about no monogamy.

497
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:01,797
God did not intend for us to be
with just one person.

498
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:05,424
If He had, He wouldn't have
given us all this sperm.

499
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:08,601
These bitches would not outnumber us
the way they do.

500
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:10,057
Okay, okay.

501
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,723
Are you a philosophy major now?

502
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:15,851
- He is a bullshit artist.
- Thank you.

503
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:22,276
Fuck y'all, man.

504
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:26,910
Y'all know there ain't nothin' better
than pussy, except some new pussy.

505
00:34:27,412 --> 00:34:29,120
You got a point there.

506
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:37,336
You can't trust these bitches anyway.
They as scandalous as us niggers.

507
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:40,660
Not all women, player. Not all women.

508
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,169
Oh, so, you don't think
that Mia ever got with other dudes.

509
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:49,882
I'm the first, the last and the only.

510
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,345
Really?

511
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:53,673
Really.

512
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,850
How do you know this?

513
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:08,605
'Cause the pussy curves to my dick.
That's how I know.

514
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,481
Besides, I know my little angel.

515
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,945
You mean to tell me with all the
stickin' and movin' you've done...

516
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:22,495
you don't think that Mia's ever
tippy-toed out the door on you once?

517
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:24,491
No.

518
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:27,419
Quentin, just play.

519
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:36,844
If she did go out
and get her little swerve on...

520
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,140
don't you think
she'd be well within her rights?

521
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,098
It's karma, baby.

522
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,622
Gotta take a piss.

523
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,794
Why did you have to do that?

524
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:25,006
Whose hand is it?

525
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:33,144
Honestly, have you ever fooled around
with a girl?

526
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,805
What do you mean? Yes, you have.

527
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:39,609
That night I met you, you was talkin'...

528
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:42,191
Hold on a second. What's up?

529
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,735
- The book.
- I don't know. I'm talkin'.

530
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,489
Go on, man. It's in there.

531
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:50,821
Yeah, I'm back.

532
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:56,783
You didn't mess around with a girl.
Ever mess around with two guys at once?

533
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:00,082
Not even in high school?

534
00:37:03,547 --> 00:37:04,792
Here we go.

535
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:08,883
You best get your own copy, player.

536
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:12,088
I was just feelin' a little
overprotective of my stuff.

537
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,549
It's too late for that.
I cannot wait to read this mug.

538
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,768
- I know it's gonna be tight.
- Well, you know...

539
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:21,602
help yourself, man.

540
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:25,561
Look at you, man.
You know you're blessed.

541
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,476
The Lord is smilin' on you.

542
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:29,856
Dead that. I make it happen...

543
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:34,358
not some heavenly being
in the clouds possessing me.

544
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:36,856
- Know what I'm saying? Me.
- You're ignorant.

545
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,656
How do you think we're as fortunate
as we are?

546
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,993
Any one of us. We could
be poor, homeless,

547
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,199
out on the street with nothing.

548
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:47,502
Lance, tuxedo fitting tomorrow?

549
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,627
Yeah. We gotta push it back till 5:00...

550
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:54,798
'cause Mia's got a laundry
list of things for this brother.

551
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:58,051
Actually that's cool, 'cause I'm
supposed to link up with Jordan.

552
00:37:58,137 --> 00:37:59,880
That's right. Jordan.

553
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:03,256
I saw how she was
lookin' at you tonight.

554
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,010
What did you see?

555
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:09,228
- I saw she wants to get with you.
- Whatever, man.

556
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:12,812
Yeah, "Whatever, man."
You'll be smackin' bellies this weekend.

557
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,213
What happened to that
talk about fidelity

558
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,526
and puttin' an end to promiscuity?

559
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:20,529
I was talkin' about me.
That don't apply to you.

560
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:22,063
Look here, man.

561
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:26,237
You got your girl, and y'all doin'
a relationship thing, and that's cool.

562
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:30,160
But, Harp, you my boy, my man, my ace!

563
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:33,832
Jordan is fine, dog.
So for once in your life...

564
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:37,167
go ahead on and be a dog, dog.

565
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:45,175
- I'm gettin' a headache.
- Now you're gettin' a headache.

566
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:46,970
- Later, man.
- All right.

567
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,299
All right, Murch, man.

568
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:51,141
Coming, dear.

569
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:56,468
That's not the worst thing in the world.

570
00:38:56,812 --> 00:39:00,228
- They were gonna read it anyway, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

571
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,890
I just didn't think they'd
take it so literally.

572
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:04,894
I'm sure it'll be fine, baby.

573
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:09,573
- Hey. I'm glad you called me.
- Yeah.

574
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,656
Yeah, you're right. It'll be okay.

575
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:16,745
Listen. Did you figure out
what you're wearing to the wedding?

576
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:17,910
Not yet.

577
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:21,789
How about that little beige number
you got?

578
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:25,251
- Strapless?
- I know how to dress for a wedding.

579
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,954
- It's under control.
- Okay. That's cool.

580
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,670
I'm not trying to... Oh, my God!

581
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:33,631
Oh, my God!

582
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,803
Oh, my God, look at the time.

583
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:39,511
- I gotta get out of here.
- Okay. I love you.

584
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:41,638
What?

585
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,512
I said, "I love you."

586
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:53,026
I gotta go. So, I'll see you, baby.
Okay?

587
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,692
- 'Morning.
- Good morning.

588
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm gonna be a second.

589
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:09,417
- Chop, chop. Time is money.
- Okay.

590
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:19,711
Nice boxers.

591
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,835
I thought you were
strictly a briefs man.

592
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,171
They were a gift from Robin.

593
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,300
The girl's got taste.

594
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:39,437
What about you?
You got any social life goin' on?

595
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:42,860
Not really. My professional
and personal life cross over so much...

596
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:45,271
I don't know where
to draw the line anymore.

597
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:49,114
But I'm fine with that, because
sacrifice is the name of the game.

598
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,661
- You can't let work consume you.
- What?

599
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:56,326
Please, Harper.
That doesn't even sound like you.

600
00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:00,829
- Maybe I'm maturing.
- Maybe you're full of shit.

601
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:04,750
I know how badly you want
that limelight. I see it.

602
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:09,300
I recognize it in myself. And besides,
you made that painfully obvious...

603
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:12,590
- in your depiction of Kendall.
- I call it like I see it.

604
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,389
Then you must not see yourself too well,
because you are exactly the same.

605
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,810
Two peas in a pod, huh?

606
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:28,143
You know, your girl,
she must be real patient or real dumb.

607
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,820
Robin deals with it.

608
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:35,483
She understands that I had dreams in my
life way before I had thoughts of her.

609
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,610
She is startin' to get that itch though.

610
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,536
- The "M" word, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,416
You got a problem with that?

612
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,124
I mean, yeah! Marriage, you know?

613
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:51,255
Movin' in together.

614
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:55,552
The last person you ever have sex with.
Ever.

615
00:41:56,428 --> 00:41:58,087
That's pretty deep.

616
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,349
At least you're gettin'
some on the regular.

617
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,095
What?

618
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:06,643
You ain't gettin' none? Jordan!

619
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:09,555
Six months and counting.

620
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:12,932
And longer than that,
if you're talking about good sex.

621
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:15,854
You know what they say:
All work and no play makes...

622
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:18,614
Jordan a horny nut basket.

623
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:26,112
Okay. I'm gonna go with the pasta bowls
with the serving utensils.

624
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:28,570
- Okay.
- Thank you. Right?

625
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:30,241
Good choice.

626
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:35,127
Have you ever had Mia's shrimp scampi
with the linguini?

627
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,087
Yes, it is a bomb.

628
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:42,086
She used to cook like at the drop
of a hat, and good stuff, too.

629
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:45,503
- Yeah. Girlfriend can throw it out.
- That she does.

630
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:47,429
Little Mia.

631
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,557
That girl's got talent.

632
00:42:55,689 --> 00:43:00,016
Oh, my God!

633
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:03,568
What's wrong with you?

634
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:07,650
You scandalous dog.

635
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:09,820
Jordan.

636
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:14,494
Harper, don't walk away from me. This
whole thing, it makes perfect sense.

637
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:16,620
- Do you take Visa?
- Yes, sir.

638
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,699
We just switched places.

639
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,834
Mia's Kacey, you're Jackson
and I'm Kendall.

640
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,492
- You're bugging the fuck out.
- I'm Kendall.

641
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,538
Jackson sexes me crazy.

642
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:29,586
Except you and I,
we never actually had sex.

643
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:33,963
And all Kacey and Jackson do is sleep in
the same bed, like you and I used to do.

644
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:36,510
The pressures of this
wedding are getting to you.

645
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,224
Oh, my God! The forehead kiss.
That is a dead giveaway.

646
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:45,436
- What are you talking about?
- The forehead kiss!

647
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,354
It's endearing. Shit!
It's damn near erotic!

648
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:51,600
You almost got me with it. It's...

649
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,102
It's bullshit, okay?

650
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:58,658
We're talking about fictitious accounts
of experiences I've gone through...

651
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:00,777
friends that I've known.

652
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:03,699
What? Now what?

653
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:07,577
You actually dedicated
that book to them?

654
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,792
Are you crazy?
Do you want to be found out?

655
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:14,462
- That is sick!
- You're right.

656
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:18,048
What you're suggesting to me
is sick and ludicrous.

657
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:20,923
So take a step back,
use your head and think.

658
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:25,348
If Lance finds out what went down,
you better use your feet and run.

659
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:28,391
That's cute. First off,
you need a sedative.

660
00:44:28,644 --> 00:44:31,598
Secondly, Lance has a million
important things to do...

661
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:33,596
to keep his mind from wandering...

662
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,774
on outlandish flights of fancy
from my little book.

663
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:40,523
As a matter of fact,
he won't have time to read it.

664
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:43,019
"White boys admired his prowess
on the hardwood...

665
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:44,906
"...and his reputation with the ladies.

666
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,660
"They secretly deemed him
'The Ebony Humper."'

667
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,113
This joint is hilarious, boy!

668
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,001
Oh, man.

669
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:58,871
I'm gonna see you at the church.

670
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,335
- See you been reading.
- Yeah, I been reading.

671
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:07,545
That's funny.
I figured you wouldn't have enough time.

672
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:10,086
Me neither, man.
I had insomnia last night...

673
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,885
and, player, I am on edge, man.

674
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:16,260
Quentin's right.
It's a page-turner like a mug, man.

675
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:18,725
- Quentin said that?
- Yeah. You know what?

676
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,516
It's a good thing you changed this dude
to a hoop star.

677
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:25,818
I'll have to disassociate myself from
this shit. This dude banged many whores.

678
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:27,147
You know what?

679
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:30,275
I'm flattered, but was
I really that bad?

680
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:33,322
Yeah, you were.

681
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:38,318
You're right. I can't deny it. Oh, man!

682
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:44,198
Harp, open up, man!

683
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,742
- What's up?
- I need your help, man.

684
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:50,626
I've called her.
I haven't talked to her in a week.

685
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:53,088
I went by her house, she wasn't there.

686
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,093
- She's just upset.
- I know.

687
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:58,593
Especially when she found out
about the honeys at the Cotton Bowl.

688
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,423
I know! Damn it!

689
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:05,226
Lord, please forgive me
and my wayward dick.

690
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:09,013
What the fuck is wrong with you?

691
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:11,309
I got to make this right.

692
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,772
I cannot lose her over this foolishness.

693
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,944
I love her, and I am so sorry
for what happened, man.

694
00:46:17,614 --> 00:46:18,645
I'm sorry.

695
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,323
Then just say that, man.
Say it. Tell her.

696
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:26,494
Just tell her, "I'm sorry."

697
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,034
Yeah.

698
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:34,742
Isaiah 1:18?

699
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,749
Lance, man, you know I can't get down
with the religion.

700
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,171
All right.

701
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,924
- 1:18.
- 1:18.

702
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:57,015
Okay. "'Come, let's talk this over, '
says the Lord."

703
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,555
My hand.

704
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,889
"No matter how deep the strain
of your sins...

705
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,354
"...I can take it out
and make you as clean as...

706
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,780
"The freshly fallen snow."
Yes, Lord, please take it away.

707
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:13,616
41:13, Harp.

708
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:23,206
I think if you just try
to read some of it.

709
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:25,170
I'm readin' right now.

710
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:26,703
I'm reading.

711
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:32,213
- Thank you so much.
- 'Bye. See ya.

712
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,885
I know what you're gonna say, man.

713
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:39,428
They were throwing panties
at you Teddy Pendergrass style.

714
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,563
You better take notes. You're gonna have
to beat honeys off with a stick soon.

715
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:46,268
Who, Harp? Hell, no.

716
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:49,229
Hell, yeah. Once he does Oprah,
it's gonna be on.

717
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:52,485
Harp ain't never gonna have to work
for the quality ass again.

718
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:56,521
Panties gonna drop without coercion,
cuddling, caressing. Or...

719
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,863
Or what?

720
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:03,870
- Or kissin' them on the forehead.
- What?

721
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,849
Harp be kissing the
babes on the forehead.

722
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,658
Panties drop with the quicks.

723
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:11,831
- Is that true?
- No, man. It doesn't work that way.

724
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,172
- I never did it to get ass.
- Bullshit, nigger. You ain't slick.

725
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:19,172
- Yeah, nigger, you ain't slick.
- Another secret, Harper?

726
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:21,409
Honeys love that
sensitive, paternal stuff.

727
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,472
Mia's the same way.

728
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,428
Mia, too?

729
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:27,310
Here it is right here.

730
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:29,966
I tried that shit one time.
It didn't work for me.

731
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:32,767
I guess I ain't as authentic
as old Harp here.

732
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:40,316
- So?
- So, what?

733
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:43,273
"So, what?" Mia.

734
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:45,863
Jordan, good girls never tell.

735
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:48,152
Bitch, don't make me hurt you.

736
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:50,653
What?

737
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:58,703
What we shared was...

738
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:03,539
as sweet and as endearing
as a forehead kiss.

739
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,675
It was what I needed.
It was what I wanted.

740
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:11,925
He was a gentleman and a friend.

741
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,888
And I will always love him for that.

742
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:28,279
It's just tight.

743
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:34,694
That's cause bohos like you was never
meant to wear fine European tuxedos.

744
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,867
Now, a handsome player like myself,
I'm gonna pimp this baby right here.

745
00:49:39,998 --> 00:49:41,991
You know, I have my own style.

746
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:44,663
Never mind.

747
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:46,034
Yeah.

748
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,164
- What's up, dude?
- Mojo's on the prowl again?

749
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:54,508
And don't stop till the panties
come tumblin' down.

750
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:58,054
You know how many
single honeys be at weddings?

751
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:02,094
There's about to be a "hoasis"
in that baby, honey.

752
00:50:02,518 --> 00:50:06,432
That's funny. If you put half the effort
into your future as you do...

753
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,396
Nigger, I am a pimp.

754
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:11,893
So my future looks mighty bright,
thank you very much.

755
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:15,981
Is everything straight
for the bachelor party?

756
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,155
Oh, hell, yeah.

757
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:21,899
Pops gave me the key
to the penthouse suite tonight.

758
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:25,659
I'm talkin' about this shit
is about to be ignorant, off the hook.

759
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,241
Luke dancers.

760
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,497
Luke dancers.

761
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,252
It's cool. It's cool.

762
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:39,383
Is your pop still tryin' to groom you
for the hotel management business?

763
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:43,753
Yeah, for the last 20 years.

764
00:50:44,263 --> 00:50:46,421
I'm just trying not to hear
none of that stuff.

765
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:49,089
Dealin' with complaining-ass guests...

766
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:52,885
and unions, payrolls.

767
00:50:52,979 --> 00:50:55,018
Too much like a real job, huh?

768
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:57,934
Nigger, fuck you.

769
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:01,774
You're my judge, right?
That's your job. You judge me.

770
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:03,606
- I'm only playing.
- No, nigger.

771
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:07,064
It's amazing how you've always
analyzed everybody else's shit...

772
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:09,614
and you don't do the same thing
for your own self.

773
00:51:09,702 --> 00:51:12,156
- Will you chill?
- No, 'cause you've done dirt, too.

774
00:51:12,245 --> 00:51:13,988
And you're doin' more dirt.

775
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:17,451
That's right.
You're fuckin' Jordan tonight, remember?

776
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,621
Jordan.

777
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:23,255
You ain't no better than the rest of us.
Got it?

778
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,212
Your shit just ain't caught you yet.

779
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:27,256
Everything okay here, fellas?

780
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,086
Cool as a fuckin' fan, cat.

781
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:34,300
What's goin' on?

782
00:51:35,682 --> 00:51:39,383
Man, nothing. Just, you know, Q.

783
00:51:40,854 --> 00:51:44,554
- I know. You can't change that fool.
- No. What you see is what you get.

784
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:48,065
At least he's honest, which is more
than I can say for most brothers.

785
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:49,729
You look nice, man.

786
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:51,477
Thanks.

787
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:01,413
You are so bad.

788
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:04,247
You got a nice smile. Here's my card.

789
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,114
Hey, Quentin.

790
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,413
May I use your phone?

791
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,787
- Who you callin'?
- Shelby.

792
00:52:15,426 --> 00:52:18,380
- Hell, no.
- Excuse me?

793
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,505
I said no, man.

794
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:25,508
You can't be lettin' her know
your every move. That's played.

795
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,061
- Sometimes you are such an a-hole.
- Well, she's...

796
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,605
Don't you dare.

797
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,641
Come on. You know you don't like
the way she be carrying you.

798
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,152
None of us like it.
It's time for you to just stand up...

799
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:41,645
grow some balls and be a man.

800
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,491
Look, all I'm trying to say is...

801
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,530
I don't want to see you walkin'
around moping tonight.

802
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,953
It's a bachelor party.
I want to see you have fun, get loose.

803
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:54,908
Get you a little booty or something.

804
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,792
Then don't even go home to her.

805
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:00,295
Now you're talkin' crazy.

806
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:03,622
Trust me.

807
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:06,511
It works.

808
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:08,918
You're a family man.

809
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:11,505
The press loves you.
They'll be dying to see this.

810
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,763
No. This is not a media event. It's
our wedding day. Can you understand?

811
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:17,891
It's one camera.

812
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:22,646
Jordan, some things are just sacred,
like between a man and a woman...

813
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:25,397
I'm sorry. You wouldn't
know nothin' about that.

814
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:28,689
- Easy, you two.
- My mind's made up. It ain't happening.

815
00:53:29,365 --> 00:53:31,939
- I'm sorry. He's just stressed.
- It's all...

816
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:33,197
Baby.

817
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:37,284
What?

818
00:53:37,372 --> 00:53:38,617
Hey, you.

819
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,753
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's great.

820
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:48,500
Okay. Look at these two.
Ain't they disgusting?

821
00:53:53,177 --> 00:53:54,292
Yeah.

822
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:58,049
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

823
00:53:59,642 --> 00:54:02,975
- Quentin, can I have a little time?
- Yes, you can.

824
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:09,939
Why didn't you call me
and tell me how the tuxedos fit?

825
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:13,686
- Quentin's phone wasn't working, so...
- You guys are wearing Boss?

826
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:17,147
You couldn't wear an American cut.
It does nothing for your frame.

827
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,989
While we're on the subject,
are you taking the job at the firm?

828
00:54:21,828 --> 00:54:23,736
How was that on the subject?

829
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,785
Hugo Boss. Prestigious law firm.

830
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,077
Need I say more?

831
00:54:32,962 --> 00:54:34,622
Shelby, I just don't know.

832
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:37,834
You cannot keep babysitting
these ghetto children forever.

833
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:42,835
- You've got to get a real job.
- I do not want to talk about this now.

834
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:47,297
I am not going to talk
about this right now.

835
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:53,803
Nice.

836
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:02,106
Why did you have to say
anything to her at all?

837
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:05,025
Because I...

838
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,860
I was curious.

839
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:09,612
You were curious?

840
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,118
That's cute. You were curious.

841
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:14,664
Jesus Christ.

842
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:16,828
Sorry.

843
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:20,457
There's something else
I want to tell you.

844
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:24,792
What? Just a little less dramatic,
please, this time. For me.

845
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,591
I wanna make love to you tonight.

846
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:42,186
I feel like...

847
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:46,021
our opportunity
has presented itself again.

848
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:50,822
And I don't want us
to miss out on it twice.

849
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:55,573
Look, I know this is a bit much, but...

850
00:55:56,202 --> 00:55:58,822
I was just hoping
that you would say yes.

851
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:09,621
How do you expect me to react
to something like this?

852
00:56:10,673 --> 00:56:14,966
I know. I don't even really know
what I expect right now, but...

853
00:56:18,762 --> 00:56:20,554
I know what I want.

854
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:23,303
And what I need.

855
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:28,645
Let's just have our night and we'll see.

856
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:30,433
You know?

857
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:38,566
Robin is coming tomorrow.

858
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:57,871
You know, you don't have to...

859
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:02,342
You don't have to decide right now.
You...

860
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,262
think about it.

861
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:18,604
Smack that ass!

862
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:28,195
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to share this time with us.

863
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:32,235
We are so overjoyed
that so many of you...

864
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:35,327
have come from all over
to be here this weekend.

865
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:38,954
I am so in love with this man.

866
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:44,961
I wish I could take sole credit
for being swept off my feet...

867
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,795
but Lance certainly played
a major part in that.

868
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,748
And that new contract
didn't hurt, either.

869
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,126
Just kidding.

870
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,419
Yeah, right.

871
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,720
Seriously, none of this would
be possible if it wasn't for...

872
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,681
our friend, our counselor...

873
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:07,854
the best man, Harper Stewart.

874
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:16,899
We love you, Harper.

875
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:33,625
L-Boogie, what's up, baby?

876
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:38,418
I've been thinkin'.

877
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:43,389
Listening to Mia, and reading your book
has really made me think, you know?

878
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,429
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I realized something.

879
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:54,608
I owe you a lot, man.

880
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:57,394
Mia's right. You kept us together, dog.

881
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:06,915
- There ain't no need to...
- You could have dogged me out to Mia.

882
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,999
I know how close you two are.

883
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:11,624
I know sometimes you felt
I didn't deserve her.

884
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,541
Who am I to judge?

885
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:18,919
Harp, you're everything, man.
I just want to thank you.

886
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:23,434
And I promise you, I'm gonna make
her happy. I'm gonna be faithful to her.

887
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:26,557
Well, good.

888
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:35,190
Man, I can't believe it.
You are getting married.

889
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:38,283
You know, the ultimate step.

890
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:41,029
- How do you...
- Harp, I have to, man.

891
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:44,410
I may be strong in mind and body,
but emotionally I'm weak.

892
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:48,286
I need Mia in my life.
She's the one who makes me whole.

893
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:51,459
She's my Earth. She's my queen.

894
00:59:54,513 --> 00:59:56,636
Man, I am so far from that.

895
00:59:58,184 --> 01:00:00,094
I mean, Robin is great.

896
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:04,014
But is she the woman
I'm supposed to grow old with?

897
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,607
Here I am.
I'm just startin' to come into my own.

898
01:00:07,695 --> 01:00:11,693
And I'm just supposed to commit to her?
Do I know how to commit?

899
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,327
- You committed to that book.
- Man, no. No.

900
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:19,825
Those were on my own terms. All right?
I had sole control.

901
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:23,336
- Lance, you don't understand.
- No, I do understand.

902
01:00:23,547 --> 01:00:26,252
Let me tell you something.
And I'm not afraid.

903
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:29,883
I made God a promise that if He ever
gave me another chance with Mia...

904
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,631
I would do right by her.

905
01:00:31,722 --> 01:00:36,469
She has forgiven me for
all my indiscretions, man. It's amazing.

906
01:00:37,187 --> 01:00:39,761
So, if she ever slept
with somebody else...

907
01:00:44,946 --> 01:00:45,977
What?

908
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:49,732
I'd just have to deal with it.

909
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,783
I wouldn't even question her about it.

910
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:55,614
All because of your faith in God?

911
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:07,167
Lance, I have to say something to you.

912
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:08,757
What's up, dog?

913
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,968
Damn! Who locked... Open the door!

914
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,674
Uncle Skeeter, what's happening?

915
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:22,738
Man, there are some
fine gals in there.

916
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,777
Lord have mercy!

917
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:27,738
- Why do you want to get married?
- I'm getting married once.

918
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:30,451
I won't have five alimony payments
like your broke ass.

919
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,707
I ain't too old to whip your butt.
I ever tell you about Vietnam?

920
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:36,795
- I'm gonna go eat.
- I don't blame you. Get your grub on.

921
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:38,292
Uncle Skeeter.

922
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,591
Oh, yo, you!

923
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,919
What was that you wanted to tell me?

924
01:01:43,222 --> 01:01:46,556
Oh, nothing. Just congratulations.

925
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:49,350
Thanks. I love you, man.

926
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,140
Look here. I don't want you talkin',
lookin', nothin' with the women.

927
01:01:59,532 --> 01:02:04,194
So are you gonna come over after all
that lap dancing and drinking and stuff?

928
01:02:07,249 --> 01:02:08,494
Sorry.

929
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:11,871
Yeah, I'm gonna call you
when I get back to my crib.

930
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:15,258
Look, don't have me
waiting all night, okay?

931
01:02:15,342 --> 01:02:17,715
Because this is our
night, and I feel it.

932
01:02:17,716 --> 01:02:20,088
And I know you feel it, too.

933
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:22,722
- Jordan, girl, come on.
- I'm coming.

934
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:29,513
And I hope you wore those boxers I like.

935
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:35,364
You have no idea the amount of ignorant
mess we're about to get into now.

936
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:38,865
- Lead the way, dog.
- He got the key. Don't you?

937
01:02:38,952 --> 01:02:40,696
- That's right, yeah.
- Good.

938
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:44,283
- You don't care how I feel.
- Of course I care.

939
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:47,538
Are you going to
this juvenile bachelor party?

940
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:50,251
Of course I am. And it's not juvenile.

941
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:54,048
Come on. You know your
"boys from the hood" would fit right in.

942
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:57,132
You really need to stop talking
about my kids like that.

943
01:02:57,223 --> 01:02:59,346
You need to stay with me tonight.

944
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,427
There's some unresolved issues
between us.

945
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,771
We should tackle them now
rather than give them time to fester.

946
01:03:04,857 --> 01:03:07,728
- I'm not gonna do that.
- What am I supposed to do...

947
01:03:07,819 --> 01:03:11,651
while you're out doing God knows what
with some low-class hoochie mamas?

948
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,697
That's not really my problem.

949
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:19,033
It's not your problem?

950
01:03:21,251 --> 01:03:23,706
All right, fine. Go.

951
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:29,749
Go to your stupid, little boys-only,
bachelor, "rauncherama" shindig.

952
01:03:29,844 --> 01:03:31,636
I don't care. Just go.

953
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:34,880
Go!

954
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:38,724
All right.

955
01:03:39,355 --> 01:03:40,351
Fine.

956
01:03:43,234 --> 01:03:44,943
See you in the morning.

957
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:47,022
Murch! Murch!

958
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,787
Let's get our freak on!

959
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:18,393
Gentlemen.

960
01:04:19,317 --> 01:04:23,150
Welcome to paradise. Have fun.

961
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:26,397
Come here, dog.
I gotta give you something.

962
01:04:28,787 --> 01:04:30,614
Damn. What a view.

963
01:04:34,043 --> 01:04:37,459
- What's up, man?
- In all the madness, I almost forgot.

964
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:42,131
Best man's gotta carry the rings
and the vows.

965
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,711
Check that out, dog. Five-K platinum.

966
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,805
- It's nice, man.
- Gold is played.

967
01:04:47,892 --> 01:04:49,802
- Put that away for me.
- Yeah.

968
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:53,100
- All right, let's get our drink on.
- Cool.

969
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:56,521
I gotta go drain the main vein.

970
01:04:56,653 --> 01:04:58,941
- Hurry up.
- Catch up with you.

971
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:21,674
Let's get our drink on!

972
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:24,221
You're being irrational.
I know it's loud.

973
01:05:24,222 --> 01:05:26,635
There's not one hoochie mama...

974
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:28,555
Shelby, there's not!

975
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:32,309
Don't hang up again. What are you doing?

976
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:34,480
- I'm in this...
- Just drink.

977
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:36,445
Hit me one more time.

978
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:39,987
- So you about to do your thing tonight?
- Man.

979
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,694
Go ahead on, be a dog, dog.

980
01:05:43,665 --> 01:05:45,991
To that fat-ass contract I just got.

981
01:05:47,794 --> 01:05:50,001
And that phat-ass bride-to-be I got!

982
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:53,166
Money and phat-asses, all right!

983
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:57,256
I like you.

984
01:05:58,056 --> 01:06:00,215
It's on like popcorn!

985
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:13,649
We've got some high-paid niggers up
in here tonight.

986
01:06:13,824 --> 01:06:17,240
- Let me be your cowboy, girl!
- Let's get the party started.

987
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,242
Wait, this my seat? All this for me?

988
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:25,661
It's all for you. They
all Zestily clean...

989
01:06:25,754 --> 01:06:28,211
so get ready to do something fresh
and exciting.

990
01:06:28,299 --> 01:06:31,716
- Is this the unlucky man?
- The one they call L-Boogie?

991
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,259
- That would be me, ladies.
- That's him.

992
01:06:36,267 --> 01:06:39,268
Murch! Wake up, Murch.
You're missing a good show.

993
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,560
Ass soft as drugstore cotton.

994
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,776
Motherfucker goin' ape for that shit.

995
01:06:54,121 --> 01:06:56,328
- You like this, Harp?
- Yeah!

996
01:06:56,665 --> 01:07:00,035
Damn! I found this girl working
in the post office licking stamps.

997
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:01,706
Come here, girl.

998
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:03,797
That's my girl!

999
01:07:10,598 --> 01:07:11,463
Damn.

1000
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:19,180
- So little time, so much ass!
- Chomp that chocolate ass, Lance.

1001
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,731
They're really nice,
but I have someone I want you to meet.

1002
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:26,313
That is my best man, Mr. Harper Stewart.

1003
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:29,696
- Right here.
- Mr. Harper, are you ready for this?

1004
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:39,254
Bite that ass.

1005
01:07:50,268 --> 01:07:51,763
Who's next?

1006
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:54,182
Yeah, baby!

1007
01:07:54,482 --> 01:07:56,226
He's mine, girl.

1008
01:07:58,612 --> 01:08:00,403
Get that money, girl.

1009
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:10,074
The party's not over!

1010
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:12,084
We got more for you.

1011
01:08:12,544 --> 01:08:14,702
Fandango, that's me...

1012
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:19,050
and Sweet Cheeks are about to bring
you somethin' luscious and sugary.

1013
01:08:19,385 --> 01:08:24,547
So allow me to introduce
the flavor we call Candy!

1014
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:36,897
Okay, she's with it.

1015
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:00,466
Watch out now, Wayne.

1016
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:03,227
Oh, man!

1017
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:07,601
Good thing his shirt is out
of his pants like that.

1018
01:09:07,691 --> 01:09:09,185
Oh, my God.

1019
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,876
Go get him, Candy!

1020
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:29,580
- Don't be scared, Murch! Calm down!
- Bite it, Murch!

1021
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:37,467
Come on, daddy. Pump Candy.

1022
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:43,979
Don't be afraid. Let's go, Murch!
What's up, dog?

1023
01:09:44,191 --> 01:09:46,897
Yo, Murch, we got Shelby
on the phone for you.

1024
01:09:49,447 --> 01:09:50,990
Do you love me?

1025
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:53,984
Oh, yeah, daddy. Candy loves you.

1026
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,460
Shelby who?

1027
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:04,665
- Go get him, girl.
- Man!

1028
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:11,430
Oh, man. I'm jealous.

1029
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,970
But what about your boy, Murch?

1030
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:19,898
Grabbed the old girl
like a 5 year old grabs his mama.

1031
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,643
Yeah. He overdid it tonight.

1032
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:24,356
Why don't you order up coffee
and make him drink it?

1033
01:10:24,446 --> 01:10:26,605
- I got your back.
- All right, man.

1034
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:47,467
Candy, come on, girl!
It's time to go get our eat on at IHOP.

1035
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:50,047
- I'm coming! Hold on.
- Would you hurry up? Damn!

1036
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,598
I told you about hiring
those college girls.

1037
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:55,059
What? I told you to shut up, didn't I?

1038
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:58,767
Sit your ass in the back...
Girl, I'll bite it, as hungry as I am.

1039
01:10:59,611 --> 01:11:02,281
I don't mean to bother you.
I really don't.

1040
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:07,620
I just thought we had a connection
back there, is all.

1041
01:11:07,704 --> 01:11:11,453
Look, baby, it just kind of goes
with the job, you know?

1042
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,189
Provide the fantasy.
That's the business.

1043
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,710
And I keep my personal
life very separate.

1044
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:21,505
Oh, right. You have to.

1045
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:23,382
You have to.

1046
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:26,346
Please forgive me.
Your show was great.

1047
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:28,802
Thank you.

1048
01:11:31,105 --> 01:11:33,597
"'Cause if you didn't define yourself
for yourself...

1049
01:11:33,692 --> 01:11:37,144
"...you'd be crunched into other
people's fantasies of you and...

1050
01:11:38,823 --> 01:11:40,234
"...eaten alive."

1051
01:11:44,204 --> 01:11:45,699
What did you say?

1052
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:50,871
It's just a quote I use
to inspire my students.

1053
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:54,381
Audre Lorde. I know.

1054
01:11:56,718 --> 01:11:57,750
Yeah.

1055
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,591
Me?

1056
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,012
No. You just don't go to sleep.

1057
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,684
Yeah, I'm gonna wake your ass up.

1058
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:14,695
All right, I'm comin'.

1059
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:16,856
Peace.

"Kacey had cried a river
on Jackson's shoulder that night.

1061
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:38,384
"Not only were the rumored exploits
of The Ebony Humper...

1062
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:41,145
"...becoming too commonplace
for her to handle...

1063
01:12:41,562 --> 01:12:44,480
"...but she'd also had her fill
of false paternity suits...

1064
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:47,057
"...and the groupies' crank phone calls.

1065
01:12:47,653 --> 01:12:49,978
"Sure, Brian meant the world to her...

"...but she wasn't gonna play the fool
any longer.

1067

"The sweetest payback
for his random indiscretions...

1069
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,038
"...would be a personal one of her own.

1070
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,641
"But how could Jackson
be a part of that?

1071
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:24,644
"What did he have to gain from that...

1072
01:13:24,736 --> 01:13:28,984
"...other than the guilt of betraying
the brotherhood he shared with Brian?"

1073
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:35,496
"But he was responsible
for bringing them together...

1074
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:38,116
"...and thus accountable for her misery.

01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:43,548
"Nevertheless,
Jackson resisted temptation...

1076

L? I'm about to be out.

1078
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:55,892
Oh, L.

1079
01:13:56,815 --> 01:14:00,101
I'm about to blow her back out!

1080
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:03,607
She don't even know.

1081
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:06,739
She does not know. God.

1082
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:09,496
Where's that book?

1083
01:14:09,705 --> 01:14:14,035
"Kaceyjust wanted to be held.
And Jackson had to oblige her.

Smile, daddy, it's a bachelor party.

01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,331
You fucked Mia!

1093
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:55,836
Oh, shit!

1094
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,718
What the fuck you doin'?

1095
01:15:00,513 --> 01:15:02,139
It's a fight!

1096
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:13,394
What you doin', man? Shit!
It's just a book! Chill, man.

1097
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:15,442
No, no, no!

1098
01:15:19,326 --> 01:15:22,743
- Watch out, watch out.
- You gonna hurt that kid.

1099

"Kissed on the frontal lobe"?
I know what that fucking shit means!

You supposed to be my boy, motherfucker!

1101
01:15:33,051 --> 01:15:34,545
Get up, bro.

1102
01:15:51,906 --> 01:15:53,945
- Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?

1103
01:15:55,243 --> 01:15:56,406
Oh, my God!

1104
01:15:58,037 --> 01:15:59,746
That fool about to fall.

01:16:00,082 --> 01:16:01,244
Oh, my God!

1106
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:05,827
Don't leave, okay?

1107
01:16:05,922 --> 01:16:07,672
I'll get you home. I'll
pay for your time.

1108
01:16:07,673 --> 01:16:09,421
Just don't leave.

1109
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:15,178
- You're reading too far...
- I know how to read between the lines.

1110
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:19,384
- Oh, my God!
- Now you want God. Ain't that a bitch?

1111
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:20,677
Yo, L, baby.

1112
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:23,938
- Tell him.
- What you want, man?

1113
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:25,558
Please.

1114
01:16:26,363 --> 01:16:28,651
- You really gonna do this?
- Hell, yeah.

1115
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,736
No, you ain't.

1116
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:34,321
You're gonna marry
a beautiful woman tomorrow.

1117
01:16:35,414 --> 01:16:38,416
A girl that loves you,
and that has only loved you.

1118
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:39,746
Oh, my God.

1119
01:16:40,503 --> 01:16:42,876
- You ain't throwing all that away.
- He's right.

1120
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,670
- Listen to Q, Lance.
- Shut the fuck up!

1121
01:16:45,926 --> 01:16:47,551
Okay.

1122
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:51,635
Listen, man.
We know that Harper's a bitch-ass...

1123
01:16:52,684 --> 01:16:57,561
but this cat is your
man, hundred grand.

1124
01:16:58,065 --> 01:17:01,897
He wouldn't do that to you.
Karma don't come back that strong.

1125
01:17:02,404 --> 01:17:04,064
He's right. Q wouldn't lie.

1126
01:17:04,156 --> 01:17:06,148
Even about you bein' a bitch-ass?

1127
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:09,409
Especially about me bein' a bitch-ass.
Especially that.

1128
01:17:09,996 --> 01:17:11,703
God don't want this, L.

1129
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,992
He don't want this. Pull him up.

1130
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,124
Pull him up.

1131
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:50,745
Damn.

1132
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:57,165
The motherfuckin' wedding is off.

1133
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:03,256
Get the fuck out of here.

1134
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:10,724
- Please, please, Lance.
- Go to hell, man.

1135
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,228
Go to fuckin' hell.

1136
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:19,856
Lance.

1137
01:18:42,603 --> 01:18:44,310
Harper, what happened?

1138
01:19:06,838 --> 01:19:07,870
Damn!

1139
01:19:13,346 --> 01:19:14,840
Just a second.

1140
01:19:20,187 --> 01:19:21,646
Jordan, Jordan.

1141
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:29,238
All right, girlfriend, get it together.

1142
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:39,118
You are really destroying the groove
up in here.

1143
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,116
Sorry.

1144
01:19:43,839 --> 01:19:45,250
You look nice.

1145
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:47,217
Gee, thanks.

1146
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:56,937
- So Lance figured it out, didn't he?
- Yeah.

1147
01:19:58,397 --> 01:20:01,518
He figured it out,
promptly beat my ass...

1148
01:20:01,985 --> 01:20:04,559
and called off the wedding.

1149
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:07,444
What?

1150
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:09,524
Yeah.

1151
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:11,452
Was he serious?

1152
01:20:12,497 --> 01:20:15,831
I don't know. Well, he was drunk.

1153
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,998
I don't know.

1154
01:20:19,422 --> 01:20:23,206
- Do you want me to get you anything?
- You've done enough.

1155
01:20:23,802 --> 01:20:26,423
You don't seem to understand something.

1156
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:32,014
They would be in marital bliss by the
time the book was supposed to come out.

1157
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:36,560
But thanks to you, "Miss I Want
An Exclusive," I got my ass whupped.

1158
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,151
I almost got thrown from a fucking
building because of your ass.

1159
01:20:40,237 --> 01:20:42,811
So thank you, Jordan. Thank you!

1160
01:20:43,992 --> 01:20:46,067
And what the fuck is that smell?

1161
01:20:48,747 --> 01:20:52,959
You got some nerve,
blaming me for your skeletons, mister.

1162
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:57,298
- Jordan.
- I'm not done. You wrote the book.

1163
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:02,424
You aired your dirty laundry. Though
you tried to disguise it, it was you!

1164
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,182
You got me all fired up
saying that my life was empty...

1165
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:08,675
and we could've been great together.

1166
01:21:08,812 --> 01:21:12,098
- That was you, okay? Not me. You.
- Okay.

1167
01:21:14,777 --> 01:21:17,529
Okay. I'm sorry.

1168
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:20,522
I know we're both a
little emotional here.

1169
01:21:20,617 --> 01:21:21,946
I'm sorry.

1170
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:26,114
We're peas in a pod, remember?

1171
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:30,786
You know, maybe if I had the luxury
of getting my ass whupped...

1172
01:21:31,797 --> 01:21:33,706
I could be calm right now.

1173
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:36,586
But I have been drinking tequila shots.

1174
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:39,513
My hormones are raging out of control.

1175
01:21:39,597 --> 01:21:44,011
I'm emotional! I'm horny! And I don't
want to hear about no goddamn peas!

1176
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:47,098
Fuck you! Good night!

1177
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:50,519
How about that?

1178
01:21:57,994 --> 01:22:00,152
Can we at least hold each other?

1179
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:26,975
Welcome to New York La Guardia Airport.

1180
01:22:27,069 --> 01:22:31,280
Baggage claim and ground transportation
are located on the lower level.

1181
01:22:33,076 --> 01:22:37,204
Good morning! You look so handsome.

1182
01:22:39,249 --> 01:22:41,041
Don't worry. I'm not wearing this.

1183
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:43,962
I didn't want to get my dress wrinkled
on the plane.

1184
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:46,372
You think I can change at the church?

1185
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:51,170
- Yeah. What is it? Yeah.
- Are you all right?

1186
01:22:52,056 --> 01:22:54,547
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Let's get going.

1187
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:58,467
I sat next to the cutest little girl
on the plane.

1188
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:00,639
She was just talking my ear off.

1189
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:04,104
And she sang me this song. I can't...

1190
01:23:05,237 --> 01:23:06,613
Harper, come on.

1191
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:12,695
Harper, what's wrong with you?

1192
01:23:14,081 --> 01:23:15,576
What's wrong, baby?

1193
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:17,740
Harper.

1194
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:36,773
It's okay.

1195
01:23:38,985 --> 01:23:41,143
Come on, baby. Come on, get up.

1196
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:46,150
Tell me what happened. It's all right.

1197
01:23:53,168 --> 01:23:54,875
Did you sleep with her?

1198
01:23:57,923 --> 01:23:58,836
No.

1199
01:23:59,342 --> 01:24:02,841
But you were going to. You wanted to.

1200
01:24:09,853 --> 01:24:11,810
I am so disappointed in you.

1201
01:24:14,609 --> 01:24:18,358
I know you feel like shit now,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

1202
01:24:18,571 --> 01:24:23,448
You compromised yourself,
our relationship and Lance and Mia's.

1203
01:24:25,997 --> 01:24:27,029
I know.

1204
01:24:29,376 --> 01:24:30,953
I'm glad you told me.

1205
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:35,789
At least now I know
where I stand with you.

1206
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:39,299
- No, baby. You know that is not true.
- Don't!

1207
01:24:41,473 --> 01:24:43,799
I may not be perfect, but I'm strong.

1208
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:53,862
I hope you can make this right.
The wedding starts soon.

1209
01:24:53,946 --> 01:24:54,977
How?

1210
01:24:56,741 --> 01:25:00,406
I've been lookin' all over for Lance,
and I cannot find him.

1211
01:25:01,204 --> 01:25:06,163
And even if I was to find him,
how do I convince him to get married?

1212
01:25:06,627 --> 01:25:09,249
I don't know. That's your bag.
I have a plane to catch.

1213
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,497
Wait, Robin. What are you doing?

1214
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:16,754
- Get off me!
- I need you!

1215
01:25:29,653 --> 01:25:31,362
I cannot do this alone.

1216
01:25:34,701 --> 01:25:36,611
Please don't leave me now.

1217
01:25:46,923 --> 01:25:48,631
Okay, I'll go with you.

1218
01:25:49,343 --> 01:25:53,009
I want to see what's been holding
you back from me all this time.

1219
01:25:55,892 --> 01:25:58,217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Come on.

1220
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:07,358
Oh, man.

1221
01:26:13,245 --> 01:26:16,697
Handle your business, baby. Handle it.

1222
01:26:21,046 --> 01:26:22,920
Shelby, I have something...

1223
01:26:23,007 --> 01:26:27,254
Julian, before you say anything, I just
want you to know that I forgive you.

1224
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:29,048
- You do?
- Yes.

1225
01:26:29,138 --> 01:26:34,181
I know now that you were just succumbing
to that testosterone peer pressure.

1226
01:26:35,104 --> 01:26:39,149
You wanted to be with me last night
and it ate you up that you couldn't.

1227
01:26:39,442 --> 01:26:42,527
It just made sense that
you should continue to suffer...

1228
01:26:42,613 --> 01:26:45,947
and think about the jeopardy
you put our relationship through...

1229
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:47,860
rather than let you have your way.

1230
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:49,612
- I have...
- We're out of time.

1231
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,993
I'm sure it can wait
until the reception.

1232
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,789
You better get inside.

1233
01:26:57,964 --> 01:27:00,881
Candace! I'm so glad you could make it.

1234
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,168
You look great.

1235
01:27:09,893 --> 01:27:11,637
Candace, this is Shelby.

1236
01:27:12,188 --> 01:27:13,813
Shelby, Candace.

1237
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:16,473
It's nice to meet you.
How are you doing?

1238
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:17,938
I'm so sure.

1239
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:21,982
So, shall I just sit anywhere?

1240
01:27:22,408 --> 01:27:23,784
Sure, yeah.

1241
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:27,363
Okay. Thanks, Julian.

1242
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:29,534
No, thank you.

1243
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:36,590
Who was that pop tart?

1244
01:27:38,927 --> 01:27:41,881
Shelby, it's over.

1245
01:27:42,682 --> 01:27:45,599
I am not the man for you.
And you are not the woman for me.

1246
01:27:45,685 --> 01:27:47,974
So let's just stop fooling ourselves.

1247
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:52,227
I hope you find what you're looking for,
because that's what I plan to do.

1248
01:27:54,403 --> 01:27:57,025
I have to go. 'Bye, Shelby.

1249
01:28:03,873 --> 01:28:05,996
Don't you think you oughta pick that up?

1250
01:28:06,084 --> 01:28:07,162
What?

1251
01:28:07,502 --> 01:28:08,913
Your bottom jaw.

1252
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,501
Q. 'Morning, Shelby.

1253
01:28:12,799 --> 01:28:15,884
- Go to hell!
- I'll probably see you there.

1254
01:28:18,013 --> 01:28:19,556
Where's Lance?

1255
01:28:19,683 --> 01:28:22,173
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

1256
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:26,348
- I'm sorry. Robin, Quentin.
- How you doin'?

1257
01:28:26,607 --> 01:28:27,686
Hi.

1258
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:32,028
- Hi. You must be Robin.
- Hi. My pleasure.

1259
01:28:32,197 --> 01:28:33,442
This is Murch.

1260
01:28:33,656 --> 01:28:36,326
- This idiot don't know where Lance is.
- What?

1261
01:28:37,495 --> 01:28:40,449
That's not good. Not good at all.
What are we gonna do?

1262
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,619
- I don't know.
- Something?

1263
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:42,823
You're not helping.

1264
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:46,287
- You need to figure something out.
- I'm under stress here.

1265
01:28:49,174 --> 01:28:51,582
It's your fault that all this happened.

1266
01:28:53,096 --> 01:28:54,839
What have you been doin'?

1267
01:28:55,974 --> 01:28:58,596
Lance. Lance! Hey!

1268
01:28:59,436 --> 01:29:03,102
I told you the wedding is off.
I came to tell my parents that I'm out.

1269
01:29:03,191 --> 01:29:06,525
- You ain't doin' that.
- That bullshit ain't working today.

1270
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:10,399
- Lance, brother. This isn't...
- Why are you even here?

1271
01:29:11,617 --> 01:29:13,575
You got nothing to say to me.

1272
01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:15,777
Yo, L.

1273
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:23,205
He wouldn't even look at me.

1274
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:27,760
- Yeah, but you have to make him!
- How am I gonna make him?

1275
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:31,130
I don't know. Divine intervention.
I don't know!

1276
01:29:31,306 --> 01:29:33,383
Just get in there. Be creative.

1277
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:38,638
- Divine intervention.
- Hey, you can do this.

1278
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:41,234
You have to.

1279
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:43,350
Go.

1280
01:29:50,954 --> 01:29:55,451
Don't do this. You don't wanna do this.
You just need to breathe, relax.

1281
01:29:55,709 --> 01:29:58,082
- Lance, hold on, man.
- Will you hold up?

1282
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,749
Please don't do this.

1283
01:30:03,218 --> 01:30:05,591
Mama, Daddy, I got something
I gotta tell you.

1284
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,464
Wait! Lance, wait.
I gotta tell you somethin'.

1285
01:30:12,228 --> 01:30:14,387
Lance! Pray!

1286
01:30:14,898 --> 01:30:16,310
Wait for a second.

1287
01:30:18,777 --> 01:30:20,107
What'd you say?

1288
01:30:22,031 --> 01:30:23,656
Pray. Pray.

1289
01:30:24,576 --> 01:30:26,984
You want me to beat you
down again, man?

1290
01:30:37,257 --> 01:30:38,835
Pray with me, brother.

1291
01:30:40,303 --> 01:30:42,378
What? What?

1292
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:47,054
What is it? What is it?

1293
01:30:49,313 --> 01:30:50,938
I should've worn my diamonds.

1294
01:30:51,023 --> 01:30:53,941
No, the pearls are perfect.
You look beautiful.

1295
01:30:54,069 --> 01:30:56,690
- Lord, did I order the right food?
- Yes.

1296
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:58,814
Something's gonna go wrong.

1297
01:31:00,868 --> 01:31:01,899
Hi.

1298
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,239
Hi, Mia.

1299
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:14,748
I'm Robin, Harper's girlfriend.

1300
01:31:15,093 --> 01:31:18,378
Oh, Robin, yes! Hi!

1301
01:31:19,305 --> 01:31:23,600
- How are you, my sister?
- I'm fine, but are you all right?

1302
01:31:23,727 --> 01:31:26,053
Because you really look beautiful.

1303
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:29,139
Thank you. I'm fine.

1304
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:33,560
I got jitters.

1305
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:37,575
I mean, I know it sounds silly...

1306
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:40,445
but if this day isn't perfect...

1307
01:31:41,456 --> 01:31:42,619
Mia!

1308
01:31:43,834 --> 01:31:46,503
Honey, I have something
that I need to tell you.

1309
01:31:46,587 --> 01:31:50,253
And I think that you might want
to sit down for this.

1310
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:51,665
What is it?

1311
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,674
Sometimes I'm really nosy
and I let my job consume me...

1312
01:31:55,848 --> 01:31:57,887
and I don't think sometimes.

1313
01:31:58,016 --> 01:32:01,516
And I know that this whole thing
is probably really my fault.

1314
01:32:01,812 --> 01:32:03,640
Baby, you are scaring me.

1315
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:06,686
Right. It's Lance.

1316
01:32:07,194 --> 01:32:10,314
- The thing is...
- He's running late.

1317
01:32:11,866 --> 01:32:14,440
- I'm Robin. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1318
01:32:15,537 --> 01:32:17,115
- Running late?
- Great.

1319
01:32:17,206 --> 01:32:22,710
Yeah. That's what I came in here
to tell you. He's running a little late.

1320
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,044
But he's here now. Right, Kendall?

1321
01:32:27,092 --> 01:32:28,503
I mean, Jordan.

1322
01:32:30,054 --> 01:32:32,212
He's here. We're just
trying to make sure...

1323
01:32:32,306 --> 01:32:35,758
And he knows how important
this day is for you.

1324
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:38,583
Harper told me about last night.
They got

1325
01:32:38,584 --> 01:32:40,854
a little wild at the bachelor party.

1326
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:43,861
Girl, please, spare me the details.

1327
01:32:43,945 --> 01:32:45,967
I'm sure they were on
their best behavior.

1328
01:32:45,968 --> 01:32:47,989
I'm sure of it.

1329
01:32:51,162 --> 01:32:54,116
So we just have a little C.P.
Time for now.

1330
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,999
Yeah. C.P.

1331
01:32:57,169 --> 01:32:58,200
Okay.

1332
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:01,713
But they'll wait for you.

1333
01:33:01,924 --> 01:33:05,792
Yeah, they'll wait for me. It's my day.

1334
01:33:06,262 --> 01:33:08,053
It's all good.

1335
01:33:14,271 --> 01:33:15,896
What scripture, man?

1336
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,683
How about Exodus 20:14?

1337
01:33:19,276 --> 01:33:21,519
Exodus 20:14. Cool.

1338
01:33:25,242 --> 01:33:26,701
"Thou shalt not..."

1339
01:33:32,918 --> 01:33:35,076
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

1340
01:33:35,296 --> 01:33:37,288
- Damn.
- What's he readin'?

1341
01:33:38,132 --> 01:33:42,130
Look, man, I'm just trying to stop you
from making a big mistake.

1342
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,969
- By running up in my woman?
- Is that what you want to hear?

1343
01:33:46,058 --> 01:33:48,763
- I wanna hear the truth.
- You don't want the...

1344
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,479
All you want to hear is that
you're an amazing running back...

1345
01:33:56,153 --> 01:33:58,193
and that your wife-to-be is perfect.

1346
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,653
When the truth is, you
could actually use

1347
01:34:00,654 --> 01:34:03,026
some work on your lateral moves and...

1348
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:05,572
your short yardage.

1349
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:09,209
And a long, long time ago...

1350
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:13,247
Mia slept with your best man.

1351
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:21,174
I could've killed you last night.
You know that? I still could right now.

1352
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:25,676
You could, man,
but it wouldn't change anything.

1353
01:34:27,814 --> 01:34:31,231
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

1354
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,529
And I'm sorry, man.

1355
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:39,321
- I would give you my right arm...
- Fuck that.

1356
01:34:46,252 --> 01:34:49,206
You said yesterday
that you would forgive her.

1357
01:34:49,297 --> 01:34:52,749
- So you calling me a hypocrite?
- You're not being realistic.

1358
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:56,215
This isn't the Bible.
This is the real world.

1359
01:34:56,555 --> 01:35:00,803
And Mia is as close to perfection
as you're gonna get.

1360
01:35:01,019 --> 01:35:04,851
I guess you got all the answers.
Everything is so fucking logical to you.

1361
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,518
Come on. You're in a church.

1362
01:35:06,609 --> 01:35:09,943
The answers are fucked wherever you are!
You can't control me.

1363
01:35:10,029 --> 01:35:14,110
I'm not one of your little characters
in one of your little stories, man!

1364
01:35:14,451 --> 01:35:18,449
You can't control this outcome.
You know why? Because you are not God.

1365
01:35:19,498 --> 01:35:22,535
- That's reality, motherfucker!
- Listen to reason.

1366
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:39,311
I knew.

1367
01:35:41,815 --> 01:35:45,979
I always knew in the back of my mind
that she had been with somebody else.

1368
01:35:46,196 --> 01:35:49,067
But never in a million lifetimes
would I think...

1369
01:35:50,325 --> 01:35:54,075
that you was gonna be that
self-serving, back-stabbing bastard.

1370
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,790
You can hate me forever.

1371
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,009
But not Mia.

1372
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,885
She loves you so much.

1373
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:15,972
Man, you're staring your ideal woman
in the face.

1374
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,228
You two were made for each other.

1375
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,451
You two fit together.

1376
01:36:32,499 --> 01:36:33,993
She's my Earth.

1377
01:36:36,211 --> 01:36:37,457
She's my queen.

1378
01:36:39,632 --> 01:36:40,878
I know.

1379
01:36:58,863 --> 01:37:00,737
Okay, I'm gonna go get your tux.

1380
01:37:00,823 --> 01:37:02,104
Wait a minute.

1381
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:05,659
I'm a Christian so I
have to forgive you,

1382
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,907
but that doesn't mean
I have to like it.

1383
01:37:08,749 --> 01:37:09,781
Okay.

1384
01:37:10,251 --> 01:37:13,252
You better find a way to deal
with your issues, too.

1385
01:37:13,337 --> 01:37:15,586
Writing is not gonna
purge you completely,

1386
01:37:15,587 --> 01:37:17,835
so I suggest that you acknowledge Him.

1387
01:37:19,387 --> 01:37:20,418
Him who?

1388
01:37:24,768 --> 01:37:26,178
Okay.

1389
01:37:30,608 --> 01:37:33,692
I feel you, but if I don't get you
into this tux...

1390
01:37:37,241 --> 01:37:39,992
You said you'd get me over that broom.
Remember?

1391
01:37:40,077 --> 01:37:42,366
- I remember.
- Then don't back out on me.

1392
01:37:42,455 --> 01:37:45,207
You recognize His strength.
You respect it.

1393
01:37:47,919 --> 01:37:50,292
Recognize. Respect.

1394
01:37:50,964 --> 01:37:52,044
Okay.

1395
01:39:45,805 --> 01:39:50,800
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today in the sight of God...

1396
01:39:51,686 --> 01:39:55,436
"...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony."

1397
01:39:57,985 --> 01:40:00,442
The couple have written
their own wedding vows...

1398
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:03,531
that they'll speak to each other,
and in front of you...

1399
01:40:03,617 --> 01:40:05,740
their family and dear friends.

1400
01:40:09,457 --> 01:40:10,620
Mia?

1401
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:20,464
"Lance, my friend...

1402
01:40:22,264 --> 01:40:24,470
"...my love, my hero...

1403
01:40:29,146 --> 01:40:31,139
"...loving you is my heart's joy.

1404
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,900
"It teaches me to be faithful
to my personal truths.

1405
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:40,614
"As I stand beside you this day...

1406
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,943
"...I offer you the very heart of me...

1407
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:48,543
"...filled with sacred love...

1408
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:53,500
"...pure, unconditional and everlasting.

1409
01:40:54,717 --> 01:40:56,876
"For love bears all things...

1410
01:40:57,554 --> 01:41:01,386
"...endures all things
and believes all things.

1411
01:41:01,976 --> 01:41:03,684
"Love never fails.

1412
01:41:05,063 --> 01:41:06,972
"And I do love you, Lance...

1413
01:41:08,608 --> 01:41:10,518
"...mind, body and soul."

1414
01:41:22,415 --> 01:41:23,411
"Mia...

1415
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:26,957
"...my darling, my love...

1416
01:41:29,132 --> 01:41:31,290
"...as I stand beside you this day...

1417
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:34,965
"...know that there is nothing greater
than love.

1418
01:41:35,806 --> 01:41:37,431
"For God is love.

1419
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:42,100
"And having faith in you...

1420
01:41:44,983 --> 01:41:46,940
"...and belief in our love...

1421
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:51,690
"...makes life worth living.

1422
01:41:52,909 --> 01:41:54,452
"And as I stare...

1423
01:42:02,545 --> 01:42:06,591
"As I stare upon your angelic face...

1424
01:42:11,263 --> 01:42:15,392
"...I am made whole today,
a man with a higher purpose.

1425
01:42:16,186 --> 01:42:19,804
"For a woman's virtue
is a man's greatest glory.

1426
01:42:22,318 --> 01:42:24,026
"From this day forth...

1427
01:42:24,695 --> 01:42:28,564
"...we should love one another
as God loves us."

1428
01:42:32,997 --> 01:42:34,540
The rings, please.

1429
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:42,455
"By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

1430
01:42:42,925 --> 01:42:44,633
"...husband and wife."

1431
01:42:46,345 --> 01:42:48,173
Please, kiss your bride.

1432
01:43:49,668 --> 01:43:52,338
Mia gave me too much credit
for this union.

1433
01:43:53,839 --> 01:43:55,916
I have learned from them...

1434
01:43:57,678 --> 01:44:01,546
what it means to be truly committed
to another person.

1435
01:44:03,017 --> 01:44:05,639
I have learned the importance...

1436
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:08,348
of seizing the moment.

1437
01:44:09,775 --> 01:44:11,602
Because you can't go back.

1438
01:44:13,321 --> 01:44:16,192
You can never go back.
You have to live for today.

1439
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:22,529
Not for what was, or could have been.

1440
01:44:25,043 --> 01:44:26,537
And what will be...

1441
01:44:28,546 --> 01:44:30,255
no one can say.

1442
01:44:34,928 --> 01:44:36,258
But sometimes...

1443
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:42,509
you just have to step out on faith.

1444
01:44:45,357 --> 01:44:46,935
And believe that...

1445
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,488
what you have built together
is worth preserving.

1446
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:58,954
Because when you're made
for each other as much...

1447
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:02,834
as these two are...

1448
01:45:06,757 --> 01:45:08,335
it's definitely...

1449
01:45:09,677 --> 01:45:11,717
definitely worth preserving.

1450
01:45:22,234 --> 01:45:24,060
So, to the bride and groom.

1451
01:45:27,364 --> 01:45:28,775
Lance and Mia...

1452
01:45:29,659 --> 01:45:30,987
I love you.

1453
01:45:33,246 --> 01:45:35,998
And may God bless this union.

1454
01:45:40,629 --> 01:45:41,709
Cheers.

1455
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:03,484
Bravo, baby.

1456
01:46:35,943 --> 01:46:38,648
Okay, ladies, who's ready
to catch the bouquet?

1457
01:46:38,738 --> 01:46:41,312
Single females, on the floor. Let's go.

1458
01:46:41,408 --> 01:46:43,365
Mia, are you ready?

1459
01:46:44,995 --> 01:46:46,656
Okay, here we go.

1460
01:46:52,963 --> 01:46:53,912
Bitch.

1461
01:46:54,172 --> 01:46:55,371
Thanks, Mia.

1462
01:46:58,302 --> 01:47:01,637
- All right. You know what comes next.
- Go get your girl.

1463
01:47:01,722 --> 01:47:03,217
Come on out, y'all.

1464
01:47:03,767 --> 01:47:06,055
- Q, you know you want to.
- What?

1465
01:47:06,144 --> 01:47:09,311
Uncle Skeeter, you don't need
to catch this. Sit your butt down.

1466
01:47:09,398 --> 01:47:12,435
Let's see what happens.
Just throw. You never know.

1467
01:47:16,573 --> 01:47:17,653
I did not!

1468
01:47:25,416 --> 01:47:26,911
I'm gettin' you.

1469
01:48:00,832 --> 01:48:02,078
Cut it out.

1470
01:48:02,168 --> 01:48:04,373
Quit acting like you don't like it.

1471
01:48:08,716 --> 01:48:09,914
You like it.

1472
01:48:13,972 --> 01:48:15,550
Say you like it.

1473
01:48:19,938 --> 01:48:21,266
Say you like it.

1474
01:48:22,858 --> 01:48:24,186
Stop it!

1475
01:48:27,321 --> 01:48:29,231
Don't let her get away, dog.

1476
01:48:35,622 --> 01:48:37,200
- Go get her, Q.
- That's scary.

1477
01:48:39,084 --> 01:48:41,001
I think we have to dance.
Care to dance?

1478
01:48:41,002 --> 01:48:42,917
Yes, I'd love to.

1479
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:51,255
Quentin better be careful
before Shelby puts a hurtin' on him.

1480
01:48:53,184 --> 01:48:54,216
Yeah.

1481
01:48:57,356 --> 01:48:58,980
Dance with me?

1482
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,395
You know...

1483
01:49:03,071 --> 01:49:05,644
I just want to talk to you.

1484
01:49:15,126 --> 01:49:17,285
Cut a rug with a war vet, darling?

1485
01:49:18,839 --> 01:49:20,796
Sure, Uncle Skeeter.

1486
01:49:21,007 --> 01:49:22,171
Come on.

1487
01:49:28,475 --> 01:49:31,761
It's been a crazy-ass,
emotional weekend, hasn't it?

1488
01:49:32,646 --> 01:49:35,103
Damn roller-coaster ride.

1489
01:49:38,194 --> 01:49:40,864
Listen, about last night, Jordan.

1490
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:45,740
I don't want to hear about last night.
If I hear you mention last night...

1491
01:49:45,827 --> 01:49:49,577
I'm gonna call the Enquirer
and tell them everything I know.

1492
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,457
So it's like that?

1493
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:55,833
Okay, I hear you loud and clear,
Miss Armstrong. Thank you.

1494
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,253
You're welcome.

1495
01:50:06,477 --> 01:50:08,803
I saw you grabbin' for that garter.

1496
01:50:13,193 --> 01:50:14,652
You know what?

1497
01:50:15,695 --> 01:50:17,190
I don't blame you.

1498
01:50:18,241 --> 01:50:20,067
She's a beautiful woman.

1499
01:50:20,868 --> 01:50:22,493
She's the one.

1500
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:27,082
Just don't blow it.

1501
01:50:34,426 --> 01:50:36,134
I love you, Harper.

1502
01:50:50,653 --> 01:50:53,061
Excuse me, Robin,
I don't mean to interrupt...

1503
01:50:53,155 --> 01:50:55,528
but Uncle Skeeter
did promise me a dance.

1504
01:50:55,617 --> 01:50:59,829
Seeing he's the only available man in
the whole wedding party, I was just...

1505
01:50:59,913 --> 01:51:02,749
Come on, baby girl.
You don't mind, do you, darling?

1506
01:51:02,833 --> 01:51:04,458
No, not at all.

1507
01:51:05,962 --> 01:51:09,248
And besides I think the best man
over there needs you.

1508
01:51:17,392 --> 01:51:20,309
Come on, Uncle Skeeter.
Don't be tryin' to touch my booty.

1509
01:51:20,395 --> 01:51:21,558
No, no.

1510
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:45,538
Thank you for helping me today.

1511
01:51:47,593 --> 01:51:48,874
You're welcome.

1512
01:51:50,555 --> 01:51:51,883
Great speech.

1513
01:51:55,519 --> 01:51:58,189
- I was moved.
- You know I meant every word...

1514
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,811
every word I said about
preserving what we have, and...

1515
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:04,571
I don't think that this
is the right time.

1516
01:52:06,156 --> 01:52:09,941
We have a lot to talk about
and it's not gonna be solved overnight.

1517
01:52:11,036 --> 01:52:14,536
- We have to figure out some...
- You know what your problem is?

1518
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,326
You don't live enough for today.

1519
01:52:18,628 --> 01:52:19,874
What?

1520
01:52:21,799 --> 01:52:23,958
For once, just live in the moment.

1521
01:52:30,226 --> 01:52:31,886
Harper, what are you doing?

1522
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:33,887
At least for a little while.

1523
01:52:42,364 --> 01:52:43,444
Robin...

1524
01:52:47,829 --> 01:52:49,407
will you marry me?

1525
01:52:53,544 --> 01:52:55,002
I love you.

1526
01:52:59,717 --> 01:53:00,832
Please.

1527
01:53:05,767 --> 01:53:06,798
Yeah.

1528
01:53:09,312 --> 01:53:10,640
Whatever, man.

1529
01:54:20,018 --> 01:54:22,094
Come and get it goin' on, y'all.

1530
01:54:22,271 --> 01:54:24,560
Five, six, seven, eight.

1531
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:16,025
Housekeeping.

1532
01:56:26,747 --> 01:56:29,155
- Damn! I shouldn't have drank!
- What did I do?

1533
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,002
I ain't drinkin' no more liquor!

1534
01:56:33,672 --> 01:56:35,380
Did you touch me?
