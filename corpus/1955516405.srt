1
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:07,024
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:20,838
[Voiceover] When Wendy was
alive, she was my friend.

3
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:25,642
Wendy always thank like a little kid.

4
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:29,809
She told me never to forget
how to think like that.

5
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:32,379
Wendy promised we'd still be friends

6
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:36,119
after she finished high
school, but she left

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,036
without saying goodbye.

8
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,421
They looked for her for a long time

9
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:48,588
and they never found anything,
not even a footprint.

10
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,961
(gun fires)

11
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:12,079
They finally decided
that she must have died.

12
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,357
Patrick said they just
weren't looking hard enough.

13
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,147
I wasn't looking at all when I found her,

14
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,734
but she didn't recognize me.

15
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:20,778
(gun fires)

16
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,778
But she really was dead.

17
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:27,225
She had forgotten how to think like a kid.

18
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:32,960
I know now that Wendy had to leave

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,460
and Patrick had to follow her.

20
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:48,521
Patrick was never ready
for Wendy to be dead.

21
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,271
(dramatic music)

22
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,990
(suspenseful music)

23
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,953
(water flowing)

24
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,815
(dog barking)

25
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,311
(scary music)

26
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:50,383
My older brothers were born twins

27
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,800
before my mom died having me.

28
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:58,424
("Flour" by The Non-Commissioned Officers)

29
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,609
My parents weren't expecting two babies,

30
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,917
so they only had names for one.

31
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:17,750
[Voiceover] No, this is me.

32
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,827
No, this is you, this me.

33
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:19,831
No, that's me, this is you.

34
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:20,664
That's me.

35
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:22,215
That's me.

36
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,422
This is you.

37
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:26,839
Patrick for a boy and Carol for a girl.

38
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:37,560
Patrick always had a crush on Wendy,

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,727
ever since she moved here.

40
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:59,068
Carol is four minutes
younger than Patrick and

41
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,841
when he was born, he
couldn't breathe because.

42
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:04,731
Patrick's umbilical cord
was wrapped around his neck.

43
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:07,494
My dad always says there's
something wrong with him,

44
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:10,661
but Patrick said he's just a big dork.

45
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,361
It's really fun.

46
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:35,326
Time to go.

47
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:41,947
Patrick we're going to be late.

48
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,217
Is Beetle ready?

49
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,088
Beetle got dressed last night.

50
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,505
I don't think he went to bed.

51
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:51,211
[Patrick] We have to
pick up Rody, don't we?

52
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,044
Patrick just get up.

53
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,032
Why don't you go get
Rody and swing back.

54
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,224
I'm getting up.

55
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:12,575
[Beetle] Rody was from California.

56
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:18,271
Our brothers always
thought he was the coolest.

57
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:27,889
Rody hated it when
people got scared or sad.

58
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,823
He said the best you could
do when you got scared

59
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,656
was to laugh as hard as you could.

60
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,588
(explosion)

61
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:41,623
(alternative music)

62
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,201
His parents were always
going on vacations,

63
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,258
so Rody was raised by his big sister

64
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,841
until she went away to college.

65
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,056
Now he takes care of himself.

66
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,953
(alternative music)

67
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:13,111
(dog barking)

68
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,905
I know now that Rody
wasn't the coolest guy

69
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:15,988
we ever knew.

70
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,907
How you guys doing?

71
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:28,734
Okay, good.

72
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,991
Patrick, we gotta go to the copy cat.

73
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,347
We're gonna be late.

74
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,644
Well, just drive fast.

75
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,977
We gotta go, it's for Wendy.

76
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:55,246
My brothers know Addy
from elementary school.

77
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,622
Addy told me she didn't have any friends

78
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,995
when she was little.

79
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:01,034
Carol said she had lots,
she just didn't like

80
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,280
to play with him.

81
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,447
♫ Allie, how did you
cut your hand so deeply

82
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:14,117
♫ Did you fall out of a sleep ♫

83
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,382
Wendy was Addy's best friend.

84
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:20,549
♫ But there's a fire in your eyes ♫

85
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,096
My dad trusted her to sit with me so

86
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,346
he can look for a new wife.

87
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:31,978
But he always comes home early.

88
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,916
After Addy put me to bed,
Wendy would come over.

89
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,547
♫ There's a rainstorm in the sky ♫

90
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,565
(car door slams)

91
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,507
I gotta go finish
the eulogy right quick.

92
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:16,340
Hey, Addy!

93
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,456
[]Beetle] We used to see Addy every day.

94
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,580
But since she started boarding school,

95
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,663
we only see her on weekends
or during the summer.

96
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,176
These were always Carol's favorite times.

97
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:39,061
(alternative music)

98
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:46,380
One time Carol asked her
to go to a dance with them.

99
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:55,054
He forgot that he didn't
know how to dance.

100
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,431
Hey.

101
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,264
Hey.

102
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,415
I feel stupid dancing alone.

103
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm not going to just stand here all night

104
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,959
in these stupid tiny sandals.

105
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,792
Hmm.

106
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,585
Rody!

107
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,585
Hey, Addy!

108
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,895
(alternative music)

109
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:34,741
(fun screaming)

110
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,958
(slow music)

111
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,595
Patrick met Wendy that same night.

112
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,047
You're Wendy Hearst, right?

113
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,584
[Beetle] Everybody was
supposed to say goodbye to Wendy

114
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:34,334
at a special service.

115
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:40,203
It was like a funeral with no body.

116
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,000
I wondered if Wendy came
back, would they put her

117
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,167
in the coffin?

118
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,926
Patrick loved summer because

119
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,593
it meant seeing Wendy every day.

120
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:07,193
Carol loved summer because
wherever Wendy was,

121
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,860
Addy was there, too.

122
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,791
(nostalgic music)

123
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,372
(splash)

124
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:35,993
They'd play until Wendy's
boyfriend would come

125
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,493
and take her away.

126
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:55,168
♫ You speak to me as
though you know my name

127
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:59,335
♫ If I'm so gone why are you still here

128
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:05,100
♫ Candle, wine and greeting on a train

129
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,267
♫ Cry me a river oh, dearie, dear ♫

130
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:25,208
Patrick said the first
thing he was gonna do

131
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,125
if she ever came back
was walk up and kiss her.

132
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,816
Rody said if Patrick was
ever gonna kiss Wendy,

133
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,046
he would have done it by now.

134
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:41,213
(Singing "Ave Maria")

135
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,181
She's singing to you, man.

136
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,595
[Beetle] Oh, yeah, that's Anne Haran.

137
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:16,012
She's Addy's friend from boarding school.

138
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:25,490
And now to say our
final goodbyes to Wendy,

139
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,657
Rody Kerrigan.

140
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:43,136
I was the first person
Wendy met when she moved here.

141
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not from here either, but
I always consider this town

142
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,583
my home and you guys my family.

143
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,252
This morning I wrote a letter to Wendy

144
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:56,988
and I'd like to read it to you now.

145
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,931
(eerie music)

146
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,098
Dear Wendy, I can't think of
any ways to talk about you.

147
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,410
Silence says it best.

148
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,758
I feel absent because you really are gone

149
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:13,508
and everything is just less good.

150
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,294
I can only take comfort in
the fact that you are free

151
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:19,313
of pain we share here today.

152
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:21,888
Your friends have to leave,
go to college and you will

153
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,138
always be 17 and beautiful and with us.

154
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:30,401
Sorry we had to grow up without you.

155
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:33,151
I'm sorry I took you for granted.

156
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,545
I still expect to see
your car in the road.

157
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:40,312
I still expect you to call me.

158
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:43,096
You've touched us all beyond
the strength of this world.

159
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:46,723
May grace and life give you
grace eternal, God speed.

160
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:47,640
Love, Rody.

161
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:52,794
(eerie slow music)

162
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:57,926
Hey, wait, hey.

163
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,464
So tell me your name.

164
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,229
So, are you going to
the Hearst house after?

165
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,812
Yeah, I think so.

166
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,404
I figure I should.

167
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,277
What did you think of the song?

168
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,110
It was good.

169
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,027
I liked it.

170
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:16,238
Thanks, I practiced it for like a year.

171
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,582
I thought it would be appropriate

172
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:20,232
even though I think it's Catholic.

173
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,149
Yeah, it is Catholic.

174
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,208
Did you put anything in the coffin?

175
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:30,919
No.

176
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,805
Were you going to?

177
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:37,014
Yeah, you.

178
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,592
[Beetle] After the service,
something felt wrong.

179
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,092
I think Carol noticed it, too.

180
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,737
I thought we were going home.

181
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,632
Are you worried about Patrick?

182
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:10,132
I'm worried about everybody.

183
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,254
I never would have known Wendy Hearst

184
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:17,369
if it wasn't for you Rhody.

185
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,536
Thanks, man.

186
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,576
I don't think you should leave.

187
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,672
You don't want me to go?

188
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:28,748
No, it's just I can't take
care of everybody by myself.

189
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,165
You'll do fine.

190
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:37,228
(crunch)

191
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:38,504
You hear those cicadas?

192
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:40,038
Yeah.

193
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,814
You wanna go look for some?

194
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:42,647
Yeah.

195
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:52,720
I tried really hard
to get her to notice me,

196
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,470
but that was always just
one of your friends.

197
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,176
(crash)

198
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,167
(dog barking)

199
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,000
Run.

200
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:27,306
♫ Victoria your pupils are indigenous

201
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:35,683
♫ I see a side of me in them

202
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:39,350
♫ I never thought to search

203
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:46,025
♫ Victoria, the day is coming

204
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,525
♫ Running late for church

205
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,489
♫ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♫

206
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:59,019
♫ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♫

207
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:03,700
♫ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♫

208
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,117
(slow music)

209
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:44,062
(dog barks)

210
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:52,409
(wind blowing)

211
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,562
(crickets)

212
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:08,341
Hey, slow down.

213
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,437
Beetle!

214
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:15,515
Beetle!

215
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,265
Don't go too far off!

216
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,612
Carol, I'm right here.

217
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,985
Beetle, I'm telling dad.

218
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,318
(dog barks)

219
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:42,778
Rody?

220
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,567
(background alternative music)

221
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:04,940
Rody.

222
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,149
You can't leave.

223
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:11,982
Why not?

224
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,362
Rody, we're so proud to have a man watch

225
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,546
over this house this summer.

226
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:21,568
Don't forget to feed the
dogs and feed Donna's fish.

227
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,741
There's plenty of meat loaf in the freezer

228
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,221
and soda in the fridge.

229
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,782
Remember blah, blah,
blah, love mom and dad.

230
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:28,835
So what?

231
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:30,321
So, who's gonna take care of the house?

232
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,154
You are.

233
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:34,441
I don't know how to take care of fish.

234
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:38,608
You just scoop them out when
they float to the surface.

235
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:49,248
(alternative music)

236
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,417
If I feed your dogs an
entire can of fish food,

237
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,241
you think you can scoop
him up when you get back?

238
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:15,832
Well, I just got done
using all the fish food,

239
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:19,454
but you can try to kill him
with my mom's meat loaf.

240
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,991
Give me some money and I'll do it.

241
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,231
I haven't got any money.

242
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:24,345
Rody, I'm not paying for your dogs.

243
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:25,672
I know your parents gave you enough money

244
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:27,505
for the entire summer.

245
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,369
Can you break a hundred?

246
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,702
No, do you have a hundred?

247
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:37,060
Fine.

248
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,887
One hundred dollars.

249
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:44,720
Thank you very much.

250
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:51,169
[Carol] Come on Beetle, what did I say?

251
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:17,613
[Beetle] Carol!

252
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:25,989
Carol!

253
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,762
Beetle, Beetle, what's wrong?

254
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:37,476
(eerie music)

255
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:41,559
I wonder what Wendy
would think of your eulogy?

256
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,166
Maybe we could read it
to her if she comes back.

257
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:50,232
Man, I'm not waiting
around here for Wendy.

258
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,205
[Patrick] I'm not waiting.

259
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,928
I just don't want to lose
two friends in one summer.

260
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,266
Patrick, I think you're
going way out of your way

261
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,597
to let everybody know how
sad you are about Wendy.

262
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:00,764
No, I'm not.

263
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,858
(scary music)

264
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,063
Beetle.

265
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,877
[Beetle] After she died
again, Carol said we had

266
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:18,685
to take her home.

267
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,935
She came back to life in the car trunk.

268
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,324
[Voiceover] Brian, Wendy would wanted us

269
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:32,991
to leave it for you.

270
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:38,059
[Voiceover] We just really
want you to have a good summer.

271
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:41,309
When you were in chorus in junior high.

272
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,258
[Voiceover] So then it
doesn't really count, does it?

273
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,920
[Voiceover] It's really important to us.

274
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,503
Please consider it.

275
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:55,242
[Voiceover] We never got
around to doing this for Wendy.

276
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:57,907
And you're at the age where
you can really appreciate it.

277
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,606
Money's not the issue.

278
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,682
[Voiceover] It'll be good
for you to know what it's like,

279
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,682
even for a little while.

280
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,397
I don't know, I gotta go home.

281
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,122
I can drive you home.

282
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,430
Where do you think you'll go?

283
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,088
I don't know.

284
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,615
You're gonna miss a lot.

285
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:31,374
If so, you can tell me all
about it over a milkshake

286
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,207
as soon as I get back.

287
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:39,917
How are you holding up?

288
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:44,770
I know you kids have had
a lot to deal with lately.

289
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,687
I'm good.

290
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:51,749
I'm just trying to make sure
that Beetle and Carol are cool.

291
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,247
[Voiceover] Well, I
don't know how much longer

292
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,830
I can stick it out.

293
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,847
I think it's time for me to hit the sack.

294
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:07,680
Okay.

295
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:09,729
Goodnight dad.

296
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,857
Oh, do me a favor.

297
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:19,192
When your brothers get home,
don't stay up too late.

298
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,025
Okay.

299
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:24,455
(dogs barking)

300
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,584
Was that loud?

301
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:37,572
[Voiceover] Beetle, close the door!

302
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,405
Who's out there?

303
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,238
It's Patrick.

304
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:40,396
Is he coming?

305
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:41,646
Close the door.

306
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:48,258
Carol, who's in the bag?

307
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,711
She's not moving.

308
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,378
Beetle, shut up!

309
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:55,227
Carol!

310
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:57,341
Patrick, I'll explain.

311
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,284
I promise I'll explain.

312
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:01,696
First we have to find Rody.

313
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:02,779
Where's Rody?

314
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:09,592
(alternative music)

315
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:18,774
Hey, I'm really sorry.

316
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:26,941
So am I.

317
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,012
(pounding drums)

318
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,948
[Beetle] Carol told
Patrick how we found her

319
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,891
and decided to bring her back home.

320
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:42,131
Patrick listened and
didn't ask any questions.

321
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:43,631
He looked nervous.

322
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:46,397
If Rody had been there,
he would have known

323
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:47,980
exactly what to do.

324
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,192
Okay.

325
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,744
[Beetle] Think she'll get better?

326
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,994
I think she'll get worse.

327
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,522
Maybe.

328
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,913
I don't know if we can keep her here.

329
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,830
We can for the night.

330
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,309
I'm going to stay in here, too.

331
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,321
Me, too.

332
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,404
No, Beetle.

333
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:20,465
I'll just come back
when you fall asleep.

334
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,968
I'm going to sleep right now.

335
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,084
Don't tell Dad you stayed up so late.

336
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:26,751
[Beetle] Whatever.

337
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,212
Such a baby.

338
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,563
You really going to sleep?

339
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,747
What are we gonna do Carol?

340
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:49,252
(alternative music)

341
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:58,345
(door closes)

342
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,383
[Voiceover] Beetle, there's a reason

343
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,281
for a secret knock, okay?

344
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:04,868
Okay, but Dad just came upstairs.

345
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,508
What if he hears?

346
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,154
Did he see you come up here?

347
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,154
Yes, but it's my room.

348
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,975
Did he ask where we are?

349
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:14,975
At Rody's.

350
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:19,294
Think he'll ever go over there?

351
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,493
Nah, he wouldn't go over there.

352
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:22,757
He hates Mr. Kerrigan.

353
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:25,424
We move as soon as it gets dark.

354
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:35,240
(dramatic upbeat music)

355
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,679
Relax, motion sensors,
I'll take care of it.

356
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:50,479
(car approaching)

357
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:53,340
Anne Haran.

358
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:57,978
[Addy] Hi, Brian, hey,
it's Addy, how are you?

359
00:31:57,978 --> 00:31:59,645
[Brian] I'm okay.

360
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:04,172
I'm sorry if I was
acting weird yesterday.

361
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:07,076
Yeah.

362
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:17,538
Do I see one little,
two little darling boys.

363
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,772
Anne Haran.

364
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:28,934
Hey, Anne Haran, wow.

365
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,035
Say, what are you guys doing over there?

366
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,434
We're playing this game.

367
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:36,705
Come here, I'll tell you about it.

368
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,955
Okay, it's called Waterloo.

369
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:44,065
(dramatic upbeat music)

370
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:13,636
(wheel squeaks)

371
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:15,553
(slam)

372
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:18,588
Beetle, get the door.

373
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,715
(dogs barking)

374
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:30,818
Beetle, it's okay,
they're not gonna hurt you.

375
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:31,756
I know they look scary.

376
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:35,555
They just want to sniff you, it's okay.

377
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,388
Fine.

378
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:41,384
If we get caught, it's your fault.

379
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:45,551
I'm putting them away and
then Carol's taking you home.

380
00:33:46,965 --> 00:33:48,215
No, he's not.

381
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,878
You seem tired.

382
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,010
Could you just talk to
me 'till I fall asleep.

383
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:01,766
Really?

384
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,476
[Brian] Yeah.

385
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,079
Okay.

386
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,953
Anne Haran's all taken
care of, but now I have

387
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:58,036
to go on a date with her.

388
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:02,009
Ooh, sorry, man, what'd you say to her?

389
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:03,408
We're feeding the dogs.

390
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:05,598
Carol, promise not to take me home.

391
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:06,431
Right.

392
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:08,557
Promise.

393
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:20,128
(door slams)

394
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:22,487
Rody's house is headquarters, Beetle.

395
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,972
We can't lock up the dogs
every time you wanna come help.

396
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:25,889
Big deal.

397
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,285
Beetle, keep it down.

398
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,618
(footsteps)

399
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,560
(tree rustling)

400
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:51,535
Hey.

401
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,387
Hey.

402
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,940
What's up?

403
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,107
Nothing, just throwing some
raisins at Patrick's window.

404
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:07,232
He must be asleep.

405
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,065
Yeah.

406
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:10,888
You tired?

407
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:22,130
You know what's weird?

408
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:27,316
Every time I see a blue car
pass, I think for a second

409
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:28,733
it must be Wendy.

410
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:33,853
Yeah, one of the only
conversations that we had

411
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:38,020
that I remember was at Rody's
cowboys and Indians party.

412
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:42,891
Where Wendy came-

413
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:44,724
- [Both] As a pilgrim.

414
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:46,756
Right.

415
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:51,305
Yeah, anyway, we were
up late just talking

416
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:55,388
and I asked her which one
of our group of friends

417
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:59,194
she would marry if she had to pick.

418
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:04,256
She said she'd marry you if
she could turn into a boy.

419
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:08,091
I said she should just
turn into me and I'd be her

420
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:11,924
as long as I didn't have
to go out with Brian.

421
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,229
(eerie chimes)

422
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:32,067
[Addy] Why don't you guys like Brian?

423
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:35,471
Brian, he's an okay guy.

424
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:43,371
I just don't feel like
he appreciates people.

425
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,162
I don't understand why he has to look so-

426
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:50,983
- Brian is just different,
he thinks a lot about things.

427
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:52,767
Well, yeah, but Addy, so do I.

428
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:56,514
I mean, I'm always thinking about things.

429
00:37:56,514 --> 00:38:00,347
Brian just, he just
thinks about himself Addy.

430
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:09,440
Maybe, but you know I just
don't like it when you and

431
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:16,811
Patrick act like it's you
two versus everybody else.

432
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:19,259
Addy, sorry.

433
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,674
No, I'm sorry.

434
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:38,540
(click)

435
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,373
(distant screams)

436
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:46,187
(dog barking)

437
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:55,102
(slow music)

438
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:57,352
It's all just so strange.

439
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:01,248
I'd really, I'd really just
like to know for certain

440
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:05,532
that I felt a certain
way about everything,

441
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,282
like everybody's parents seem to.

442
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,918
I'm not even really sad.

443
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,251
They didn't even know Wendy.

444
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,992
Do you ever feel that way?

445
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,532
Don't you ever just wish
you could wake up one day

446
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:28,949
and be completely in control of yourself?

447
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:37,974
Yeah, I, I'm just not sure I know how

448
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,349
to think like that Addy.

449
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:48,204
Yeah.

450
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,588
You keep saying my name.

451
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:55,762
Really?

452
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,512
I didn't even notice.

453
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,900
Well, you do and it sounds funny.

454
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,763
Addy, Addy, Addy, Addy,

455
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:04,761
Carol stop it.

456
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,548
Adelaide Everly Greer.

457
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:07,381
Geez.

458
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,906
(dog barking)

459
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:36,753
(retching)

460
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,326
What am I doing?

461
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:48,253
(military horns)

462
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:55,422
(western music)

463
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,923
You can pet him if you want Beetle.

464
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:09,785
Don't touch their heads
while they're drinking, okay.

465
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:12,535
(glass breaking)

466
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:15,903
Stay here.

467
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,116
(dog groans)

468
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:33,489
Man, she's pissed about something.

469
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,476
Yeah, this is good.

470
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:54,309
Good idea.

471
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,900
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

472
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:19,204
She's not chewing.

473
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,204
No, but she's sucking.

474
00:42:45,054 --> 00:42:49,221
You know, Patrick, everything
we're feeding her is dead.

475
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,821
(alternative music)

476
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,108
Yeah, that's the one.

477
00:43:20,796 --> 00:43:22,808
[Carol] You know I can't.

478
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,045
'Cause you're gonna
kiss Anne Haran all night?

479
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:25,946
No.

480
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:28,090
Are you gonna hug Anne Haran?

481
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,728
Beetle, I'm just gonna
get this thing over with.

482
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:35,311
(upbeat music)

483
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,069
[Voiceover] Welcome
to Frank 'N Burger dude.

484
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:51,950
[Carol] Hey, can I get
a chocolate milkshake?

485
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,450
[Voiceover] Comin' right up.

486
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:57,638
[Voiceover] Okay, nice bike.

487
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,138
(engine revs)

488
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,084
(bell rings)

489
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:07,651
There you go, man.

490
00:44:07,651 --> 00:44:09,318
Oh, and a straw.

491
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:13,779
Hey, I'll give it to your
friend if you tell your brother

492
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:16,858
to put in a good word to Addy for me.

493
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:19,775
Thanks anyway, you can keep that.

494
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:26,138
(alternative music)

495
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:44,692
I did a monologue for
the school talent show.

496
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:45,534
It was from MacBeth.

497
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:47,218
It was really twisted.

498
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,379
They loved it though, it was great.

499
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:50,705
I had the time of my life.

500
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,679
You sure I can't get you a plate?

501
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:54,846
No, that's okay, thanks.

502
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:58,328
She made extra for you.

503
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:02,351
I didn't know that.

504
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,142
That was very nice.

505
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:04,975
For you.

506
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:07,376
Daddy.

507
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:20,929
(rat squeaking)

508
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,429
(scary music)

509
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,172
[Voiceover] Carol,
how's your summer been?

510
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,005
Good.

511
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:52,938
Difficult.

512
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,938
[Voiceover] Difficult?

513
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:59,629
Well, with Wendy's passing.

514
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:01,879
I don't think she's gone.

515
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:05,009
But, hmm.

516
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,764
What do you mean?

517
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:11,880
I think they stopped
searching for her prematurely.

518
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,713
Daddy.

519
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:25,209
Carol, darling, where are
you taking me out tonight?

520
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,500
I thought we'd stay here.

521
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,392
I rode my bicycle over.

522
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:40,974
Carol, interesting name, Carol (laughs).

523
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,522
Bathroom?

524
00:47:52,522 --> 00:47:53,439
That way.

525
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,945
[Carol] Patrick.

526
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:08,695
Something happened.

527
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,408
Just look at her.

528
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:28,156
She looks the same.

529
00:48:29,513 --> 00:48:30,680
What happened?

530
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:38,155
I showed her the rat, She got worked up.

531
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:40,126
She got up.

532
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:45,482
Well, she probably wants to eat.

533
00:48:57,554 --> 00:49:00,221
(rat squealing)

534
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:04,138
Patrick give me the rat.

535
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:08,639
Shh.

536
00:49:22,194 --> 00:49:24,861
(rat squeaking)

537
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,872
She ate the rat.

538
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:43,495
(retching noises)

539
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:54,241
That is so gross.

540
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:09,982
So, can she see Rody's
house from her window?

541
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:14,181
I never made it to her bedroom.

542
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:24,744
Patrick her dress needs
to go into the laundry.

543
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,682
[Patrick] Let's get her out of here.

544
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:10,005
(hairdryer blowing)

545
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:17,013
Maybe Donna has something
that she can change into.

546
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:18,259
What?

547
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:20,297
Maybe Donna has something
that she can change into.

548
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,901
I can't hear you,
turn off the blow dryer.

549
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:26,246
Maybe Donna has something
that she could wear.

550
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:29,079
[Patrick] I'll check the closet.

551
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:44,604
No wonder Donna left all this crap behind.

552
00:51:48,747 --> 00:51:50,223
Ah.

553
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:52,048
(laughs)

554
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:55,381
We're raiding Wendy's closet tomorrow.

555
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:59,775
[Carol] Yeah, but won't
Wendy's parents be there?

556
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:01,521
[Patrick] Relax, just stay in the car.

557
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:03,938
I'll take care of everything.

558
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:10,997
(knocks)

559
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:21,468
Hi, Patrick.

560
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,481
They're upstairs.

561
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:26,314
Oh.

562
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,725
[Voiceover] I made lunch.

563
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:30,570
Why don't you go upstairs
and tell them it's ready.

564
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,987
[Patrick] Sure.

565
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:37,852
(gentle music)

566
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,668
Patrick.

567
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,931
Adelaide.

568
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:53,215
Hi Brian.

569
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:55,548
[Voiceover] Hello Patrick.

570
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,333
What are you doing?

571
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,257
I wonder why Addy didn't
wonder why I wasn't with you?

572
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:12,974
What the hell are you doing?

573
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:18,161
Getting some lipstick.

574
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,971
[Addy] Did Mrs. Hearst
know you were coming?

575
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:21,522
No.

576
00:53:21,522 --> 00:53:22,813
Did she know you were coming?

577
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:23,789
Did you guys meet up here?

578
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,466
I didn't see your cars.

579
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:27,383
Well, Brian drove me.

580
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,823
Oh, so you came together.

581
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:38,305
What was Brian doing there?

582
00:53:39,944 --> 00:53:42,872
He was having lunch with
Mrs. Hearst and sitting

583
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:45,872
all creepy on Wendy's bed with Addy.

584
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:48,401
Crap.

585
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:56,195
Mrs. Hearst told me to tell
you guys lunch was ready.

586
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,879
I'll just stay up
here if you don't mind.

587
00:53:57,879 --> 00:53:59,423
Tell her I'll be down in a minute.

588
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,006
Sure, sure, okay.

589
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,036
I'm going to put her in this one.

590
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,348
Are you gonna just take her clothes off?

591
00:54:58,348 --> 00:54:59,242
You got a better idea?

592
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:01,829
It's not like I'm gonna look.

593
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:02,662
Okay.

594
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:05,642
Do you want my help?

595
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,403
I can manage.

596
00:55:07,403 --> 00:55:10,153
Besides, what would Addy think?

597
00:55:12,287 --> 00:55:13,204
Whatever.

598
00:55:22,474 --> 00:55:25,474
(alternative music)

599
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:45,129
Then he got up and
left and that was that.

600
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:47,249
Like no hug, no kiss goodbye.

601
00:55:47,249 --> 00:55:48,293
I didn't get to walk him to his bike.

602
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:51,052
I mean can you believe that?

603
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:54,526
Oh, yeah, that sucks Anne Haran.

604
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:55,359
Yeah.

605
00:55:56,774 --> 00:55:58,107
So, how's Brian?

606
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:00,281
He's okay.

607
00:56:01,806 --> 00:56:04,885
I think us hanging out
is helping him a lot.

608
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:06,524
I'm gonna call him after I'm done here.

609
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:09,441
I think that's a good idea, Addy.

610
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,788
You know he was really
in love with her Anne.

611
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,990
[Wendy] To my little Brian Z.

612
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,484
I never thought a name
guessing game to lead to this.

613
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,320
One year later and you
still make me feel like

614
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,440
I swallowed a big piece of ice.

615
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,973
I guess you were right.

616
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:46,345
I'll never get used to boys.

617
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:48,762
Love, your girlfriend, Wendy.

618
00:56:51,395 --> 00:56:56,244
P.S. Don't forget what you
said, 6576, magic numbers

619
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:57,994
with no middle names.

620
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:41,314
(sobbing)

621
00:57:58,419 --> 00:57:59,809
[Addy] Hello?

622
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,475
Hi, is Addy there.

623
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:03,305
Yeah, hey, Carol.

624
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:04,498
Hey.

625
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:07,302
Are you sick or something.

626
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:09,820
[Addy] No, I'm not sick.

627
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,987
Okay, are you upset about something?

628
00:58:14,526 --> 00:58:15,654
[Addy] What do you think Carol?

629
00:58:15,654 --> 00:58:16,487
Right.

630
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:20,723
Do you want to talk about it?

631
00:58:20,723 --> 00:58:23,306
Probably, just not right now.

632
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:26,110
Addy, it's okay if
you feel like you need

633
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,777
to talk about Wendy.

634
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:31,967
I've gotta go Carol, bye.

635
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:32,800
Bye.

636
00:58:39,568 --> 00:58:40,401
Crap.

637
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:46,426
(slow music)

638
00:59:03,515 --> 00:59:07,598
[Beetle] 7/6, Wendy's 18th birthday.

639
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,425
(alternative music)

640
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:48,729
Wendy once told me she never
wanted anyone to surprise

641
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:51,745
her on her birthday, but somebody tried

642
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,495
to every year anyway.

643
00:59:56,102 --> 01:00:00,269
That's why I made her the card,
but I never gave it to her.

644
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:15,871
(choir singing)

645
01:01:42,804 --> 01:01:46,804
(creepy piano music with bells)

646
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:03,109
Happy birthday.

647
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:40,519
(glass breaks)

648
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,869
(soft squealing)

649
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,612
Addy, what are you still doing here?

650
01:05:54,612 --> 01:05:58,029
Didn't anyone tell you you could go home?

651
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:10,192
[Beetle] Wendy's
birthday made Carol realize

652
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:14,387
that he had a mission, to
make Addy his girlfriend

653
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,470
before the end of summer.

654
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:27,572
(engine revs)

655
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,961
(moans)

656
01:06:46,117 --> 01:06:48,200
Crap, crap, crap, crap.

657
01:06:49,494 --> 01:06:50,327
(bell rings)

658
01:06:50,327 --> 01:06:51,160
Ow!

659
01:06:53,448 --> 01:06:57,293
[Beetle] Most of Carol's
plans didn't work out,

660
01:06:57,293 --> 01:07:01,786
but sometimes things are
just supposed to happen.

661
01:07:01,786 --> 01:07:05,786
[Addy And Anne] Hey,
Carol, hey darling, heya!

662
01:07:08,729 --> 01:07:09,562
Oh.

663
01:07:15,756 --> 01:07:17,089
I broke my bike.

664
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:22,572
[Anne] Yeah, I was just
gonna say are you okay?

665
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,312
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

666
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:28,182
I was just riding around
and I popped a wheelie

667
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:30,451
and the wheel came off.

668
01:07:30,451 --> 01:07:31,868
Can I get a ride?

669
01:07:34,037 --> 01:07:35,870
Isn't that your car?

670
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:40,193
That's Patrick.

671
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:42,452
He must have left that there.

672
01:07:42,452 --> 01:07:44,418
If I take it, he'll be stranded, so-

673
01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:46,251
- I can take you home.

674
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,920
Well, it's on Addy's way.

675
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,725
No, it isn't.

676
01:07:51,725 --> 01:07:54,698
Don't sweat it, I got it.

677
01:07:54,698 --> 01:07:55,531
Come on.

678
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:03,264
[Carol] Addy, I'm sorry.

679
01:08:03,264 --> 01:08:07,081
I never apologized for
being a jerk on the phone.

680
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:09,395
It's okay, you weren't being a jerk.

681
01:08:09,395 --> 01:08:11,978
It was just a bad time to call.

682
01:08:14,778 --> 01:08:18,111
But it was good time to wreck your bike.

683
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:20,889
Humph!

684
01:08:23,973 --> 01:08:26,390
Carol you are unbelievable.

685
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,918
[Carol] What happened?

686
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:05,085
Wendy, she was, anyway it was Wendy.

687
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,620
She couldn't help it.

688
01:09:14,507 --> 01:09:15,916
[Carol] So what do you do here

689
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:19,083
when me and Beetle aren't around?

690
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,666
What do you mean?

691
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:23,472
Never mind.

692
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:30,306
Wait, I got an idea.

693
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:50,418
I'm gonna go.

694
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:12,454
(alternative music)

695
01:10:13,432 --> 01:10:16,361
Beetle, did you go over
to Rody's at all last night?

696
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:17,194
Huh-uh.

697
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:20,193
I need you be over there when I'm not

698
01:10:20,193 --> 01:10:22,730
so you can tell me what happens.

699
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,730
I want you to spy on Patrick for me.

700
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,069
[Beetle] Patrick was waiting for me

701
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,319
when I got to Rody's house.

702
01:10:44,357 --> 01:10:45,610
Just in time.

703
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,375
Just the man I wanted to see.

704
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,277
He told me he was
working on a secret plan

705
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:51,807
to get Carol and Addy together.

706
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:53,667
I got something here
I've been working on.

707
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:55,814
But really I knew it was a secret plan

708
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:57,771
to get Carol out of his way.

709
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,021
D.E.O, darling eyes only.

710
01:11:01,483 --> 01:11:04,483
(alternative music)

711
01:11:15,635 --> 01:11:19,908
[Patrick] Everything you
need is now in your hands.

712
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,325
[Beetle] Darling eyes only.

713
01:11:26,038 --> 01:11:27,568
The list?

714
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:30,144
[Beetle] The list was 13
steps that Carol had to execute

715
01:11:30,144 --> 01:11:32,433
to win Addy's heart.

716
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:34,552
You really think this will work?

717
01:11:34,552 --> 01:11:35,527
[Beetle] I knew this
would be his last chance

718
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:39,110
before summer ended
and Addy left for good.

719
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:43,393
Number one, the decoy.

720
01:11:43,393 --> 01:11:45,834
Use Anne Haran to make Addy jealous.

721
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,384
Anne Haran, you want a soda?

722
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:50,934
Why yes, Carol,
darling, I would love one.

723
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:53,005
[Carol] Okay.

724
01:11:53,005 --> 01:11:54,845
Hey, I want one, too.

725
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:56,095
[Carol] Okay.

726
01:12:01,268 --> 01:12:04,351
Where the hell are all the ice cubes?

727
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:11,766
We only have one ice cube.

728
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:12,849
Who wants it?

729
01:12:14,924 --> 01:12:16,416
She can have it.

730
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,522
Do you want it?

731
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:20,048
Do you really want it?

732
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:21,287
Yes, Carol.

733
01:12:21,287 --> 01:12:22,120
Okay.

734
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,457
Ah, Carol, darling, I'm gonna kill you.

735
01:12:26,457 --> 01:12:29,232
[Carol] No, Anne Haran.

736
01:12:29,232 --> 01:12:31,880
You are so in for it Carol.

737
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,623
Hey, Addy, are you seeing this?

738
01:12:34,623 --> 01:12:36,206
Wait, I can't swim.

739
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:39,299
[Beetle] Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.

740
01:12:39,299 --> 01:12:41,154
Carol can't swim.

741
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:43,237
(splash)

742
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:55,692
I didn't know he couldn't swim.

743
01:12:55,692 --> 01:12:58,109
Even babies know how to swim.

744
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:11,101
Thanks, Addy.

745
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,088
[Beetle] There's a
thing about dead things.

746
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:16,934
They're not what they were.

747
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,348
With Carol gone, I learned
something about my brothers.

748
01:13:20,348 --> 01:13:24,037
They're not themselves without each other.

749
01:13:24,037 --> 01:13:26,704
(jumping music)

750
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:37,946
Shh.

751
01:13:43,437 --> 01:13:46,201
[Beetle] Number five, swimming lessons.

752
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:47,811
I don't know Anne Haran.

753
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:50,894
I still think he has a thing for you.

754
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:55,771
(alternative music)

755
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:08,153
[Beetle] Number seven,
get her on a boat.

756
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:08,986
Any boat.

757
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:17,484
Guess who I just talked to on the phone?

758
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:18,317
Who?

759
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:19,655
Carol, darling.

760
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,719
What did he want?

761
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,337
He called asking where you were.

762
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:23,837
I didn't tell him.

763
01:14:24,942 --> 01:14:28,613
I told you he like adores
you, it's ridiculous.

764
01:14:28,613 --> 01:14:32,780
[Beetle] Number eight,
always who is Mr. Fun, you are.

765
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:44,502
Number ten, tell as many
people as you can that Addy

766
01:14:44,502 --> 01:14:46,475
is a lot of fun to hang out with.

767
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:48,225
I really like Addy.

768
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:54,260
You know who'd really like this game?

769
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,177
Addy Greer.

770
01:14:56,179 --> 01:14:57,964
To tell you the truth, I
totally think Addy's a lot

771
01:14:57,964 --> 01:14:59,964
of fun to hang out with.

772
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,368
You know, he does seem
to be around every time

773
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:04,618
I need someone.

774
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:07,856
And people I don't even
know, keep asking me

775
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:09,606
if he's my boyfriend.

776
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:16,739
(water spraying)

777
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:18,323
You know, I bet Addy Greer could teach

778
01:15:18,323 --> 01:15:20,407
me a thing about tennis.

779
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:21,240
Oh, shoot.

780
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:27,571
Man, I think Addy's a lot
of fun to hang out with.

781
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:29,222
[Voiceover] So you coming to my party?

782
01:15:29,222 --> 01:15:30,292
With Addy.

783
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,292
All right.

784
01:15:35,623 --> 01:15:38,623
Addy Greer got me this skateboard.

785
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:46,319
(balls striking)

786
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:10,418
[Beetle] I thought the
list would make Carol braver,

787
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:12,430
but it just made him forget.

788
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,930
All I could do is wait until he came back.

789
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,314
[Carol] Does dad know where you are?

790
01:16:23,314 --> 01:16:24,228
I told him I was sleeping over

791
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:26,645
at Edwin Lokey's mom's house.

792
01:16:27,702 --> 01:16:28,535
Good.

793
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:31,851
What do you got for me?

794
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:39,770
Hold her Beet, I think
she's starting to move.

795
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:42,821
What did you do?

796
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:46,904
Look if you can't help,
then you have to go home.

797
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,006
[Beetle] All he does is hurt her.

798
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:51,839
Does he?

799
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:02,289
I don't know.

800
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:04,372
I can't breathe in there.

801
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:14,455
He told me I had to sit
outside because I'm a baby.

802
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:15,385
That's stupid.

803
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:17,052
Yeah, he's stupid.

804
01:17:18,903 --> 01:17:20,921
He doesn't care, Carol.

805
01:17:20,921 --> 01:17:22,242
Why doesn't he just take
her back to the place

806
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:23,825
where we found her?

807
01:17:24,793 --> 01:17:26,876
I showed him where to go.

808
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:37,352
Beetle, is he doing anything gross?

809
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:42,766
Have you seen him try
to kiss her or anything?

810
01:17:42,766 --> 01:17:44,349
Are you retarded?

811
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,469
Carol, are we gonna break the pact?

812
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:55,302
No, keep quiet, stay
here, I'll talk to him.

813
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:58,852
[Addy] I'm serious.

814
01:17:58,852 --> 01:17:59,897
Keep them closed.

815
01:17:59,897 --> 01:18:02,710
I can't do it if you're watching.

816
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,210
Okay, I promise.

817
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:10,470
[Beetle] Number 11, rumor has
it Addy writes secret songs.

818
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:20,677
Patrick.

819
01:18:20,677 --> 01:18:23,953
Hey, Carol, where you been all summer?

820
01:18:23,953 --> 01:18:26,370
Guess the list was a success.

821
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:30,676
♫ What is wrong, what can it be

822
01:18:30,676 --> 01:18:34,794
♫ Have all my days turned to Halloween

823
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:38,253
♫ My smile is lost behind ♫

824
01:18:38,253 --> 01:18:41,123
That's what I came to talk to you about.

825
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:42,373
That and Wendy.

826
01:18:45,275 --> 01:18:47,942
This isn't fun anymore, Patrick.

827
01:18:48,876 --> 01:18:53,241
Well, we're not in high
school anymore, Carol.

828
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:54,074
Fun?

829
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,441
What's your problem?

830
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:02,283
♫ I need you here by my side

831
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:06,369
♫ I want you here by my side

832
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:10,536
♫ Need you here by my side once again ♫

833
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:13,918
[Beetle] Number 13, sleaze comfort.

834
01:19:13,918 --> 01:19:16,782
[Carol] What is number 13?

835
01:19:16,782 --> 01:19:18,865
Is it what I think it is?

836
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,777
Number 13 sleaze comfort is
the consummation of the list.

837
01:19:23,777 --> 01:19:28,540
Wendy's gone, Addy's upset,
yeah, it's what you think it is.

838
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,237
I don't want to do that to her.

839
01:19:30,237 --> 01:19:32,542
[Patrick] Yes, you do.

840
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:34,656
Not like that.

841
01:19:34,656 --> 01:19:35,895
Not using Wendy.

842
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:38,728
[Patrick] We're not using Wendy.

843
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:43,170
Did you break the pact?

844
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,552
[Carol] No, I didn't say anything.

845
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:46,914
I promised I wouldn't.

846
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:48,564
♫ By my side

847
01:19:48,564 --> 01:19:50,927
♫ I want you here by my side ♫

848
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:54,843
[Carol] She's going to
be at this party tonight.

849
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:58,912
She didn't even ask me
to go, Anne Haran, did.

850
01:19:58,912 --> 01:19:59,745
Hey, Anne Haran.

851
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:00,578
[Patrick] Are you going?

852
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:02,895
Why don't you just take Carol

853
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:04,337
to the party?

854
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:08,504
No, I don't want to know any
more boarding school girls.

855
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:12,652
Patrick?

856
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:16,819
♫ Once again my love, my friend ♫

857
01:20:18,312 --> 01:20:20,463
Call Anne Haran.

858
01:20:20,463 --> 01:20:22,630
We're going to that party.

859
01:20:33,714 --> 01:20:36,214
(party music)

860
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,379
Twins, all right.

861
01:20:44,604 --> 01:20:45,687
Yeah, dude.

862
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:49,920
I guess we should find our girls.

863
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,755
Call Addy.

864
01:20:50,755 --> 01:20:52,572
Hello, my darling boys.

865
01:20:52,572 --> 01:20:55,694
Hi, Anne Haran, bye Anne Haran.

866
01:20:55,694 --> 01:20:57,861
All the BSGs have arrived.

867
01:20:59,112 --> 01:21:00,636
So come on, would you like
to meet the other Annes?

868
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:02,469
There's Anne Ferguson.

869
01:21:08,306 --> 01:21:09,223
(Whispering)

870
01:21:12,115 --> 01:21:14,289
I know a secret about
you Carol, darling.

871
01:21:14,289 --> 01:21:16,694
What's that Anne Haran?

872
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:18,527
You like Addy Greer.

873
01:21:20,577 --> 01:21:21,973
I don't know what you're talking about.

874
01:21:21,973 --> 01:21:23,390
Sure you don't.

875
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,423
It's been forever since
I've seen you Patrick.

876
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:32,173
Yeah, it's been a rough summer.

877
01:21:33,218 --> 01:21:34,051
Yeah.

878
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:38,684
When was the last time I saw you?

879
01:21:38,684 --> 01:21:40,684
I don't even remember.

880
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:44,868
It was at Wendy's.

881
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:47,098
You were there with Brian.

882
01:21:47,098 --> 01:21:48,348
That's right.

883
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,644
Did she give you that?

884
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:04,134
I don't like you anymore,
you know that right?

885
01:22:04,134 --> 01:22:05,300
I know Anne Haran.

886
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,192
No, really, I totally
don't like you at all,

887
01:22:07,192 --> 01:22:08,192
so over you.

888
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:10,201
Cool.

889
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:13,605
So you've been hanging
out with my brother a lot?

890
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:17,438
Yeah, he's a really
sweet guy, a lot of fun.

891
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,353
What do you guys do?

892
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,342
What do you talk about?

893
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:23,175
Wendy.

894
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:28,802
Have a drink, Patrick.

895
01:22:28,802 --> 01:22:31,892
I don't need a drink to cut loose.

896
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:33,059
Cuttin' loose!

897
01:22:35,146 --> 01:22:37,646
(house music)

898
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,399
I thought we agreed we
weren't going to talk

899
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:27,316
to anybody about Wendy?

900
01:23:28,582 --> 01:23:31,490
Patrick, I think she should know.

901
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,118
If Beetle can know, so can Addy.

902
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:34,951
No, Carol, the pact.

903
01:23:36,098 --> 01:23:37,384
Addy's not our sister, she's not even

904
01:23:37,384 --> 01:23:39,806
your girlfriend is she?

905
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:43,723
No, she's not my
girlfriend, she's my friend.

906
01:23:45,005 --> 01:23:48,941
She's your friend, too,
at least she used to be.

907
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,024
She is my friend but what do
you think is going to happen

908
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:53,225
if everybody starts to find out?

909
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:55,778
How long do you think you
can keep her there Patrick?

910
01:23:55,778 --> 01:23:57,558
Rody is coming home.

911
01:23:57,558 --> 01:23:59,862
Rody's parents are coming home.

912
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:01,639
It doesn't matter, Carol.

913
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:03,568
You finally realize that Addy
Greer would rather date her

914
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:05,625
dead best friend's old boyfriend than you?

915
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,105
Shut up Patrick.

916
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:09,002
Addy'll never be your girlfriend.

917
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:13,711
Just like Wendy'll never
be yours, so fuck off.

918
01:24:13,711 --> 01:24:14,711
Let her die.

919
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:28,210
(faint screams)

920
01:24:30,308 --> 01:24:32,808
(dog barking)

921
01:24:49,387 --> 01:24:50,220
Carol.

922
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:53,127
Where's Patrick?

923
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:55,400
He left.

924
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,117
He didn't even say goodbye.

925
01:25:05,193 --> 01:25:08,193
Do you want to come outside with me?

926
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,163
Okay.

927
01:25:32,645 --> 01:25:34,907
It's better out here.

928
01:25:34,907 --> 01:25:37,846
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

929
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:38,679
Yeah.

930
01:25:51,297 --> 01:25:53,797
Are you ever going to kiss me?

931
01:25:58,297 --> 01:26:01,630
Addy, I've never kissed a girl before.

932
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:16,393
Let's get awesome.

933
01:26:35,671 --> 01:26:38,171
(dog barking)

934
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,643
[Voiceover] Hey, Rody,
we know you're in there.

935
01:26:56,789 --> 01:26:58,039
What's wrong?

936
01:27:01,294 --> 01:27:04,329
This whole summer everything has changed

937
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:08,412
and I just want to know
what's going on with you?

938
01:27:12,606 --> 01:27:13,856
I don't know.

939
01:27:15,132 --> 01:27:17,363
I haven't seen Patrick all
summer, I've gotten to be

940
01:27:17,363 --> 01:27:19,196
pretty close with you.

941
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,933
Brian won't even talk to me.

942
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,803
What's going on with you and Brian?

943
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:39,695
After everything happened
with Wendy this summer,

944
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:43,862
Brian and I started spending
a lot of time together.

945
01:27:45,939 --> 01:27:47,528
Oh, God.

946
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,361
Carol.

947
01:27:48,361 --> 01:27:50,185
No, I'm sorry.

948
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:51,018
Go on.

949
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,046
It's just-

950
01:27:54,046 --> 01:27:56,129
You sleaze comforted him?

951
01:28:00,145 --> 01:28:02,228
You sleaze comforted him.

952
01:28:13,052 --> 01:28:16,635
(upbeat alternative music)

953
01:28:27,209 --> 01:28:31,126
I found some more, it's
Patrick darling, run!

954
01:28:33,389 --> 01:28:35,139
You broke the pact.

955
01:28:42,676 --> 01:28:43,533
What's this?

956
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:45,697
It's just toilet paper, I
didn't want them to find Wendy.

957
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:46,965
So you helped them roll Rody's house?

958
01:28:46,965 --> 01:28:47,798
No, I didn't.

959
01:28:47,798 --> 01:28:48,971
No, I didn't.

960
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:51,669
I didn't break the pact.

961
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:54,510
♫ Through the storms and all thundering ♫

962
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:56,268
Shut up Beetle, you little cry baby.

963
01:28:56,268 --> 01:28:57,999
While you're at it, tell
your dogs to shut up, too.

964
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,394
She doesn't need you Patrick.

965
01:28:59,394 --> 01:29:03,227
She's not even your
girlfriend, she's Brian's.

966
01:29:13,463 --> 01:29:15,120
Well, guess what B?

967
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,703
They're not even your
dogs, they're Rody's.

968
01:29:39,085 --> 01:29:39,918
Addy.

969
01:29:41,196 --> 01:29:44,529
You should know something about Patrick.

970
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:00,710
Leave me alone, I can't stand you.

971
01:30:07,556 --> 01:30:10,139
(dogs whining)

972
01:30:18,192 --> 01:30:20,775
(gentle music)

973
01:30:44,034 --> 01:30:46,367
(sobbing)

974
01:31:18,855 --> 01:31:22,482
Beetle, does your father
know where you are?

975
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:26,029
Addy, you have to come with me.

976
01:31:26,029 --> 01:31:27,446
It's about Wendy.

977
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:40,042
(doorbell rings)

978
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,313
Something you wanted to talk about.

979
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:03,221
I'm having trouble remembering
any stories about Wendy.

980
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:07,921
I'm starting to think I just
didn't know her all that well.

981
01:32:07,921 --> 01:32:09,919
She seemed to know you pretty well.

982
01:32:09,919 --> 01:32:12,252
I mean, well, she wanted to.

983
01:32:16,107 --> 01:32:18,024
How did you meet her?

984
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,868
[Brian] At school.

985
01:32:24,868 --> 01:32:27,646
When we first started
going out, we were sitting

986
01:32:27,646 --> 01:32:31,813
drinking chocolate milkshakes
and I told her I'd dump

987
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:37,915
my milkshake on her head and
she said she'd punched me

988
01:32:37,915 --> 01:32:41,998
in the face if I did and
so I did and she punched

989
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:45,248
me in the face and it hurt.

990
01:32:54,452 --> 01:32:58,245
What does Wendy have
to do with Rody's house?

991
01:32:58,245 --> 01:33:01,328
Addy, promise you won't get scared.

992
01:33:02,406 --> 01:33:03,489
We found her.

993
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,545
How did you meet her?

994
01:33:14,692 --> 01:33:15,859
Fall formal.

995
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:22,279
I thought I was gonna kiss her that night.

996
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:40,328
Oh, yeah.

997
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:46,223
Don't tell Patrick I have this.

998
01:33:46,223 --> 01:33:47,056
Okay.

999
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,919
[Patrick] Did she ever
tell you anything else

1000
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:55,336
about me and her?

1001
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:58,813
No, should she have?

1002
01:34:14,757 --> 01:34:16,090
I don't know.

1003
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:24,961
(sobbing)

1004
01:34:24,961 --> 01:34:28,128
This is hitting me harder than anyone.

1005
01:34:44,369 --> 01:34:46,786
You're such a faggot Patrick.

1006
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,240
Leave me alone.

1007
01:35:07,523 --> 01:35:08,440
In there.

1008
01:35:11,776 --> 01:35:14,359
(gentle music)

1009
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:43,994
(driving music)

1010
01:35:43,994 --> 01:35:44,827
Beetle?

1011
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,125
You broke the pact first.

1012
01:36:04,647 --> 01:36:06,480
[Carol] Hello, Addy?

1013
01:36:08,023 --> 01:36:10,190
I'm coming over right now.

1014
01:36:26,882 --> 01:36:29,215
(sobbing)

1015
01:36:45,483 --> 01:36:49,650
[Beetle] They were all
yelling and Patrick was crying.

1016
01:36:55,544 --> 01:36:59,711
The night before the funeral
at dinner we were all quiet.

1017
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:14,081
Whenever dad talks about mom, it's quiet.

1018
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:20,916
Beetle?

1019
01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:28,082
Beetle?

1020
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:38,021
She's gone.

1021
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:43,668
[Beetle] When we found Wendy
in the field it was quiet.

1022
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:46,751
[Carol] I'll take her to the field.

1023
01:37:56,722 --> 01:37:59,222
(engine revs)

1024
01:38:40,113 --> 01:38:40,946
Beetle!

1025
01:38:55,285 --> 01:38:58,535
Addy, I don't know what I was thinking.

1026
01:39:05,844 --> 01:39:07,511
It doesn't matter.

1027
01:39:12,919 --> 01:39:14,502
Carol, I'm leaving.

1028
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:20,158
Summer's over.

1029
01:39:30,538 --> 01:39:33,205
(driving music)

1030
01:42:10,595 --> 01:42:13,023
[Beetle] Your average
country cicada spends much

1031
01:42:13,023 --> 01:42:15,690
of it's natural life in silence.

1032
01:42:17,193 --> 01:42:19,537
It emerges from the ground
for three short months

1033
01:42:19,537 --> 01:42:22,078
to sing and make love.

1034
01:42:22,078 --> 01:42:25,745
It does this until the
moment if it's death.

1035
01:42:28,156 --> 01:42:29,201
I now know what-

1036
01:42:29,201 --> 01:42:32,951
- What the fuck happened
to my house darling?

1037
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:38,958
(sprinkler whirring)

1038
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:56,166
[Beetle] Just forget it.

1039
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:03,397
