1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,148
[woman]<i> Let me tell you
the tale of Jimmy Stubbins</i>

2
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,358
<i>and the golden jingle bells.</i>

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>It all began 100 years ago when
the small town of Pleasant Bay</i>

4
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>fell on hard times.</i>

5
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,829
<i>A drought caused the
local river to run dry,</i>

6
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>which shut down the lumber mill,</i>

7
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>putting most of the
townsfolk out of work.</i>

8
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,963
<i>Spirits were down
that Christmas Eve.</i>

9
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>Kids like Jimmy
Stubbins went to sleep</i>

10
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>with little hope of
getting any presents.</i>

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,558
[thuds, bells chiming]

12
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,061
[footsteps]

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,404
[footsteps continue]

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,919
<i>Through his sleepy eyes,</i>

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>he saw something that
had dropped from the sky.</i>

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,008
[soft instrumental
music playing]

17
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>Golden jingle bells
from Santa's sleigh.</i>

18
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>As Jimmy took the bells in his
hands and felt their magic,</i>

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>he wished with all his
heart for the mill to reopen</i>

20
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,367
<i>so the town could
get back on its feet.</i>

21
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,039
<i>When he awoke on
Christmas morning,</i>

22
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,042
<i>there he saw a present
under the tree.</i>

23
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,880
[bells chiming]

24
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,757
<i>And, to his delight,</i>

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>the strip of jingle bells
still lay by his bedside.</i>

26
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,554
Mom, Dad, come quick.

27
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,472
[woman]<i> It wasn't a dream.</i>

28
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,814
Look. Merry Christmas.

29
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,982
[knock on door]

30
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,733
[man] Shane, Judy.
Are you awake?

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,194
[woman]<i> A neighbor
appeared at their door...</i>

32
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,946
Have you heard?

33
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,174
[woman]<i> The river was flowing,
and the mill was reopening.</i>

34
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>The townsfolk were all
getting their jobs back.</i>

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,912
<i>Jimmy knew his wish
had been granted.</i>

36
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,250
[Jimmy] My wish came true.
These bells must be magical!

37
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,002
Wh... what are these bells?

38
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,255
I was sleeping, and then
I heard Santa on the roof,

39
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,841
and then his sleigh was flying
away, and then his reindeer...

40
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,928
[woman]<i> The story of the golden
jingle bells spread quickly.</i>

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,556
<i>The bells were put on
display at the lumber mill</i>

42
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,058
<i>and became the town's
good luck charm.</i>

43
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,316
<i>People started coming to
Pleasant Bay from miles around</i>

44
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,777
<i>to see the bells and deliver
their own Christmas wishes.</i>

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,619
<i>The bells became a symbol of hope
for all who came to see them.</i>

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,788
<i>They were soon given a
home in the town's museum,</i>

47
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,207
<i>and every year on Christmas Eve,</i>

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,668
<i>the town held a Ringing
of the Bells ceremony.</i>

49
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,087
[Santa] Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

50
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:37,800
[woman]<i> As more and more people came to
see the bells and make their wishes...</i>

51
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,346
<i>Pleasant Bay and its
people began to flourish.</i>

52
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,140
And since that Christmas,

53
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:49,979
Pleasant Bay has had 100
years of prosperity and peace.

54
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,899
Some people say it's
just coincidence,

55
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:59,322
but true believers know it's all
because of the golden jingle bells.

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,950
[man] Fiona!

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,288
There's customers waiting
for you at the gift shop.

58
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,667
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I... I just
love telling the story of the bells.

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,293
I can take it from here.

60
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,213
[exhales softly]

61
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,549
This year marks

62
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:23,930
the 100th anniversary of Jimmy
Stubbins finding the bells.

63
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,350
So, this should be the biggest
Ringing of the Bells ever!

64
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,977
That's why people
come to our town,

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,022
to see the bells and to
make their Christmas wish.

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,817
Okay, are there any questions?

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,735
Yes, Violet, what's
your question?

68
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,488
How can Santa's sleigh still
fly when he's missing the bells?

69
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,950
[chuckles] I'm sure Santa
has plenty of other bells.

70
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,952
Does he know these
bells are here?

71
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,079
Yes, he does. And he's
very happy about it.

72
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:52,500
These bells have brought so much
good fortune to Pleasant Bay.

73
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,713
How can those be Santa's bells when
there's no such thing as Santa?

74
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,882
Reggie, of course
there's really a Santa.

75
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,884
Right, Mr. Martin?

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,344
Absolutely, young lady.

77
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,221
- See?
- Naughty list.

78
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,474
There will always
be non-believers.

79
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,269
But don't let them rob you
of your Christmas spirit.

80
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,565
Christmas is a time of
goodwill towards all men,

81
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,402
and women, people, in general.

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,488
Good tidings to all the people.

83
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,241
All right, kids, feel free to look
around the rest of the museum.

84
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,964
- [girl] Let's go look at the old fire truck.
- Let's go over there.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,254
What do you think that was for?

86
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,214
Probably for reaching
into your butt.

87
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,340
Kenny.

88
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,217
[Glenn] Where did I...

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,802
Are you okay, Mr. Martin?

90
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,639
Uh... Yeah, uh, just seem to
have misplaced my glasses.

91
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,559
You put 'em in your coat pocket
when you were yelling at Fiona.

92
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,977
Yelling?

93
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,939
[scoffs] You mean, passion,
maybe, but not... No.

94
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,733
I never put my gla... Oh...

95
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,276
Hey...

96
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,611
Hey now. [chuckles]

97
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,196
Thank you, Violet.

98
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,970
[George] Hey, what
are you kids doing?

99
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,993
- Dad!
- [chuckles] Hey, buddy.

100
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,454
- Hi, Mr. Bottoms.
- Hey, Violet. How are ya?

101
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,040
You guys enjoying your visit?

102
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,709
Listen, I was thinkin' since
you don't have school tomorrow,

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,473
why don't we make it
a boys' night tonight?

104
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,297
Oh! Can we make popcorn
and watch<i> The Batman?</i>

105
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,510
Uh, I was thinking of something
a little more Christmassy.

106
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,012
Uh... how about<i> Elf?</i>

107
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,976
I love it when he eats
his spaghetti with syrup.

108
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,517
- It's so gross!
- That is so funny. [laughs]

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,185
Hey, I was looking at that.

110
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,311
Hey!

111
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,105
[boy] Reggie, give
it back. Come on.

112
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,648
[Reggie] You want
it? Come, get it.

113
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,375
- Hey, be... be careful.
- [boy] Quit being a jerk.

114
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,211
- [Glenn] Boys, stop that.
- [suspenseful music playing]

115
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,995
- [dramatic music playing]
- [Reggie] Whoa...

116
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,488
[thuds]

117
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,204
[dramatic music intensifies]

118
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,540
[George grunts]

119
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,669
[lilting music playing]

120
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,838
[exhales heavily]

121
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,732
[Violet whispering] Oh,
my God, did you see that?

122
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,007
It almost fell on his head.

123
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,717
[panting] You all right?

124
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,184
Everything's fine.
No one's hurt. Right?

125
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,603
Yes. Thank you.

126
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,901
Did, uh... did that happen
because I didn't believe in Santa?

127
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,529
Lucky for you, I
do. [clicks tongue]

128
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,364
Okay, 20 more minutes, kids,

129
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,284
then the bus will be
taking you back to school.

130
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,869
Thank God.

131
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,996
- [bell ringing]
- [upbeat song playing]

132
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,420
Pumpkin pie's for Thanksgiving.
Pecan pie is for Christmas.

133
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,255
Pumpkin pie is for both.

134
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,216
It doesn't make any sense. The same
pie shouldn't get two holidays.

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,801
Oh, wanna go
sledding over break?

136
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,386
Do you even have to ask?

137
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,822
My dad said that there's
snow up on Table Mountain.

138
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,097
Maybe he could take us one day.

139
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,265
[Harrison] Kenny!

140
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
Come on. Mom said I have
to walk you home today.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,397
[Kenny] I can walk with Violet.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,108
No, sorry. I'm going
to the station.

143
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,027
Hey, Harrison.

144
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,239
Uh, any plans for the break?

145
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,575
Not really.

146
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,036
Yeah, me neither.

147
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,623
Um, I'll probably just
be hanging out at home.

148
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay, um, good... good talk.

149
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,300
Violet, come on, let's go.

150
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,303
- See you later, skater.
- Catch you soon, baboon.

151
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
You wanna hear about
our science project?

152
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,681
We're gonna get
up early tomorrow

153
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,850
and walk all over town
and look for leaves.

154
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,852
[upbeat song continues]

155
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,317
Why am I going to
the station today,

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,237
and what are you doing
that's so important?

157
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,529
It's none of your business.

158
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,782
[upbeat music playing
on car stereo]

159
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,374
You're going to Patty's house

160
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,085
to work on the Student
Council Santagram fundraiser.

161
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,545
What?

162
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,440
You have art supplies
sticking out of your backpack,

163
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,175
and you put on lip gloss in
case Patty's brother is there.

164
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,219
[scoffs]

165
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,555
Why can't you just act
like a normal 11-year-old?

166
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,269
[Violet chuckling]
Have fun at Patty's!

167
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,106
Hi, Sam.

168
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,274
Hey, Violet.

169
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,445
Hey, Deputy Terry.

170
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,781
Deputy Violet in da house.

171
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,158
- Ooh! Can I have one of these?

We gotta find as many

We had a 10-90 today.

A 10-90?

- A bank alarm?
- Mmm-hmm.

Someone robbed a
bank in Pleasant Bay?

189
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,797
No, no, no. It's
just a wiring glitch.

ever happens around here.

00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,058
No. She had picked up a
swing shift at the diner.

349
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,478
She didn't get back
till after 2:00.

350
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,855
And did you stay here
all night after that?

351
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,315
Yeah, I did.

352
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,237
You have your
museum keys on you?

353
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,406
Yeah. Right there
on the counter.

354
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,411
What about the high school?

355
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,247
You still picking up
custodial shifts there?

356
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,333
- Yeah. Mostly on the weekends.
- [Terry] Sheriff.

357
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,918
I have something
you need to see.

358
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,507
This is the video feed from your
site security camera last night.

359
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,800
1:12 a.m.

360
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,014
You mind if the deputies
look around a little bit?

361
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,184
Um, no.

362
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,602
Is your garage locked?

363
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,188
Side door's open.

364
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,950
What are you looking for, Grant?

365
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,451
The bells, George.

366
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,579
Somebody stole 'em last night.

367
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,662
What?

368
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,125
And you think they're here?

369
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,343
[Terry] I'll check this side.

370
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,979
[Violet] What's going on?

371
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,606
I think they're in the garage.

372
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,774
Why are they in the garage?

373
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,194
There's nothing in there. It's
just my grandma's old stuff.

374
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,620
[Sam] Terry, over here.

375
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,206
[soft suspenseful music plays]

376
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,926
This is 'cause of my
previous arrest, isn't it?

377
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,262
Well, it was for
theft, wasn't it?

378
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,849
I got in with the wrong
people. I made a mistake. Okay?

379
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,476
What's going on?

380
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,187
Nothin', Harrison. Just
go back to your room.

381
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,357
Dad, what did you do?

382
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,192
I didn't... I didn't
do anything. Okay?

383
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,569
Just, please go
back to your room.

384
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,737
[Terry] Sheriff?

385
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,784
Found this tucked between
a few boxes in the garage.

386
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,495
What... How did... I don't
know how that got here.

387
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,168
You gotta believe me, I have no
idea how that got in my garage.

388
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,711
Where are the bells, George?

389
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,006
I don't know! I told you.
Grant, come on, listen to me.

390
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,675
Why would I steal the bells?

391
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
You know me.

392
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,469
George Bottoms...

393
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,387
- Wait a minute. Guys...
- you're under arrest.

394
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,470
I swear.

395
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,559
Dad?

396
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,938
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

397
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,773
It's just a
misunderstanding, is all.

398
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,066
It's gonna be fine.

399
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,196
- Kenny, no.
- Let go of me!

400
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,116
Kenny, wait! No.

401
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,844
[Kenny] Why are they
taking Dad away?

402
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,037
Because he hasn't
changed. Okay?

403
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,960
Let me know if
you find anything.

404
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,086
You got it.

405
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,550
We can't go in the house
while they search it.

406
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,010
I called Mom at the diner.

407
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,095
She's gonna come get us
to go to the station.

408
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,858
Why don't you just have
her meet you there?

409
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,015
I can drive you guys.

410
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,018
Okay. Thank you.

411
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,728
Yeah. Let me get my keys.

412
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,938
[Harrison] Let's go.

413
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
[keyboard clacking]

414
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
Here.

415
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,660
[Sam] Yeah, that's...
pretty hard evidence.

416
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,495
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Kenny] Dad.

417
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,041
Hey. Hey, buddy.
[groans softly]

418
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,084
Dad, no. Not Mr. Bottoms.

419
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,502
What are you guys doing here?

420
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,379
We gave Harrison
and Kenny a ride.

421
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,757
Oh.

422
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,051
Your father didn't do this.

423
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,886
How do you know that?

424
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,845
Hey.

425
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,764
I did not take those bells.

426
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,101
Someone sure is trying to
make it look like I did.

427
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,896
Harrison...

428
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,565
you gotta trust me.

429
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,109
Yeah, right.

430
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,237
Let him go.

431
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,406
I know this is hard on him.

432
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,658
This is hard on all of us.

433
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,080
Harrison.

434
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,208
I believe you, Dad.

435
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,501
[sighs in relief]

436
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,005
[sighs]

437
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,298
What's that?

438
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,514
It's not good for Mr. Bottoms.

439
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,021
Sorry, Kenny.

440
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,440
George.

441
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,197
Come on.

442
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,658
Listen to me.

443
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,245
It's gonna be okay.

444
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,289
I'm gonna figure out
a way outta this.

445
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,501
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, kiddo.

446
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,002
[Pierce] Come on,
George. It's time.

447
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,393
Look, I'm sorry, George.

448
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,395
I have to follow the evidence.

449
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,862
Another Christmas
without my dad.

450
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:12,325
I know what it's like to have Christmas
without one of your parents. It sucks.

451
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,455
My dad didn't do this, Violet.

452
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,791
You are the smartest
person I know.

453
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,459
You have to help us.

454
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,554
- 'Night, guys.
- All right, good night.

455
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,598
There we go. [sighs sharply]

456
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,142
- Dad?
- Yeah?

457
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,102
I have a Christmas wish.

458
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,771
Oh, yeah? What is it?

459
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,650
I want Mr. Bottoms to be home
with Kenny for Christmas morning.

460
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,569
Oh, Violet...

461
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,405
I don't think Santa
can help with this.

462
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,908
If the bells are really magical,

463
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,117
then it'll happen.

464
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,787
You know, I wish it
were that simple.

465
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,543
Sheriff Pierce signing off.

466
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,171
Deputy Violet signing off.

467
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,464
I love you.

468
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,924
Love you, too.

469
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,594
Dad?

470
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,929
Yeah?

471
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,848
Did you find the bells
at the Bottoms house?

472
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,310
No. No, we searched
everywhere and...

473
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,229
they weren't there.

474
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,790
Doesn't it seem weird that the
case would be at the Bottoms house,

475
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,024
but not the bells?

476
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,112
Yeah, but maybe he already
did something with them.

477
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,991
Then why would he keep evidence
that would make him look guilty?

478
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,330
[sighs] I don't know.

479
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,707
I want to help.

480
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,210
With what? Mr. Bottoms' case?

481
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,295
I can do something.

482
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,524
I don't want to just sit around and
wait for someone to solve the problem.

483
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:54,135
Well, that someone would be
me because that is my job.

484
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,137
You think it was Mr. Bottoms,

485
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,848
but I don't believe
that he would do this.

486
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,020
I know that he's Kenny's dad,

487
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:09,651
but sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

488
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,195
Those bells are valuable.

489
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,447
Just get some rest, okay?

490
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,783
[sighs]

491
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,378
[mysterious music playing]

492
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,891
[doorbell dings]

493
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,023
Got any eggs?

494
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,525
Get in here.

495
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,780
[Violet] Means.
Motive. Opportunity.

496
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,534
And what is that?

497
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,578
This is what my
dad does at work.

498
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,265
He makes a board for a case and
then puts pictures on it and things.

499
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,042
It's how he decides
on possible suspects.

500
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,085
So, for your dad...

501
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,379
Means. He had keys.

502
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,881
Motive.

503
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,841
The bells are worth money.

504
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,551
Opportunity.

505
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,654
His only alibi is that he
was home sleeping last night.

506
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,473
He could have snuck out of the
house while you guys were asleep.

507
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,310
How do you know
how to do all this?

508
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,646
I've learned a lot sitting at the
police station doing my homework.

509
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:31,900
[sighs]

510
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,610
What can we do?

511
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,738
We have to find another person
who has all three of these things.

512
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,157
Then we'll have another suspect.

513
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,035
Well, who else
could be a suspect?

514
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,745
I have one idea.

515
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,830
Are we gonna need
detective stuff?

516
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,457
[upbeat music playing]

517
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,359
I think it's closed.

518
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,444
Mr. Martin's car is here.

519
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,826
[door creaking]

[suspenseful music playing]

521
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,462
Sure is quiet in here.

522
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,880
Let's check it out.

523
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,555
[whispers] Wait for me.

524
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:49,644
He's probably in his office.
Wait here. I'll be right back.

525
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,531
[suspenseful music playing]

526
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,331
Hmm.

527
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,502
Mr. Martin?

528
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,546
I'm sorry. We
were closed today.

529
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,882
I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

530
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,674
[exhales sharply]

531
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,217
Okay.

532
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,388
I only have a moment.

533
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,561
Why do you think Mr. Bottoms
would have stolen the bells?

534
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,355
Oh, I'm still hoping
it wasn't him.

535
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,691
He has been a wonderful
addition to the staff this year.

536
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,777
But it would probably
be for the money, right?

537
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,529
It usually is. Yes.

538
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,117
What is the museum's
donation money used for?

539
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,786
Just, general upkeep
of the museum, mostly.

540
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,790
Old buildings like these,
they're full of surprises.

541
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,251
If Mr. Bottoms was stealing
the bells for money,

542
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,879
why wouldn't he take
the donation money, too?

543
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,089
[suspenseful music playing]

544
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,138
[cell phone ringing]

545
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,765
[clears throat]

546
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,644
Ah. I really have to take this,
and then I have to lock up.

547
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,896
So, bye, Violet. Sorry.

548
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,649
Hi.

549
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,775
Hold on just a...

550
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,320
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Martin.

551
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,488
Bye, bye now.

552
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,114
[Mr. Martin clears
throat] Hello?

553
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,199
Yes.

554
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,793
Hey.

555
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,504
I handled the shoplifting
call at the M and M market.

556
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,965
Where's Sam?

557
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:46,010
Oh, she's out looking into
who vandalized Carl's garage.

558
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,762
What do you think's
going on, Sheriff?

559
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,889
I've never seen so
much crime here before.

560
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,017
I know the town needs its
Christmas spirit back.

561
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,936
We need to find these bells.

562
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,855
What's the latest on the pawn
shops and the jewelry stores?

563
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,607
No hits yet.

564
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,109
All right, well, stay on it.

565
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,903
Go into overtime if you
have to. Sam as well.

566
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,446
Uh, my Dad...

567
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,242
Uh, Mayor Donovan wants to
hold a press conference today.

568
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,119
About the bells. At noon.

569
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
I can run point
for the department.

570
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,873
No, no, I have to be there.
This is too important

571
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,334
for your dad and the town.

572
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,045
Yes, sir. I understand.

573
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,090
Why don't you come, too?

574
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,725
[sighs wearily]

575
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,561
[Violet] Means.

576
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,439
Who else has a key to the
museum? Mr. Martin, obviously.

577
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,066
And he was acting kind of funny.

578
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,484
What's the second "M" again?

579
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,320
Motive. Most likely money.

580
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,780
Sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

581
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,990
Why does he need money?

582
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,783
That's what we need to find out.

583
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,828
[cell phone rings]

584
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,836
I counted the money.
It's a good haul.

585
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,212
Oh, you don't need to do that.

586
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,923
I can meet you
somewhere about halfway.

587
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,091
How about the pier?

588
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,844
I'm on my way, okay?

589
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,096
He's going to the pier.
We gotta beat him there.

590
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,514
How are we gonna do that?

591
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,242
He's got a dozen
stoplights to get through.

592
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,727
If we take the footbridge,
we can get there first.

593
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,563
[Kenny groans]

594
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,957
- [Violet] Come on, Kenny!
- [grunts]

595
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,067
[tense music playing]

596
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,277
[Kenny] Whoa!

597
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,866
Slow down!

598
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,581
This way, Kenny.

599
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,375
[Kenny] Look both ways!

600
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,711
Not the stairs.

601
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,962
[Violet] You got this!

602
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,631
[tense music continues]

603
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,924
[Kenny grunting]

604
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:54,972
[tires screech]

605
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,559
There's his car.

606
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
[panting]

607
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,313
[tense music continues]

608
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,330
[Violet] We're almost there.

609
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,712
Pedestrians ahead!

610
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,756
- [grunts]
- Whoops!

611
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,591
Hey! Watch out!

612
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,718
Sorry!

613
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,302
Merry Christmas!

614
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,386
[scoffs]

615
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,701
[Mr. Martin] Barbara.

616
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,954
How are you?

617
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,248
That's not Mrs. Martin.

618
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,000
- Well, guess what?
- What?

619
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,835
We did really well this year.

620
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,712
Yeah, the donations
were through the roof.

621
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,881
[speaking imperceptibly]

622
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,638
[Kenny] What's that?

623
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,057
[Violet] It's the
museum's donation money.

624
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,115
Well, now we're never gonna
know where the money's gone.

625
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,832
We can use the police computers
to look up her license plate.

626
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,375
That doesn't sound legal.

627
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,878
That's why we're not
going to tell anybody.

628
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,802
[groans]

629
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,180
[crowd clamoring]

630
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,478
[man] Mayor.

631
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,188
Where is the bell?

632
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,374
-Guys, guys, guys, please. Please, I...
-[woman] Mayor!

633
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,776
There's never been this
many reporters before.

634
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,861
- Mayor!
- Hold on a second, please.

635
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,322
I can't hear the lady's
question. Yes, ma'am?

636
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,283
Are you going to cancel the
Ringing of the Bells celebration?

637
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,868
Absolutely not!

638
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,829
The great town of Pleasant Bay

639
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,790
represents the joy and
spirit of Christmas.

640
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,041
Not without the bells.

641
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,376
[all] Yeah!

642
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,294
That's the whole
reason everyone comes.

643
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,047
- Yes, I...
- If no one's here on Christmas Eve,

644
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,216
my bakery's out a lot of money.

645
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,051
Yes, I understand.

646
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:41,597
I've had 15 cancellations at my
hotel in the last 24 hours, Mayor.

647
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,141
The bells are the
key to everything.

648
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,101
[clamoring]

649
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,895
Yes, yes. Friends, friends.

650
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,648
Keep that Pleasant
Bay spirit up.

651
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,067
Stay hopeful,
because in this town

652
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,820
we believe in Christmas
spirit, don't we?

653
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,339
- [scattered cheering]
- And we believe... Yes!

654
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,739
And we believe in the bells.

655
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,575
This is great publicity
for the mayor.

656
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,618
[scoffs] This is horrible
publicity for the mayor.

657
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,413
But not if the bells are
found before Christmas Eve.

658
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,249
Then he would be a hero,
and get a lot of attention.

659
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,792
And with the
election coming up...

660
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,878
that's motive.

661
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,589
And we believe that
our fine police force

662
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,634
will find our bells
before Christmas Eve.

663
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,428
Wait, but what
about Mr. Martin?

664
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,805
We can't just focus
on one suspect, Kenny.

665
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,849
That's the mistake my dad
is making with your dad.

666
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,435
But what if you don't find
the bells before Christmas?

667
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,728
- [others] Yeah!
- Or ever?

668
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,397
We have Sheriff
Pierce on the case.

669
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,899
He has promised me

670
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,485
that he will return the bells
to their rightful place.

671
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,029
Am I right, Sheriff?

672
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,698
[Violet] Right now...

673
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,952
these are our suspects.

674
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
[Maddie] Suspects?

675
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,541
Violet...

676
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,670
you don't seriously think you
can solve this case, do you?

677
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,422
Why not?

678
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,609
I mean, for starters, you still
sleep with a stuffed animal.

679
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,551
I already have two new suspects.

680
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,970
She's trying to get my
dad home before Christmas.

681
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,265
And that's in two days, Maddie.

682
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,809
Kenny, I'm... I'm really
sorry about your dad.

683
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,271
I hope it's all just
a misunderstanding.

684
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,690
Can you drive me and Kenny
to the police station?

685
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,360
I just got home.

686
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,779
Kenny's mom is there
visiting his dad.

687
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,906
Kenny wants to go, too.

688
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,115
Uh, yeah.

689
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,408
Could you, please?

690
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,744
Fine.

691
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,828
I'll take you.

692
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,330
You don't... um...

693
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,391
you don't think your brother
would want to go, do you?

694
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,169
Um, I don't think so. He's
kinda mad about all of this.

695
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,213
He's been moping around
the house all day.

696
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,090
Of course. Um...

697
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,508
Okay, grab your stuff.

698
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,310
All right, here you go.

699
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,311
[Violet] Thank you, Maddie.

700
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,395
[Maddie] You're welcome.

701
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:01,362
If you're going to check in on Harrison,
your lip gloss is in the glove box.

702
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,787
All the business owners
are calling my office

703
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,039
worried no one will
come to the celebration

704
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,793
if the bells aren't found
before Christmas Eve.

705
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,629
I know, Dad. I'm
sorry about that.

706
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,464
They'll be found.

707
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,009
Now, how can you be so
sure about that, Violet?

708
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,969
The bells mean everything
to Pleasant Bay.

709
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,180
No one is going to rest until the
bells are back where they belong.

710
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,892
[chuckles] Maybe I should make
this girl the new sheriff.

711
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:36,564
She's the only one with any
determination around here.

712
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,274
We're doing the best we can.

713
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,777
Yeah, well, if your best doesn't
include finding the bells,

714
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,904
it's not enough.

715
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,573
[Sam] Sheriff's department.

716
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,992
He's out right now.
I can take a message.

717
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,662
Your dad's out on
a call, Violet.

718
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,913
I just came with Kenny.

719
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,582
He wants to see his dad.

720
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,916
Is that okay?

721
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,752
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of
course. Come on, Kenny.

722
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,462
Your mom's already back there.

723
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,424
I'm just gonna wait
in my dad's office.

724
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,134
Okay.

725
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,344
[suspenseful music playing]

726
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,769
Business is down at the diner
since those bells were stolen.

727
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,771
People's moods are, too.

728
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,148
[sighs] Well...

729
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,233
gotta keep up hope.

730
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,319
How are you holding up, son?

731
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,737
I'm okay, Dad.

732
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,907
Um, Violet's helping,
too. She's really smart.

733
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,990
[chuckles softly]

734
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,621
Well, thank you, Kenny.

735
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,039
And you make sure
you tell Violet

736
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,041
I really appreciate it.

737
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,292
And, uh...

738
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,089
tell Harrison I really miss him.

739
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,554
Password. Mom's birthday.

740
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,350
[stealthy instrumental
music playing]

741
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,661
[Sam] Sheriff's department.

742
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,204
Okay, tell me what happened.

743
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,333
Yes, as soon as he gets back.

744
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,379
Uh-huh. I'll let
the sheriff know.

745
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,682
[tense music playing]

746
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,352
[Violet] Come on. Come on.

747
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,937
Hey, what you doing?

748
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,481
I was just looking up
something for my project.

749
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,154
- On the police database?
- [sighs]

750
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,031
I just had an idea who
might have stolen the bells.

751
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
[sighs]

752
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,327
We're pretty sure we
know who stole the bells.

753
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,621
I just want to look up
a license plate number.

754
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,499
Does your dad know
you're doing this?

755
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,584
No.

756
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,590
I don't like the idea of you
keeping secrets from your dad.

757
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,341
I just don't want to worry him.

758
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,595
Well, little kids aren't
allowed on the police database.

759
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,680
But police officers are.

760
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,767
Are you a police officer?

761
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,228
No, but you are.

762
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,400
[sighs]

763
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:29,695
All right. You're gonna have to tell
me a lot more if you want my help.

764
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:34,283
Fine. I'll tell you everything. But
you have to promise you'll help me.

765
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,921
Hey.

766
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,005
Hey.

767
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,553
Do you maybe wanna
talk about anything?

768
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,931
You don't have to be
nice to me, you know.

769
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm not just being nice.

770
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,603
I thought you might
need a friend.

771
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,813
[slow instrumental
music playing]

772
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,112
I guess that doesn't
sound so bad.

773
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,874
Do you really think that your
dad could have done this?

774
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,587
He's stolen before.
That's why he was in jail.

775
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,923
What did he steal?

776
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,677
Well, nothing, really.

777
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,346
He stole nothing
and went to jail?

778
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,768
He worked in a huge warehouse,
and someone recruited him

779
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,479
to make a delivery
for a few extra bucks.

780
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,773
The truck was full
of stolen goods.

781
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,692
Oh, no.

782
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,444
Yeah. He swears he
knew nothing about it.

783
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,489
You don't believe that?

784
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,884
All I know is, we spent eight months
without him while he was in jail,

785
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,661
and everyone at school looked at me
like I was the son of a criminal.

786
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,497
- I'm sorry.
- [softly] Yeah.

787
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,964
My dad grew up here,

788
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:16,135
so we moved here from Portland when
he got out, you know? Start fresh.

789
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,139
My grandma had
left us this place.

790
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,600
Yeah, I remember her.

791
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,894
I'm really sorry
about her passing,

792
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,857
but I'm also really glad that you
got a chance to have a fresh start.

793
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,986
Now I'm the son of
a criminal again.

794
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,612
I just can't get away from it.

795
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,116
Is that why you're
not on social media?

796
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:42,828
You tried to look me up?

797
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,164
[clicks tongue]

798
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,333
Maybe.

799
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,970
Can you at least
tell me her name?

800
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:04,183
No, Violet. I already looked up the
license plate number like you asked.

801
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,393
Now you have to do the
rest of this on my terms.

802
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,686
Fine.

803
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,233
Are these cupcakes?

804
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,445
They were cupcakes.

805
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,365
Sorry. Meant to
throw that away.

806
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,744
It's not usually
such a mess in here.

807
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,163
Is that a London plane leaf?

808
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,582
Can I have this?

809
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,250
The leaf?

810
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,920
Yeah. It's for a
science project.

811
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,006
Sure. You can have the leaf.

812
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,509
I don't currently
have any plans for it.

813
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,682
[Maddie] My gosh.

814
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,270
What, the tins?

815
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,441
Yeah, um, my mom, she used to
collect this kind of stuff.

816
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,111
This one is in pretty
good condition.

817
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,784
What happened to your mom?

818
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,413
Most people get kind of
uncomfortable talking about my mom.

819
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,375
I'd like to hear about her.

820
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,295
Well, um...

821
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,801
she was an amazing person.

822
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,138
She was so funny.
[chuckles] Um...

823
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,181
she would do these little voices

824
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,225
when she would tell
us bedtime stories.

825
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,146
And she actually made Violet
pee her pants one time.

826
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,480
Poor Violet.

827
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,858
Yeah, no, it wasn't Violet.

828
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,110
- She made me pee my pants one time.
- Yep.

829
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,278
[Maddie] Um...

830
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,865
The, um...

831
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,492
The cancer...

832
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,616
[melancholy music playing]

833
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,995
came on...

834
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,706
pretty quick.

835
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,711
And then one day...

836
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,590
she was just gone.

837
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,592
[breath trembling]

838
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,765
How did Violet take it?

839
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,770
She was so little.

840
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,815
I have no idea how
she processed it.

841
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,736
How did you process it?

842
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,080
[sobbing] Maybe I
haven't yet, either.

843
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,587
[sniffing] I... I still wake
up and I walk into her kitchen

844
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,255
hoping she'll be there, so...

845
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,260
My dad chose not to
be in our kitchen.

846
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,391
I really wish you
didn't think like that.

847
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:56,271
How can you have a relationship with
him if you spend every day blaming him?

848
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,857
Take it from me.

849
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,861
One day, it'll be too late.

850
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,425
The Ashton Home?

851
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,929
That's what came up when I
searched the license plate.

852
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,599
Mr. Martin is stealing
money for a children's home?

853
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,600
Stealing? Uh...

854
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,602
Um, our newest deputy here

855
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,147
saw you giving some money to
a woman from the Ashton Home.

856
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,567
Barbara?

857
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,650
Yes, I did.

858
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,779
See? I told you. He lied to me.

859
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,240
That was our Christmas donation.

860
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:51,910
For presents, for the
children at the home.

861
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,913
Presents for children?
Not much of a crime.

862
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,250
But he...

863
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,295
You told me the donation
money was for museum upkeep.

864
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,713
It is.

865
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,798
Then why were you giving
it to the Ashton Home?

866
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,384
Oh. Those were our
December donations.

867
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,095
Everything from the first
three weeks in December

868
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,097
goes to the children's home.

869
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,308
But he said...

870
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,357
What about the bells?

871
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,401
- The bells?
- You have a key to the museum.

872
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:28,363
You could have taken the bells that
night as easily as Mr. Bottoms.

873
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,240
I...

874
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,203
I was at the Spirit
River Casino all night...

875
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,496
Did anyone see you there?

876
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,374
A lot of people saw
him there, Violet.

877
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,586
Cameras, too. We already
checked his alibi for that time.

878
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,669
[Pierce] Yeah.

879
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,964
I did that.

880
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:50,093
This is why 11-year-olds shouldn't
be running police investigations.

881
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,303
You called my dad?

882
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,263
It's for your own good, Violet.

883
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,727
You shouldn't be interfering
with this, Violet.

884
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,103
- Dad, I...
- You're just a kid.

885
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,355
I can still help.

886
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,898
But you're not helping.

887
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,275
You're taking me away from
the actual investigation.

888
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,945
Mom would have
thought I could help.

889
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,113
Violet...

890
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,032
She wouldn't just see
me as some dumb kid.

891
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,246
[sighs]

892
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,049
[stomping]

893
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:33,804
Dad?

894
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,389
We've had a rough day.

895
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,686
[knock on door]

896
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,941
You okay?

897
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,985
I'm fine.

898
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,418
I just wish I could have got
Mr. Bottoms home for Christmas.

899
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,383
Is this about something else?

900
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,510
[breath trembling]

901
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,099
I wish Mom was here.

902
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,145
She is.

903
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,273
She's in you.

904
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,608
She's in me.

905
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,653
She's part of
everything that we do.

906
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,780
Why didn't anyone save her?

907
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,283
Yeah.

908
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:44,249
Mom didn't die because
we didn't do enough.

909
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,377
Everyone did everything
that they could.

910
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,589
I wish I could have saved her.

911
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,633
Oh, Vi.

912
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,386
You couldn't have.

913
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:03,351
You know that getting
Mr. Bottoms home for Christmas...

914
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,023
it won't bring Mom
home for Christmas.

915
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,983
I had to at least try.

916
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,780
But you can't go around
accusing other people, Vi.

917
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,073
Not without real proof.

918
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,911
[Maddie sniffles]

919
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:26,041
You know, the best thing about
you, it isn't your big brain...

920
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,168
it's your big, giant heart.

921
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,463
I love you, Maddie.

922
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,131
I love you, too.

923
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,218
[whimsical music playing]

924
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,314
A little late, Terry.

925
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,358
I didn't get home till
after midnight last night.

926
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,753
Well, it's not letting up out
there. There is a list on your desk.

927
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,195
All right.

928
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,881
We're shorthanded right now.
We'll get somebody on it.

929
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,031
Deputy Violet.

930
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,699
In the house.

931
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,828
Hi, Terry. Maddie was
busy this morning.

932
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,413
She should be here any
minute to get me, though.

933
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,290
Always happy to have you here.

934
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,376
You still mad at me?

935
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,711
No.

936
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,880
I get why you called my dad.

937
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,676
It's fine. I'm done
investigating anyways.

938
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,639
Don't worry. We're
gonna solve this case.

939
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,517
I just wanna say
bye to Mr. Bottoms.

940
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,810
No problem.

941
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,025
Hey, Mr. Bottoms.

942
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,402
How are you doing?

943
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,778
Hey, Violet.

944
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,408
I'm okay. All
things considered.

945
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,869
Maggie brought me a change
of clothes, which was nice.

946
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,580
I hear you're on the case.

947
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,666
I was, but Deputy
Terry ratted me out.

948
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,209
[chuckles]

949
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,712
[sighs] Oh, Terry.

950
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,007
How long have you known him?

951
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,176
I knew him from back in my
basketball coaching days.

952
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,596
His dad asked me to make
him an assistant coach.

953
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,181
Instill some discipline.

954
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,308
How'd that go?

955
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,268
Not good.

956
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,770
I had to fire him.

957
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,774
He wasn't too happy about
that. Neither was his dad.

958
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,777
You know, the mayor
is pretty hard on him.

959
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,072
But look at him now.
I guess it worked out.

960
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,532
Look at him now?

961
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,118
The mayor asked my dad to
give him this job, too.

962
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,662
- That's the reason he works here.
- [chuckles]

963
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,666
I guess it's all about
who you know, isn't it?

964
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,045
I guess.

965
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,463
Bye, Mr. Bottoms.

966
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,130
Bye, Violet.

967
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,273
[suspenseful music playing]

968
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,952
[music increases in tempo]

969
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,709
Mr. Bottoms, do you
own any white sneakers?

970
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,921
White sneakers? No.

971
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,216
Pretty much, these are my work
boots. It's all I ever wear. Why?

972
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,679
I think I might have
to reopen your case.

973
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,681
Okay.

974
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,935
[tense music playing]

975
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,120
Maddie, I think I
found some proof.

976
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,164
Violet Pierce, I thought
you were done with this.

977
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,876
I was wrong about Glenn Martin,
but this is the real thing.

978
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,336
Violet.

979
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,314
If there's anything we can
do to help Mr. Bottoms,

980
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,132
shouldn't we at least try?

981
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,013
Buckle your seat belt.

982
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,143
Do you think Harrison would
be willing to look at this?

983
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,022
What are we looking at?

984
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,566
This is our home security footage
my dad had on his computer.

985
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,861
It sees over the
fence, into your yard.

986
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,324
They think that's your
dad going into the garage.

987
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,951
That's why they searched there.

988
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,121
It could be.

989
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,998
[Violet] But look.

990
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,801
You can't actually see him go in or
out of the house, from this angle.

991
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,742
[Harrison] Yeah,
but look at this.

992
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,759
What is that?

993
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,261
That looks like it could be
the logo from the museum.

994
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,513
It's on all of our dad's
work shirts and jackets.

995
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,557
But how many does he have?

996
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,309
Jackets?

997
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,103
I don't know. A couple.
He does keep one at work.

998
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,901
What about this?

999
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,628
Whoever took the bells also
took a jacket from the museum

1000
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,196
so they would look
like your dad.

1001
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,948
Then he could have put it
right back when he was done.

1002
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,950
That's a stretch.

1003
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,203
Violet, we can barely see
anything in this video.

1004
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,038
It's too grainy and dark.

1005
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,876
[Violet] But we can see
this. Look at his shoes.

1006
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,920
White sneakers with two stripes.

1007
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,381
[Maddie] Violet, a lot of
people own white sneakers.

1008
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,549
Yeah, but my dad doesn't.

1009
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,264
He hates how white
shoes get dirty so fast.

1010
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,309
But do you know who does own
white sneakers with two stripes,

1011
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,103
just like those?

1012
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,689
Deputy Terry.

1013
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,569
You think Deputy
Terry stole the bells?

1014
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,446
[dramatic music plays]

1015
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,007
[Violet]<i> I think he has an
old grudge with Mr. Bottoms.</i>

1016
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,031
I had to fire him.

1017
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,951
He wasn't too happy about that.

1018
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,830
He went out of his way to stop me
from looking into other suspects.

1019
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,041
<i>Terry knows all the details of
the case and everyone involved.</i>

1020
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,709
<i>He's been to my house,</i>

1021
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,628
<i>he knows about the
security cameras.</i>

1022
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,351
He could have been messing with
Dad's investigation this whole time.

1023
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,508
But why would Terry steal
the bells? For money?

1024
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:13,179
For attention. If Deputy Terry finds
the bells right before Christmas Eve,

1025
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,349
he's going to be the town
hero. That's his motive.

1026
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,768
She's good.

1027
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,019
So do we tell your dad?

1028
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,396
- No.
- No.

1029
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,731
After what happened with
Mr. Martin at the museum,

1030
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,276
we need actual proof.

1031
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,403
Terry's sneakers
isn't enough evidence.

1032
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,697
Although a really
weird coincidence.

1033
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,198
Where can we get more evidence?

1034
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,951
We have to find the bells.
That's the real proof.

1035
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,370
What do you wanna do?

1036
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:38,806
Break into Terry's house?
See if the bells are there?

1037
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,248
No, we can't do that.

1038
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,253
But he does leave a lot
of stuff in his car.

1039
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,674
Hey, you're back.

1040
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,800
Hi, Deputy Terry.

1041
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,302
You forget something?

1042
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,196
Uh, I was just wondering if
I could see my dad again.

1043
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,432
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on, follow me.

1044
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,058
[cell phone ringing]

1045
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:04,147
Hey, I'm pretty busy, Dad. No.

[suspenseful music playing]

1047
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,574
She did it.

1048
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,658
Let's go.

1049
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,453
Oh, come on.

1050
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,288
[suspenseful music continues]

1051
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,693
[Terry] Well, you should have
a little bit more faith in me.

1052
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,890
I don't know. Have you tried
unplugging it and restarting it?

1053
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,516
[tense music continues]

1054
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,825
Hey, Dad, I... I'm
pretty busy right now.

1055
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,035
I gotta go.

1056
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:01,913
Maddie.

1057
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,248
Come on, let's go.

1058
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,419
[gasps]

1059
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,217
Violet.

1060
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,972
You caught me.

1061
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,975
Just take one. Okay?

1062
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,309
Okay.

1063
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,979
No, I'm not having
trouble with Violet, Dad.

1064
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,230
Everything's fine.

1065
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,233
Hey, Violet, um, we need to go.

1066
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,943
[Violet] We just got here.

1067
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,112
I know. I'm sorry,
that's my fault.

1068
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,282
Um, can you grab Kenny?

1069
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,200
Sisters. Am I right?

1070
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,994
Hmm.

1071
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,330
Oh, there you are.
[chuckles] Let's go.

1072
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,634
There were no bells in Terry's
car. Mostly just regular cop stuff.

1073
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,136
Oh, man.

1074
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,596
But I did find something that
was a little weird. A map.

1075
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:03,933
"Department of Public Works?"

1076
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,536
Hey, that's... that's
where Terry worked

1077
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,200
before he started at
the sheriff's office.

1078
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,731
Man, Terry's had a lot of jobs.

1079
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,441
Is this a tunnel map?

1080
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,085
[Harrison] There's something
similar in Portland.

1081
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,320
They're called the
Shanghai tunnels.

1082
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,197
They connect Downtown Portland
to the Willamette River.

1083
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,533
They run all over the city.

1084
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,327
All under the city.

1085
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,121
All under the city, yeah.

1086
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,749
But there's access
points all across town,

1087
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,918
and just like these tunnels right
here in Pleasant Bay. And, look.

1088
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:34,505
There happens to be one right
under the Pleasant Bay museum.

1089
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,466
That's means.

1090
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,444
You don't need a key to the front door
if you're coming through a tunnel.

1091
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,970
We have motive and means
now. This is getting good.

1092
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,555
We have to find

1093
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,742
- that tunnel entrance under the museum.
- [Harrison] Yeah.

1094
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,933
[thumps]

1095
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,980
Hey!

1096
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,374
- What are you guys doin'?
- Nothing.

1097
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,859
We were, uh... we
were just leaving.

1098
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,903
[engine starts]

1099
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,030
[tense music playing]

1100
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,761
It's definitely closed today.

1101
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,096
Now what?

1102
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,972
Well, that's why we
stopped at our house.

1103
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,767
To grab my dad's
backup set of keys.

1104
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,270
That's why they think he
did it, right? His keys.

1105
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,606
Don't you also think he did it?

1106
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,527
No. Not anymore.

1107
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,781
And I wanna find out who did.

1108
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,116
Wait! The alarm!

1109
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,992
I know how we can deactivate it.

1110
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,913
As long as one of those keys also
opens the circuit breaker box.

1111
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,962
[suspenseful music playing]

1112
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:01,134
If there's an access
tunnel in this building...

1113
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,094
it's probably down there.

1114
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,848
You should go and check.

1115
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,726
We're all going down together.

1116
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,937
[suspenseful music continues]

1117
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,450
- [Harrison] Got it?
- [Maddie] Yeah.

1118
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,162
[gasps]

1119
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,249
[sighs in relief]

1120
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,961
[Violet] I guess we're looking
for a door or something.

1121
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,506
Okay. Violet and I
will take this side.

1122
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,966
[Harrison] Come on, Braveheart.

1123
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,759
[Kenny] Who's Braveheart?

1124
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,314
[Harrison] Come on.

1125
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:03,988
Nothing.

1126
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,364
Nothing on our side either.

1127
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,366
Maybe there's another basement.

1128
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,456
We have to check
under these boxes.

1129
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,167
Okay, but how could someone
get out through the ground

1130
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,045
and then also use the
boxes to cover the opening?

1131
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,339
Deputy Terry was down
here the next morning

1132
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,758
<i>while they were investigating.</i>

1133
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:27,428
He could have put boxes over
the opening to cover his tracks.

1134
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,475
[Harrison] All right.

1135
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,519
[Kenny] Remember,
lift with your legs.

1136
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,187
[Harrison] I got it, Kenny.

1137
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,275
[grunts]

1138
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,486
[suspenseful music playing]

1139
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,739
That sure looks like something.

1140
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,329
Whoa!

1141
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,956
[Kenny] Yeah, uh, no.

1142
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,749
[Violet] This has to be it.

1143
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:57,959
Now what?

1144
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,461
We have to find
out where it goes.

1145
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,838
[Kenny] Um, I don't think
that's such a great idea.

1146
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,257
Man up, Kenny.

1147
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,050
That's sexist.

1148
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,260
Give me a hand.

1149
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,142
[Harrison] Looks
like power conduits.

1150
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,396
Gas lines, water pipes maybe.

1151
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,480
What's that?

1152
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,859
Looks like an emergency
power shutoff.

1153
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:27,196
That's how Terry could have
deactivated the security system.

1154
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,906
He could have done
it from down here.

1155
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,865
[loud clanking]

1156
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,742
[Kenny] What was that?

1157
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,786
It's fine. It's just the pipes.

1158
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:35,997
I got this. Stay behind me.

1159
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,873
That's also sexist.

1160
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,459
But I'm also gonna
stay behind you.

1161
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,628
[suspenseful music continues]

1162
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,721
[Maddie] Where are we going?

1163
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,156
[Harrison] Let's just
see where it goes.

1164
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,620
Maybe we'll find
clues along the way.

1165
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,690
[Kenny] Did anyone bring snacks?

1166
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,692
- [clanking]
- [Kenny gasps]

1167
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,235
Pipes, Kenny.

1168
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,362
[music continues]

1169
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,582
[Maddie] What now?

1170
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,667
[clanks]

1171
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,210
This does not feel safe.

1172
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,670
So, should we split up?

1173
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,754
No!

1174
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,841
Let me see the map.

1175
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,055
What are you looking for?

1176
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,765
I'm not sure yet.

1177
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,977
Where would Deputy Terry
come into these tunnels?

1178
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:47,526
There.

1179
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,611
That's it.

1180
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,699
The school? Why there?

1181
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,202
It's surrounded by
London plane trees.

1182
01:05:56,285 --> 01:06:00,081
- So?
- I found a London plane tree leaf in Deputy Terry's car.

1183
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,002
<i>He's been there recently.</i>

1184
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,296
The school was closed
that day for winter break.

1185
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,049
Wait.

1186
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,177
But then how would Deputy Terry
get into the school that night?

1187
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,805
They have a lock box

1188
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,557
for police to use in
case of emergencies.

1189
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,892
The school it is.

1190
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:21,769
[suspenseful music playing]

1191
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,699
[Kenny] What's this?

1192
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,703
Looks like some kind of storage.

1193
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,505
There. That should
be the school.

1194
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:53,175
[Harrison] Yup.
There's a hatch.

1195
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,929
Now we tell your dad?

1196
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,055
No, not yet.

1197
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,766
I'll go up first.

1198
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,270
Breaking into school. Never
thought I'd be doing this.

1199
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,650
Come on.

1200
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,695
So, this is our school?

1201
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,739
Yeah, we're in the boiler room.

1202
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,449
- Look.
- Oh.

1203
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,343
Our dad works here on the
weekends to make extra cash.

1204
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,953
He also used to coach
basketball here, too.

1205
01:07:21,036 --> 01:07:23,664
That's right. A long
time ago, with Terry.

1206
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,625
Deputy Terry?

1207
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,086
Is that just a coincidence or...

1208
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,171
No.

1209
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,343
Terry plans to find
the bells here.

1210
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,053
If Terry finds the bells here,

1211
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,972
that's another thing
connected to your dad.

1212
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:42,391
It'll make him look
even more guilty.

1213
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,478
So, the bells could
actually be here right now?

1214
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,772
No, but our dad already
searched the school,

1215
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,483
and he said the
bells weren't here.

1216
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:54,528
Maybe they were just focused on places
related to Mr. Bottoms' work as a janitor.

1217
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,280
Your dad used to coach here.

1218
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,283
Terry could have planted the
bells somewhere related to that.

1219
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,535
You're right.

1220
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,081
Come on, let's check it out.

1221
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:08,959
[Kenny groans]

1222
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,089
This is so weird.

1223
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,847
Okay, there's the gym, there's the
locker room, there's Coach's office.

1224
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,892
There's so many hiding spots.
The bells could be anywhere.

1225
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,019
[Harrison] Well,
let's start looking.

1226
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,980
Maddie and I will start
with the locker rooms.

1227
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,775
- Okay, I'll start with the bins.
- I'll check the lockers.

1228
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:38,239
[sniffing]

1229
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,450
I have an idea.

1230
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,035
Great. What?

1231
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:44,429
Do that thing where you think
about something for a moment

1232
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,121
and then you have
a brilliant idea.

1233
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,099
Kenny, be serious. The Ringing
of the Bells is tomorrow.

1234
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:50,042
Come on, I'll help
you. [clears throat]

1235
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,127
The bells.

1236
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,797
The bells. The bells.

1237
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,424
Kenny, stop. We have to
just look everywhere.

1238
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,176
Fine.

1239
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,346
[crunching]

1240
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,556
Kenny, don't move.

1241
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,474
- What?
- Let me see under your foot.

1242
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,148
That's from the bell's
display case at the museum.

1243
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,567
How do you know?

1244
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,336
I found a piece just like
it when we were there.

1245
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,612
It had a purple
tint just like it.

1246
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,906
Yeah. Good one, Kenny.

1247
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,410
If this is where Terry took the
bells out of a pocket or a bag,

1248
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,620
some glass could
have fallen out.

1249
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,748
That means he was about to
hide them somewhere close.

1250
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,751
But where?

1251
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,593
[thumps]

1252
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,847
You heard that, too, right?

1253
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:49,435
[thumps]

1254
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,604
[mysterious music playing]

1255
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,148
The trophy case.

1256
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,108
Of course. Guys, come here!

1257
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,405
What?

1258
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:03,991
[thumps]

1259
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,412
My dad's trophy.

1260
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,957
Um... his keys.

1261
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,601
One of them should
open the trophy case.

1262
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,544
[keys jangling]

1263
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,338
Got it!

1264
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,007
Okay.

1265
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,639
Oh, my gosh!

1266
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,974
The bells! We did it!
You did it, Violet!

1267
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,309
You found the bells!

1268
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,062
- Violet, you did it!
- Great job, Violet.

1269
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,772
Now do we call Dad?

1270
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,148
Now we call Dad.

1271
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,691
Okay.

1272
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,735
- But don't mention me using his computer.
- Okay.

1273
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,195
Or searching Terry's car.

1274
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,322
- [Maddie] Okay.
- Or breaking into the museum.

1275
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:46,700
This is going to be
a very short story.

1276
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,577
- [thumping]
- [bells tinkling]

1277
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,828
Someone's here.

1278
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,997
[suspenseful music playing]

1279
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,808
Maybe it was just the wind.

1280
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:12,892
[Terry] That's right.

1281
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,814
I found the bells
at the high school.

1282
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,232
It's Deputy Terry.

1283
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:20,526
He's here to grab the bells.

1284
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,069
Let's get outta here.

1285
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,297
No. Let's punch this guy in
the face. He framed our dad.

1286
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:27,533
No. This is our chance
to get more proof.

1287
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,994
[Terry] I'm giving you
guys the exclusive on this.

1288
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,832
You're gonna wanna get a news
crew over here right away.

1289
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,792
I have an idea.

1290
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,049
[Terry] Sam.

1291
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,551
[Sam on radio]<i> Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1292
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,720
I found them. I
found the bells.

1293
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,389
You remember how George used to
be a coach at the high school?

1294
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,057
They're right here
in the trophy case.

1295
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,910
We gotta get a forensic
kit over here right away.

1296
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,519
[Sam on radio]
<i>That's great, Terry.</i>

1297
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,062
<i>Sheriff Pierce isn't too far.</i>

1298
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,148
<i>I'll radio for him
to head your way.</i>

1299
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,274
Copy that.

1300
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,118
No, no. No, no, no.

1301
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,876
Something wrong?

1302
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,546
Violet?

1303
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:25,966
What are you doin' here?

1304
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,135
I was just looking
for the bells.

1305
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,678
What are you doing here?

1306
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,223
Same thing.

1307
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,685
I remembered that George, he...
he used to be a coach here.

1308
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,813
Yeah.

1309
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,190
He fired you, didn't he?

1310
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,987
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

1311
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,448
He didn't respect
my opinions. It...

1312
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,784
it wasn't a good fit.

1313
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,411
That must have been really
disappointing for your dad.

1314
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,954
Losing a job like that.

1315
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,541
Yeah.

1316
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,461
Well, he's gonna see
how capable I am...

1317
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,630
when I'm the one
who finds the bells.

1318
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,633
Right. You'll be the
hero when you find them.

1319
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,802
Your dad's finally going
to be proud of you.

1320
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,096
He might even make
you the new sheriff.

1321
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,974
Just doing my job.

1322
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,602
Is it your job to
frame an innocent man?

1323
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,983
George Bottoms isn't innocent.

1324
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,735
He's an ex-con.

1325
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,489
People don't change, Violet. Once
a criminal, always a criminal.

1326
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,533
That's a funny thing
for a criminal to say.

1327
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,660
Me?

1328
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,955
I'm just investigating.

1329
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:41,333
And your investigation somehow took you to
the exact hiding spot the bells were in?

1330
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,420
You were so sure, you even told
Deputy Sam you already had them.

1331
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,547
No, no, I didn't...

1332
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,092
I... I told her that I thought
I was about to find them.

1333
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,094
That's not what I heard.

1334
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,973
Should I replay the video I have of
you going straight to the hiding spot?

1335
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,766
<i>They're right here
in the trophy case.</i>

1336
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,727
<i>We gotta get a forensic
kit over here right away.</i>

1337
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,729
Let me have the phone, Violet.

1338
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:06,191
I really shouldn't. I think this
video, the tunnel map in your car,

1339
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,777
and the two-striped sneakers
on the security camera footage

1340
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:13,157
are going to be all the proof my dad needs
to put you in jail instead of Mr. Bottoms.

1341
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,325
[ominous music playing]

1342
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,369
Give me the phone.

1343
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:33,926
Okay.

1344
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,720
That's enough.

1345
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,306
[Violet] Whoops!

1346
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,475
[sighs wearily]

1347
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,770
Don't worry.

1348
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:44,855
I caught it.

1349
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,483
[sighs wearily]

1350
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,902
You're making a big mistake.

1351
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,570
You're not acting like I am.

1352
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:00,954
The phone.

1353
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,039
Please.

1354
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:03,415
I don't have it.

1355
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,211
I'm done playing
games with you guys.

1356
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,414
[Harrison] Looking for this?

1357
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,090
[dramatic music playing]

1358
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,229
[Terry] Harrison, stop!

1359
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,710
[chuckles] Looks like
you dropped something.

1360
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,547
- [Harrison] Kenny, now!
- [Kenny] Got it!

1361
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,637
Let me out!

1362
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,114
We heard Sheriff
Pierce is on his way.

1363
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:02,599
We can let you out then.

1364
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,017
I'm just gonna
destroy this phone.

1365
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,103
- And the video that's on it.
- Go ahead.

1366
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,705
We already have the video of you going
straight to the bells' hiding spot

1367
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,314
on the phone my brother has.

1368
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,316
[panting]

1369
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,111
Hey! Let me out!

01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,117
[curious instrumental
music playing]

1371
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,457
[reporter 1] Does this have anything
to do with the missing jingle bells?

1372
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,191
[reporter 2] Deputy Donovan...

1373
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,752
- Come on, guys, back off.
- -Deputy, do you have anything to say?

1374
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:55,920
I'll have a statement
for you tomorrow.

1375
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:56,963
[reporter 2] ...George Bottoms?

1376
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,447
[reporter 1] Okay.

1377
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,206
I thought I told
you to stand down.

1378
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,293
I know, Dad, but he was messing
with your investigation,

1379
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,211
and he was your deputy.

1380
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,421
How could you have known?

1381
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,506
I couldn't let him do that.

1382
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,844
I'm not sure how
you guys did this.

1383
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,014
I'm not sure you want to know.

1384
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,353
I had a lot of help.

1385
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,605
I stepped on the glass.

1386
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,357
Is that right?

1387
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,068
I broke into the museum.

1388
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,529
I was the getaway driver.

1389
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,114
Yeah.

1390
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,116
Everyone pitched in, Dad.

1391
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,706
I'd better take those. [sighs]

1392
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,837
And we will talk about
this when we get home.

1393
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,298
But...

1394
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,843
you guys did good.

1395
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,596
[Fiona]<i> Let me tell you
the tale of Violet Pierce</i>

1396
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,182

1397
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:11,770
<i>The magic of the bells went
beyond just a wish that year.</i>

1398
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,146
[Pierce sighs]

1399
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,690
I'm sorry you had to go
through this, George.

1400
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:16,900
It's okay, Grant.

1401
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,610
- You're just doing your job.
- Yeah.

1402
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,739
[laughs]

1403
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,624
[Fiona]<i> They gave a
chance at reconciliation.</i>

1404
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,418
[George grunts]

1405
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,102
[Harrison] I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

1406
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,508
It's okay.

1407
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,803
I love you, son.

1408
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,972
I love you too, Dad.

1409
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,224
Come on. Come here. Come here.

1410
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,643
[George sobs]

1411
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:57,691
[Fiona]<i> They offered an
important wake up call.</i>

1412
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,403
You, um...

1413
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:05,323
you did all of this because George
Bottoms fired you 18 years ago?

1414
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,577
I wanted to do
something... something big.

1415
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,495
- Something... something...
- Something big?

1416
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,123
Something to make you
finally notice me.

1417
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,250
I'm sorry, Dad.

1418
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:20,172
No, no. I'm sorry, son, if I made you
feel you needed to do something like this.

1419
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,885
I just want you
to be proud of me.

1420
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,971
Oh, son.

1421
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,600
You're gonna get
through this, okay?

1422
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,353
I'm here with you.

1423
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:38,690
Okay.

1424
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:42,068
[Fiona]<i> They allowed a chance to
move through a difficult memory.</i>

1425
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,321
Oh, boy.

1426
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:45,655
Look at you.

1427
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,201
It's one of Maddie's
old dresses.

1428
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:53,288
Hmm. Well, that is...
that is lovely on you.

1429
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,624
Maddie said I remind her of Mom.

1430
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,504
Oh, yeah. Wow.

1431
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,049
You sure do.

1432
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:08,011
Uh, you are, um... [chuckles]

1433
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:12,474
You are funny, and you
are kind, and so smart.

1434
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,309
- [chuckles] Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1435
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:18,188
You know who else
you remind me of?

1436
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,272
Who?

1437
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,441
Me.

1438
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,985
You won't let anyone tell you
what to do or how to behave,

1439
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,696
or when to take
"no" for an answer.

1440
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,992
You got a little
bit of both of us...

1441
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,329
and it's perfect.

1442
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,250
I love you, honey.

1443
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,459
I love you too, Dad.

1444
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,422
[sighs softly]

1445
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,801
[Harrison] Hey, Maddie.

1446
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,469
- [Fiona]<i> Even planting seeds...</i>
- Hey.

1447
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:52,013
<i>Of love for new
relationships to blossom.</i>

1448
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:56,309
Thank you for everything.

1449
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,686
Me? [chuckles]

1450
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,814
I mean, you're the one
who found the tunnel map.

1451
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:02,691
You gave me a reason to believe.

1452
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:06,319
This is for you.

1453
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,572
To say thanks.

1454
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,075
- For me?
- Yeah.

1455
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,163
I mean, you don't have
to put coffee in it

1456
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,040
if you don't want, but...

1457
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,721
[chuckles]

1458
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,265
[chuckles]

1459
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,517
[Fiona]<i> Young or
old, believer or not,</i>

1460
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,769
<i>no matter who you
were that year,</i>

1461
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:45,900
<i>you were forever changed by the
magic of Santa's golden jingle bells.</i>

1462
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,281
Just in case.

1463
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:53,491
[Fiona]<i> And the
town of Pleasant Bay</i>

1464
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:58,121
still celebrates the Ringing of the Bells
ceremony every year on Christmas Eve.

1465
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,123
Fiona! It's time.

1466
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:01,708
Sorry.

1467
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,835
I just love telling
the story of the bells.

1468
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:05,754
[chuckles] I gotta go.

1469
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:09,382
Welcome, everyone, to
the 100th anniversary

1470
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,343
of the Ringing of the Bells!

1471
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,553
[crowd clapping, cheering]

1472
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:22,312
Tonight, the honors
go to a young lady

1473
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,397
without whom, ladies
and gentlemen,

1474
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,650
frankly, we would not be here.

1475
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:27,984
Violet Pierce.

1476
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,195
[crowd clapping, cheering]

1477
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,201
And now...

1478
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,621
The Ringing of the Bells!

1479
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:41,790
[crowd clapping, cheering]

1480
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,756
You made this happen.

1481
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,677
[bells jingling]

1482
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,430
Deputy Violet...

1483
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,723
do your duty.

1484
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,684
With honor, Sheriff Pierce.

1485
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,102
[George] Attagirl, Violet!

1486
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,312
[boy] Yo, get ready.

1487
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,361
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- [bells chiming]

1488
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,530
[crowd clapping, cheering]
