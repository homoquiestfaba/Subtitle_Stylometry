1
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,599
Ow.

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,306
Are you OK?

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,839
Here, hold this.

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,159
Honey, I'm, I'm driving.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,344
Just hold it.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,359
Hey, that's my jam.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,319
All right.

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,151
Say something.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,239
This is not safe.

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,424
That's good. Keep talking.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,199
I'm not... what do
you want me to say?

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,519
Just keep talking.
I got to adjust these levels.

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,319
One, check one.

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,079
Ah, brr...

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,759
Ma made me mash my M & M's.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,183
That's good. Keep going.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,079
Uh, this is... check one.

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,439
My boyfriend is a big idiot.
Check one.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah. More.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,599
And, here we go again.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,159
That's it.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,639
And, I don't feel safe driving around
this mountain like this, babe.

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,719
No, that's great. Keep going.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,679
Uh, it's the cradle of life,
the center of civilization.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,479
Men have fought for
it, even died for it.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,159
What is that?

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,559
One might say it's the most
powerful thing on earth,

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,479
so come on, ladies,
show it a little love.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,199
Cleansing Washing Cloths
from Summer's Eve.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,399
Hail to the V.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,159
That's great.
What, what is that from?

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,839
It's a douche commercial
I didn't get.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,759
You didn't get that?

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,679
Yup.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,999
Oh, man.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,879
I'm surprised. That was really good.

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,719
Thanks, babe.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,519
You would, you could have
been the next douchiest

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,319
spokesperson in the world.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,359
- You're really funny, you know that?
- Thank you.

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,359
You think my vagina is dirty?
Is that what you're saying?

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,439
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's a dirty V.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,199
- Really?
- You have a dirty V.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,779
Have I ever told you how dirty
your penis is, your cock?

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,439
Uh, thank you. No, baby,
you have a porcelain V.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,959
Your V is spotless.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,919
That's more like it.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,070
Yup, you're welcome.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,471
Action.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,279
Are you going to,
are you going to say, "Action"?

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,799
Don't do, don't do that.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,479
That's going to mess me up.

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,559
OK.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,869
It doesn't make any
sense at all, but...

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,639
Hi. I'm Jim Kessel.

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,199
I'm here at the Trinity
National Forest along Route 96,

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,599
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,999
I'm here with my girlfriend,
Kelly Monteleone,

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,199
where we plan on
re-tracing the famed

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,382
1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in our search for Bigfoot.

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,159
What's that face?

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,999
Just, it's your thing.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,719
Just make it about you, you know,

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,119
no girlfriend, my name, all that.

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,319
You don't want to be in
the movie and now you're,

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,079
you're Stanley fucking Kubrick.
That's good.

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,264
Oh. Oh, OK.

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,679
Hi. I'm Jim Kessel.

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,359
I'm here at Trinity National
Forest, along Route 96,

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,999
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,919
I'm here at Bluff Creek,

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,759
where I plan on re-tracing the famed

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,702
1996 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in my search for Bigfoot.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,199
OK.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,599
- Are you a little nervous?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,839
I can see it. I can see it.
You know what?

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,319
I just want you to take these off.

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,839
OK.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,319
- I want you to loosen up.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,919
- And, just be yourself.
- All right.

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,999
You know. It's like, "Hey,
lets..." Just talk and...

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,559
We're here in this
beautiful place. Use it.

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,300
OK.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,105
OK.

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,199
Hey, what's up? I'm Jim Kessel.

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,119
I'm here at the Trinity National
Forest, along Route 96,

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,559
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,159
I'm here at Bluff Creek,

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,799
where I plan on re-tracing the famed

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,269
1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in my search for Bigfoot.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,229
Won't you join me?

93
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,639
- Boom.
- Oh, nice.

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,599
- Yeah?
- That was good.

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,559
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,999
- I'll buy that.
- It was good.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,559
- Nice.
- Good, babe.

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,159
- Thank you, babe.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,719
Did you see the
buckshot on this sign?

100
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,359
What's that?

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,599
Right here.

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,399
And a bullet hole.

103
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,948
Great. That makes me feel good.

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,987
You'll be fine.

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,199
You don't want to look stupid.

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,559
Honey, I'm afraid
of a lot of things,

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,999
but I'm not afraid to admit that
I don't believe in Bigfoot.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,199
I know, but just...

109
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,271
How can you, how can you
prove there isn't one?

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,719
Babe, I, I said that I,
I will come on this trip to,

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,639
to help you with your film
and it's your birthday

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,879
and we're going to
have a great time,

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
but I'm not about to say
that I believe in Bigfoot.

114
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,519
You don't have to say
you believe in Bigfoot.

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,199
I'm just looking for, I don't know,

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,479
"Maybe there is one, Jim.

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,599
I'm not really sure,
but maybe you're right,

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,559
maybe there is something out there."

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,639
OK. You want to know why I, I,
I firmly believe there isn't?

120
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,639
Why is there, has there never been

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,439
a Bigfoot body that's
been discovered?

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,079
All this time and no one
has ever found one?

123
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,719
That's a little odd to me.

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,039
Who knows?

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,159
When's the last time you found
anything dead in the forest?

126
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,039
Do you know how many millions
of acres there are of...

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,279
Plenty of times.

128
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,839
...unexplored forest out...
plenty of times. OK.

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,039
You're seeing bones in the forest?

130
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,919
Yes.

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,879
Listen, who knows?
Maybe they bury their bodies.

132
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,599
I don't know.

133
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,079
There's forest is so
thick out here, babe.

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,079
You can't see three
feet in front of you.

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,039
I mean, there could be a
hundred Bigfoot corpses

136
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,439
- within half a mile in here.
- Yeah.

137
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,399
Nobody would ever even know it.

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,279
There could be a hundred dead
leprechauns out there, too.

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,279
Ha, ha, yeah.

140
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,919
But no one, no one has
found those either.

141
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,319
- Yeah, OK.
- Uh-huh.

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,199
Uh, we're talking two
different things here.

143
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,479
Aren't you curious to know
why for thousands of years,

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,599
all right,

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,639
people all over the world
have reported seeing

146
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,826
an ape-like creature
walking through the woods?

147
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,119
Not really.

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,719
Well, then, why are you here?

149
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,111
Because I like being with you.

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,110
What?

151
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,519
Oh, boy. Now, you're mad.

152
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,261
No, I'm not mad.

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,399
Honey, we can believe different
things and still be a couple.

154
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,439
It's OK.

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,959
I just don't want you
to think I'm crazy.

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,559
Oh, I know you're crazy.

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,639
I wouldn't be with you
if I didn't know that.

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,108
I just don't believe in Bigfoot.

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,439
- Hi.
- Action.

160
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,519
Babe?

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,919
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,627
I'm so used to saying it. OK.

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,639
Hi. I'm in Willow Creek,

164
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,711
Mecca to the Bigfoot Community.

165
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,711
Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,439
That's it?

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,519
Yeah, that's it.

168
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,464
All right.

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,279
Oh, check it out.

170
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,519
Home of the Bigfoot Burger.

171
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,439
And ammunition.

172
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,439
Can't say I've ever dined
in a place with both.

173
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,799
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,199
Well, you know, they
hold a gun to your face

175
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,879
if you don't order
the Bigfoot Burger.

176
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,620
Oh, God.

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,759
I love the, uh, the,
uh, artwork here.

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,679
- It looks like Bigfoot...
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,679
...he really likes his
doughnuts and coffee.

180
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,359
Is he toasting doughnuts?

181
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,199
Could be bagels.

182
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,399
Oh, and there's the other one.

183
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,879
- Look, it's like us.
- Yeah.

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,839
There I am bringing you flowers

185
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,559
and there you are making
doughnuts and coffee.

186
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,439
Making breakfast and there
you are prancing over,

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,399
giving me my flowers for the day.

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,390
That's awesome.

189
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,279
That girl seems pretty
happy to be missing.

190
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,145
Who is that?

191
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,239
I should take a picture of you,

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,879
of what you would look
like if you went missing.

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,359
So that if you ever
go missing, I can...

194
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,519
I can show what you would
actually look like.

195
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,199
OK.

196
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,719
We'll dirty you up.

197
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,269
Give me your missing, give
me your missing photo face.

198
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,639
- No, I don't think that's your...
- No?

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,599
No.

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,943
How about this? Um...

201
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,239
That's pretty good.

202
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,599
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,599
But I do feel like they all smile.

204
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,799
Yeah.

205
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,559
Maybe you would be happy if missing.

206
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,279
Why would you be happy
to be missing, babe?

207
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,464
I don't know.

208
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,705
See that?

209
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,159
So, lets see the Bigfoot Burger.

210
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,959
Oh, check it out.

211
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,919
Oh my God.

212
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,919
Whoa. Yeah.
It even has the toe marks.

213
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,919
Look at that.

214
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,399
Do you think this is,
um, real Bigfoot meat?

215
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,599
- No, honey.
- No?

216
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,919
- This is just a Bigfoot Burger.
- Oh.

217
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,479
It could be real Bigfoot meat.

218
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,919
You know what would be really funny?

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,503
- Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm.
- Is if, um, his...

220
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,759
Yeah? Please, finish your thought.

221
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,039
I was going to say that
it's a good thing,

222
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,599
um, his feet are his most
prominent attribute.

223
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,599
Or else, we could be eating
really big weeners right now.

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,959
- That's a whole other restaurant, honey.
- Hmm-hmm.

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,959
- I'll take you there...
- Mmm.

226
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,119
...some other time.

227
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,119
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

228
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,999
Mmm.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,439
- How is it?
- Wow, this...

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,199
It's actually really good.

231
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,509
- It's pretty sweet.
- Hmm-hmm.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,359
Mmm.

233
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,959
Mmm.

234
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,719
- Well, look at this, babe.
- Oh, yeah.

235
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,719
What is that?

236
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,119
What?

237
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,639
Wow.

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,879
It's a Bigfoot mural.

239
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,999
Is that a van Gogh or
what do you think it is?

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,119
Yeah.

241
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,639
He's pushing a wheelbarrow
and hoeing a garden.

242
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,137
And, very, he seems clinically..

243
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,399
- depressed actually.
- Yeah.

244
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,359
"Bigfoot sad.

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,639
Bigfoot no want to work in garden."

246
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,839
Why are they forcing him
to do all this work?

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,199
I don't know. What the fuck is this?

248
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,479
Like, they got him as a
day laborer or something.

249
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,359
"Bigfoot help you put
up house for berries."

250
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,999
I would avoid man, too,
if I had to do all of this shit.

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,679
Yeah, no shit.

252
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,879
Maybe he just doesn't want to work,

253
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,759
- that's why they can't find him.
- Yeah.

254
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,359
"Bigfoot tired of working."

255
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,039
All right. Let's get out of here.

256
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,519
This is so great.

257
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,999
Is this... so, this is the town?

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,999
This is it.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,279
- Oh, there. Bigfoot.
- Yeah.

260
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,359
He's all over the place.

261
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,239
Oh, there he is.

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,469
- Hey, buddy.
- Chubby guy.

263
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,199
Oh, I got to get this.
Bigfoot Avenue.

264
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,519
This must be where he lives.

265
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,226
Yeah.

266
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,039
Is that where we're staying?

267
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,359
Oh, yeah. Bigfoot Motel.

268
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,279
Oh, great.

269
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,599
Yeah.

270
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,039
This place is heaven, babe.

271
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,559
This is the great O'Mah
statue carved by Jim McClarin

272
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,319
out of one giant piece of redwood
right around the same time

273
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,107
Patterson shot his famed footage.

274
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,639
I like his bangs.

275
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,879
- You do?
- Hmm-hmm.

276
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,439
They have the whole
flippy thing going on?

277
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,239
Well, he didn't.

278
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,261
He wished he could have re-carved him
after he heard Albert Ostman's account.

279
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,119
You're really making me horny.

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,039
Go up there and stand next to it.

281
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,959
Why?

282
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,439
For a scale. Go on.

283
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,359
How come people don't know
how big I am? I could be huge.

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,305
Check that out.

285
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,110
Get closer.

286
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,624
He's a nice-looking guy,

287
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,667
kind of cute.

288
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,559
Don't do that, baby.

289
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,199
Baby, just don't do that. Seriously.

290
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,039
May I help you?

291
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,269
- He's lonely.
- May I help you?

292
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,439
Yeah. Do you mind
if we interview you?

293
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,639
I told you I was new at this.

294
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,426
OK. Here we go.

295
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,268
Hi. Are we going?

296
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,319
Hi, I'm here with Nita Rowley,

297
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,239
who's worked at the Willow
Creek Visitor Center

298
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,439
for the last 20 years.

299
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,239
How are you, Nita?

300
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,799
I'm doing well. Thank you.

301
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,799
Well, good.
I have a question for you.

302
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,759
Do you know of anyone or
do you know personally

303
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,399
the exact site of the
Patterson-Gimlin?

304
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,959
Uh, no, I do not.

305
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,799
And, um, has there been any
recent sightings of Bigfoot

306
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,759
or Sasquatch in the area?

307
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,919
No, not to my knowledge.

308
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,599
Are you a believer?

309
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,319
Not at all.

310
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,439
No, huh?

311
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,199
OK.

312
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,599
Is it safe to camp here?

313
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,039
Uh, you have to be on the lookout,

314
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,759
uh, for bear, mountain
lions, rattle snakes,

315
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,639
um, but it's, it's safe,
I mean, you take your chances.

316
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,439
Have you ever heard of
anyone being attacked

317
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
by a mountain lion
or a bear out here?

318
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,879
Uh, yes.

319
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,039
I haven't heard the,
uh, bear attacks.

320
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,799
Uh, basically, they
get into the garbage,

321
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,039
uh, and come in to steal your food.

322
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,350
The mountain lions, uh, will attack.

323
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,747
What would you do if you
saw Big Foot, Nita?

324
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,799
I don't expect to see one.

325
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,399
Um, I, I really wouldn't
be surprised, um,

326
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,719
because I just don't believe in it.

327
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,631
We're rolling.

328
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
I got really lucky.

329
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,239
Um, we're here at Bigfoot
Books with the owner,

330
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
Steve Streufert.

331
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,719
What's up, Steve?

332
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,719
The usual thing,

333
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,039
Bigfoot every day out
here in Willow Creek.

334
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,719
Yeah, nice.

335
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,319
I heard you had a little, uh,
you were just out there.

336
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
Yeah, we were out of Bluff Creek.

337
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,039
Yeah, Bluff Creek.

338
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,159
Uh, it is about 29
miles north of here,

339
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,079
you come to the bottom
of Bluff Creek there.

340
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,079
Hmm-hmm.

341
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,559
And that was where the
Patterson film was shot.

342
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,439
Yes, of course.

343
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,359
Also, these, uh,
footprints that you,

344
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,999
uh, may have seen before...

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,359
Yeah.

346
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,039
These were cast out in
Bluff Creek in 1958.

347
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,919
Sure.

348
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,839
Wow. So, these are
the Jerry Crew cast?

349
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,359
That is from the
same track way of...

350
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,119
Yeah.

351
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,439
...the famous Jerry Crew
track was taken from.

352
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,279
That's incredible.

353
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,359
And that's where,
obviously, you know,

354
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,399
they coined the name Bigfoot...

355
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,239
Yeah.

356
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,399
The contractors on the road
building project out there

357
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,879
and the loggers, um,

358
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,599
had very strange activity
going on out there.

359
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,399
Yeah.

360
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,799
They were cutting a new
road into this virgin timber,

361
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,879
so, um, they started
finding these footprints

362
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,559
out on the dusty plowed road
and they called it, "Bigfoot."

363
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,599
Apparently, there were
some that saw it out there,

364
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,599
so, uh, you know,
the big feet were connected

365
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,719
- with a creature that was...
- I didn't realize that.

366
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,079
...that was also throwing a
big 55 gallon fuel drums and,

367
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,439
uh, spools of metal logging
wire down into the creek,

368
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,959
uh, vandalizing their
camp, in general.

369
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,959
So, that's where that
name came from in 1958.

370
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,399
Right.

371
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,839
This is the model that was
used by Roger Patterson.

372
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,599
He rented this and
came out here and,

373
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,999
- you know, it's very heavy.
- Yeah.

374
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,999
He, he, this is what he used
to film while running across a,

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,559
- a regular gravel bar and rocks in the...
- Yeah.

376
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,039
...in the creek.

377
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,239
They were also used for, uh,
making home movies and,

378
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,239
uh, amateur films like pornos.

379
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,039
Oh, that's awesome.

380
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,239
Wow, that's so heavy.

381
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,759
Tell me a little bit about, um,
the Patterson-Gimlin site

382
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,919
and just how to get there, man.

383
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,599
Oh, well, um, you
can take this road,

384
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,079
I can show on the map,
and you go down that road.

385
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,279
- It's probably easier that way.
- That would be great.

386
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,439
You come down to the bottom and
there's an old camp site there,

387
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,439
you know, and, uh, when
you're at that camp site,

388
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,159
you basically just take a right.

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,119
You have to bushwhack and
go through the forest.

390
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,599
- My girlfriend is OK with that.
- But it's not... you won't get lost.

391
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,639
Just follow the sound of
the creek on your left

392
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,479
and look at the hill on your right.

393
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,119
You just keep going straight between
those until you come to a big gulch

394
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,359
and you'll see it all
blasted out with rocks

395
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,479
and log debris and, uh,

396
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,919
- that's the bottom of the film site area.
- Wow.

397
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,479
So, you go, you're going to
have to go down in the creek.

398
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,519
Be careful not to twist
your ankle, you know.

399
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,279
Just getting to the site,

400
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,799
is it kind of dangerous
or would you...?

401
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,479
Uh, well, there is
the thing we called,

402
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,159
"The Curse of Bluff Creek."

403
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,999
What's that?

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,839
Uh, wait, that's sort of related
to The Curse of Bigfoot, but...

405
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,799
The Curse of Bigfoot
usually means that,

406
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,799
you know, like you're
going to get divorced,

407
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,319
your friends will all
think you're crazy,

408
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,999
uh, you'll be, uh, impecunious

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,639
and you'll spend all of your days

410
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,559
searching for something
that you never find.

411
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,479
Um, that's kind of a classic thing

412
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,839
with the old researchers, you know.

413
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,959
Hmm-hmm.

414
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,359
But, um, that's sort of a joke.

415
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,399
The, the, um, the real truth
of it is that you're out

416
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,999
in the middle of nowhere, you know,

417
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,039
so you, you don't
really want to, uh,

418
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,319
just go out there
unprepared, you know.

419
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,999
Right.

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,039
There's no food and there's no water

421
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,679
unless you want to drink the wild water
and hunt the wild animals, you know.

422
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,239
There are some berries and things,

423
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,879
which you have to
know the wild plants,

424
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,039
so I'd say, you know, go prepared

425
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,719
and have the tools you
need to survive, right?

426
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,559
- Yeah.
- A lot of people aren't ready for that.

427
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,599
They think there should
be a, a campground there

428
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,719
with a like porter
potty or something.

429
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,199
You know, you're not in the...

430
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,519
It's still the wilderness.
I mean, it's...

431
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,399
Yeah. It's not technically
a wilderness,

432
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,399
but it's still pretty
wild, you know,

433
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,279
and we've seen many, many
bears, uh, out there,

434
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,039
um, so, watch out for that.

435
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,399
We are going to go see Tom Yamarone.

436
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,679
He's the Bob Dylan of
the Bigfoot Community.

437
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,839
Where does he live, Mordor?

438
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,464
- No jokes around him, all right?
- So, can I look him in the eye?

439
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,824
OK. No jokes.

440
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,359
- All right, great.
- We're rolling.

441
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,239
This is like Christmas in July,

442
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,759
uh, because I'm here
with Tom Yamarone and,

443
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,719
uh, Tom, I know you know Bob Gimlin.

444
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,439
I do.

445
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,199
So, uh, why don't you tell
us a little bit about, um,

446
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
the Patterson-Gimlin site?

447
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,799
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
it's a site that's so remote

448
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,759
and what you're going
to love about it

449
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,199
is, when you get in there,
it's a steep canyon,

450
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
there's a running creek,
there's forest that's thick

451
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,719
and you're going to feel
how isolated they were.

452
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,919
They were really truly
in the wilderness.

453
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,399
How do you think those guys
were feeling that day when...

454
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,759
I mean, they've been,
they've been searching

455
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,879
for a little while and to finally,

456
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,879
to finally come across what was,

457
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,599
you know, there by the riverbed...?

458
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,919
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'll tell you, they were bored,

459
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,799
not bored, but they had, they
had no success up to that point

460
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,959
and, boom, they come
around that log jam

461
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,319
and there's this big hair-covered
creature standing there,

462
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,639
starts walking away from them

463
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,919
and they knew right then they
had won the prize, you know,

464
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,279
if they could get it on film

465
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,479
and so, Patterson scrambles,
Gimlin watches him,

466
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,919
and they, they think they got it.

467
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,639
So, they were, couldn't
have been more excited.

468
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,959
You know, the only thing that would be
better, if there was a song about it.

469
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,439
I just so happened
to have written one.

470
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,799
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Yamarone with,

471

OK.

497
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,719
Hi, I'm here with, uh,
Shaun White Guy Sr.

498
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,039
She's, uh, a resident of
the Hopa reservation.

499
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,559
And, Shaun, I understand
you have a Sasquatch story

500
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,079
that you'd be willing
to share with us?

501
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,559
Um, yeah, I just have a small story.

502
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,559
It's, uh, me and my dad,
uh, went on a camping or,

503
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,239
you know, a, a Christian... cut.

504
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,359
- It's Hoopa.
- Hoopa?

505
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,239
Yes, Hoopa.

506
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,599
Okay, good. Thank you.

507
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,959
Hi. I'm here with
Shaun White Guy Sr.,

508
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,039
and, uh, she is a resident of
the, uh, Hoopa Reservation,

509
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,279
and I understand you'd be willing
to share a Sasquatch story with us?

510
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,399
Um, yeah.

511
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,039
Um, when I was little,
about eight years old,

512
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,599
I, uh, wanted to go on a camping,

513
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,599
a Christian like, camping
trip with my dad...

514
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,119
Hmm-hmm.

515
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,119
And so, I asked to go and
he said I could go and, um,

516
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,599
we were heading towards like,
Ferndale, Garberville area.

517
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,759
I wasn't too sure,
but I know I was going.

518
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,559
And so, um, we're
following my Uncle Tiny,

519
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,439
and then, all of a sudden, um,

520
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,079
a big black image came
in-between the cars

521
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,959
and my dad turned the steering wheel

522
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,799
and we flipped into the like,
the gutter, and we looked up

523
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,679
and there was Sasquatch
walking in front of us,

524
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,319
up towards the, the like, field,

525
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,319
a big huge, it was a
big square open field

526
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,839
and there was the tree range

527
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,799
and we actually got to watch
him, uh, walk in front of us

528
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,959
and he was tall and he
was like, long-haired...

529
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,519
- Were you scared?
- Uh, yeah, I was, I was scared.

530
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,199
I couldn't believe
that it, you know,

531
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,359
I always heard rumors and
everybody's talking about,

532
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,639
that they've seen it, you know, and,

533
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
and when I actually
looked up and saw him,

534
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,639
he was just big and he was hairy

535
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,679
and he made like this weird,
like snorkeling kind of sound.

536
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,639
I, I, I'd never heard it before.

537
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,439
And then, when he turned
around and looked,

538
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,439
all I could see is his little
brown eyes with like,

539
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,239
right here is like,
skin around his eyes.

540
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,159
There was no hair right
there, just skin,

541
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,559
and he just looked back
and made this little noise

542
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,279
and then, I just looked away

543
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,319
and I just closed my
eyes and I was like,

544
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,221
"Oh, don't come back, don't."

545
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,159
I just don't believe in Bigfoot.

546
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,599
Do you know how many new species
are discovered every single year?

547
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,919
Twenty thousand species
every single year.

548
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,159
Right.

549
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,279
OK.

550
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,519
And, what do you
think that's including?

551
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,039
Do you think that's including
animals and creatures?

552
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,879
That's plants, plankton,
uh, microscopic organisms.

553
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,639
- Oh, yeah.
- Not what we're talking about.

554
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,359
And, and I'm talking
about mammals, too.

555
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,599
Monkeys. All right?

556
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,479
Do you know last year, they
discovered a snub-nosed monkey?

557
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,839
That's a brand new species
they never even knew existed,

558
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,639
- but they found it.
- Yeah, but...

559
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,719
And they never even found
a body, dead or alive,

560
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,319
but they found it.

561
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
Not finding a tiny monkey
in a giant rainforest

562
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,159
the size of a continent

563
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,559
is not the same as not finding
a 900-pound hairy biped

564
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,559
roaming around a very
highly populated

565
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,959
Pacific Northwest area.

566
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,269
That's not the same, babe.

567
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,559
So, you're a ranger?

568
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,559
Seventeen years.

569
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,839
Is that cool if we, if
we mentioned that or...?

570
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,479
Oh, I don't think it's important.

571
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,479
- I, I wouldn't.
- That's cool.

572
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,639
Uh, so, um, I'm here
with Troy Andrews and,

573
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,759
uh, you know, he's
willing to share with us,

574
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,199
uh, uh, an incredible,
uh, encounter.

575
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,319
When did this happen?

576
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,679
Oh, a couple of years ago.

577
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,359
I was hunting in New Orleans.

578
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,759
That's, uh, where Bluff Creek is?

579
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,439
Yeah. Well, near there.

580
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
Sorry. Just go on. Yeah.

581
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,839
Yeah. So, I was out in,
out in the woods with my,

582
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,759
my dog, Bella, a beautiful girl.

583
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,759
She was a golden retriever,

584
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,119
and, uh, well, she, she
took off in the woods and,

585
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,519
uh, and I called, called
for her to stop and,

586
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,839
uh, she didn't, you know.

587
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,959
She just kept going and,
uh, which is weird,

588
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,359
because usually,
she's very obedient.

589
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,119
And, uh, so I went in
the woods after her.

590
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,799
I was, I was calling
and calling and, uh,

591
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,959
nothing, you know.

592
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,239
She, uh, I kept calling and, and,

593
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,799
and then, I started to get
a little nervous because

594
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,639
the sun was going down,
it was starting to get dark,

595
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,319
and, uh, I kept calling and
all of a sudden, I heard this,

596
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,079
this, this, this, she was
growling and whimpering

597
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,479
and, uh, and then,
she cut loose with this,

598
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,799
with this horrible
growl, wail kind of.

599
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,268
It was, it was like a scream.

600
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,999
When I got there, it was too late.

601
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,628
She was dead.

602
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,948
I loved that dog.

603
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,186
You know, it hurt bad.

604
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,759
Uh, someone or,
or something had, uh,

605
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,279
just ripped poor Bella in half,

606
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,305
apart.

607
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,199
Bigfoot?

608
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,519
Well, I don't...
I wouldn't say that.

609
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,359
I mean, there's...

610
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,119
There's a lot of people
who live back in the,

611
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,999
in these woods and, uh,

612
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,199
they just don't like other
people into their business here.

613
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,199
Like who?

614
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,279
Oh, like, uh, uh, pot farmers and,

615
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,159
river people, locals, uh,

616
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,359
I don't know, uh, pets and people

617
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,359
go missing all the time here.

618
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,119
Right. But you had
mentioned to me earlier,

619
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,519
um, when you were telling me this
story that you had the feeling that,

620
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,399
that it might have been
something, a Bigfoot.

621
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,799
Well, whoever or whatever it was,

622
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,871
I don't know, you know.

623
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,981
I just miss my dog.

624
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,359
Thanks, Troy.

625
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,544
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it, man.

626
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,119
That was a terrible story.

627
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,199
I know.

628
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,559
So, what do you
think killed his dog?

629
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,839
I don't know. It could
have been anything.

630
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,039
Yeah. He was lying.
He knows what killed his dog.

631
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,199
Are you serious?
You don't believe that guy,

632
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,239
but you believe any
nut job out there

633
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,159
that says Sasquatch is real?

634
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,639
I don't know.

635
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,399
I think we have to
re-think this whole

636
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,359
going into the woods thing.

637
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,559
Oh, I'm not re-thinking anything.

638
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,719
I'll go in there myself.

639
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,519
You can just stay here
in town, if you want.

640
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,719
Can we at least have a normal
discussion about this?

641
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,519
Does it just... right away,
it's got to be either/or?

642
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,079
Listen. I'm not going to
let one guy ruin our trip,

643
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,079
all right?

644
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,867

Ah.

Let's go.

660
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,559
Bye, Bigfoot Motel.

661
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,141
We're good?

662
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,159
Yeah, you're good.

663
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,439
Hey, what's up?

664
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,999
I'm standing here with
Bigfoot himself and, uh,

665
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,799
Biggie, today is the day
we hike into Bluff Creek

666
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,999
to come look for you.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,389
How, how do you feel about that?

668
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,063
- Uh-huh?
- It's not a joke.

669
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,519
OK.

670
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,359
- You shouldn't go there.
- Thank you.

671
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,639
Have a nice day.

672
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,869
Sorry.

673
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,919
- Let's do it again.
- OK.

674
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,839
So, I'm here with Bigfoot and, uh,

675
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,919
Biggie, today is the day we're
going to come look for you.

676
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,679
Are you cool with that?

677
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,839
"Oh, yeah, me very cool."

678
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,839
Good. Let's go get him.

679
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,039
All right.

680
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,519
This is so beautiful here.

681
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,639
I know.

682
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,039
We could move up here
tomorrow and be fine with it.

683
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,839
Hmm, I don't know about that.

684
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,439
I don't think I could
ever live here.

685
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,999
Really? Why not?

686
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,119
- What would I do?
- I don't know.

687
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,479
Be a farm hand?

688
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,679
Yeah.

689
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,479
I don't know.

690
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,639
I'm sure there's some pretty good
regional theater up here you could do.

691
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,959
Yeah. I think I've done all
the regional theater I care,

692
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,399
uh, to do, honey.

693
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,039
The Entire Works of Shakespeare
by Kelley Monteleone.

694
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,039
Yeah.

695
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,350
The Trinity National
Forest Art Center.

696
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,999
No, I love that I've done all that,

697
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,079
but, you know, I'd like
to do some more stuff.

698
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,223
I'd like to do TV and film
and that's mostly in LA.

699
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,719
I'm probably going to have
to eventually be there.

700
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,399
- What? LA?
- Yeah.

701
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,159
Are you serious?

702
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,879
Yeah.

703
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,587
Oh, OK.

704
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,479
Because I could never move to LA.

705
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,399
Fuck that.

706
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,239
You know, if I moved to LA,

707
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,199
I would still be the same
person and so would you.

708
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,279
I know you would be.

709
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,999
I'm not saying, you, I'm
talking about everybody else

710
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,199
you have to live with down there.

711
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,589
A bunch of freeholes.

712
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,189
The last time I was there, babe, they
put fruit in their, fruit in my sushi.

713
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,799
Who does that?

714
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,479
Is that... what did they
call that? Frushi?

715
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,519
They called it...

716
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,999
Yeah, that's what... that's what
I'm going to call it, frushi.

717
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,439
I like that.

718
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,079
That says everything you need
to know about LA, to a T.

719
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,186
Again, with the leprechauns?
I'm recording.

720
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,919
Trinity National Forest.

721
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,999
Over 2 million acres of
unexplored wilderness.

722
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,999
There could be a whole
herd of Bigfoot out here.

723
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,599
Or, leprechauns.

724
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,959
All right. First of all,
leprechauns aren't real, okay?

725
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,427
Bigfoot...

726
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,471
<i>♪ Roger and Bob,
they rode out that day</i>

727
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,119
I'm sorry. I love that song.

728
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,519
No, you have a really
good voice for that.

729
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,719
Thank you.

730
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,665
Nice...

731
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,039
And I have no cell reception.

732
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,827
The beginning of every horror movie.

733
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,999
Are you getting excited?

734
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,919
Yeah.

735
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,239
I think we're getting close.

736
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,239
I hope so because it's
been a very long drive

737
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,999
up a very narrow road.

738
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,719
I realize I just turned
on my turn signal.

739
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,279
I don't think you need to
worry about that here.

740
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,879
I don't think I need it either.

741
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,949
No.

742
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,947
Let's see. Oh.

743
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,479
- Someone's up there.
- Who's this guy?

744
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,789
Oh, better stop.

745
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,159
Hey, how is it going, man?

746
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,159
Hey, is this the final
pass to get to the,

747
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,439
uh, PGF film site?

748
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,079
No, I'm sorry.

749
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,159
It, it got washed out
a long time ago.

750
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,799
There's nothing down there anymore.

751
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,759
Oh, yeah.

752
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,519
No, I've heard about that, man, but,

753
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,199
uh, I think we're going
to check it out anyway.

754
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,639
I think what you want to do is,
you want to turn this around

755
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,239
and go back the way you came

756
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,949
and just keep driving until
you get back to town.

757
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,319
Uh, actually, man,
I was told to come this way.

758
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,599
We've been traveling all day, so...

759
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,839
Could you turn that
camera off, please?

760
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,751
Oh, sorry.

761
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,599
So, I think we're just going to
move on now, man. Thank you.

762
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,319
I've already tried being nice.

763
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,599
Now, I'm telling you,
turn this thing around,

764
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,639
drive back the way you came,
keep going until you hit town,

765
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,919
maybe you can get there

766
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,639
and get yourselves
a couple of t-shirts

767
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,508
and maybe have a nice slice
of pie at the Fuck Off Cafe?

768
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,119
- OK. So...
- All right?

769
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,959
OK. We got it.

770
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,319
Why don't you get the
fuck out of here?

771
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,799
- Turn that fucking thing off.
- OK. I'm sorry.

772
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,959
Let's go, Jim. Come on.

773
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,064
- Have a nice day.
- OK...

774
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,399
I'll just run this
motherfucker over right now.

775
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,959
- Uh...
- Go on.

776
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,622
Honey, let's just get
out of here. Come on.

777
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,750
This guy is obviously not
excited with us being here.

778
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,999
Did he just fucking throw a rock?

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,399
What?

780
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,239
He did?

781
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,639
So, what are we going to do now?

782
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,319
Well, I didn't come all this
way to get turned around

783
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,709
by that asshole.

784
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,627
Lucky for me, I know another way in.

785
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,747
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Jim.

786
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,822
Just hang in there, all right?

787
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,359
Yeah?

788
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
Can you do that?

789
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,399
Yeah, I guess so.

790
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,999
All right.

791
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,389
Would you like me to narrate?

792
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,025
Yeah.

793
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,439
Oh. Hey, what's up?

794
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,119
Uh, this is Kelly, just, uh,
driving with my boyfriend.

795
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,279
Um,

796
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,719
I'm not sure where we
are right now, but...

797
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,839
We are in the Trinity
National Forest.

798
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,999
Ooh.

799
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,519
Balls deep in the Trinity
National Forest?

800
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,559
Hellz, yeah.

801
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,199
So, babe, we did it.

802
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,039
This is, this is the actual road...

803
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,559
To what?

804
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,479
What do you think to what?

805
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,039
To the Patterson-Gimlin film site.

806
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,639
This is it. This is bonafide,

807
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,586
so fuck you, hillbilly.

808
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,199
I told you I know a way in.

809
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,639
You sure did, babe,
but we're really...

810
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,359
What do you think about that?

811
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,479
I think it's, um, scary, this road.

812
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,159
Oh.

813
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,231
I mean, we're driving
in the day time.

814
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,959
Yeah.

815
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,239
Hmm.

816
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,679
What did they,
what did they ride in on,

817
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,799
horses or something or...?

818
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,668
Yeah, but this is how you
get to the PGF site now.

819
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,399
Hang on.

820
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,199
Oh, oh.

821
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,479
Bumpity, bumpity.

822
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,599
Last stop for the car.

823
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,159
Ah.

824
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,662
We got to hike the
rest of the way in.

825
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,390
But babe, this is it.

826
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,839
We're going to get there.

827
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,879
Yes, we are. Can we get
out of the car now?

828
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,144
I would love that. Let's do it.

829
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,828
We're here.

830
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,199
We're here.

831
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,599
We're leaving the car behind

832
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,679
- and this is it, babe.
- This is it.

833
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,999
This is the road that
leads to Bluff Creek.

834
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,599
Ooh.

835
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,519
To the famed
Patterson-Gimlin film site.

836
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,510
Whoa.

837
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,584
What do you think?

838
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,959
- I didn't...
- Holy shit.

839
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,799
I don't think I
pictured it like this.

840
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,399
This is awesome.

841
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,239
Babe, this is the dream I've
had since I was eight years old.

842
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,879
- I know.
- Thank you.

843
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,559
I'm happy to be here,
honey. Come on.

844
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,479
Let's go.

845
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,239
Yup.

846
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,187
Ooo, is there a
Starbucks on the way?

847
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,439
How long did you say it takes?

848
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,466
Mmm, air is clean.

849
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,389
- And, another brilliant observation, honey.
- Shut up.

850
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,759
Check out that moss.

851
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,679
Whoa.

852
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,909
Ah, sweet.

853
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,239
Poop!

854
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,279
Whoa.

855
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,119
Oh, look at all that.

856
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,439
That could be Bigfoot scat.

857
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,999
Yeah, or it could be bear shit.

858
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,959
Or, Pope shit.

859
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,825
OK.

860
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,039
Ahh.

861
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,239
It's prickly.

862
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,039
Ouch!

863
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,679
Here, babe.

864
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,599
Grab the camera.

865
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,667
- Get some of me walking through.
- Sure. Why not? I'd love to.

866
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,999
I like nature.

867
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,399
- Oh.
- Aw!

868
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,599
Yeah. Are you all right?

869
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,039
- Yes.
- Yeah?

870
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,108
- All right. Just watch yourself.
- Oh, right in the nose.

871
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,904
Oh, shit.

872
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,911
Ooh.

873
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,199
Are you getting this?

874
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,039
Oh, yeah, I'm getting it.

875
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,079
All right.

876
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,026
"Are you getting this, huh?"

877
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,679
Watch your step here.

878
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,119
Yeah, I'm trying to, to film

879
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,639
and walk at the same time
in a treacherous area.

880
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,983
Bear with me.

881
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,184
Not even a path.

882
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,919
What the fuck?

883
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,399
How do we know we're
going in the right direction?

884

Just keep going, babe.

885
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,719
We're almost there.

Ooh.

889
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,479
So, by my estimations,
we're about an hour

890
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,119
to an hour and a half
from the PGF film site.

891

Turn off the camera.

- What?
- Turn off the...

893
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,622

Check this out.

895
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,959
Jim?

896
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,861
- Hold on, let me just get this.
- I need you to...

897
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,799
It's amazing to think that
we're in the same woods

898
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,119
that Roger Patterson and Bob
Gimlin were in 45 years ago

899
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,749
when they saw that creature.

900
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,679
What do you think?

901
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,228
It's very pretty.

902
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,759
Babe.

903
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,910
Hey, babe, come here.

904
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,279
What?

905
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,748
Come here. I want to
show you something.

906
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,599
Come here. I got a
little surprise for you.

907
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,359
Really?

908
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,669
Yeah, really.

909
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,519
OK. Bring it over here.

910
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,639
No, no, no. Come on.

911
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,585
Follow me.

912
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,341
Oh my God.

913
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,471
Told you.

914
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,799
Wow.

915
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,189
This is insane.

916
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,559
You did good.

917
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,999
All right, I'm going in.

918
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,679
- You are?
- Yeah.

919
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,079
Oh my God. OK.

920
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,559
So hot.

921
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,461
Yeah. Whoa!

922

Oh my God.

Oh! It's cold.

Yeah?

926

Baby, I am proud of you.

927

How cold do you think that is?

928
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,599
Should I get in there?

929
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,590
No.

930
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,279
Whoa.

931
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,279
I like that you had no hesitation jumping
in that water even though I didn't get in.

932
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,399
What is my sock doing in the tree?

933
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,470
Oh, what sock?

934
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,662
Huh. That's weird.

935
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,119
Oh my God.

00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,463
What the fuck?

937
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,348
Honey, I want to go home.

938
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,159
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's probably just a bear.

939
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,747
Just a bear!? Oh, great.
That makes me feel good.

940
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,199
All right. Well, just
help me put it back up.

941
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,679
Look, they're more afraid
of us than we are of them.

942
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,581
I don't know. I'm pretty afraid of them.

943
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,959
Actually, just stand
there and record.

944
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,239
I think that'll be,
that'll be much better.

945
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,919
Oh. Oh, are you telling me
you don't want me to film?

946
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,230
Uh, yeah?

947
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,386
What is it?

948

What is it?

949
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,079
I don't know, but it
sounded really big.

950
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,519
What?

951
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,546
It was right behind me.
I think it moved over there.

952
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,119
Are you serious?

953
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,919
Can you see it?

No, I don't see anything.

Yeah. Me, too.

- I think we found our visitor.
- Oh my God, yeah.

Nothing.

970

It's not going to be
that kind of night.

971
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,559

me all the way out here.

Oh, I don't know what to say. Um...

984

Well, you could start
by saying, "Yes."

to have that kind of career?
