00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:16,676
(♪♪♪)

00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:44,436
(♪♪♪)

4
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:12,230
INTERVIEWER: Mr. Lansky, why are
the American authorities after you?

5
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:14,433
Well, apparently some
newspaper man wrote

6
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:17,235
that I had $300 million.

7
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:17,870
INTERVIEWER:
Is it true?

8
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:19,371
(Lansky chuckles)

9
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:22,474
I wish I had a million dollars.

10
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:24,609
They accuse me
of making a president.

11
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:26,646
Now, I don't know Mr. Nixon
any more

12
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:28,915
than what I've read
in the newspapers.

13
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:32,451
They claim I have 50%
of Lebanon casinos,

14
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,386
50% of Monte Carlo.

15
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:37,322
Now how ridiculous
can we really get?

16
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:38,691
INTERVIEWER: Mr. Lansky,
is there such a thing

17
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,525
as organized crime?

18
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,867
I have no knowledge
on the subject.

19
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,769
(♪♪♪)

20
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,346
DAVID: (Voice-over) Listen
Eva, I'm in Florida, honey.

21
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,381
Daddy's here for work.

22
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,984
- What do they have here?
- (Chuckles)

23
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:08,755
They have oranges and gators
and Mickey Mouse.

24
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,790
Next time we can go
and I promise.

25
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:14,694
Okay Eva,
can you put your momma on?

26
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,398
Christie, Christie,
Christie please?

27
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,735
I know that the check bounced.

28
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,803
Okay, but that's OK.

29
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:24,904
That's why I'm in Miami.

30
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,039
I'm going to do some book
signings.

31
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:27,907
Yeah, sure they gotta.

32
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,643
They are putting me
in a fancy hotel,

33
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:31,778
they gonna give me the...

34
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:37,549
Christie, I know
my responsibilities, alright?

35
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,454
Look Christie, I'm trying
my best, alright?

36
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:43,522
Trying my best.

37
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:53,498
(♪♪♪)

38
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:13,578
(♪♪♪)

39
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:20,552
David Stone.

40
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:21,888
Mr. Lansky, it's a pleasure.

41
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,055
How was your trip?

42
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,924
Fine, thanks, umm.

43
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:25,925
Hope you don't mind,
I got a coffee.

44
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,793
You mind sitting down there?

45
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:30,830
Huh, yeah sure.

46
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,064
Thank you.

47
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:38,638
Hello, Mr. Lansky, how are you?

48
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,740
Fine, Daphne.

49
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,041
How's your mother feel?

50
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,877
Ah, good days and bad, you know.

51
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:45,778
It is a mission.

52
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,213
Yeah, I know all about that.

53
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,613
What can I get for you, honey?

54
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,816
We'll do a couple of them
sandwiches.

55
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,053
Bills sliced and fatty cut
and an assortment of pickles.

56
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,922
So, the usual.

57
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,223
I'll pick out the best ones.

58
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,523
OK.

59
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,695
I'd like you to remove that.

60
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:06,531
Ok.

61
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,502
You're from Pittsburgh.

62
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,940
You graduated on scholarship
with honors from Princeton.

63
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,842
You were on the crime beat
at the Fort Wayne News Sentinel

64
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,945
before you started
writing books.

65
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,546
You've got a wife, Christina,
and two young children,

66
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,548
Eva and Jack.

67
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:27,519
I make it a point of knowing
who I associate myself with.

68
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:30,957
Mr. Stone,
old business habits never die.

69
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:36,762
It's a complicated thing,
isn't it, marriage, children.

70
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:47,505
I've been reading some articles
about you.

71
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,809
Forget all that.

72
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,777
I'm here to tell you
the real story.

73
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,012
(David chuckles)

74
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,814
All right, well, that's great,
cause I'm-

75
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,548
I'm here to write
the real story.

76
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,752
Four packs a day, 60 years.

77
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,688
I finally work up the courage
to quit.

78
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,256
A week later,
I go to see my doctor.

79
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,158
He tells me I'm dying.

80
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,027
(Lansky laughs)

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,730
As a writer, I thought you would
appreciate the irony in that.

82
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,832
I do. I'm just I'm very sorry
to hear that.

83
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,801
My circumstances offer me
the privilege

84
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,070
to pick who I want
to tell my story.

85
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:20,006
Your book on Kennedy paid
you well?

86
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,573
Well, I did OK.

87
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:25,878
It's been a few years since
lady luck visited you.

88
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,913
Yeah well history doesn't
always repeat itself.

89
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,317
When I was a young boy,

90
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,586
I spent my days
at the public library.

91
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,022
I read everything

92
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:40,159
and I have a particular interest
in history.

93
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,130
People see the same thing
from different perspectives,

94
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,832
and that fascinates me.

95
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,734
But what do you want from this?

96
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:52,738
Why does David still want to
write a book about Meyer Lansky?

97
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,273
Oh.

98
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,882
Everything that I've read
in history about you says

99
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:03,983
you're a complicated man

100
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:06,952
and maybe I like stories about
complicated people.

101
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:11,791
And I think that your story,
the real story.

102
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,992
I don't think
he's been told yet,

103
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,627
and I don't think
it's about one man,

104
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,162
I think
it's about the 20th century.

105
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,900
That was quite a speech,

106
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,635
but you didn't answer
the question.

107
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,871
I need the money.

108
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:30,276
Ah, there it is, the truth.

109
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,945
When I die,
the book is yours to sell.

110
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:36,148
Until then, you won't show
the manuscript to no one.

111
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:39,218
Anything I choose to tell you
is off the record

112
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,321
until I give you permission
to put it in the book.

113
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:45,024
Without my approval, what you
have is a work of fiction.

114
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,293
- I won't incriminate myself.
- OK.

115
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,361
Any conversations
you have about me

116
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,097
outside of our meetings,

117
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,665
- I want to know.
- Sure.

118
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:58,003
Betray me
and there will be consequences.

119
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,738
Are these terms
are agreeable to you?

120
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,142
Yes sir.

121
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:08,647
I hope our collaboration
will be a successful one.

122
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,353
(typewriter keys clicking)

123
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:38,277
CHRISTIE: (on phone)
<i>Hello?</i>

124
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,179
Hey, Christie, it's me.

125
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:43,048
CHRISTIE: (on phone) <i>Hey,
it's ok baby, mommy's got you.</i>

126
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,184
You OK?

127
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,919
You don't sound, OK?

128
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,354
CHRISTIE: (on phone)
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

129
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,389
<i>Jack's got a 103 and he's not
holding his spoon down.</i>

130
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,724
Take him to a doctor.

131
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,960
CHRISTIE: (on phone) <i>Excuse me?
I took him to the doctor.</i>

132
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,762
<i>Listen, I can't do this, OK?
Not now.</i>

133
00:08:56,795 --> 00:09:00,366
Christie, I gotta chance
to write a new book, alright?

134
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,734
And it could be-

135
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,468
CHRISTIE: (on phone)
<i>Oh, David, no.</i>

136
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,737
Could be something really good.

137
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,705
CHRISTIE: (on phone) <i>Oh David,
I called your publisher.</i>

138
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,474
<i>They had no idea
you were even in Miami,</i>

139
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,743
<i>which means
you are lying to me.</i>

140
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,077
<i>I can't go through this,
I've got to go.</i>

141
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,115
(Phone hangs up)

142
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:26,058
(♪♪♪)

143
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,830
LANSKY: You said you read some
stories about me in the papers.

144
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,733
My reputation has a habit
of preceding me.

145
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,236
When they don't know you
they put labels on you,

146
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,905
Master Stock Manipulator.

147
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,943
America's most successful
casino operator in history.

148
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,511
Mob's accountant.

149
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,047
The feds even leaked the story
to the press

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,750
about me having
$300 million squirreled away.

151
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:52,918
(Lansky laughs)

152
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,820
If you find out
who's out there guessing,

153
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:56,288
please be sure to let me know.

154
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:57,456
- Yeah.
- You don't get to keep it,

155
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,258
call me
and I'll give you a piece.

156
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,826
- Fair enough.
- (Lansky laughs)

157
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,861
The labels are the accurate?

158
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,331
It's your book.
You decide.

159
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,465
OK, alright.

160
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:07,766
(Lansky laughs)

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,201
Okay.

162
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:13,038
You strike me as a rather
obsequious guy, David.

163
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,206
(Chuckles)

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,841
Quick to please.

165
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,309
Never thought of myself
that way.

166
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,877
- You're seperated.
- Hmm.

167
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,512
What did your wife
think about that?

168
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:23,415
Did she find you that way?

169
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:24,950
We're here to talk about you.

170
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,352
We are not here
to talk about me, Mr. Lansky.

171
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:29,455
No, no, no. We have to talk
about you and me.

172
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,959
- You know, I was married also.
- Yeah?

173
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,394
Yeah, twice.

174
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,298
You know, what they say,

175
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,000
can't live with them,
can't shoot them.

176
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,002
(David chuckles)

177
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,272
So where do we start?

178
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,340
Let's start
when you were a child.

179
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,843
Russia.

180
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,945
The only thing
I remember about Russia,

181
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:56,081
is one day me and my uncle
crossing a path

182
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,850
and some Cossacks
ordered my uncle

183
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,585
to open his potato sack.

184
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,987
And toss a potato up
in the air.

185
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,055
My Uncle obeyed.

186
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,593
Tossed a potato into the air,

187
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:11,897
and the Cossack takes out this
fucking sword and swoosh.

188
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,602
He wasn't aiming
for the potatoe.

189
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:19,571
He was aiming
for my uncle's hands,

190
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,040
Cut it right off.

191
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,141
Tough guys.

192
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:25,311
But swords,
we didn't have a sword.

193
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,812
That was the difference.

194
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,848
I never forgot that.

195
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:35,187
I promised myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

196
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,091
The next time I'll be the one
holding the knife.

197
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,293
That's the only thing Russia
ever gave me,

198
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,028
when I swore that day.

199
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,167
Made me stronger,
it sharpened me.

200
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,642
I wish I knew where that
cocksucker was today,

201
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:58,944
I'll show them
what a tough guy he is.

202
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,447
The real story starts
in America.

203
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:10,322
LANSKY: (Voice-over) By the time I was
10, I was sharp as a shiv.

204
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:14,593
My mind was my escape
and more than anything, numbers.

205
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,995
Numbers gave my world
some order.

206
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,298
And if a kid with that kind
of interest in numbers,

207
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,635
there was nothing as thrilling
is a dice game.

208
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,303
I would watch them play.

209
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:27,206
But oh boy, my old man found out
that was how

210
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,308
I was spending my time,

211
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:30,677
My father?

212
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,911
Everything he did,
he did for us.

213
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,247
He was an honest man
earning an honest living.

214
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,148
There's nothing wrong with that.

215
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,484
He wasn't living his life.

216
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,386
His life was living him.

217
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,553
I guess that's what we do.

218
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:45,391
We measure ourselves
against our fathers.

219
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,326
And you?
What was your's like?

220
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,196
My father died when I was young.

221
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,533
That must have been hard.

222
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,940
So being an honest man.
Being an honest father.

223
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:04,143
Yeah.

224
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,310
Is that beneath you?

225
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,350
What I know is that
life wouldn't wait for me.

226
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:18,223
(♪♪♪)

227
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,493
LANSKY: (Voice-over) It all happened
so fast, I put down the nickel

228
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,595
my mother gave me
to pick up some bread.

229
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,968
In a matter of seconds,
my nickel was gone.

230
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,438
Can you imagine having to tell
my mother and father

231
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,139
why we couldn't eat
that night?

232
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:37,677
He took your money
and you just felt ashamed.

233
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,211
It was rage.

234
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,615
You ever feel that, David?

235
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,720
A rage so strong
it changes the path you're on?

236
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,555
Never felt anything like that.

237
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,724
There are people
in this world who will try to

238
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:55,327
make you believe that
they are better than you,

239
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,430
that they can win
at your expense.

240
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:03,335
Rage is a tool we use to look
those people in the eye

241
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,737
and prove them wrong.

242
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,405
That's what drove you to win
at dice?

243
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,608
It did much more than drive me
to win.

244
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,543
It drove me to control the game.

245
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:18,417
LANSKY: (Voice-over) I
calculated the odds and payoffs.

246
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,620
Watched how the probabilities
ebbed and flowed,

247
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,622
but something didn't make sense.

248
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:26,191
I knew something was going on,

249
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:29,328
something invisible
that no one else could see.

250
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,096
And then I saw it.

251
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:41,808
A blink of the eye,
a scratch of the air,

252
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:45,210
I figured out what these guys
were doing,

253
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,746
they rigged the game.

254
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,815
It was the outsider.

255
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,550
He was the one
controlling the game.

256
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,655
And isn't that what we all want,
David?

257
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:59,591
The only one is in gambling,
as in life,

258
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,460
are those who control the game.

259
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,442
(Music playing in distance)

260
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:40,767
I think that you have the smile
of a beauty queen, right?

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,269
I do know I don't think that
they stick out.

262
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:48,307
I don't think that
there's a huge gap, but,

263
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,575
if you think they're going to
straighten out,

264
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,644
then what's the point
of getting braces, right?

265
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,445
EVA: (on phone)
<i>Mom's right.</i>

266
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,113
Right about what?

267
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,515
EVA: (on phone)
<i>We can't afford it.</i>

268
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,484
<i>That's why you don't want me
to get braces.</i>

269
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:03,823
She say that?
Put your mama on, Eva? Hmm?

270
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,490
EVA: (on phone)
<i>She said she can't talk.</i>

271
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,259
What ya mean she can't talk?

272
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,528
If she can't talk
or she won't talk?

273
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:12,665
EVA: (on phone) <i>She said she's
not talking to you, daddy.</i>

274
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,132
Give mama a message, alright?

275
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,500
- Can you do that?
- <i>Okay.</i>

276
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,837
And you tell her that the reason
that Daddy's in Miami

277
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,806
is because of a man
called Meyer Lansky.

278
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,873
EVA: (on phone)
<i>Meyor Lasky?</i>

279
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,675
It's okay, she know who that is.

280
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:25,912
And you tell her that
Mr. Lansky

281
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:29,314
hired daddy personally to
write a book about his life.

282
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,683
And every publisher
is going to want it

283
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,384
and it's going to be best
selling when it is,

284
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:36,355
daddy is gonna set your smile,
alright?

285
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:37,255
EVA: (on phone)
<i>OK.</i>

286
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,325
Because that's what daddies do.
Yeah?

287
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,695
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- OK.

288
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,931
Don't you worry
about your thing.

289
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,398
Alright, you go tell her.

290
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,432
EVA: (on phone)
<i>I love you, daddy.</i>

291
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,533
Alright, bye.

292
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,541
Sorry.

293
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:03,548
You look like hell.

294
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,151
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

295
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,223
Problems at home?

296
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,695
OK, umm.

297
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,499
Ok, today...

298
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:22,635
These problems you're having,

299
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,705
I hope they're not interfering
with your ability to work.

300
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:29,541
I'm here. I'm fine.

301
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:30,677
Good.

302
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,214
I want to talk
about Bugsy Siegel.

303
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,651
It's Ben Siegel.

304
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,787
Say that name again.

305
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,690
DAVID: (Voice-over)
Ben Siegel, Bugsy.

306
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,992
He and Lansky had bootlegging
and gambling racket

307
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,326
known as
the Bugs and Meyer Gang.

308
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,462
There were more than partners.

309
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:51,931
They were like brothers.

310
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,700
Lansky handle the numbers.

311
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,534
Bugsy was the muscle.

312
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,535
All right, Ben.

313
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,838
- (Groaning)
- Come on.

314
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,007
I think he gets to a point.

315
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,541
DAVID: (Voice-over) The only thing
Bugsy enjoyed more than killing

316
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,811
was the ladies.

317
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,611
Or maybe it was the other way
around.

318
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,257
Luciano is looking for somebody

319
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,927
to run as his transportation
for him.

320
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:26,799
We offer Lucky
a deal on his distribution

321
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,969
too favorable to turn down.

322
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:32,270
Maybe we take a loss on it.

323
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:33,305
(Ben chuckles)

324
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:36,475
A loss?
How's that makes sense?

325
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:39,846
We'll be getting in on the
ground up with Lucky Luciano

326
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,981
and it will supply liquor
for our own operation

327
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:43,548
at the same time.

328
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,551
Profit margins are justified
tenfold.

329
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,522
I did the math for you.

330
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,623
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

331
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:55,527
(Laughter)

332
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,029
What do you think of that guy,
Ramsie?

333
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:58,698
He's friendly.

334
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,633
Gets along with the clientele,
why?

335
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,368
He should lose the ring.

336
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,671
It's distracting.

337
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,506
Sends the wrong message.

338
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,011
Rosen why are you
so fucking happy?

339
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:15,681
LANSKY: (Voice-over) Our
operation was expanding fast.

340
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:18,017
We had to keep
our books clean,

341
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,353
keep the authorities
off the money trail.

342
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:24,523
If you're on a leaky boat,
you plug the holes.

343
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,859
You over by 200.

344
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,426
It was a good day
at the track.

345
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,697
Yeah?
Explain the numbers to me.

346
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:41,908
Uh, I had 9,320 on the seven
at...

347
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,645
573 against the favorite.

348
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:48,613
But you heard Reenam Roll
was a winner.

349
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:51,583
So you, what?
You to sweeten the pot?

350
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:56,055
You got to admit it.
He is good.

351
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:59,524
Yeah, well, I couldn't lose.

352
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,062
What did I tell you?
Trust your memory.

353
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:07,800
I know, I just got a lot
of numbers to remember.

354
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:12,071
You know, how many gambling
rooms I run in this town?

355
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:16,676
The fact that you don't know
puts us at an advantage.

356
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,510
You also got no idea
how much money

357
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:22,081
comes through that door
each day, do you?

358
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:23,481
You know what?

359
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,853
The only one who knows is me

360
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:31,824
and I keep that number
in my head.

361
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:35,795
But you do know the percentage
of our bets don't you?

362
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:39,598
- 10%.
- 10% win or lose?

363
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:42,935
That's what sustains
this business, Jimmy.

364
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,071
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

365
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,640
Who else is gambling
with our money, maybe?

366
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:50,710
I swear, Bugsy,
I don't know nothing.

367
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,681
Did you just call me Bugsy.

368
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:03,455
Everybody calls you that,
at least when you're not around.

369
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,163
Well, now I'm confused.

370
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:13,766
Am I not standing here?

371
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,500
What am I?

372
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,737
Am I a figment
of your imagination?

373
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,971
No.

374
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,773
No, no, because that's
what you just said.

375
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:24,010
That's what people call me
when I'm not around.

376
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:26,511
But I'm right here.

377
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:30,116
Meyer, do you see me?

378
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:31,817
I see you, Bennie.

379
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,188
I'm going to ask you
one more time, Jimmy.

380
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,895
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

381
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,198
- No, I...
- Don't lie to me.

382
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,506
Don't forget to breathe.

383
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,742
They say breathing is good.

384
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,010
Okay.

385
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,548
Now, don't you want me to know?

386
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:13,960
I-I-I may have heard something
about a dealer

387
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:16,528
at your Roma at Allen.

388
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,631
I don't remember his name.

389
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:20,032
Well, let me jog your memory,
huh?

390
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:26,604
Ow! Rosen, his name is Rosen.

391
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,573
Now what exactly
did he tell you?

392
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:30,876
He was tipping off some players.

393
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,611
I don't know anything else,
I swear.

394
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:38,684
Sit up.

395
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:39,952
Thank you, Jimmy.

396
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,256
It's very helpful for us,
you know.

397
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,028
Oh, at least you die
with a clean conscience, right?

398
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,562
Who?

399
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:52,965
- You.
- (Gunshot)

400
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:56,702
YOUNG LANSKY:
God dammit, not in my ear.

401
00:22:56,736 --> 00:23:04,010
(♪♪♪)

402
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:07,013
CHARLIE: First time me and you
met and here comes little Meyer

403
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:10,249
walking through the snow
like the wandering Jew.

404
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,817
And my guys, I mean,

405
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:13,119
there must've been like
six of us or something, huh?

406
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,919
Seven.

407
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:15,154
We ask him
to empty his pockets,

408
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,856
if he wants to cross the street,

409
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:20,259
YOUNG LANSKY: Ask?
I don't recall any asking.

410
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:23,561
We politely instructed him
to remove the contents

411
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,331
of his pockets.

412
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,199
DAVID: (Voice-over)
Charlie Lucky Luciano,

413
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,567
father of modern
organized crime.

414
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,203
He created the governing body
of the Mafia

415
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,304
known as The Commission

416
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,840
and the National
Crime Syndicate,

417
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:38,110
Confederation of Italian, Jewish
and Irish Gangsters.

418
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,246
And you know
what he said to us?

419
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,783
"Go fuck yourselves,
you guinea bastards."

420
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:47,086
That's right and the balls
on this one, huh?

421
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,921
(Lansky chuckles)

422
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,657
This kid would fought all six
of us before giving up a penny.

423
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,758
So what do I do?

424
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,627
I let them go.

425
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,063
Kid as us fearlessness as that
deserves to be rewarded.

426
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,598
How many times I've gotta hear
this story, huh, Lucky?

427
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,702
Eh, this story is like wine,
Benny.

428
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:05,738
Get's better with age.

429
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,006
I prefer whiskey.

430
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,875
The point is.

431
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:15,047
You and me, Meyer, Italian, Jew,
none of that matters.

432
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,983
What matters is the way
we see the world.

433
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:20,186
We fight our way in
from the outside.

434
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,787
That's right.

435
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:25,825
This distribution business
you proposing,

436
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,592
we got ourselves a deal.

437
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,031
I'll drink to that.

438
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:32,965
(Speaks Hebrew)

439
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:42,808
See that half-Checz girl?

440
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:45,377
You know, she's jotting
everything down.

441
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:49,782
Who's coming, who's going,
who's talking to who?

442
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:54,820
That all goes to lucky.
It's the attention to detail.

443
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:59,158
That's what makes a Lucky,
Lucky.

444
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:02,194
I'm paying attention
to a different detail.

445
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:03,729
Be right back.

446
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:13,672
(♪♪♪)

447
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,709
YOUNG BEN:
Have a seat.

448
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:20,746
This is my friend, Meyer.

449
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,183
Meyer, please meet
Anne and Louise.

450
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,317
Hello.

451
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:30,923
YOUNG BEN: Now tell me something,
what are two lovely ladies

452
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:33,893
like yourself doing
in a place like this?

453
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,428
The sign outside said
it was a drugstore.

454
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:38,030
I needed some toothpaste.

455
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,268
So what are you guys,

456
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:44,403
professional gamblers
or something?

457
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:48,474
Oh! Us? No. No, no, no.

458
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:51,410
Then what line
of business are you in?

459
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,112
Truck rentals.

460
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:55,781
LOUISE: Truck rentals?
What does that mean?

461
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:58,384
Means we rent trucks.

462
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,386
Anne, look.

463
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,956
It's the big cheese gangster
from the newsreels.

464
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,125
They say he murdered
his own cousin.

465
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:08,894
Louise.

466
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:12,398
YOUNG BEN: Hey,
how's about I go over there tell them to

467
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:14,900
come give you a good old kiss
on the lips.

468
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,702
Very funny.

469
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,705
OK.

470
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:27,246
What the hell?
Is he really doing it?

471
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,315
(Young Ben whispering)

472
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:33,118
Oh, my God,
he's looking right at us.

473
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:35,120
Let's get out of here.

474
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,022
I'm not going anywhere.

475
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:42,061
The man is a killer
and these guys are his friends.

476
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,999
They seem harmless.

477
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,270
Suit, yourself.

478
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:03,282
So you're in the truck
rental business?

479
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,889
Cold?

480
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,831
You need a coat.

481
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,235
Are you going to buy me one?

482
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:25,137
(Young Lansky laughs)

483
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:31,443
Fur.

484
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:36,181
Mink.

485
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:44,456
Leather trim
down to the knees.

486
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:50,796
And what will you do
with the rest?

487
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,167
Of this?

488
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:01,307
This I'm going to keep
for our future.

489
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:17,222
(♪♪♪)

490
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:30,369
DAVID:
Not too cold.

491
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:35,341
It's refreshing.

492
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:39,511
Oh, it's cold.

493
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:41,413
Alright, crazy.
Would you like 'em?

494
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,917
Sure, why not.

495
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:50,489
Thank you, I'm Maureen.

496
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:51,890
I'm David.

497
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:58,297
You're a writer.

498
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,933
Yeah? How do you know that?

499
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,368
I hear you taping at night?

500
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:03,502
Yeah?

501
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,404
Yeah.

502
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:07,439
And the walls are pretty thin.

503
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:12,511
Spy novels?

504
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,113
I'm just doing research.

505
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:15,581
On women in swimming pools?

506
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:21,120
It's good you quick,
very quick.

507
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:27,426
What about you?
Are you on vacation?

508
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,927
Something like that.

509
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,368
Doctor, are you telling us that
Buddy will have to wear a brace

510
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:37,670
the rest of his life?

511
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:43,643
If you'd like, I'd be happy
to recommend specialists

512
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,310
who are developing
a new treatment

513
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,445
for cerebral palsy.

514
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:48,280
Answer the goddamn question.

515
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,986
My professional opinion is,
you a...

516
00:29:55,053 --> 00:30:04,963
(♪♪♪)

517
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:06,465
The doctor said
there was no chance

518
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,434
he would ever be normal.

519
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,203
And you couldn't accept that?

520
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:14,473
I wasn't about to let my son
become weak and vulnerable.

521
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:15,507
No.

522
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:19,211
- (Laughs)
- And if I could help it.

523
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,146
Why did that bother you so much?

524
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,347
Why do you think?

525
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:33,760
Would it not bother you to see
your own son go through his life

526
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,327
at such a disadvantage?

527
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,164
I couldn't accept the odds.

528
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,401
The odds?

529
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,603
It was a mathematical
equation,

530
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:48,307
the proportion of those
afflicted versus those cured,

531
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,075
the rate at which
those afflicted

532
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:51,678
were able to walk again.

533
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:53,111
I ran the numbers to my head.

534
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,379
I made the calculations.

535
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:56,649
You thought
you could beat the odds?

536
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:57,616
Yes.

537
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:02,020
What about faith?

538
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,055
Faith?

539
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:04,156
Mm hmm.

540
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:05,290
Maybe God wanted him
to be like that.

541
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,458
Who?

542
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:15,467
Hello, God, hello,
hell fucking lo.

543
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,503
I ain't hearing anybody
answer me.

544
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:20,339
Maybe he's got nothing
he wants to tell you.

545
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:24,009
And he made that clear,
didn't he?

546
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:30,349
You OK?

547
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:31,383
Let's do this.

548
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:41,360
(♪♪♪)

549
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,765
- (Groaning)
- Come on you.

550
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:46,666
Shut up, Rosen..

551
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:49,601
(Muffled shouting)

552
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,780
Get down, come on, get down.

553
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:04,316
Please, don't do anything
to him, please!

554
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,485
Hey, hey, woah, woah, woah,
enough.

555
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:08,153
Hey, what the fuck
is she doing here?

556
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,121
Well you told me
to bring her down.

557
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:12,090
MRS. ROSEN:
Please, please, he's a good man.

558
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:12,792
He's a father.

559
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:14,861
We have four children, please.

560
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:16,128
Oh God.

561
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,563
Get up.

562
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:20,465
Here, this is for you.

563
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:24,637
Your husband has been stealing
from me for years, Mrs. Rosen.

564
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:27,472
A nickel at a time,
money that adds up.

565
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:32,210
Mrs. Rosen, you knew about this,
didn't you?

566
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,281
(Sobbing)

567
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,282
It's OK.

568
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:45,390
This is a warning.

569
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:49,762
But if you ever mention what you
see here today to anyone.

570
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:54,634
You'll be putting your life
and your children's in danger.

571
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:01,306
You understand?

572
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,574
Get her out of here.

573
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:07,346
May I help you with anything,
Mrs. Rosen?

574
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,181
Come on, deal with it.

575
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,653
Don't worry about him,
he's okay.

576
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,858
Where were you?

577
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,829
She was a mess, boss.
I was trying to be delicate.

578
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:28,701
Never let your emotions dictate
your actions ever again.

579
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:33,706
(Mrs. Rosen crying)

580
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:41,246
(Mr. Rosen muffled speech)

581
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:45,752
(Crying)

582
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:55,360
(Gunshot)

583
00:33:55,394 --> 00:34:03,368
(♪♪♪)

584
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:06,405
(Crying)

585
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:15,247
(♪♪♪)

586
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:27,225
So you left them fatherless?

587
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:28,427
Three children.

588
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,664
He left them fatherless.

589
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:33,900
Is that what you tell yourself,
so you can sleep at night?

590
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,534
No, I don't have to tell myself
anything

591
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,403
when I go to sleep at night.

592
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:40,539
It's the way we live.
It's business.

593
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,911
What do you want,
a fucking fairy tale, David?

594
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,846
Go home and write a fairy tale.

595
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:49,916
LANSKY: (on recording) <i>I want
you to write a book about me.</i>

596
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,551
<i>Would that be
of interest to you?</i>

597
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:55,722
DAVID: (on recording) <i>Yeah,
I'd be very interested in that.</i>

598
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:58,590
LANSKY: (on recording) <i>Good,
I'll need you to come to Miami.</i>

599
00:34:58,623 --> 00:35:01,027
<i>There's a coffee shop not far
from where I live.</i>

600
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,295
<i>Take down this address.</i>

601
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,363
Okay?

602
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:06,999
We need more resources.

603
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:10,970
Even after sell him Frank?
15 years.

604
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,571
You got all the surveillance
you asked for.

605
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:14,006
What else are you expecting
to find here?

606
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,744
The $300 million that
Lansky has stashed away.

607
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,846
This guy, Stone, can really
open the door for us.

608
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,781
Opening the door?

609
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:24,316
There are no more doors to open,
Frank,

610
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,386
tax evasion, contempt of court,
they threw it all away.

611
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,757
And no indictment.

612
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,658
Lansky's impenetrable.

613
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:34,961
But that stuff was 10 years ago.

614
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:37,063
And where's he been
for the last 10 years?

615
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:40,298
Federal prison?
No.

616
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:43,335
Collins Avenue walking that
little shiatsu of his

617
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:45,638
up and down the boardwalk
with a smug face.

618
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:47,006
It's an embarrassment, frankly.

619
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,707
We can fix that.

620
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,509
Oh, yeah and how's that, Greg?

621
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,511
Even if that money is out there
somewhere,

622
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:53,913
we don't have the budget
to keep digging holes

623
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,882
to know where to
try to find it.

624
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:58,617
We're talking about the most
notorious gangster

625
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:00,019
in American history.

626
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,554
We're just asking
for a little rope.

627
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:05,658
A little rope, so you two can
hang yourselves, huh?

628
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:09,061
Andre. Just consider it.

629
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:14,299
(Keys clicking)

630
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:17,937
(David muttering)

631
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:24,576
(Knocking on door)

632
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:29,715
Hey, hey.

633
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:31,449
Hi.

634
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:35,121
I was, um, I was
in the neighborhood.

635
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:37,924
Come in, come in, yeah.

636
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:46,364
So I was about to take a break,
so we need some glasses.

637
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:48,400
I've only got these glasses
so let me fix something.

638
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:49,434
One second.

639
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,369
(Maureen laughs)

640
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,444
How is the book going?

641
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:00,146
- DAVID: The book?
- Yeah.

642
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,915
DAVID:
Uh, struggling.

643
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:05,517
I'm guessing that's a good
thing, you know?

644
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:12,390
Is this the guy you are writing
the book about?

645
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:13,458
Yeah.

646
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,631
Meyer Lansky?

647
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:22,001
That's him. Here, sit down.

648
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,435
Should I know who that is?

649
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:26,072
Uh, he ran a lot of Casinos.

650
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,908
So, if you're into gambling,
I guess, but, um.

651
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:30,643
Hey, I'm so sorry
about the mess.

652
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:32,510
Oh stop, I don't care.

653
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:39,484
That's my daughter.
She's really cheeky.

654
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,053
And looks a lot like me.

655
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,923
Oh, she's pretty cute.

656
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:48,995
Yeah, and I got a picture
of my son somewhere,

657
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:51,063
but of 18 months.

658
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,497
He looks like a bug.

659
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:58,070
But uh, here you go,
and don't worry, you know?

660
00:37:58,104 --> 00:37:59,604
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Yeah, okay.

661
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,572
(David laughs)

662
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:08,948
To your huh,
to a vacation in paradise.

663
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:14,954
Sorry.

664
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:19,759
You were saying?

665
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:24,063
To umm...

666
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:28,935
To a vacation in paradise,
I guess.

667
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:30,836
(♪♪♪)

668
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:40,612
Are you sure?

669
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:41,681
Yeah.

670
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,591
Well you were unfaithful
to your wife,

671
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,661
is that why you broke up?

672
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:02,234
Then what was it?

673
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,637
I tried to give her
a good life

674
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,274
and tried to make her happy,
but it wasn't enough.

675
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:12,712
Happy on whose terms?
Your's or her's?

676
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:18,050
I was as unfaithful
as they come.

677
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:21,187
The way I see it, you do
what you can and feel alive.

678
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:26,726
It's time I told you about the
years leading up to the war.

679
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:32,031
I though you quit.

680
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:35,234
You keep it pack as a reminder.

681
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,636
You want to conquer
your weaknesses,

682
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,604
keep them in plain sight.

683
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:42,908
Speaking of which, how was...

684
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:45,978
Who?

685
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:49,148
You still have lipstick
on your neck.

686
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,117
Don't you shower?
Jesus.

687
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:55,821
So, Lucky was in jail.

688
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:57,555
I wanted to get him
out of prison.

689
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,293
How fast can we put together
an army of men?

690
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,129
Fast?

691
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:05,998
For what?

692
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:07,733
I want to put the fear of God
into them.

693
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:12,138
Heil Hitler.

694
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:13,605
Heil Hitler.

695
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:17,643
MAN:
My (speaks foreign)

696
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,079
We call upon our legislators
to evict (unclear).

697
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:28,054
Jew is as alien in body,
mind and soul

698
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:30,588
and it is more dangerous to us
than all the others

699
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:33,793
by reason of its
parasitic nature.

700
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:34,727
Heil Hitler.

701
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,095
Heil Hitler.

702
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,936
This is a private function.

703
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:53,879
(♪♪♪)

704
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:58,317
My name is Sasha Klein.

705
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,021
My parents come
from Ludmir, Poland.

706
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:04,390
I'm Jew.

707
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,026
You got something
to say to me?

708
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:08,294
Say it now.

709
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,629
Jewish scum!

710
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:11,797
(Grunts)

711
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,767
(Indistinct)

712
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:19,738
(Grunting)

713
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,946
(Screaming)

714
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:35,620
(Screaming and grunting)

715
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:48,134
(♪♪♪)

716
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,984
I would rather have killed them
all.

717
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:05,985
DAVID:
Why?

718
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:15,928
To show the world that as long
as my Meyer Lansky was around,

719
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:21,133
they could never do that to us,
again.

720
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:26,972
Never.

721
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:35,948
Rabbi Weiss calls the act
shameful and deplorable.

722
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:37,483
The rabbi says
there is no difference

723
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:40,719
between these so-called
Jewish gangsters

724
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,721
and the Nazi hoodlums
they attacked.

725
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:51,197
Kosch refuses to take my money.

726
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:56,835
People look away from me
and the kids

727
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,470
when we walk down the sidewalk.

728
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:03,909
Now they all know.

729
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,530
Paul, come.

730
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:25,831
Come.

731
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,768
Buddy, you too.

732
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:35,174
Leave your father alone.

733
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,042
He's got some thinking to do.

734
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:38,143
Buddy.

735
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:45,351
Listen to your mother.

736
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:55,294
(♪♪♪)

737
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,205
Mr. Lansky,

738
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:08,007
I'm Lieutenant Haffenden
of the P3 division

739
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,342
of Naval Intelligence.

740
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:13,078
As I'm sure you know,
the Germans are sabotaging,

741
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:16,181
and destroying our ships
all over the North Atlantic.

742
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:19,285
I've read the papers.
It's terrible.

743
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:22,221
The enemy is here on our shore.

744
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,055
It's only a matter of time

745
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:25,257
before there's an attack
on our soil.

746
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,259
We need to ferret out
German spies.

747
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:30,195
Like you, who's got a problem
with the Sicilians.

748
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:33,432
Because the Sicilians got
a problem with people like you,

749
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,833
the authorities.

750
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,268
The Mafia controls
the waterfront.

751
00:44:36,302 --> 00:44:39,171
Are you suggesting that
I'm affiliated with the Mafia?

752
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:42,041
I'm a businessman, Lieutenant.

753
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:44,176
LT. HAFFENDEN:
Of course.

754
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:47,079
I'll find your spies,

755
00:44:47,112 --> 00:44:49,148
but you got to do me a favor
first.

756
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,599
Mr. Luciano, State Department
has agreed to arrange

757
00:45:07,634 --> 00:45:09,268
for your release from prison.

758
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:13,272
Twenty four years left
on my sentence,

759
00:45:13,305 --> 00:45:15,841
14 of whom even eligible
for parole.

760
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:20,079
Meyer.

761
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:22,816
I know you would do the same
thing for me.

762
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:29,421
What can I do to help?

763
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:34,426
They need you to set up
a meeting with Joe Socks.

764
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,961
Joe Socks,

765
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:39,531
Joe Lanza, local 16975.

766
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,334
United Seafood Workers Union.

767
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:45,137
I'll arrange for your boys
to get their union cards

768
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,005
and you can begin
your operation.

769
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,142
I was the connection between
the U.S. and the waterfront.

770
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:52,611
There were German spies working
amongst us.

771
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:55,280
I extracted whatever
intelligence I could from them

772
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:57,182
on behalf of the feds.

773
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,251
The fate of the country
depended on us,

774
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,353
and they're looking
to lock me up?

775
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:03,155
God bless America.

776
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,027
LANSKY: (Voice-over) I had my
men on a dock hunting Germans

777
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,496
up and down the shore.

778
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,136
We root them out
and have ourselves

779
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:19,037
a friendly conversation

780
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:21,674
in the language them cocksuckers
understood only too well.

781
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,609
(Phone ringing)

782
00:46:26,612 --> 00:46:28,480
You got an address?

783
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:31,684
224 Main Street.

784
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:34,520
(Indistinct chatter)

785
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:40,959
Freeze, don't move.

786
00:46:40,993 --> 00:46:42,394
Don't move, you're under arrest.

787
00:46:43,663 --> 00:46:46,666
LANSKY: (Voice-over) We busted up the
whole German intelligence network.

788
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:48,967
Blew the cover
on a group of spies

789
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:52,471
moving artillery, bombs
and cash.

790
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:55,675
They were planning an enormous
attack on American soil,

791
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,476
but we stopped it.

792
00:46:58,678 --> 00:46:59,846
So, why would you defend
a country

793
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:02,514
whose government is devoted
to putting you behind bars?

794
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:05,484
I'm an American and a Jew.

795
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:08,721
The Germans wanted to destroy
both of those things.

796
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:11,490
So I wanted to destroy
the Germans.

797
00:47:11,523 --> 00:47:13,325
- And I did.
- OK. But why?

798
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,561
Why was it never
in the in the press?

799
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:18,530
They could never own up to
the fact that somebody like me

800
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:22,000
could be capable of doing
any good in this world?

801
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:25,037
See, I believe this world
is made of shades of gray.

802
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,206
It's never black or white.

803
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,008
So, you never felt compelled to
just set the record straight

804
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:32,211
and say, Meyer Lansky, patriot.

805
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:34,179
I think you found the title
of your book.

806
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:36,482
I'm asking the question.

807
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:39,051
I never felt the need back then.

808
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:40,452
Why?

809
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:44,323
It was currency between me
and the United States.

810
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:46,793
I assume that if I did favors
for the government,

811
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:48,594
they would always honor
my loyalty.

812
00:47:48,627 --> 00:47:49,729
And did they?

813
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:52,164
We haven't gotten to that part
of the story here David.

814
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:53,198
OK?

815
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:56,168
The United States,

816
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:59,438
are not who you think they are,
David.

817
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,441
You're the wandering Jew
just like Lucky said, right?

818
00:48:02,474 --> 00:48:05,745
That's me, the outsider
invited in from the cold

819
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:08,514
to warm my feet by the fire.

820
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:10,215
And then sent them
my way again.

821
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:11,250
Yeah.

822
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,656
You know how that feels,
don't you?

823
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,290
Of what? What?

824
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,259
To be an outsider.

825
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,560
Your father didn't die, David,

826
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:23,428
he walked out on you
and your family

827
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:26,532
and you felt like an outsider
ever since in this world.

828
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,503
Yeah.

829
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,105
(Lansky chuckles)

830
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:34,641
Look at us here.

831
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:38,110
Couple of outsiders sitting here
in a diner.

832
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:46,686
(indistinct chattering)

833
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:47,586
RAY:
Don't fucking lie.

834
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:48,420
(indistinct chattering)

835
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:49,388
RAY:
That's bullshit.

836
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:50,790
No.

837
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:52,825
Maureen, I am gonna ask you
one more fucking time,

838
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,159
who fucking snitched?

839
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:55,494
I don't fucking know.

840
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:56,261
I swear on my fucking,
I have no idea.

841
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:57,563
- That's bullshit.
- You okay?

842
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:58,497
Who the fuck is that?

843
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:59,131
David, please don't,
we're just talking.

844
00:48:59,164 --> 00:49:00,033
RAY:
Don't fucking lie.

845
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,634
I swear my fucking life,
I have no idea.

846
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:02,568
- You're shaking.
- I'm not shaky.

847
00:49:02,601 --> 00:49:03,535
Hey, take a hike, pal.

848
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,204
Hey, I've got a John fucking
Wayne here, huh?

849
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,875
Let me ask you a question, John.

850
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:09,842
Are you fucking her?

851
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:12,411
Jesus, Ray.

852
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:13,345
I don't think it is any
of your business, buddy.

853
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,882
I'll tell you
why is my fucking business

854
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:17,616
because she's got
a big fucking mouth.

855
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,585
- Fuck you.
- And if I can't trust her,

856
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:21,286
I can't trust any of her
fuck buddies either.

857
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,822
Don't disrespect her, okay?

858
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:26,325
You put your fucking bag down,
pal.

859
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:27,827
Ray, please don't do this.

860
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,161
Yeah, put your fucking bag-

861
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:32,264
God dammit.

862
00:49:32,297 --> 00:49:33,733
You're a fucking asshole Ray.

863
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:34,834
It's your fucking warning.

864
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:36,234
Keep your mouth shut.

865
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:43,442
MAUREEN:
He was busted for selling drugs.

866
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:44,610
Someone set him up.

867
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:51,216
I told a girlfriend of mine
I was in Miami.

868
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:52,517
She told him where I was.

869
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,657
So he showed up wanting to know
if I know who set him up.

870
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:01,126
Do you?

871
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:04,396
No.

872
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:12,604
We all make mistakes.

873
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,773
Ray was one of mine.

874
00:50:20,545 --> 00:50:22,849
Life is just full of shades
of grey.

875
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:32,792
(♪♪♪)

876
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:47,439
She likes it rough, huh?

877
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:51,911
Who did that to you?

878
00:50:51,944 --> 00:50:52,879
DAVID:
It's nothing.

879
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:53,946
Either you're going to tell me
who did this

880
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,414
or I'm going to find out.

881
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:02,454
All right, well, okay you know,
the woman that I've been...

882
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:05,925
Fucking?
I think that's the word for it.

883
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:09,896
Yeah, OK, well, I had to break
up a fight between her

884
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:12,564
- and her ex.
- (Lansky laughs)

885
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:14,667
I see.

886
00:51:14,701 --> 00:51:18,370
Well, I wish you luck with all
your future sparring endeavors.

887
00:51:18,403 --> 00:51:19,772
Thank you, nice.

888
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:22,709
LANSKY: My pleasure.
Next time hit him first.

889
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:24,644
Always hit him first.

890
00:51:26,578 --> 00:51:30,549
Mr. Lansky,
you chose the losing side.

891
00:51:30,582 --> 00:51:36,856
I'm a businessman,
I don't choose sides.

892
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,825
We chose opportunities.

893
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:41,894
Which is why I think we can make
a deal.

894
00:51:41,928 --> 00:51:43,963
DAVID: (Voice-over)
Salvatore Maranzano,

895
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:47,299
possible bosses
of organized crime in New York.

896
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,769
Bootlegging, racketeering,
narcotics.

897
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:51,570
He called himself Little Caesar.

898
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,876
I want to invest
in your corporate joints.

899
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:03,683
See, the thing is, I built my
business from the ground up

900
00:52:03,716 --> 00:52:07,319
and I prefer to keep it under
the same roof.

901
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:10,489
(Salvatore chuckles)

902
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:14,326
And frankly, Mr. Maranzano,
I don't need your money.

903
00:52:17,897 --> 00:52:23,468
Yeah, I don't give a shit,
how's that look?

904
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:24,971
What if I offer you
an opportunity

905
00:52:25,004 --> 00:52:28,373
to take Luciano's seat
in the council?

906
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:30,375
How you propose doing that?

907
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:33,612
You take Luciano out
and the seat's yours.

908
00:52:33,646 --> 00:52:34,981
He'll never see it coming
from you.

909
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,053
You walk out now

910
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,755
or we'll take you down
with the restaurant.

911
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:53,532
I have known Luciano
for a long time,

912
00:52:53,565 --> 00:52:56,769
since we were children.

913
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:59,071
He's much more than an associate
to me.

914
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:01,808
I respect that.

915
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:05,510
But there can only be one boss,
and that's me.

916
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:07,780
It's about business.

917
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:09,715
I think you should make
the right decision here

918
00:53:09,749 --> 00:53:11,416
and do the right thing.

919
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:12,551
We've got a search warrant.

920
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:15,087
Hey, nobody move.

921
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:16,454
Nobody move!
Hey!

922
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,589
What's all the commotion?

923
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:18,791
Go check it out, Marco.

924
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:25,998
Woah, woah, woah, calm down.
Put down your guns.

925
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:28,433
My boss is inside,
you go talk to him.

926
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:29,702
He knows your Captain.
It's going to be OK.

927
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:31,469
Everything's all right.
Hey.

928
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,108
- (Gunshot)
- (Grunting)

929
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:38,678
What took you so long?

930
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:39,712
Lot of stairs.

931
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:40,980
(Gunshots in distance)

932
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,716
Double crossing prick.

933
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:44,951
Make him feel it, Benny.

934
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:46,484
No.

935
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:47,385
- Come here.
- No.

936
00:53:47,419 --> 00:53:50,122
(Groaning)

937
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:53,092
Look at me, look at me
when you fucking die,

938
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,994
you double crossing
sack of shit.

939
00:53:58,563 --> 00:53:59,866
Oh, that's it.

940
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:03,836
Here you go.

941
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:15,181
They're going to come after us
now,

942
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,183
all of them with everything
they've got.

943
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:20,653
We'll already be in control
by then.

944
00:54:20,686 --> 00:54:22,655
I'm grateful for your loyalty,
Meyer.

945
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:28,094
I want a seat at the council,
Charlie.

946
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,695
It's a new era,

947
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,664
what matters is
how I run my business,

948
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:33,431
not the fact that I'm a Jew.

949
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:35,001
You know, if it were up to me...

950
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:36,802
We'll be your executors,

951
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:39,005
seen the numbers
we're doing in Saratoga.

952
00:54:39,038 --> 00:54:41,674
No one runs an operation
like I do.

953
00:54:41,707 --> 00:54:46,478
I got the best carpet joints,
Upstate, Jersey, Florida.

954
00:54:46,511 --> 00:54:48,613
No, you don't gotta justify it
to me, Meyer.

955
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:50,850
Plus, I got the muscle to back
all of 'em.

956
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:55,121
And the revenue,
the revenue speaks for itself.

957
00:54:55,154 --> 00:55:01,559
I run it like a business
and Ford Motors, Coca-Cola.

958
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,663
You know, like U.S. Steel.

959
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:11,170
I'll tell you what,

960
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:12,972
I'll do what I can
to convince the council

961
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,506
that you deserve a spot.

962
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:15,507
Hmm.

963
00:55:17,777 --> 00:55:18,711
What about Benny?

964
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:20,980
Benny.

965
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:23,115
Benny's handling California
for us?

966
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,124
Why are you still awake?

967
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:34,694
How the hell
am I supposed to sleep?

968
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:36,095
Do you know what time it is?

969
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:38,230
Yeah, says the man who comes
and goes at all hours.

970
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:40,700
Mind your business.

971
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:41,901
Was out working.

972
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:43,703
Oh work.

973
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:45,537
It's always work with you.

974
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,707
Take a look around you.

975
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,142
All this shit.

976
00:55:50,176 --> 00:55:52,845
Where do you think
it comes from, huh?

977
00:55:52,878 --> 00:55:55,781
Maybe try showing
a little gratitude for once.

978
00:55:55,815 --> 00:55:58,184
Gratitude?

979
00:55:58,217 --> 00:56:02,520
The hell with gratitude,
you're a criminal.

980
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:03,122
Come on.

981
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,690
(Grunting)

982
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:07,793
(Taking deep breaths)

983
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:15,067
What happened to you?

984
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:16,669
You're pathetic.

985
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,310
You think the neighbors
don't talk to you because of me?

986
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:27,246
I see in your eyes
what you do at night.

987
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:30,716
Who do you think you are
coming into our home

988
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,818
pretending to be a good man,
huh?

989
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:34,954
A father?

990
00:56:34,987 --> 00:56:37,622
You think you're helping him?

991
00:56:37,656 --> 00:56:38,290
(Grunts)

992
00:56:38,324 --> 00:56:40,960
Shut your mouth!

993
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:43,062
It's your fault.

994
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:45,765
It's your fault he's a cripple.

995
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:48,000
It's because of you,
it's all because of you!

996
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,671
(Sobs)

997
00:56:52,705 --> 00:56:56,008
It's called "judgement",
it's punishment

998
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,076
for what you've done

999
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,712
and how you live your life,
Meyer.

1000
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,817
(Sobs)

1001
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:08,354
God is watching.

1002
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:12,792
He's watching,
he's watching you, I know he is.

1003
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:15,761
(Sobbing)

1004
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,939
DAVID:
You believe that?

1005
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,140
Believe what?

1006
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:33,212
We get judged and punished
for the way we live our lives.

1007
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:37,615
The choices we make
that's what defines us.

1008
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,885
I don't question the choices
I make.

1009
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:41,220
Never?

1010
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:43,222
I get the feeling sometimes
you don't question

1011
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,691
the choices you make either.

1012
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:47,660
Okay, let's talk
about those choices.

1013
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:51,630
Tell me about Murder, Inc.

1014
00:57:51,664 --> 00:57:53,833
After Maranzano,

1015
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:57,369
we needed the muscle
to consolidate our power.

1016
00:57:57,403 --> 00:57:59,604
I had the right people to do it.

1017
00:58:01,373 --> 00:58:02,607
Bingo.

1018
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:07,813
LANSKY: (Voice-over) A group of
nice Jewish and Italian boys,

1019
00:58:07,847 --> 00:58:10,716
you know, the kind a girl wants
to bring home to her mother.

1020
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:12,818
Always willing to lend a hand.

1021
00:58:12,852 --> 00:58:15,888
(Grunting & yelling)

1022
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:19,758
DAVID: (Voice-over) "Murder, Inc.",
that's what they called them.

1023
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:23,662
There was Abe "Kid Twist" Reles,
"Tick-Tock" Tannenbaum,

1024
00:58:23,696 --> 00:58:27,399
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter,
an army of enforcers,

1025
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:30,769
hired assassins,
a thousand hits between 'em,

1026
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:33,772
they put contract killers
on payroll.

1027
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:35,441
There were no rules
on how to kill.

1028
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:39,945
As long as you got it done,
you got paid.

1029
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:43,749
Most were shot, stabbed,
strangled, drowned, burned,

1030
00:58:43,782 --> 00:58:48,254
buried alive, left to bleed dry,
all of 'em unrepentant,

1031
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:50,823
cold-blooded killers.

1032
00:58:50,856 --> 00:58:53,692
And Lansky was their general.

1033
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:56,362
Through sheer determination
and fearlessness,

1034
00:58:56,395 --> 00:58:59,031
Lansky finally got
what he wanted,

1035
00:58:59,064 --> 00:59:01,734
a seat at the table
sitting right beside guys like

1036
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:06,305
Joe Bonnano, Frank Costello,
Al Capone, Italian...

1037
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,340
- Meyer.
- To Meyer.

1038
00:59:08,374 --> 00:59:10,476
DAVID: (Voice-over) Jewish and Irish
mob bosses from across America,

1039
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,878
together, they formed
the largest organization

1040
00:59:12,912 --> 00:59:15,047
of crime the world
has ever known,

1041
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,882
the National Crime Syndicate.

1042
00:59:30,396 --> 00:59:32,097
I don't know understand

1043
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:33,265
when they're investigating
Lansky,

1044
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,801
no one bothered to look
at the old files.

1045
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:38,804
Hey, we're talking 40 years
of transcripts, depositions,

1046
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:40,806
surveillance reports.

1047
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,474
That's a lot of material.

1048
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:45,911
Frank, look at this.

1049
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:47,213
It says he's still alive.

1050
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:54,820
Mr. Sims, I'm Special Agent
Frank Rivers with the FBI.

1051
00:59:56,989 --> 00:59:58,791
(Grunts)

1052
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:01,093
I'd like to talk to you
about your association

1053
01:00:01,126 --> 01:00:02,328
with Meyer Lansky.

1054
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:05,064
Never heard of him.

1055
01:00:05,097 --> 01:00:07,533
I can make your life in here
a whole lot easier, you know.

1056
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,835
I'm gonna die in here.

1057
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:11,437
The hell are you gonna do
for me?

1058
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,105
Get me fresh soup?

1059
01:00:13,138 --> 01:00:16,375
Well, Lansky sent you on a job
and you got caught

1060
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:19,078
and right now he's uh...

1061
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:21,013
he's having
a pretty comfortable life,

1062
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:22,414
and you're stuck in here.

1063
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:24,350
You gonna pop him for me,
are you?

1064
01:00:24,383 --> 01:00:25,851
I can put him away.

1065
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:27,486
Make it so his life's
not a whole lot different

1066
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,421
from yours.

1067
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:31,890
I'm looking for his money.

1068
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:34,960
He started stashing it away
back in the Murder, Inc. days.

1069
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:37,096
So who was keeping the books
back then?

1070
01:00:37,129 --> 01:00:39,231
- No money.
- What do you mean no money?

1071
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:41,267
There's no money in murder.

1072
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:47,072
It wasn't a sustainable business
not like a casino.

1073
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,207
There was money.

1074
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,942
Maybe he just didn't tell you
about it,

1075
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:52,011
he was stuffing the walls
with it.

1076
01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:53,012
(Spits)

1077
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:58,150
Then go ask the walls.

1078
01:00:58,183 --> 01:01:01,287
You listen to me,
you piece of shit.

1079
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,190
The only reason you're in here
is because of that asshole.

1080
01:01:05,224 --> 01:01:07,993
Well, now you can suffer
the rest of your time in here

1081
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,461
because of him, too.

1082
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,399
Geneva.

1083
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:15,601
Geneva?

1084
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:19,171
He had a money manager
in Geneva.

1085
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:42,928
What are you doing with that?

1086
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,335
What are you doing with it?

1087
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:52,037
(Shushes)

1088
01:01:53,038 --> 01:01:54,540
FBI.

1089
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,212
DAVID: Just tell...
just tell me, tell me.

1090
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:01,380
Tell me, it's okay.

1091
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:03,215
What... what is it?

1092
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:05,184
Ray turned state's
evidence,

1093
01:02:05,217 --> 01:02:07,986
he made a deal with the Feds,
they reduced his sentence.

1094
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,221
And he named me
as one of his partners

1095
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:10,456
in his drug operation.

1096
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:12,324
So the Feds came to me
and they said that

1097
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:14,360
I would go to prison
if I didn't cooperate.

1098
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:15,594
Okay.

1099
01:02:18,163 --> 01:02:19,164
So how?

1100
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,499
It's "cooperate"
that's the word that they used?

1101
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,201
Get close to you.

1102
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:28,207
Okay, and then?

1103
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,876
Feed them information
from your files.

1104
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:37,684
Listen, David, everything
that's been happening between us

1105
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:39,652
is real.

1106
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:42,020
- You have to trust me.
- Trust you, trust you?

1107
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,122
I know that sounds ridiculous.

1108
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,990
I have a family.

1109
01:02:48,026 --> 01:02:50,062
(Scoffs)

1110
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:53,700
(Takes deep breaths)

1111
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:57,369
What did... did you...

1112
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:58,036
What'd you give 'em?

1113
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,372
Everything I could remember.

1114
01:03:00,406 --> 01:03:05,978
The name of associates
and accomplices.

1115
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:07,446
They wanted me to write
everything down

1116
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:09,148
and give it to them
and that's what I did.

1117
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:11,483
Okay, what else did they want?

1118
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:13,653
What else they wanted
apart from names?

1119
01:03:13,686 --> 01:03:15,421
They said you might have
information on money

1120
01:03:15,454 --> 01:03:17,022
that Lansky laundered years ago.

1121
01:03:17,055 --> 01:03:19,091
Money.

1122
01:03:19,124 --> 01:03:20,125
(Scoffs)

1123
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:29,134
(♪♪♪)

1124
01:03:29,168 --> 01:03:31,937
Oh.

1125
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,981
(Sobs)

1126
01:03:43,015 --> 01:03:52,725
(♪♪♪)

1127
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:20,486
(Muffled screaming)

1128
01:04:32,197 --> 01:04:34,032
DAVID: (On tape)
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

1129
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:35,534
<i>What are you doing with it?</i>

1130
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,303
(Maureen shushes)

1131
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:41,406
MAUREEN: (On tape)
<i>FBI.</i>

1132
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,642
<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

1133
01:04:42,675 --> 01:04:52,584
(♪♪♪)

1134
01:04:57,256 --> 01:04:59,091
(Sniffles)

1135
01:05:03,128 --> 01:05:05,765
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

1136
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,211
Okay, here we are again.

1137
01:05:39,197 --> 01:05:41,233
- (Knocking on door)
- Morning.

1138
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:43,302
Can I help you?

1139
01:05:43,335 --> 01:05:45,638
Special Agent Frank Rivers,
with the FBI.

1140
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:48,273
We're looking for a guest
of the hotel, Miss Duffy.

1141
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:50,475
She's in room 1-4-6.

1142
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:52,244
Miss Duffy's not here.

1143
01:05:52,277 --> 01:05:54,146
Well, I'd like to look
in her room if I could.

1144
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:55,147
Suit yourself.

1145
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,349
But you're not going to find
anything there.

1146
01:05:57,382 --> 01:05:59,886
- Room's empty.
- Empty?

1147
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:01,854
Miss Duffy checked out
late last night.

1148
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:07,727
How did you evade the Feds,

1149
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,696
like how did you
and your business associates

1150
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:12,598
become so successful under
the scrutiny of the government?

1151
01:06:12,632 --> 01:06:15,334
- Why are you whispering?
- Hmm.

1152
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:18,370
I can hardly hear you.

1153
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:23,275
How did you and your associates
like that were very successful

1154
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:24,576
under the scrutiny
of the government?

1155
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,912
How did you do that?

1156
01:06:25,945 --> 01:06:28,513
The way any legitimate
company does.

1157
01:06:28,547 --> 01:06:32,484
We were making more money
than some Fortune 500 companies.

1158
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:35,554
We got assets to manage
and we had the best talent

1159
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:36,889
to manage them.

1160
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,590
You okay, David?

1161
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:41,526
You seem a little white
around the gills this morning.

1162
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,695
It was one of those nights.

1163
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:43,595
Not another one.

1164
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,465
(Both laugh)

1165
01:06:46,498 --> 01:06:49,534
Okay, so um, how'd you go about
doing all of that,

1166
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:51,570
changing your
business practices?

1167
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,572
'Cause I think that's what
everyone wants to know.

1168
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:56,676
I taught my associates that
there are benefits,

1169
01:06:56,709 --> 01:07:01,346
cost benefit of keeping a guy
that owes you money alive

1170
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,183
instead of goons, I said,
we ought to send accountants.

1171
01:07:05,217 --> 01:07:08,921
Additional sum for
the cash reserve and profit

1172
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:13,191
should be passed along
to be put in the credit column

1173
01:07:13,225 --> 01:07:14,459
of the ledger.

1174
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:15,862
There's a reason
I dropped out of school

1175
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:17,596
when I was 12.

1176
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:18,530
Let him talk.

1177
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:19,498
That guy made more money

1178
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:21,400
for Luciano
than all your tweeds combined.

1179
01:07:21,433 --> 01:07:22,467
- Come on.
- Uh.

1180
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,636
Any questions?

1181
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:26,338
In the early days,
a man owed you money,

1182
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:29,709
you would send goons
to break his body apart,

1183
01:07:29,742 --> 01:07:32,745
and if he couldn't pay,
he'd find an unfortunate end.

1184
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:35,715
Now, rather than kill the guy,
we ordered him,

1185
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:37,582
crunch the numbers,

1186
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:39,819
make sure his business
turns a profit.

1187
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:43,255
Now, Joe Schmo belongs to us.

1188
01:07:43,288 --> 01:07:44,556
We own him.

1189
01:07:44,589 --> 01:07:53,565
(♪♪♪)

1190
01:07:53,598 --> 01:07:55,467
Why don't we go for a walk,
David?

1191
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,637
You look like
you could use some air.

1192
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,271
Come.

1193
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:07,412
Optimizing our resources,
restructuring our operations.

1194
01:08:07,446 --> 01:08:10,016
This was a new world
for our associates.

1195
01:08:10,049 --> 01:08:12,584
I think it was Henry Ford
that said that,

1196
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,554
"Business that makes nothing
but money is a poor business."

1197
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:18,390
Gambling and casinos
are to entertainment,

1198
01:08:18,423 --> 01:08:21,728
what Ford's automobile
was to transportation.

1199
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:22,862
For some business,

1200
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:24,463
it's to realize
as the toss of the dice.

1201
01:08:24,496 --> 01:08:25,865
We catered to that need.

1202
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:28,300
Okay, you wake up
in the morning,

1203
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:31,037
there's car in your driveway,
you didn't make a product.

1204
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,371
(Laughs)

1205
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,475
Henry Ford's product
wasn't the car.

1206
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:39,611
It was the freedom
the car gave to people.

1207
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:41,948
Freedom is what people wanted.

1208
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:44,784
Our product wasn't gambling
or the casinos.

1209
01:08:44,817 --> 01:08:47,385
It was the world of excitement
and thrills.

1210
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:49,354
We built have resorts
in this country,

1211
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:53,291
created thousands of jobs,
supported families.

1212
01:08:53,325 --> 01:08:54,994
It was a product.

1213
01:08:55,027 --> 01:08:56,662
That's why
it's all legalized now,

1214
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:59,766
why the government
has its finger in the pie.

1215
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:02,802
It was too valuable a product
to leave to criminals.

1216
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:13,880
David, where's your car?

1217
01:09:13,913 --> 01:09:15,547
It's over there.

1218
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:21,386
This fucker is following us.

1219
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:24,824
Can you fucking believe it?

1220
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:27,459
See if you could turn off
some place,

1221
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:29,361
make the first turn off you can.

1222
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:33,900
DAVID:
Here?

1223
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:35,600
Right over here.

1224
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:39,071
Son of a bitch.

1225
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:49,048
(♪♪♪)

1226
01:09:57,924 --> 01:09:58,925
(Sighing)

1227
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,794
Right, so who is that?

1228
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:03,796
I thought maybe
you could tell me.

1229
01:10:06,098 --> 01:10:08,333
I... I don't know.

1230
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:20,847
When you lose your money,
you lose nothing.

1231
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,083
When you lose your health,
you lose something.

1232
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:27,086
When you lose your character,
you lose everything.

1233
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:31,389
Remember that.

1234
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:41,133
(♪♪♪)

1235
01:11:11,697 --> 01:11:14,000
Hey, woman in the room,
you seen her?

1236
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:16,903
- She checked out.
- She checked out?

1237
01:11:16,936 --> 01:11:18,004
What's going on here?

1238
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,105
I don't want any trouble.

1239
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:22,842
I'm not giving you any trouble.

1240
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:26,913
The Do Not Disturb sign has been
on your door for a week.

1241
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:28,714
Okay, well, let's keep it
that way, alright?

1242
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:31,684
I'll pay you extra,
you let no one in my room.

1243
01:11:31,717 --> 01:11:32,818
Fine.

1244
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:56,242
Let's talk about the shitstorm
of trouble you're in, Mr. Stone.

1245
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:57,810
Show him the pictures, Greg.

1246
01:11:59,577 --> 01:12:00,947
This must have been fun, huh?

1247
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,016
Get a little taste of that.

1248
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,550
You have fun taking these?

1249
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,352
Did you have fun taking them?

1250
01:12:06,385 --> 01:12:07,219
Meyer Lansky has
over $300 million.

1251
01:12:07,253 --> 01:12:07,653
Why are you...
why are showing me this?

1252
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:08,821
Listen to me.

1253
01:12:08,854 --> 01:12:12,058
Lansky has over $300 million
squirreled away somewhere.

1254
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:12,892
The government wants it

1255
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:14,994
and we want your help
finding it.

1256
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:17,730
I can't, I can't... I...

1257
01:12:17,763 --> 01:12:20,132
Now we could let it slip
to Mr. Lansky that

1258
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:24,003
you've been sharing his secrets
with an FBI informant.

1259
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:26,238
That's not gonna go well
for you.

1260
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:30,076
Look, we don't wanna go down
that road if we don't have to.

1261
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:32,510
We know you're just a writer
who was looking for a story

1262
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:34,013
who had the misfortune
to stumble into

1263
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:37,984
a decades-long investigation
into Lansky and Associates.

1264
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:41,988
So we're willing to offer you
a financial incentive,

1265
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:44,090
we'll make you a paid informant.

1266
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:46,692
We'll give you $150,000.

1267
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:48,861
Now that'll go a long way
to take care of your family

1268
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:49,428
- and your money problems.
- I don't have any...

1269
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:50,595
I don't need your money.

1270
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:52,665
David, we've been listening.

1271
01:12:52,698 --> 01:12:55,600
You help us
or Lansky gets to you first.

1272
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:57,870
Now we can offer you
and your family protection

1273
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,537
and the money.

1274
01:12:59,571 --> 01:13:02,108
The way I see it,
you don't have a choice.

1275
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:04,076
I'm gonna give you
my number here.

1276
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,712
You call us from a payphone
when you got something.

1277
01:13:08,948 --> 01:13:10,582
Do the right thing here, David.

1278
01:13:30,602 --> 01:13:33,239
You heard the joke about
this rabbi who got hit by a car,

1279
01:13:33,272 --> 01:13:35,908
falls down,
the emergency ambulance comes,

1280
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:39,011
rabbi's laying on the floor,
the emergency worker runs over,

1281
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:41,881
says, "Rabbi, Rabbi,
are you okay?"

1282
01:13:41,914 --> 01:13:45,017
The rabbi looks up at him
and he says, "I make a living."

1283
01:13:46,752 --> 01:13:48,254
(Laughing)

1284
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,655
Okay, go ahead.

1285
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:51,657
A little levity here,
you know.

1286
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:56,028
Money, must have been pouring in
by now, right?

1287
01:13:56,062 --> 01:13:57,263
That's right.

1288
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:05,704
CUBAN EMISSARY: The gaming
business in Cuba is no good,

1289
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:09,008
it's a free-for-all,
no regulations.

1290
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,844
(Speaks Spanish)

1291
01:14:11,877 --> 01:14:13,646
These men are making millions.

1292
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:19,218
Gambling in Cuba will soon be
under our control again.

1293
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:22,188
And President Batista
wants you to oversee it,

1294
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:23,656
Mr. Lansky.

1295
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:26,692
All of it.

1296
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:29,662
I appreciate the opportunity.

1297
01:14:29,695 --> 01:14:33,265
I always felt Cuba,
a land of enterprise.

1298
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:38,003
In America,
you might be an outlaw,

1299
01:14:38,037 --> 01:14:41,407
but in Cuba
you are on the inside.

1300
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,376
(Lyrics in Spanish)

1301
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:50,249
(♪♪♪)

1302
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:52,218
You were making what,
10 million?

1303
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:56,021
Turned to 20,
and then 30 million.

1304
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:57,790
I was the biggest
casino operator

1305
01:14:57,823 --> 01:14:59,825
this country had ever seen.

1306
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:02,261
You were legitimate, yeah,
you were above board.

1307
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:04,964
You had your license,
machines weren't rigged.

1308
01:15:04,997 --> 01:15:06,398
Never.

1309
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:08,701
But they still consider you
part of the underworld.

1310
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:10,903
(Lyrics in Spanish)

1311
01:15:10,936 --> 01:15:13,873
We weren't the underworld.

1312
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:16,675
We were the overworld.

1313
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:24,016
(Lyrics in Spanish)

1314
01:15:25,718 --> 01:15:28,087
Go back to sleep.

1315
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,896
DAVID: (Voice-over) When Batista gave
Lansky control over Cuba's casinos,

1316
01:15:36,929 --> 01:15:39,298
Lansky turned the country
into an international playground

1317
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:41,867
for gamblers
and pleasure-seekers.

1318
01:15:41,901 --> 01:15:44,236
Criminal empire
outside the U.S.,

1319
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:46,805
it couldn't be touched
by law enforcement.

1320
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:48,774
The National Crime Syndicate
now owned

1321
01:15:48,807 --> 01:15:51,343
the biggest gambling corporation
in the world.

1322
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:52,912
And Lansky was the CEO.

1323
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,317
Hey kid.

1324
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:03,722
How you doin', huh?

1325
01:16:03,756 --> 01:16:05,357
How was the trip?

1326
01:16:05,391 --> 01:16:06,792
Fine.

1327
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:11,030
How you doin', beautiful?

1328
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:12,131
Huh?

1329
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:13,299
Come on, let's go.

1330
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:14,466
You wanna go to the room?

1331
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,301
Let's head in.

1332
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:16,869
Come on.

1333
01:16:16,902 --> 01:16:18,771
(♪♪♪)

1334
01:16:26,946 --> 01:16:29,815
(Indistinct chatter)

1335
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:45,497
(Cheering)

1336
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,439
YOUNG LANSKY:
You put the nickel in.

1337
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:54,807
Just try.

1338
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,876
Right here?

1339
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,412
Pull that lever hard.

1340
01:17:00,446 --> 01:17:06,485
State-of-the-art slot and blend,
silent bells, double jackpots

1341
01:17:06,518 --> 01:17:09,555
and then the guys rig 'em
so they better our odds.

1342
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:11,357
Haven't I talked to you
about that?

1343
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,524
About what?

1344
01:17:14,893 --> 01:17:16,562
I don't want
the machines rigged.

1345
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:19,898
Every casino in this town
rigs their machines.

1346
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:23,135
I'm not every casino.

1347
01:17:23,168 --> 01:17:24,336
Yes, sir.

1348
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:29,275
Come on, go again.

1349
01:17:37,283 --> 01:17:39,285
I'll be right back, Buddy.

1350
01:17:39,318 --> 01:17:40,853
Keep at it.

1351
01:17:40,886 --> 01:17:42,855
You, watch the kid.

1352
01:17:42,888 --> 01:17:52,798
(♪♪♪)

1353
01:17:58,037 --> 01:17:59,938
Mr. Yariv.

1354
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:02,241
Mr. Lansky,
thank you for seeing me.

1355
01:18:02,274 --> 01:18:04,176
Welcome to the Colonial,
Mr. Yariv.

1356
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,313
Please.

1357
01:18:07,346 --> 01:18:09,348
Thank you.

1358
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:11,984
How can I help you?

1359
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:15,387
Mr. Lansky, I'm here on behalf
of Golda Meir.

1360
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:18,023
As you know, our people
have been slaughtered in Germany

1361
01:18:18,057 --> 01:18:19,258
and across Europe.

1362
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,492
The Jewish settlement
in Palestine

1363
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:21,960
has been hard at work.

1364
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:22,995
You need money?

1365
01:18:23,028 --> 01:18:24,296
Yes.

1366
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:26,465
To purchase weapons.

1367
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,467
We are fighting for
the future state of Israel

1368
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,170
and for the survival of
the Jewish people, Mr. Lansky.

1369
01:18:31,203 --> 01:18:34,940
Fighting, as in killing.

1370
01:18:43,048 --> 01:18:46,118
We will do whatever it takes,
Mr. Lansky.

1371
01:18:48,954 --> 01:18:52,391
You tell Miss Meir that

1372
01:18:52,424 --> 01:18:55,894
she has Meyer Lansky's support.

1373
01:18:55,928 --> 01:18:58,897
I'd be happy to contribute
in any way.

1374
01:18:58,931 --> 01:19:01,934
And I'm sure my colleagues here
share my feelings

1375
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:03,369
for the state of Israel.

1376
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:08,006
Well, how much do you have
on you.

1377
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,677
It's the weekend take.

1378
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,077
Give it to him.

1379
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:25,658
Mr. Yariv here
is taking donations

1380
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:27,259
for the state of Israel.

1381
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:28,661
I am Italian.

1382
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,520
I'll make arrangements for more.

1383
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:57,122
On behalf of Golda Meir
and the Israeli people,

1384
01:19:57,156 --> 01:19:59,057
we are grateful.

1385
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,660
And we will not soon forget.

1386
01:20:12,004 --> 01:20:14,306
If you need any weapons
or ammunition,

1387
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:16,074
you let me know.

1388
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:17,677
We hope you enjoy your stay
with us.

1389
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,078
Oh, I'm not staying
at the Colonial.

1390
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,582
Next time, I hope.

1391
01:20:38,564 --> 01:20:41,233
We're hearing things, Meyer,
about Ben.

1392
01:20:42,802 --> 01:20:45,270
What kind of things?

1393
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,606
That he's out of control,
kicking heads in,

1394
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,108
dating movie stars.

1395
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:52,578
He's lost his focus, Meyer.

1396
01:20:52,611 --> 01:20:55,214
We gave him California,
we gave him Vegas,

1397
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:58,050
all's we get in return is grief.

1398
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,786
I'll talk to him.

1399
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:01,688
Envelopes are coming back
lighter.

1400
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:06,291
Listen,
Lucky ain't happy, Meyer.

1401
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:13,065
You know, it ain't easy for us
coming to you like this

1402
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:15,100
not gonna shout Ben.

1403
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:19,238
I said I'll talk to him.

1404
01:21:31,718 --> 01:21:35,420
So what are you gonna do
with your winnings, huh?

1405
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:40,292
Buy mom a new fur coat,
just like you always do.

1406
01:21:40,325 --> 01:21:43,595
Your mother... your mother,
she's got plenty of fur coats.

1407
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:46,733
I'm gonna be just like you.

1408
01:21:46,766 --> 01:21:49,334
I'm gonna get my wife
fur coats, too.

1409
01:21:54,774 --> 01:21:57,209
Or you can be whatever
you wanna be.

1410
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:02,047
You don't wanna be like me.

1411
01:22:09,756 --> 01:22:11,390
Why?

1412
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,229
You just don't.

1413
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:22,401
(Takes deep breath)

1414
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:32,177
I love you, you know that,
right?

1415
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:34,413
I love you, too.

1416
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,831
I never wanted my children
to follow in my footsteps.

1417
01:22:51,864 --> 01:22:53,766
You know, I think about it
all the time.

1418
01:22:57,837 --> 01:23:01,841
My kids see me as a...
a man who tries his best

1419
01:23:01,874 --> 01:23:04,509
or... or some failure?

1420
01:23:04,543 --> 01:23:06,913
It's complicated.

1421
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:09,816
Marriage, children,
you did your best.

1422
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:12,217
(Scoffs)

1423
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,186
I trust you, David.

1424
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,188
You're gonna write
a hell of a book.

1425
01:23:22,662 --> 01:23:24,196
Vegas.

1426
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:26,498
Vegas, Flamingo.

1427
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,337
LANSKY: (Voice-over) We built that
town, a paradise,

1428
01:23:32,371 --> 01:23:35,307
but for us it turned out to be
our worst nightmare.

1429
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,910

1430
01:23:53,525 --> 01:23:54,526
(Grunts)

1431
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:55,762
- Yeah.
- Benny.

1432
01:23:55,795 --> 01:23:57,529
YOUNG BEN: (On phone)
<i>Meyer, that you?</i>

1433
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:01,266
What time is it?

1434
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:03,703
It's a quarter after 2:00 there.

1435
01:24:03,736 --> 01:24:04,904
Look, why don't you
hop on a flight

1436
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:06,639
and head out here?

1437
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:09,241
Oh, hey pal, listen,
I'd love to,

1438
01:24:09,274 --> 01:24:10,777
but you know, Ginny's
got friends in town, right?

1439
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:13,445
So probably not for me.

1440
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:18,751
Hey, I gotta tell you,
the women in this town, man.

1441
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:20,318
(Laughs)

1442
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,888
Meyer, you'd go crazy.

1443
01:24:21,921 --> 01:24:23,956
I'm happy things are good
for you, Ben,

1444
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:26,391
but unfortunately, we have to
talk about something

1445
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,226
not so pleasant.

1446
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,327
Well, what is it?

1447
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:30,897
It's our investors.

1448
01:24:32,497 --> 01:24:33,833
- They're not happy.
- What do you mean?

1449
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:35,467
Is there...
did they tell you that?

1450
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,703
YOUNG LANSKY: (On phone)
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

1451
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:41,473
The materials are overpriced,
the construction is delayed.

1452
01:24:41,506 --> 01:24:43,810
YOUNG BEN: (On phone) <i>Do you know how
many people are undertaking this town?</i>

1453
01:24:43,843 --> 01:24:45,945
I can't screw in a light bulb
without a city official

1454
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:47,880
and he's goddamn maid
coming for a handout.

1455
01:24:47,914 --> 01:24:49,949
- That's the deal.
- <i>The accounting is sloppy, Ben</i>

1456
01:24:49,982 --> 01:24:51,851
and sloppy accounting
leads to concern.

1457
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:53,251
Do me a favor.

1458
01:24:53,285 --> 01:24:55,454
Remind them that
we own 66% of this casino,

1459
01:24:55,487 --> 01:24:57,757
which means we get to decide
who gets to be concerned.

1460
01:24:57,790 --> 01:25:00,625
66% of nothing is nothing.

1461
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,628
We have to put money back in
to cover the cash flow problem.

1462
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:09,601
Were you planning on talking
to me about this?

1463
01:25:09,635 --> 01:25:11,536
Of course.

1464
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,939
Of course, I mean
what'd you think

1465
01:25:12,972 --> 01:25:16,408
I wasn't gonna have that
conversation with you?

1466
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:19,544
How much are we talking about,
Ben?

1467
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:20,680
Half a million.

1468
01:25:22,547 --> 01:25:24,984
Maybe another three
just to get us

1469
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:26,485
through a few months.

1470
01:25:29,956 --> 01:25:31,556
I'll turn it around, Meyer.

1471
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:35,795
I know you will, Ben.

1472
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:37,697
That's what I told Lucky.

1473
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:43,870
I'm not gonna let you down,
I swear.

1474
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:45,270
I know, Ben.

1475
01:25:54,013 --> 01:25:56,481
You're listening to my calls?

1476
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:57,650
He's a bum.

1477
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:03,355
He's a bum and you know it.

1478
01:26:03,388 --> 01:26:05,323
YOUNG LANSKY:
It's not your concern, Anne.

1479
01:26:05,357 --> 01:26:07,093
He's gonna get you killed.

1480
01:26:07,126 --> 01:26:09,628
They'll kill you both.

1481
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:10,797
Bang, bang.

1482
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:14,934
Goodbye, Meyer Lansky.

1483
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,601
May he rest in peace.

1484
01:26:18,104 --> 01:26:21,406
Father.

1485
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:23,375
Husband.

1486
01:26:23,408 --> 01:26:24,710
Murderer.

1487
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:27,947
- Stay out of this.
- How about I jump, huh?

1488
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,915
Right off this balcony
and save you all that trouble.

1489
01:26:28,948 --> 01:26:31,717
Don't be ridiculous.

1490
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:32,919
Come on.

1491
01:26:32,952 --> 01:26:35,520
Would make your day.

1492
01:26:35,554 --> 01:26:38,825
Don't pretend like you care
for my well-being.

1493
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:44,563
All you care for is your money.

1494
01:26:44,596 --> 01:26:47,566
It's your money,
money, money, money, money.

1495
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:48,466
- Your money.
- Enough!

1496
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,870
- (Grunting)
- No!

1497
01:26:50,903 --> 01:26:53,605
You murderer, you're a murderer!

1498
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:55,107
Get off!
Liar!

1499
01:26:55,141 --> 01:26:58,077
(Grunting)

1500
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,380
Get off me!

1501
01:27:02,414 --> 01:27:04,016
No!

1502
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,018
- (Grunting)
- Hey, call an ambulance.

1503
01:27:06,052 --> 01:27:07,552
- No, Meyer!
- It's my wife.

1504
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:09,088
- No, Meyer.
- She's hysterical.

1505
01:27:09,121 --> 01:27:10,455
No!

1506
01:27:10,488 --> 01:27:13,592
- Meyer!
- (Indistinct speech)

1507
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:15,761
Just get a doctor here now!

Meyer, oy.

1514
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:10,582
Look at this place.

1515
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:12,550
Nice, hmm.

1516
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,186
(Laughs)

1517
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:15,688
Are you kidding me?

1518
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:17,589
You're the king
of the goddamn domain.

1519
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:20,059
I'll tell you something, too.

1520
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,728
It'll be little different
down here.

1521
01:28:22,762 --> 01:28:23,528
How's your flight?

1522
01:28:23,561 --> 01:28:26,999
Ah, forget about that.

1523
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:29,769
Real question is, what do
we got lined up for tonight?

1524
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:31,938
Hmm.

1525
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:33,839
Oh, boy.

1526
01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:35,607
(Laughs)

1527
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,679
Things have changed, Ben.

1528
01:28:39,712 --> 01:28:42,882
Look around you.

1529
01:28:42,915 --> 01:28:47,086
There's too much money at stake
to be fucking around.

1530
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,553
We're not kids anymore.

1531
01:28:48,586 --> 01:28:49,689
Yeah.

1532
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:53,192
You're right.

1533
01:28:53,225 --> 01:28:54,961
I can't keep defending you.

1534
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:59,198
Especially if you don't show
any results.

1535
01:28:59,231 --> 01:29:00,700
Is that what you doin'?

1536
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:03,135
You're defending me?

1537
01:29:03,169 --> 01:29:03,936
Meyer I used to know,

1538
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:05,705
he would've stood up
for his pal.

1539
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:18,184
You know, there was never
an option for me.

1540
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:22,955
Wasn't gonna be a tailor's son,
make 8 bucks a week?

1541
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:27,159
But you could have
done anything.

1542
01:29:29,962 --> 01:29:32,131
And I looked up to you
my whole life for that.

1543
01:29:39,038 --> 01:29:41,007
And following you.

1544
01:29:43,309 --> 01:29:46,245
(Sighs)

1545
01:29:46,278 --> 01:29:48,580
I don't know, Meyer.

1546
01:29:48,613 --> 01:29:50,182
I don't know
if it was worth my soul.

1547
01:29:54,086 --> 01:29:56,088
'Cause I don't know
how to get that back.

1548
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:22,248
I'm aware that I was called here
today to bear witness

1549
01:30:22,281 --> 01:30:29,789
to your decision
to kill my friend, Ben Siegel.

1550
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:32,324
And he saved my life
on more than one occasion.

1551
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:40,966
I cannot sit here and watch you
condemn him to death.

1552
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,903
But he's been robbin' from us,
Meyer.

1553
01:30:43,936 --> 01:30:47,773
I'm aware of
Benny's shortcomings.

1554
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:55,147
I'm also aware that many of us
would not be sitting here today

1555
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:58,150
if it weren't for Benny's
past loyalty

1556
01:30:58,184 --> 01:31:02,088
and his willingness
to stick out his neck.

1557
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,227
If it's about money,

1558
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,930
I've agreed to make amends
for his past mistakes.

1559
01:31:12,998 --> 01:31:19,004
If it's about honor,
I ask you

1560
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:22,975
where is the honor in killing
a friend?

01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,241
Eva?

1578
01:33:02,274 --> 01:33:04,910
EVA: (On phone)
<i>Yes.</i>

1579
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:07,279
Eva, what are you...
what are you doing up?

1580
01:33:07,313 --> 01:33:08,981
What time is it?

1581
01:33:09,014 --> 01:33:11,917
EVA: (On phone)
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

1582
01:33:11,951 --> 01:33:13,152
"I couldn't sleep."

1583
01:33:13,185 --> 01:33:14,987
Honey, you gotta get to sleep.

1584
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,455
Got school tomorrow.

1585
01:33:16,488 --> 01:33:20,192
EVA: (On phone)
<i>But tomorrow is Saturday.</i>

1586
01:33:20,226 --> 01:33:22,528
Okay.

1587
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:24,430
Where's your mama?

1588
01:33:24,463 --> 01:33:27,499
EVA: (On phone)
<i>She went out.</i>

1589
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:29,535
She went out, out where?

1590
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:31,337
EVA: (On phone)
<i>With some man.</i>

1591
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,076
You know, these things.

1592
01:33:38,577 --> 01:33:41,747
It's... that's what's
gonna happen, you know.

1593
01:33:45,384 --> 01:33:49,255
EVA: (On phone) <i>Daddy,
do you still love mommy?</i>

1594
01:33:52,057 --> 01:33:54,159
Honey, I love you.

1595
01:33:56,996 --> 01:33:58,998
I love you.

1596
01:34:00,432 --> 01:34:03,235
FRANK:
Mrs. Lansky.

1597
01:34:03,269 --> 01:34:04,903
Who is it?

1598
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:08,274
FRANK: It's Frank Rivers,
ma'am, we spoke on the phone.

1599
01:34:08,307 --> 01:34:10,242
Oh, yes.

1600
01:34:10,276 --> 01:34:12,144
I remember.

1601
01:34:12,177 --> 01:34:13,812
Sit down.

1602
01:34:13,846 --> 01:34:15,180
Thank you.

1603
01:34:20,252 --> 01:34:22,554
You know, there's no way in hell
you're going to find

1604
01:34:22,588 --> 01:34:25,090
that bastard's money.

1605
01:34:25,124 --> 01:34:26,292
Why is that?

1606
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:31,196
My ex-husband, Meyer,

1607
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:34,500
he never let a dime
out of his sight.

1608
01:34:34,533 --> 01:34:36,068
(Chuckles)

1609
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:43,075
If I were you,
I would look to Cuba.

1610
01:34:43,108 --> 01:34:47,046
That is where Meyer made
his first real money.

1611
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:49,848
I thought he lost everything
when Castro took over.

1612
01:34:49,882 --> 01:34:52,451
You think he would
give all that money

1613
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:54,153
to a communist.

1614
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:59,391
Uh, that Batista,
he trusted no one, only Meyer.

1615
01:35:01,927 --> 01:35:03,996
He gave Meyer
what Meyer wanted.

1616
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:08,033
FRANK:
And what was that?

1617
01:35:08,067 --> 01:35:11,437
To turn that country
into the Monte Carlo

1618
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:13,038
of the Caribbean.

1619
01:35:16,608 --> 01:35:20,312
If only it had lasted.

1620
01:35:20,346 --> 01:35:21,947
Pfft.

1621
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,917
(Waves crashing)

1622
01:35:27,019 --> 01:35:29,154
Here's one of his diets.

1623
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:31,523
Matiz Sardine, Jello,
and Irish stew.

1624
01:35:31,557 --> 01:35:33,492
- Blegh.
- Ugh.

1625
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:37,496
Hey, there's a Lansky associate
in Geneva.

1626
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:39,298
GREG:
That might be our guy.

1627
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:42,101
Let's get Stone to run it
by Lansky.

1628
01:35:42,134 --> 01:35:44,970
I got it, of course.

1629
01:35:45,003 --> 01:35:48,507
Hey David,
I got a message for you.

1630
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,275
From Mr. Lansky.

1631
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,098
What... what do you want?

1632
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:15,267
I'm beginning to think
you're not taking me seriously.

1633
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,301
Hey, he's not even here.

1634
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:17,670
I've got nothing.

1635
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:18,638
Man, I think we're done.

1636
01:36:18,671 --> 01:36:19,938
I think the book is done.

1637
01:36:19,972 --> 01:36:20,906
- I think...
- Listen to me.

1638
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:22,541
We're looking for an associate
of Lansky's.

1639
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:25,277
He goes by the name "Pinkus".

1640
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,713
He's 81, alright?

1641
01:36:26,746 --> 01:36:28,947
He's mind's not that sharp.

1642
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:31,016
I think that some of the stuff
he's been saying is...

1643
01:36:31,049 --> 01:36:32,317
it's a little incoherent.

1644
01:36:32,351 --> 01:36:34,721
Trust me,
he'll remember this name.

1645
01:36:34,754 --> 01:36:38,190
Find out who he is, okay?

1646
01:36:38,223 --> 01:36:39,558
You've got a pen,
I'll write it down.

1647
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:42,662
Pink-ass,
that you could remember.

1648
01:36:47,634 --> 01:36:49,468
(Knocking on door)

1649
01:36:51,671 --> 01:36:53,038
LANSKY: (On radio)
<i>Hello, David.</i>

1650
01:36:53,071 --> 01:36:54,506
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

1651
01:36:56,442 --> 01:36:58,977
<i>I didn't feel like
going out today.</i>

1652
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:00,212
<i>You want coffee?</i>

1653
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:01,280
DAVID:
<i>No, thanks, I'm fine.</i>

1654
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:07,386
Is that your father?

1655
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:17,463
When Israel turned me down,

1656
01:37:17,496 --> 01:37:19,565
all I could think about was
how embarrassed

1657
01:37:19,598 --> 01:37:21,033
he would have been.

1658
01:37:22,802 --> 01:37:25,604
I was always ashamed of him.

1659
01:37:25,638 --> 01:37:28,273
In my mind, he was weak.

1660
01:37:28,307 --> 01:37:30,476
Busting his balls
earning pennies.

1661
01:37:32,177 --> 01:37:35,682
He felt the same about me,
shame

1662
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:38,183
for having a gangster
for a son.

1663
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:48,126
I didn't go to his funeral,
my own father.

1664
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:53,098
I don't have the power
to change my past,

1665
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:56,201
I do have the power to change
the perception of it.

1666
01:37:57,704 --> 01:38:00,773
Do as I ask
and you will be rewarded.

1667
01:38:03,242 --> 01:38:05,344
You would do what I ask.

1668
01:38:05,377 --> 01:38:06,545
<i>Let's sit on the porch.</i>

1669
01:38:06,578 --> 01:38:07,079
GREG:
Turn it back now.

1670
01:38:07,112 --> 01:38:08,180
Switch over to two.

1671
01:38:14,687 --> 01:38:16,054
What's going on?

1672
01:38:16,088 --> 01:38:18,590
We lost, he knows
we're listening to him.

1673
01:38:18,624 --> 01:38:19,759
Goddammit.

1674
01:38:24,363 --> 01:38:26,565
There's a name that came up
in my research,

1675
01:38:26,598 --> 01:38:28,066
someone named "Pinkus".

1676
01:38:31,804 --> 01:38:33,372
Huh?

1677
01:38:33,405 --> 01:38:35,274
Someone named "Pinkus".

1678
01:38:38,443 --> 01:38:42,614
You mean Sal Rosenstein,
tough son of a bitch,

1679
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:45,852
his entire family died
at Takhel.

1680
01:38:45,885 --> 01:38:48,554
After the war,
he moved to Switzerland,

1681
01:38:48,587 --> 01:38:51,189
did some banking for me.

1682
01:38:51,223 --> 01:38:53,525
Pinkus was my nickname for him.

1683
01:38:58,597 --> 01:39:02,702
Wanted Pinkus' identity,
get a pen.

1684
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:04,837
Saul Rosenstein.

1685
01:39:06,706 --> 01:39:08,273
Yeah, yeah.

1686
01:39:08,307 --> 01:39:09,474
Put the money
in my wife's account

1687
01:39:09,508 --> 01:39:10,810
and make sure they're safe.

1688
01:39:10,843 --> 01:39:12,511
And let my family alone.

1689
01:39:18,718 --> 01:39:20,419
(Sighs)

1690
01:39:23,856 --> 01:39:25,858
We found him.

1691
01:39:25,892 --> 01:39:27,760
Who, Rosenstein?

1692
01:39:27,794 --> 01:39:29,796
Yeah, he was in Geneva.

1693
01:39:29,829 --> 01:39:30,730
Where is he now?

1694
01:39:30,763 --> 01:39:32,297
He died 48 hours ago.

1695
01:39:32,331 --> 01:39:35,233
(Phone ringing)

1696
01:39:49,749 --> 01:39:51,918
Yeah, what the...

1697
01:39:51,951 --> 01:39:54,319
FRANK: (On phone) <i>It's Rivers, Saul
Rosenstein was killed in a car accident</i>

1698
01:39:54,353 --> 01:39:56,789
- <i>48 hours ago.</i>
- Say again.

1699
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:58,557
FRANK: (On phone) <i>I'm saying
that Lansky had him killed.</i>

1700
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:00,292
<i>This is not a coincidence.</i>

1701
01:40:00,325 --> 01:40:02,361
<i>I would advise you
to stop talking to Lansky.</i>

1702
01:40:02,394 --> 01:40:12,337
(♪♪♪)

1703
01:40:15,775 --> 01:40:17,576
Mr. Rivers,
as soon as you called,

1704
01:40:17,609 --> 01:40:20,212
we started running a query
into our database.

1705
01:40:20,245 --> 01:40:22,314
It appears Mr. Rosenstein
moved his money

1706
01:40:22,347 --> 01:40:24,751
primarily to one place, Israel.

1707
01:40:24,784 --> 01:40:27,185
Rosenstein was Mossad.

1708
01:40:27,219 --> 01:40:29,254
<i>We've got a paper trail
of laundered money</i>

1709
01:40:29,287 --> 01:40:32,659
going in and out of Geneva
into Israel to a bank

1710
01:40:32,692 --> 01:40:34,292
called "Mekif".

1711
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:35,928
And you think that money
was Lansky's?

1712
01:40:35,962 --> 01:40:38,196
I think it's why Lansky wanted
to get into Israel.

1713
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:39,398
His money's there.

1714
01:40:45,303 --> 01:40:48,273
MEKIF EMPLOYEE: Mr. Rivers,
welcome to Israel.

1715
01:40:48,306 --> 01:40:50,208
We've been expecting you.

1716
01:40:50,242 --> 01:40:52,277
I will be taking you down
to the vault.

1717
01:40:56,949 --> 01:40:59,284
Here it is.

1718
01:40:59,317 --> 01:41:00,687
Thank you.

1719
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:10,663
(♪♪♪)

1720
01:41:18,303 --> 01:41:19,571
Son of a bitch.

1721
01:41:19,604 --> 01:41:21,273
And God said to Abraham,

1722
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:26,244
"Abraham, take your son,
your only son whom you love,

1723
01:41:26,278 --> 01:41:29,716
Isaac, and sacrifice him
upon one of the mountains

1724
01:41:29,749 --> 01:41:31,550
that I will tell you."

1725
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:35,922
And Abraham went forth
with Isaac to do just that.

1726
01:41:35,955 --> 01:41:39,324
But perhaps what God
really wanted was for Abraham

1727
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:42,427
to say, no.

1728
01:41:42,461 --> 01:41:46,264
We praise God now for those
who have departed this world

1729
01:41:46,298 --> 01:41:49,802
as we stand for the Kaddish,
let us all stand.

1730
01:41:51,838 --> 01:41:54,707
(Jewish prayer in Aramaic)

1731
01:42:08,821 --> 01:42:10,757
Mr. Lansky, Mr. Lansky.

1732
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:12,959
David.

1733
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,359
Prayer for the dead, right?

1734
01:42:14,392 --> 01:42:15,061
Kaddish.

1735
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:16,561
Is that for your father?

1736
01:42:16,595 --> 01:42:18,831
Or was it for Saul Rosenstein?

1737
01:42:18,865 --> 01:42:23,770
Remember Saul Rosenstein,
your friend Pinkus is dead

1738
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:24,971
and he died in a car accident.

1739
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:27,740
I'm sorry to hear that.

1740
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:28,941
Three days ago.

1741
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:34,747
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

1742
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,381
I just think
it's a bit coincidental,

1743
01:42:36,414 --> 01:42:37,616
we were just talking about him

1744
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:41,353
and then something terrible
happens to him.

1745
01:42:41,386 --> 01:42:42,955
(Laughs)

1746
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:44,991
Maybe he's dead

1747
01:42:45,024 --> 01:42:47,693
or maybe they just think
he's dead.

1748
01:42:47,727 --> 01:42:49,361
Just tell me the truth.

1749
01:42:49,394 --> 01:42:51,697
You mean like the truth that
you're speaking to the Feds?

1750
01:42:54,767 --> 01:42:57,335
You betrayed me, David,
you broke my heart,

1751
01:42:57,369 --> 01:42:59,672
you made a deal with me
and you broke your word.

1752
01:42:59,705 --> 01:43:01,040
Yeah, I did talk to them.

1753
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:03,542
I did, yeah.

1754
01:43:03,575 --> 01:43:06,378
You know why I did it?

1755
01:43:06,411 --> 01:43:08,014
You call it "self-preservation",
I think.

1756
01:43:08,047 --> 01:43:10,950
Right, I had to do
what I had to do for my family.

1757
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:12,317
Stand by.

1758
01:43:14,153 --> 01:43:15,855
I forgive you, David.

1759
01:43:17,556 --> 01:43:19,959
If you wanna hear
the rest of the story...

1760
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:22,061
Why'd you forgive me?

1761
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:23,696
'Cause I like you.

1762
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:28,067
You liked Sal Rosenstein, too.

1763
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,367
Not really.

1764
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:37,542
INTERVIEWER: And now you come to
Israel, for what reason?

1765
01:43:37,576 --> 01:43:39,745
You want to become
an Israeli citizen, Mr. Lansky?

1766
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:42,114
I do.

1767
01:43:42,148 --> 01:43:47,053
My association with Israel
stands many years back.

1768
01:43:47,086 --> 01:43:49,155
I was born a Jew.

1769
01:43:49,188 --> 01:43:52,024
I have all my life
lived as a Jew.

1770
01:43:52,058 --> 01:43:55,127
I never changed my faith.

1771
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:57,596
My grandparents are buried here.

1772
01:43:57,629 --> 01:44:00,700
INTERVIEWER: <i>Why are the
American authorities after you?</i>

1773
01:44:00,733 --> 01:44:03,970
LANSKY: <i>They claim I have
50% of Lebanon casinos,</i>

1774
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:05,938
<i>50% of Monte Carlo.</i>

1775
01:44:05,972 --> 01:44:10,408
INTERVIEWER: <i>Mr. Lansky,
is there such a thing as organized crime?</i>

1776
01:44:10,442 --> 01:44:12,945
<i>I have no knowledge
on the subject</i>

1777
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:15,614
<i>and I'd like to live
the remainder of my days</i>

1778
01:44:15,648 --> 01:44:16,949
<i>in Israel.</i>

1779
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:29,862
I got a tip from a friend,
Golda Meir's lobbying Nixon

1780
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:32,899
to supply Israel
with F-4 fighter bombers.

1781
01:44:32,932 --> 01:44:34,566
What's that got to do with me?

1782
01:44:34,599 --> 01:44:37,036
The prime minister was told that
in order for that deal

1783
01:44:37,069 --> 01:44:38,204
to go through,

1784
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:40,640
she'd have to see to that
you leave Israel

1785
01:44:40,673 --> 01:44:42,474
and return to the U.S.

1786
01:44:42,507 --> 01:44:45,711
State Department
is revoking your passport.

1787
01:44:45,745 --> 01:44:47,880
You need to surrender
at the embassy.

1788
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:52,184
The Law of Return says
every Jew has the right

1789
01:44:52,218 --> 01:44:56,088
to citizenship in Israel.

1790
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:58,456
There's nothing I can do.

1791
01:44:58,490 --> 01:44:59,624
I'm sorry.

1792
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:02,594
After everything I did
for this country,

1793
01:45:02,627 --> 01:45:06,132
after all I gave them
when they begged me for money,

1794
01:45:06,165 --> 01:45:07,199
for weapons.

1795
01:45:07,233 --> 01:45:08,734
Doesn't she remember?

1796
01:45:08,768 --> 01:45:12,038
This is how they repay me,
making me the only Jew

1797
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:15,141
in history to be banned
from his country.

1798
01:45:15,174 --> 01:45:16,541
How dare she?

1799
01:45:16,574 --> 01:45:18,144
How dare she?

1800
01:45:19,946 --> 01:45:22,748
They've already arranged
for your return to the U.S.

1801
01:45:22,782 --> 01:45:24,150
They're charging you
with contempt of court...

1802
01:45:24,183 --> 01:45:25,483
Oh my God.

1803
01:45:25,517 --> 01:45:27,053
And conspiracy related
to your ownership

1804
01:45:27,086 --> 01:45:28,788
at the Flamingo Hotel.

1805
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:30,256
I won't go back there.

1806
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:33,092
I want you to help me
find a place,

1807
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:35,194
a country that will take me.

1808
01:45:35,227 --> 01:45:36,162
I have money.

1809
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:38,097
Name the price.

1810
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:40,066
I don't want your money, Meyer.

1811
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:42,068
I believe your people
have betrayed you.

1812
01:45:45,071 --> 01:45:46,604
I'll say.

1813
01:45:52,745 --> 01:45:54,213
(Sighing)

1814
01:45:54,246 --> 01:45:57,016
And after all that, they were
never able to indict you.

1815
01:45:57,049 --> 01:45:58,217
(Sighs)

1816
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,654
The charges against me,
contempt of court,

1817
01:46:01,687 --> 01:46:04,690
conspiracy, they were dropped.

1818
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:11,030
You can go back to Israel.

1819
01:46:11,063 --> 01:46:13,232
(Laughs)

1820
01:46:13,265 --> 01:46:17,169
The wandering Jew,
just like Lucky said.

1821
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:24,576
(Sighs)

1822
01:46:24,609 --> 01:46:27,146
Have we arrived at the end
of my story?

1823
01:46:33,152 --> 01:46:34,820
(Sighs)

1824
01:46:39,058 --> 01:46:40,726
What about the money?

1825
01:46:49,268 --> 01:46:50,568
Hmm.

1826
01:46:52,004 --> 01:46:54,572
Come for a ride.

1827
01:47:36,082 --> 01:47:37,917
Buddy.

1828
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:47,860
(♪♪♪)

1829
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:30,769
Gangster?

1830
01:48:34,773 --> 01:48:39,879
I'm an angel
with a dirty face.

1831
01:48:49,488 --> 01:48:53,025
I think we're finished, David.

1832
01:48:53,058 --> 01:48:54,693
Go home.

1833
01:48:57,730 --> 01:48:59,365
To your family.

1834
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,435
Remember me.

1835
01:49:03,469 --> 01:49:13,379
(♪♪♪)

1836
01:49:22,087 --> 01:49:25,057

(♪♪♪)

1838
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:56,255
DAVID: (Voice-over) When all is said
and done, how do we measure ourselves?

1839
01:49:58,791 --> 01:50:01,026
If Lansky taught me anything,
it's that

1840
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,461
there's only one measure
in this world

1841
01:50:02,494 --> 01:50:04,063
that truly matters.

1842
01:50:06,265 --> 01:50:07,800
We measure ourselves
through the eyes

1843
01:50:07,833 --> 01:50:09,835
of the ones we love.

1844
01:50:13,973 --> 01:50:15,841
(Taking deep breaths)

1845
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:22,314
DAVID: (Voice-over) Somewhere
on the stretch of highway

1846
01:50:22,348 --> 01:50:25,384
between Miami and home,
it all made sense.

1847
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:28,487
Lansky spent his life
trying to control the game,

1848
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,190
but in the end,
he knew there was one game

1849
01:50:31,223 --> 01:50:35,094
that no one gets to control,
life itself.

1850
01:50:35,127 --> 01:50:37,396
And you can try
to beat the odds.

1851
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:40,366
But the house always wins.

1852
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:41,867
Maybe all you need
every now and then

1853
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,502
is a winning streak.

1854
01:50:50,476 --> 01:50:52,111
You wanted to see me?

1855
01:50:52,144 --> 01:50:53,479
Yeah, come on in, Frank.

1856
01:51:00,085 --> 01:51:02,254
We're shutting
the investigation down.

1857
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:04,123
Wait, what?

1858
01:51:04,156 --> 01:51:05,124
Why?

1859
01:51:05,157 --> 01:51:06,492
It's over, Frank.

1860
01:51:10,429 --> 01:51:11,463
Who's killing it?

1861
01:51:11,497 --> 01:51:13,299
The CIA?

1862
01:51:21,073 --> 01:51:23,976
Before your time, sonny boy.
