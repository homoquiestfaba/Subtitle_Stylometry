28
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:09,973
I couldn't sleep last night.

29
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,090
Kept thinking about necking.

30
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,152
What is it exactly?

31
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,952
Is there kissing involved or
their necks actually touch?

32
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,092
I don't know, it's been bothering me.

33
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:23,925
I've never necked.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,270
Lot of things I've never done.

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,959
Never salsa-ed.

36
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,783
Always thought it would be fun to salsa.

37
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,453
Or getting the last laugh.

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,590
I mean, like actually
being the last person

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,840
to laugh in the room and
then closing the door

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,873
so no one can laugh after you, or at you.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,020
And then there are the prostitutes.

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,382
That moaning and groaning, the wailing.

43
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,632
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,490
Sorry, hope you weren't offended by that.

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
I'm just still not used
to, you know, a woman.

46
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,680
- I assure you, I listen just
as carefully as Dr. Duncan.

47
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:13,902
(Floyd sighing)

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,450
- Gotta lay off the horses.

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,550
Takin' such a beating.

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,840
I shouldn't even go near a carousel.

51
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,720
(Floyd chuckling)

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,450
You know, that's why I was up last night.

53
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,720
I was fearing carousels.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,970
That round and round endless cycle.

55
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,440
Always comin' back to where you were,

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,710
seeing the same place
over and over and over.

57
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,423
I just wanna get off!

58
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,363
Try something else.

59
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,040
I don't wanna be the guy who looks down

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,460
and finds he's standing
in a rut at the bottom

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,323
of a mountain.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,653
- So you're suggesting a midlife crisis?

63
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,470
- Just really sick of having no money.

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,920
- Incidentally, did your
mother stop paying my bills?

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,472
- It feels like everything
just passed me by.

66
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:04,930
Washooo!

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,500
Suddenly I'm too old
to ever have sex again

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,450
with a 20-year-old.

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,410
Just a guy who women don't want,

70
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,410
can't afford to buy 'em a pretzel stick,

71
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,570
and whose got about as
much chance of relieving

72
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,453
his libido as Conway
Twitty going on world tour.

73
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,463
I was thinking, why do
people smile in photographs?

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,640
I mean, why are we all
pretending to be having

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,623
such a good time?

76
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,340
- I really think we should
start getting together

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,540
an extra session a week.

78
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:47,835
(Floyd sighing)

79
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:50,918
(dramatic music)

80
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,870
- It's New York lottery
numbers and Win Draw Four.

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm Yolanda Vega.

82
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,970
Now here's the next number,
the first ball up is five.

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,580
The next is eight, and the last

84
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,423
is zero, making tonight's number 580.

85
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,200
And now for Win Four.

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,030
The first ball up is three.

87
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,330
The next is three.

88
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,680
The next is nine,

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
and the last is seven,

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,230
making tonight's Win Four number 3397.

91
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,673
Thank you and good night.

92
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,026
(fists pounding)

93
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,430
- [Mr. Garber] Floyd, it's me!

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,193
(fists pounding)

95
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,026
Floyd!

96
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,979
- Hey.

97
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,060
- Don't hey me.

98
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,520
What the hell do you think this is?

99
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,900
Some free boarding house?

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm not here to support you, young man.

101
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,800
- I'm not a young man, Mr. Garber.

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,570
- I'm here for my money!

103
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,350
- Mr. Garber, I got a lot
of mice in here, okay?

104
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,610
My faucet in the kitchen drips.

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,410
It keeps me up all night.

106
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,740
- I can't continue to have you live here

107
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,849
if you don't pay!
(fist pounding)

108
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:00,682
That's it!

109
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,695
(door slamming)
(lock clicking)

110
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,862
(bright groovy music)

111
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:16,471
- This is the greatest job in the world.

112
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,607
The pay is bad, but the
paybacks are the greatest.

113
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:25,936
(woman moaning)

114
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,390
- You get to fix my door yet?

115
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,420
- Workin' on it, baby,
but it's kind of hot.

116
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,243
Hey, hey, hey!

117
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,843
Know what I mean? (laughing)

118
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,013
- You make a deposit
in this cup, Mr. Lloyd.

119
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:43,264
- Floyd.
- Oh.

120
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,135
- I left a really hot
video playin' for ya, man.

121
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:48,968
- Uh.

122
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,733
- Oh.

123
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,270
- Oh, and it'll be the same?

124
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,020
20 bucks like the last time, right?

125
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:02,390
(bright groovy music)

126
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,522
- Man, this guy sucks.

127
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,254
- I don't know, I think
it's actually kind of sexy.

128
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:19,421
(bright groovy music)

129
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,198
(Floyd thudding)

130
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,663
- Hey, Floyd, you here again?

131
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,320
- Yeah, I'm all ready.

132
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,153
- It's too soon.

133
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:31,710
You know, you have to wait at least a week

134
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,256
to do donations.

135
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:34,688
- Please? I need the money.

136
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,494
Come on.

137
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:40,573
- All right, but don't tell my supervisor.

138
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,111
Shh.

139
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,537
(Floyd screaming)

140
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,556
Shh!

141
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:45,635
Stop!

142
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:48,468
(Floyd screaming)

143
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,258
- Want me to do the windshield?

144
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:54,194
- [Woman] Okay.

145
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:57,361
(bright groovy music)

146
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:09,425
(Floyd speaking indistinctly)

147
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:10,341
- [Woman] That's him!

148
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,174
The one with the nose!

149
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,481
- [Policeman] Get over here.

150
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,210
Hey, you! Yeah, you.

151
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,261
Pick it up. Step up.

152
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,094
- Please, not me.

153
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:19,490
I'm just here for the money.

154
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,800
I didn't do anything. (chuckling)

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,972
Him, on the other hand, I'm not so sure.

156
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,972
(man growling)

157
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,972
(Floyd screaming)
(punches smacking)

158
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,698
- [Ida] You been working?

159
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,973
- [Floyd] It's been a little rough.

160
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,310
- That's all I hear.

161
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,290
What's so rough?

162
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,930
You go get yourself a job.

163
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,020
- Ma, you can't just go get a job.

164
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,007
Who's gonna hire somebody
without a college education, huh?

165
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,430
- All I know is when your father got out

166
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,350
of the army, he went lookin' for a job,

167
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,270
whatever he could get.

168
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,940
And he brought home enough
money to support a family.

169
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,190
But you, you've got no wife, no kids,

170
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,360
and you're draining me every single month

171
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,600
with those stupid shrink bills.

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,580
Do you know what kind of
fancy life I could be living

173
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,040
with the money that that expensive shrink

174
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,443
milks out of my account
every single month, huh?

175
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,050
That's right, high on the hog, my dear.

176
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,940
High on the hog.

177
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,403
But no, just so my son's
not mental, I gotta suffer.

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,620
- What do you want me to say, Ma?

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,410
- Floyd, honey, I gotta get out of here.

180
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,253
I hate it.

181
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,980
If I don't get outta here soon,

182
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,460
you're not gonna have
a mother to come visit.

183
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,290
Now why can't I come and live with you?

184
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,880
- Mom, we've discussed
this a million times.

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,950
My apartment's no place for you, trust me.

186
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,160
- Why can't I come and
live with my own son?

187
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,003
- Ma, I live over a porno shop.

188
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,300
Besides, we know we drive
each other up the wall

189
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,050
whenever we're under the same roof.

190
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,840
For my next trick, the
amazing Floydini will perform

191
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,670
the classic milk poured
into a cone of newspaper.

192
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,640
Now, this can be a very dangerous trick.

193
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Kids, don't try this at home,

194
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,320
especially if your mother
just cleaned the floor.

195
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,240
One time I did that and boy did
I get a punch in the tuchus.

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,175
That's Yiddish for a beating.

197
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,925
(women laughing)

198
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,270
- What happens when he usually does this?

199
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,940
- Depends on if he's been practicing.

200
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,176
- And now, a one, and a two, and a three!

201
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,064
Oi!

202
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,332
(glass clattering)

203
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,165
- Oh!

204
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:35,998
- Would you watch?

205
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:36,890
- My bad, my bad.

206
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,960
- All right, all right,
let's talk numbers.

207
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,793
Whaddya got?

208
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,960
- I got three numbers in
one game on Wednesday.

209
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,340
Four numbers on Saturday,
but no supplementary.

210
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,090
And I had two numbers in six games

211
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,080
and four consecutive drawings in both

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,800
the Connecticut and New
York State lotteries.

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
- Oh man, you were so close.

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,440
- Yeah, I could
practically smell the green

215
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,330
underneath my mattress.

216
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,368
- I think you were
smellin' something else.

217
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:59,951
(men laughing)

218
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,960
- Hey, anybody!

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,273
Anybody legitimately get
laid since the last meeting?

220
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,680
(man clearing throat)

221
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,450
- How about you, Floyd?

222
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,293
- Uh, no, not yet.

223
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,570
I've been busy with other things.

224
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,720
- Yeah, what other things?

225
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,610
- Like tryin' to earn a livin'.

226
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,354
That sound familiar to any of you?

227
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:27,520
- You sound like my shrink.

228
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,749
- Now this guy's got a shrink, too.

229
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:30,790
(men laughing)

230
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,973
- Up yours, twicky boy.

231
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,480
- Look, I just don't wanna be doing this

232
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
the rest of my life, you know?

233
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,390
I mean, nothin' ever happens here.

234
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,590
Don't you guys see that?

235
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,463
I mean, seriously.

236
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,850
We piss around here all day

237
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,663
and none of us are ever
gonna win anything.

238
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,340
None of us are ever gonna get laid.

239
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,630
- Hey, speak for yourself.

240
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,020
- Look, I don't know how
you guys can be so satisfied

241
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,400
with what we're all doing
here, or rather, not doing.

242
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,190
I mean, 'cause I, I'm just, I don't know.

243
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,565
I'm not happy with the
way things are goin'.

244
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:03,240
- (chuckling) What's with you, man?

245
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,160
You used to be fine coming
up here with all of us

246
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,980
hanging around, doing nothing.

247
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,260
All of a sudden you come
with this attitude up here.

248
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,199
- My life's half over.

249
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,670
What the hell have I
done with it, you know?

250
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,683
- Look, Floyd.

251
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,123
Why don't you do magic?

252
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:19,273
I mean, you're good at it.

253
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,140
Go be a magician and leave
us the hell alone, all right?

254
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,350
- Yeah. (laughing)

255
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,179
- Drink up, guys.

256
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,321
- All right, eh?

257
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,689
- [Man] Pass me them cards, come on.

258
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:33,727
- [Man] Give me some,
give me some of that.

259
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,751
Give me some of that.
- [Man] Yeah.

260
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,168
(bright whimsical music)

261
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:53,694
- Hello?

262
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,566
(Floyd laughing)

263
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,923
Whoa! (laughing)

264
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,100
- Pretty neat trick, heh?

265
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,933
- That was great.

266
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,090
- Look, I'll tell ya something.

267
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,560
This is a great trick for you.

268
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,120
See, it's outside of the package.

269
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,860
It's usually $112, but I'll
let ya have it for $215.

270
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,370
And these I'll just throw in, $75 each.

271
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,440
Now, what would you like?

272
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,780
- Well, I was thinking
of becoming a magician.

273
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,140
- Oh, you wanna be the master of illusion,

274
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,980
the king of hocus pocus,

275
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,660
the ringmaster of the ruse.

276
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,070
Well, that's quite a step.

277
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,900
What makes you think
you're cut out for it?

278
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,370
- Well, I always liked
watching David Copperfield.

279
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,250
And I once read a book on Houdini.

280
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,863
- Ooh, I had no idea you
were that experienced.

281
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Come right this way, sir.

282
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,930
Follow me.

283
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,000
I had no idea I was in
the presence of greatness.

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,190
See, this is the same
finger my proctologist has.

285
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,400
Here, just take it.

286
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,090
That'll be $81.

287
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,440
Ah, what kind of magician
would you like to be?

288
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,190
- Oh, I don't know.

289
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,130
You know, the usual.

290
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,740
- The usual?

291
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,020
You don't wanna be the usual!

292
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,250
Anyone can be the usual!

293
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,700
You wanna be different.

294
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,170
You wanna be unusual, okay?

295
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,540
- Okay. Unusual.

296
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,373
- Perfect.

297
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,030
I'm just gonna set you up
with like little things

298
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,670
that you need, just the essentials.

299
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,850
I know you don't have that much money,

300
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,610
so let me see what I can fix ya up with.

301
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,360
Now, um, now you, ah, you
have an assistant, right?

302
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,530
- No.

303
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,650
- You don't have an assistant?

304
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,440
- No.
- Everybody has an assist.

305
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,410
The magician has to have an assistant.

306
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,820
The assistant says look at the trick,

307
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,360
and if you don't want
them to see the trick,

308
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,110
the assistant says look at me.

309
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,940
And the assistant has talent.

310
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,697
Lots and lots of talent.

311
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,500
Now, you gotta get an assistant.

312
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,690
And don't tell anyone your secrets,

313
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,950
except your assistant.

314
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,710
Now, obviously, you have a rabbit.

315
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,093
- Uh, no.

316
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,750
- You don't have a rabbit?

317
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,760
What are you? Out of your mind?

318
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,783
Every magician has a rabbit.

319
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:06,760
A magician without a rabbit,
that's crackers without cheese.

320
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,800
It's eggs without bacon!

321
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,280
It's, you know something?

322
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,480
I skipped lunch today, that's the problem.

323
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,840
I knew I was dizzy.

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,490
Go get yourself a rabbit!

325
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,690
- Rabbit.

326
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,980
- Okay, now let me just give
you one or two other things.

327
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,850
Just stuff that you have to have.

328
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,463
And um, will this be cash or charge?

329
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,600
- Uh, charge?

330
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,750
- [Salesman] I knew it.

331
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:37,058
(Floyd sighing)

332
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:42,058
(woman moaning)
(bed creaking)

333
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,168
(Floyd sighing)

334
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,109
- Oh, come on.

335
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:55,109
(woman moaning)
(bed creaking)

336
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,310
Shazam.

337
00:15:58,196 --> 00:16:00,092
(woman moaning)
(bed creaking)

338
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:00,925
Shazam.

339
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,933
The Fabulous Houdini.

340
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:11,083
Shazam. Fabulous Floydini. (chuckling)

341
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,477
Shazam.

342
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,093
The Funny Floydini.

343
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,412
Funny Floydini. Shazam.

344
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:24,189
(woman moaning)
(bed creaking)

345
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,213
Surprising Floydini. (chuckling)

346
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,437
Shazam!

347
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,260
The Amazing Floydini!

348
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,320
Shazam! Shazam!

349
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:44,660
(upbeat Caribbean music)

350
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,340
- If you're trying to
get laid, don't bother.

351
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,210
She's like a dried up raisin.

352
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,210
Trust me. I've seen it.

353
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,433
- Hey, shut up, will ya?

354
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,615
♪ Da da da da ♪

355
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,074

356
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:00,907
Yay!

357
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,501
Bella Stella.

358
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,060
- My pleasure.

359
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,510
- What kind of mood she in today?

360
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,183
- So-so.

361
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:09,083
- A little grumpy.

362
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:11,530
- Mmm.

363
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,673
Thanks for the dance.

364
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:17,192
(upbeat Caribbean music)

365
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,473
Hi, Ma.

366
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,200
Hi, Ma.

367
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,490
- I heard you the first time.

368
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,550
You don't have to shout at an old woman.

369
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,080
- Well, then why didn't?

370
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,720
Never mind.

371
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,890
How you doin' today?

372
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,723
- Lousy.

373
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,672
- Good.

374
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:36,680
Well, you're better than yesterday then.

375
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,670
I was worried about you.

376
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,610
- So?

377
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,780
- Have I told you I'm thinkin'
of becoming a magician?

378
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,883
- A magician?

379
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,020
Oh, god.

380
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,870
There's no chance for me.

381
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,500
The lawyers got my will.

382
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,580
You got it all.

383
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,650
Enjoy the salad spinner.

384
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,200
It was your great-grandmother's
on your father's side.

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,073
That bitch.
- Ma, would you stop it?

386
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,003
- Stop what?

387
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,430
I didn't do anything.

388
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,330
Except do everything for
you your entire life.

389
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,160
- I really would like
your support on this.

390
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
- No.

391
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,450
I will not pay for magic lessons.

392
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,370
I will not waste your father's money

393
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,613
all of a sudden for circus acts.

394
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,070
He worked his fingers to the bone

395
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,520
for every dollar that he earned.

396
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,080
- Ma, I didn't say anything about money.

397
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,800
I just want you to be a quarter as excited

398
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,680
about this as I am.

399
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,750
An eighth, I don't care.

400
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,170
Just don't chastise me about it.

401
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,210
- I don't know.

402
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,910
I did everything I could.

403
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,277
I was always watching you.

404
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,170
You never fell once as a child, not once.

405
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,800
I used to see all the other
mothers in the playground

406
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,202
not watching their kids
half as good as me.

407
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,350
They let them fall all over the place,

408
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,800
hitting their heads.

409
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,740
You never hit your head once.

410
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,683
But obviously, doesn't mean a thing.

411
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,833
- Maybe a good hit on the head
would've done me some good.

412
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,830
- Mmm.
(Floyd chuckling)

413
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,483
Ma, I wanna start over.

414
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,350
I want the chance to
do what makes me happy

415
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,670
and I wanna be a magician.

416
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,050
- How many times have I heard that?

417
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,220
You're gonna start over.

418
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,380
This time, Ma, it's gonna be it.

419
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,210
- So would you rather
I keep doing nothing?

420
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,240
- Why?

421
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,026
Why a magician?

422
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,363
- Because I like it.

423
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,833
And the people who watch me,

424
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,670
they like it too.

425
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,080
- You know, Esther
Frankenburg came to visit me.

426
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,160
She told me that her son, the doctor,

427
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,450
bought her a Lincoln
Continental, with cruise control.

428
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,560
- So is that what this is all about?

429
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,563
Cruise control?

430
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,380
Ma, you know what?

431
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,760
Sometimes I really don't
enjoy coming to see you.

432
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,540
- So you don't want to enthrall me with

433
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,373
your twice a week visits?

434
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,123
- I don't know what's the matter with you.

435
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,390
Become an old, bitter woman.

436
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,793
- I don't have to hear that.

437
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,230
I should never, never have
sold that beautiful, old house.

438
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,040
- Ma, there is nothing
wrong with this place.

439
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,590
You got a whole room
full of friends out there

440
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,620
that want to play with you.

441
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,940
- Nah, I don't wanna be played with.

442
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,020
- You gotta get out.

443
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,123
- I do gotta get out! Outta here.

444
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,250
- Ma, you know, I wish Pop was here

445
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,930
to see what you've become.

446
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,680
Better yet, I'm glad he's not here.

447
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,113
Goodbye, Ma.

448
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:33,583
(birds chirping)
(light groovy music)

449
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:45,332
(Floyd mimicking chirping)

450
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:49,335
(water gurgling)

451
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:53,456
(light groovy music)

452
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,140
Excuse me, miss? Miss, excuse me!

453
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,110
Before someone else gets
it, I'd like a rabbit.

454
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,560
Yeah, this rabbit right here.

455
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,431
Miss! Miss!

456
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,890
(light groovy music)

457
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,589
(Floyd sneezing)

458
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:16,530
It's okay.

459
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,120
Try some carrots.

460
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,610
Got to eat, got to eat.

461
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,010
We got a lot of magic to do.

462
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,664
(Floyd sneezing)

463
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:29,110
Shazam.

464
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,707
Shazam.

465
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,713
And for my next trick. (sneezing)

466
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:36,940
And for my fi...

467
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,600
(Floyd blowing nose and sneezing)

468
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,380
- Watch closely, as I,
the Amazing Mumford,

469
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,670
say the magic word.

470
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,448
A-la peanut butter sandwich!

471
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:52,363
(explosion booming)

472
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,146
(audience applauding)

473
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,058
- Oh, look at that!

474
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:57,940
That was good.
- But observe closely

475
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,690
as I, the Amazing Mumford,
say the magic word.

476
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,064
- Again, you're gonna do it?

477
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:05,707
- [Mumford and Floyd] A-la
peanut butter sandwiches.

478
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,104
(explosion booming)
(Floyd sneezing)

479
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:10,666
(audience applauding)

480
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,106
(sirens wailing)

481
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,856
(Floyd sneezing)

482
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,453
- [Linda] So, how's the magic business?

483
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,343
- Slow.

484
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,680
I bought a rabbit.

485
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,270
- Really?

486
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,320
- I'm allergic to it.

487
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,170
- I never heard of a magician
being allergic to rabbits.

488
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,940
That sounds like kind of a problem.

489
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,773
- Yeah, I know.

490
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I've been givin' a lot of thought
to this whole magic thing.

491
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,620
- Yeah?

492
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,240
- Yeah, you know, I never
learned how to swim,

493
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,390
so I can't do any of
the water tank tricks.

494
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,590
- Well, maybe you could skip the tricks

495
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,473
with the rabbits and skip
the water tank tricks.

496
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,640
- I have another problem.

497
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,473
- Oh?

498
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:58,100
Oh, knives.
- Knives.

499
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,630
- Well, maybe you could skip the tricks

500
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,010
with the sharp things.

501
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,220
I mean, what about levitation?

502
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,430
- Kind of a slight fear of heights.

503
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,143
I could never go in tree houses.

504
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,850
- Maybe you levitate someone else.

505
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,683
- [Floyd] Maybe.

506
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,380
- It gives you some goals to shoot for.

507
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,930
- Yeah.

508
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,330
- I've had a goal for years.

509
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,400
- Really? What?

510
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,820
- I always wanted to go to Mexico.

511
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,263
Cabo San Lucas.

512
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,023
- Wow.

513
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,650
I bet it's beautiful there.

514
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,393
- Yeah, so I hear, but who
knows if I'll ever get there.

515
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,230
- Why not?

516
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,330
- It's just really easy in life to settle.

517
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,737
And to do what everyone else wants,

518
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,653
and to leave your own dreams behind.

519
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,987
I mean, it's one thing to talk about it,

520
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:52,320
but it's another thing to do it.

521
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,220
- Don't I know it.

522
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,200
- The change would be good.

523
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,220
- Change, huh?

524
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,773
Sounds good.

525
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,136
- I got you something.

526
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,137
- Me?

527
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:08,137
- Yeah, you.

528
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,680
- Wow.

529
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,510
Ooh, I'm flattered.

530
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,420
Is this allowed?

531
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,350
I mean, gifts for your clients?

532
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,330
- Consider it a promotional
gift for a good client.

533
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,370
I hope you don't have it already.

534
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,320
I have the receipt.

535
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,353
- Wow.

536
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:26,886
Oh.

537
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,833
I don't.

538
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
Oh, wow, I really love it.

539
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,112
- I figured no magician
should be without a top hat.

540

00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,380
at Hooters the other night?

613
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,610
You won't believe it.

614
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:33,480
- [Newsman] A man who exposed
himself to police officers

615
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,531

voices made him do it.

617
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,585
The arresting officer was
already telling the man...

618
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:40,418

619
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:49,508

623
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,293

My friends, they call me Big Rod.

00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:04,590
I own a porno joint downstairs.

626
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,040
Hey, hope they're not
keeping you up too late.

627
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,361
Party's get pretty wild
at night, you know?

628
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,061
Some of my good clients,
they go eight, 10 rounds, eh?

629
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,010
- You have anything to do with those women

630
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,010
moaning next door to me?

631
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,300
'Cause I know they don't live there.

632
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,210
- I do freelance work on the side.

633
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,420
Ooh, I'm in the business of
making people happy, right?

634
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,050
- Yeah.

635
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,930
So what do you want with me?

636
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,130

637
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,963

639
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,200

641
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,770
but, uh, my woman, she
just got out of the can.

642
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,400
Bambi, I think that's her name.

643
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,307
Anyhow, the bitch wants me to take care

644
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:42,200
of the kid's birthday, and
I saw the flyers and all.

645
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,230
I don't even know if you got the time.

646
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,440
- Yeah, I think I got the time.

647
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,770
Uh, wait.

648
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,230

657
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:03,660
Well, for a birthday party

658
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,587
Um, I usually charge for
a kid's birthday around

- Okay, and I'll see you there?

665
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,193
- Are you kiddin'?

666
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:19,800
I don't even think the kid's mine.

667
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Then again, maybe he is, heh, who knows?

668

Okay, are you ready?

722
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,810
- [Kid] Yeah!

723
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,160
- Okay, good.

724
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,873
And now as I say the magic words,

725
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,771
a-la peanut.

726
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:04,050
- [Girl] Uh-oh.
- [Boy] Boo!

727
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,883
- Bessy, Bessy, where'd you go?

728
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:05,716
Bessy, into the hat.

729
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,300
No, Bessy, no.

730
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,512
Bessy, Bessy.

731
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,560
- [Boy] Get 'em!

732
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,642
- [Floyd] Bessy, come back into the hat.

733
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:11,944
Bessy!

734
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,804
No, kids, get out of there.

735
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:14,910
All right, that's enough.

736
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,743
Oh my gosh.

737
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:16,923
Ah! Don't pull Uncle Floyd's hair.

738
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:19,503
That's it, be nice to the magician.

739
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,885
That's it. Oh, oh my gosh.

740
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,081
- This guy sucks.

741
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:23,950
- [Floyd] Let go, just stop it!

742
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,195
- Leave Rod to do
something, he screws it up.

743
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,688
- Ow, that hurts!

744
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:29,521
Ah! Ow!

745
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:32,342
Give me back my hat!

746
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:33,461
I can't!

747
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,044
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ow!

748
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,883
Now let go.

749
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:41,906
Let go of my teeth!
(kids laughing)

750
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:42,739
Ow!

751
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,200
- So it got to the point where my parents,

752
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,710
they threatened to disown me
if I didn't get straight A's.

753
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,030
I always did what everyone else wanted.

754
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,580
I graduated honor society.

755
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,390
I was graduated summa cum laude.

756
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,330
I was valedictorian of my high school.

757
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,140
I won award after award.

758
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,150
I have plaques in my closet that I won

759
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,220
for one thing or the other.

760
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,600
Be a doctor, they said.

761
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,290
It will honor the family.

762
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,923
Everyone will say, ooh, she's a doctor.

763
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:15,493
(Linda sighing)

764
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:18,010
I can't stand it when they come
in here with their bullshit.

765
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,080
They can pay me all the money in the world

766
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,970
and I still, I don't give a damn.

767
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,580
I want to say, oh, so
your father rejected you?

768
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,590
I'm so sorry.

769
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,430
I'm so sorry that your dead
dog meant everything to you.

770
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,950
Oh, so your neighbor touched you?

771
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,630
Aw, I'm so sorry that you
feel inadequate as a man.

772
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,700
I'm so sorry.

773
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
I'm sorry that your mother
beat you with hangers.

774
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,880
But you know what?

775
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,930
I want to say, session's
over, session's over.

776
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,670
Get out, you dysfunctional degenerate.

777
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,690
No one cares.

778
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,170
- Hmm, I thought you
seemed a little distant

779
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,210
when I mentioned my fear of knives.

780
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,043
- No, not you.

781
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,743
You're the only one who has a clue.

782
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,913
- Wow, should call my mother for this.

783
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,670
- You're the only one
who's doing what he loves.

784
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,600
You are pursuing your dreams,
even if you suck at it.

785
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,593
- Hmm, well, I am not good with kids.

786
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:07,033
They just don't like me.

787
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,900
Should've seen the way
they were pulling my hair.

788
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,000
One of 'em gave me a wedgie.

789
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,980
It was such a disaster.

790
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,177
- I'm sure it wasn't you.

791
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,827
- Oh, it was me. I'm the problem.

792
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,020
I mean, a good magician would've
known how to handle 'em.

793
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,570
- It was your first show.

794
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,970
- Well, I'm thinkin' maybe
it should be my last.

795
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,352
Look, um, I just can't do it.

796
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,880
I'm not any good.

797
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,030
- Why do you say that?

798
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,040
- Because I have nothing going for me.

799
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,660
I have nothing.

800
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,773
I can't even swim.

801
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,720
- It's important to avoid
people who aren't going

802
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,493
to encourage success in your life.

803
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,100
I got you something.

804
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,933
- Wow.

805
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,060
You're like the tooth fairy for egos.

806
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,930
- It's nothing big, but I thought
you could benefit from it.

807
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,170
Are you much of a reader?

808
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,893
- Well, you know.

809
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:00,887
"Where the Wild Things Are."

810
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,663
Couple of Dr. Seuss's.

811
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:06,496
- Perfect.

812
00:37:12,884 --> 00:37:14,316
(Floyd chuckling)

813
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,020
- "The Little Engine That Could".

814
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,110
For my confidence. Thanks.

815
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,960
- I have more confidence
in you than you do.

816
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,130
- [Floyd] Really?

817
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:23,963
- Absolutely.

818
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,513
- You know, I wondered last
week if you like dill pickles.

819
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:32,340
(Floyd chuckling)

820
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,623
Do you like dill pickles?

821
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,063
- I like a good dill pickle now and then.

822
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,413
- Me, too.

823
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,907
Well, that's...

824
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:45,272
- That's what?

825
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,087
- It's just,

826
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:51,914
I don't know.

827
00:37:51,914 --> 00:37:56,803
Do you ever feel like just
really alone in this world?

828
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,730
I mean, I don't know you really.

829
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,280
Are you married?

830
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,480
Sorry, you don't have to answer that.

831
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,313
- I'm not.

832
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,900
- What? Lonely or married?

833
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,340
- I'm not married.

834
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,610
My mother told me when I
was 10 that even nice guys

835
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,910
aren't that nice.

836
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,743
- Oh.

837
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,320
Sounds like you have a
few issues of your own.

838
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,878
Hey, I know a good shrink.

839
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:23,813
- You know what I admire about you, Floyd?

840
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,160
- I have something to be admired?

841
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,600
- You don't care that you're a failure.

842
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,193
- Wow, first a compliment,
then a smack in the face.

843
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,260
You're like Zsa Zsa Gabor.

844
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,010
- You're one of the
few people who realizes

845
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,370
that life isn't about money.

846
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,580
It's about doing what you love,

847
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,623
even if it means taking the
time to find your magic.

848
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:50,618
(gentle classical music)

849
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,870
(thumping groovy music)

850
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,002
- [Floyd] My god.

851
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,410
- Hey, dude.

852
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,120
What can I get for you?

853
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,140
- Well.

854
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,240
- Hey, you want a little thrill?

855
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,557
We've got a new thing, goes
places you never knew you had.

856
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:23,600
And requires only two AA batteries.

857
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,433
- Uh.

858
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,640
I'd just like to speak to a gentleman

859
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,760
by the name of Rod, please.

860
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,930
- What you want with Rod?

861
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,830
- Well, actually, see,
I'm a magician, and uh-

862
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,360
- Hey, Rod.

863
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,713
You got some guy up here
who's lookin' for ya.

864
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,760
- What is it, man?

865
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,610
- Hey, Big Rod. How you doin'?

866
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,850
It's me, little Floyd, the magician.

867
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,263
Um, I came by to pick up my check.

868
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,040
- Who the hell are you?

869
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:57,823
- The magician, remember?

870
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,290
- No, man.

871
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,610
- Come on, I spoke to you out front.

872
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,223
I did the show for your son, Johnny.

873
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,967
- Look, man. I ain't got no son.

874
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,400
Now, you either buy something
or take your ass out of here.

875
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,233
- You heard him.

876
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,920
Either buy something or get out.

877
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,530
We don't need any dregs in
here draggin' this place down.

878
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,600
- I am not a dreg.

879
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,930
Listen, sir, Rod.

880
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,710
What about the birthday
party for your kid?

881
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,390
With your wife, you know?

882
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,473
The one that just got
out of the can, can, can.

883
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,420
- Dude, you better get out now,

884
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,100
'cause this guy's got
an extra Y chromosome.

885
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,020
- Does this mean I don't get the 10% off?

886
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,990
I actually saw something
there I really could use.

887
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,250
Oh, ow. Excuse me.

888
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,083
Sorry, miss.

889
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:42,916
Oh, my. Oh!

890
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,570
Uh, yeah.

891
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,660
Okay, I'll just take
something in a leather hood.

892
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,782
Thank you.

893
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:48,673
(items clattering)

894
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:49,506
Sorry. Ow!

895
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,303
Hello?

896
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,920
Whoa! (laughing)

897
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,410
That's, ooh, you got me good.

898
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,243
That's good.

899
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,580
Ooh.

900
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,090
- Yeah, so what can I do for ya?

901
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,470
- I spoke to you once before.

902
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,505
I was considering doing magic.

903
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,680
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,530
How's that goin'?

905
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,600
- Oh, it's not been going too well.

906
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,073
- Ah, not gettin' any gigs?

907
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,990
- No, I'm getting gigs.

908
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,570
- Rabbit acting up?

909
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,490
- No, Bessy's fine.

910
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,102
- So what's the matter?

911
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:27,352
- I don't know.

912
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,343
Just the people, they just don't,

913
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,802
you know, wanna pay much.

914
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:37,222
- Ah, I know what you need.

915
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:38,055
- You do?

916
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,220
- Oh, yeah.

917
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,470
You need the big trick.

918
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,260
You need the trick that makes the money

919
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,510
disappear from their wallets
and appear in your pocket.

920
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,290
You need the boost to business.

921
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,080
- Yeah, exactly.

922
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,860
That's it, that's exactly what I need.

923
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,669
A boost to business, that's for sure.

924
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:58,160
Do you, um, do you have that?

925
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
- I have everything.

926
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:01,597
- Oh, great.

927
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,487
And how much does this cost?

928
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,490
- [Salesman] $195.

929
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,706
- Whoa-ho!

930
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:10,620
- It makes its money back right away.

931
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,453
- Uh-huh.

932
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,010
And uh, what does this do?

933
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,400
- Oh, be careful with those.

934
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,920
Those are smoke chips.

935
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,975
Very good.

936
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:19,908
They're very good for
getting you out of a jam.

937
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:20,830
- What kind of a jam?

938
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,400
- Oh, you'll know when you're in it.

939
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,850
- And how does this work?

940
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,100
- Well, you just read
the directions carefully,

941
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,610
and you gotta keep practicing,

942
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,920
'cause if you don't know it,
it'll get ya into trouble.

943
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,010
And don't reveal a secret.

944
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,479
- Except to my assistant.

945
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:36,250
- Exactly.

946
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,740
- Okay, I'll take 'em.

947
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,827
- Will this be cash or charge?

948
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:42,660
- Oh, charge. (chuckling)

949
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,993
- Why do I come to work?

950
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:48,245
(traffic humming)

951
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:01,616
(paper ripping)

952
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,330
- Place right hand on right shoulder

953
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,670
and as you reach in with the left,

954
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,563
be sure to distract your
subject with the right.

955
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,453
Hey, look at that.

956
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,450
- Well, hey.

957
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,513
Are you a magician?

958
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,573
- Are you a locksmith?

959
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:38,743
- Yeah, yeah, this thing
is really messed up here.

960
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:42,833
- Smith your lock, okay?

961
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,137
(knuckles rapping)

962
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:52,524
(door creaking)

963
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,323
Ma?

964
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,493
Nurse! Nurse!

965
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,830
My mother.

966
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,663
Where's my mother?

967
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:04,500
Where is she?

968
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,880
- Well, she said she couldn't breathe.

969
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,660
I wanted to give her
oxygen, but she refused it,

970
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,600
so I let her go out to the courtyard.

971
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,433
Maybe all she needed was some fresh air.

972
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:17,310
(lighthearted music)

973
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:21,820
- Ma?

974
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,530
- I said I didn't want any oxygen.

975
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,667
- So don't have any oxygen.

976
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,030
- Oh. (chuckling)

977
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,450
I didn't think it was you.

978
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:33,910
- What are you trying to do to me?

979
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,100
- I couldn't take that room.

980
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,933
- So I hear.

981
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:38,360
I saw the empty bed.

982
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,543
- What'd you think? I was dead?

983
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:41,790
- With you, I don't know what to think.

984
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,757
- I feel the same way about you.

985
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,870
- Oh, did I tell you?

986
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,270
I did a magic show at a
pimp's illegitimate son's

987
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,380
birthday party.

988
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,213
- That's nice.

989
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,660
- All right, look. Fine, fine.

990
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,160
Come live with me if you want.

991
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,710
But I'm warning you now,
it's a horrible place.

992
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,720
It's a mess, and I hope
you're not afraid of mice,

993
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,257
'cause I got a lot of 'em.

994
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,660
So just, just go get your things

995
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,163
and come on over, all right?

996
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:15,843
- Are you serious?

997
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:18,249
- Yeah.

998
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,423
- You gonna make me breakfast?

999
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,468
- All right.

1000
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,130
- What are you gonna make me?

1001
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,463
- Whatever you like.

1002
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:29,322
- I like Monte Cristos.

1003
00:45:29,322 --> 00:45:30,843
- Okay, Monte Cristos.

1004
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:32,490
- [Ida] I like Court TV.

1005
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,423
You got cable?

1006
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,700
- I'll get it, I'll get cable.

1007
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,775
- Can I have my friends over?

1008
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:40,670
- What friends?

1009
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,130
- You don't think I have friends?

1010
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,550
What about Esther Frankenburg?

1011
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,637
What do you call her?

1012
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,840
- Call her a lot of things.

1013
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,230
Fine, fine, have Esther
Frankenburg over for tea,

1014
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,063
for whatever.

1015
00:45:51,063 --> 00:45:51,896
I don't care, doesn't matter to me.

1016
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:54,920
I'll probably drown
myself in some storm pipe.

1017
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,220
- [Ida] Don't talk stupid.

1018
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,040
- I'll go get your things.

1019
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,317
- I'm not coming.

1020
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,823
- What do you mean?

1021
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,590
- Which part didn't you understand?

1022
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,443
I'll talk slower.

1023
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,220
- You're not coming?

1024
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,598
- No, but you get credit anyway.

1025
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:15,640
- I don't believe this.

1026
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,421
- Well, believe it.

1027
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,330
I'm not coming.

1028
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,610
I just wanted to hear you offer it.

1029
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,460
- So all this time, you didn't
want to come live with me?

1030
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,493
You're sick.

1031
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,510
There's something wrong with you.

1032
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,050
- It obviously runs in the family.

1033
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,050
I never said I didn't
want to live with you.

1034
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,090
I just said I'm not coming.

1035
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,840
Big difference.

1036
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,970
Sometimes, sometimes
it's just nice to know

1037
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:42,983
that you're wanted.

1038
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,473
- Never said I wanted you.

1039
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:46,517
I said you could come live with me.

1040
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,573
- That's the way to talk to an old woman.

1041
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,400
- Goodbye, Mom.

1042
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,660
- Wait.

1043
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,763
I changed my mind.

1044
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,613
- Sleep well.

1045
00:46:57,613 --> 00:46:58,953
- Floyd, I'm dying.

1046
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,243
- What?

1047
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:05,445
- Just kidding.

1048
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,830
(soft gentle music)

1049
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,583
- [Yolanda] Good evening,
I'm Yolanda Vega.

1050
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,740
- Hello, Yolanda.

1051
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,573
I love you!

1052
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:26,650
Come on.

1053
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,600
- [Yolanda] Six.

1054
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,733
26.

1055
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,939
56.

1056
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:34,719
- 56.

1057
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,398
- [Yolanda] 15.

1058
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:39,280
30.

1059
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,753
- 30!

1060
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:41,968
55.

1061
00:47:41,968 --> 00:47:43,250
- [Yolanda] 55.

1062
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,350
- 55!

1063
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,536
55!

1064
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:46,795
- [Yolanda] And bonus number 14.

1065
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:48,193
- Ha ha ha!

1066
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:49,026
Yee-haw!

1067
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,558
I love you, Yolanda!

1068
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:54,308
Thank you, thank you!

1069
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,622
(audience applauding)

1070
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:02,015
I win!

1071
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:05,761
I win!

1072
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:09,591
(Floyd laughing)

1073
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:19,204
(water dripping)
(woman moaning)

1074
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:33,548
(bus rumbling)

1075
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:39,056
(gentle contemplative music)

1076
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:49,936
Thank you.

1077
00:48:50,977 --> 00:48:51,810
Hee-ha.

1078
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,614
(bus rumbling)

1079
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:05,741
(gentle contemplative music)

1080
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,307
- I, um, I like your robe.

1081
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:21,220
(Floyd chuckling)

1082
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,300
- St. Vincent's thrift shop.

1083
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,950
- That's where I got these shoes.

1084
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:32,282
(soft gentle music)

1085
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,458
You are right.

1086
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,981
They make them really great here.

1087
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:42,356
- I told you.

1088
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:43,847
Here.

1089
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,886
Picked you up some flowers.

1090
00:49:45,886 --> 00:49:49,032
(fingers snapping)

1091
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:50,590
Ta-da!

1092
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,533
- How sweet.
(Floyd chuckling)

1093
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,370
- Actually, I need those back. Sorry.

1094
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,153
They're special, see?

1095
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:02,151
They pop up, see?

1096
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:04,896
(fingers snapping)
(Floyd whistling)

1097
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:06,007
- It's the thought that counts, anyway.

1098
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,150
You still get the credit.

1099
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,983
- Thanks.

1100
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,690
So you ever bet on the horses?

1101
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,810
- I'm really not into that.

1102
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,970
- Oh, yeah. Sorry. (chuckling)

1103
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,803
Nevermind.

1104
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,063
So, tell me more about yourself.

1105
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:27,700
- About what?

1106
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,673
- About you.

1107
00:50:29,574 --> 00:50:30,407
- I don't know.

1108
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,013
- Sorry, I'm not good at this.

1109
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,503
- You're not too bad, either.

1110
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:42,076
- Really?

1111
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,900
- I played lotto a couple of times.

1112
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,733
- Oh, yeah? Really?

1113
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:48,556
- Yeah, sure, but I never
really won anything.

1114
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:51,746
I guess I'm just not a lucky person.

1115
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:53,510
- I don't know.

1116
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,713
On the other hand, you
might be very lucky.

1117
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,523
Think you might be interested
in being an assistant

1118
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:04,053
to a bad magician?

1119
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:06,627
(Floyd blowing)

1120
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:09,659
(Lulu chuckling)

1121
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:12,409
(water dripping)

1122
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,700
Number 28.

1123
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,010
Graciously acknowledge
the thunderous applause

1124
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,910
as you drop the rope onto
the table or in your pocket.

1125
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,400
All right, Bessy, let's give this a try.

1126
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,900
We have three strands of
rope, different lengths.

1127
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,013
Watch closely.

1128
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,363
Three, ready?

1129
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:37,103
One, two, three. (chuckling)

1130
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:43,143
- Bastard changed the locks.

1131
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,670
(doorknob rattling)

1132
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,160
You bastard!

1133
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,649
You changed the locks!

1134
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:50,404
(doorknob rattling)

1135
00:51:50,404 --> 00:51:51,323
- One, two, three.

1136
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:54,832
Thank you.

1137
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:58,020
Thank you very much.
(electricity zapping)

1138
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,075
Oh, shit.
(rabbit crunching)

1139
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,949
(audience applauding)

1140
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:05,076
Thank you.

1141
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:06,918
Thank you very much.

1142
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:10,085
(audience applauding)

1143
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:14,014
And now my lovely
assistant Lulu will select

1144
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:17,310
a volunteer from the
audience for our final trick.

1145
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,250
We prefer no magicians or lawyers.

1146
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,450
Just don't like lawyers.

1147
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,793
Givin' you the full
treatment here, brother.

1148
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,163
Step on in there.

1149
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,060
And then what I will attempt to do

1150
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,040
is turn Mr. Ryan here into a rabbit.

1151
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,490
You can hold on to your
doggie there if you like.

1152
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,663
Hurry up now.

1153
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:43,500
I want to get home in time for
Seinfeld reruns. (chuckling)

1154
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,667
Okay, and now.

1155
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,223
A-la peanut butter sandwiches!

1156
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:52,868
(audience applauding)

1157
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:54,167
Thank you.

1158
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,962
As you can see.

1159
00:52:55,962 --> 00:52:57,179
(Floyd sneezing)

1160
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:59,537
The trunk is totally empty.

1161
00:52:59,537 --> 00:53:02,064
(audience applauding and cheering)

1162
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:04,064
Oh, well, almost forgot.

1163
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,302
You really want him back?

1164
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:09,079
(audience applauding and cheering)

1165
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:10,531
You sure now?

1166
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:11,364
Mr. Ryan.

1167
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:14,630
Come on out.

1168
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,528
(audience applauding and cheering)

1169
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,788
Let's give him a big hand, everybody.

1170
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:21,272
Mr. Ryan, thank you.

1171
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:22,619
Mr. Ryan Toddsworth.

1172
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,971
Thank you for all your help.

1173
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,890
So, once again I'd like to
thank my assistant Lulu,

1174
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,585
and all of you for being
such a wonderful audience.

1175
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:29,847
Thank you and goodnight.

1176
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:33,217
(audience applauding and cheering)

1177
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:35,210
- You were incredible tonight.

1178
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,590
- So were you.

1179
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,010
The perfect assistant.

1180
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,980
- The amazing thing is he
didn't even have a clue.

1181
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,461
- I know.

1182
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:42,985
How much did we get exactly?

1183
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:46,010
- 846 bucks.

1184
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,735
- Can't believe it.

1185
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:50,605
I haven't seen 800 bucks in
one shot since my aunt died.

1186
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:51,490
This is incredible.

1187
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,297
- Plus, we did get 150
bucks for doing the show.

1188
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,780
(Floyd laughing)

1189
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,613
- Yeah.

1190
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:59,490
Too bad we can't do this professionally.

1191
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,290
(Floyd laughing)

1192
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:09,290
See, the secret is all
in the presentation.

1193
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,340
See, it's all sleight of hand.

1194
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:14,140
So, people are looking over there.

1195
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,920
And over here, you do anything you want,

1196
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,593
and they never notice, see?

1197
00:54:19,777 --> 00:54:21,157
Ta-da!

1198
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,530
You know how when you were in school

1199
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,130
and someone came in the room late?

1200
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,300
Everybody turns their head to look, right?

1201
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,530
It's natural instinct.

1202
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,740
Well, in that moment the teacher can do

1203
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,290
anything he wants and you'd never notice.

1204
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:37,160
See, so the key is to like be
able to focus the attention.

1205
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,143
I'll show ya. Here.

1206
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,693
Hey.

1207
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,560
Look at that.

1208
00:54:49,195 --> 00:54:52,586
(kisses smacking)

1209
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:55,419
(Floyd chuckling)

1210
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:02,000
(kisses smacking)

1211
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,833
That's when the magic happens.

1212
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,385
(phone ringing)

1213
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:08,385
- Ignore it.

1214
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,471
Ignore it.

1215
00:55:11,471 --> 00:55:13,364
- What if it's a job?

1216
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:14,495
- What if it's not a job?

1217
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:15,755
- But what if it is?

1218
00:55:15,755 --> 00:55:17,541
- It's probably just a wrong number.

1219
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,444
- What if it isn't?

1220
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:20,810
Oh.

1221
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,110
I gotta get it. I'm sorry.

1222
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,597
Hello?

1223
00:55:24,597 --> 00:55:27,730
- Floyd, it's Dr. Kircshner.

1224
00:55:28,995 --> 00:55:30,240
Linda?

1225
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,300
- Oh, yeah.

1226
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,150
Hey.

1227
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,930
- Am I disturbing you?

1228
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,120
- No, no, no, not at all.

1229
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,280
Just, uh, fooling around.

1230
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,840
- Oh, I wondered what happened to you.

1231
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,270
You missed our appointment.

1232
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,103
- Oh, right.

1233
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,480
Oh my god, right. Of course.

1234
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,130
Uh.

1235
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,810
You know, I just totally forgot.

1236
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,940
I'm really sorry. (chuckling)

1237
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,773
- That's okay.

1238
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:53,350
As long as everything's all right?

1239
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,623
- Oh yeah, it's great. Thanks.

1240
00:55:55,623 --> 00:55:58,041
- [Linda] Okay, I'm looking
forward to seeing you.

1241
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,110
- Yeah, great.

1242
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,023
Take care. Bye.

1243
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:05,220
(kisses smacking)

1244
00:56:07,814 --> 00:56:10,981
(bright upbeat music)

1245
00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:21,094
Thank you.
(group applauding)

1246
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:23,687
- And now for our final trick.

1247
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:26,854
(bright upbeat music)

1248
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,107
- Now for my final trick.

1249
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:37,274
(bright upbeat music)

1250
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,199
And for our final trick,

1251
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,251
we'd like a volunteer from the audience.

1252
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:52,419
(women laughing)

1253
00:56:52,419 --> 00:56:55,586
(bright upbeat music)

1254
00:57:02,123 --> 00:57:03,582
Thank you.

1255
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:04,717
Thank you very much.

1256
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:05,700
Thank you.

1257
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,487
And for our final trick...

1258
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:11,654
(bright upbeat music)

1259
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:19,000
(crowd applauding)

1260
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,917
Lulu! Lulu!

1261
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:24,374
(bright upbeat music)

1262
00:57:40,818 --> 00:57:41,651
Hmm.

1263
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:45,691
Who's been good today?

1264
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:48,941
(bright upbeat music)

1265
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,589
Let's count this fast.

1266
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:02,330
Get it down to Garber

1267
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,000
before he leaves so he can
get these lights back on, huh?

1268
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,833
Okay.

1269
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,530
I got it.

1270
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,363
Let's go.

1271
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,620
(knuckles rapping)

1272
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,453
- Well?

1273
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,663
What the hell do you want?

1274
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:28,790
- Here's all the rent.

1275
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,360
(Floyd blowing)

1276
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,270
Sorry about the delay.

1277
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:36,475
Won't happen again.

1278
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,310
(Garber laughing)

1279
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,090
- Listen, cutie.

1280
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,880
If you think you're
getting into a good thing

1281
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,490
by prostituting yourself
for this no-good bum,

1282
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,140
I suggest you get your head examined.

1283
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,550
- You don't hear her complaining.

1284
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,670
- Yeah, I ain't complaining.

1285
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,840
- Christ.

1286
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,060
All right, I'll get the
electric and the water

1287
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,340
turned back on, but you
better not make one,

1288
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,760
little miscappipin' excuse next month.

1289
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,920
I'm tellin' ya!

1290
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,650
I don't care if you bring me enough money

1291
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,740
to fill up this entire room, you're out!

1292
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,420
You got it?
- Got it.

1293
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,910
Come on, Lulu.
- Uh, listen.

1294
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,093
Uh, girlie.

1295
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,150
If you wanna make a little extra money,

1296
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,150
you know where I am.

1297
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:19,701
(door slamming)

1298
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:22,440
(door slamming)

1299
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,563
- Hey, Lu, come on.

1300
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,698
Come practice with me.

1301
00:59:26,698 --> 00:59:27,698
- [Lulu] No.

1302
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,783
- Come on, don't be this way.

1303
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,120
Come on into bed.

1304
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,953
Let's work on this stuff.

1305
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:36,950
- [Lulu] No, I told you already.

1306
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,643
I'm not wasting my time on, on that crap.

1307
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,493
- You know, it hurts me when
you start talking like that.

1308
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,910
- Yeah, well, I feel the same exact way.

1309
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,274
- Come on, we got a
couple of gigs coming up.

1310
00:59:52,274 --> 00:59:53,760
We're gettin' closer, you know?

1311
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,970
The show's gettin' bigger.

1312
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,380
Pretty soon we won't have
to do anymore picking.

1313
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,210
- Are you out of your mind?

1314
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,090
That picking is the only future you got.

1315
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:03,570
You think you can build
your lame, little magic show

1316
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,070
into some kind of Copperfield?

1317
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,090
Really, really think
you should start going

1318
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,340
to that shrink again, 'cause
you have some major delusions

1319
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,290
about what you think you're capable of.

1320
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:18,770
(Lulu sighing)

1321
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:22,743
Floyd, if you want to be with me, honey,

1322
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,280
you're gonna have to start thinking about

1323
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,563
what's good for us.

1324
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,950
- I thought I was.

1325
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,933
I mean-
- Shhh, shhh, shhh.

1326
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,977
Listen, get yourself dressed

1327
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:38,763
and we'll go out and make
ourselves some money picking.

1328
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,570
Then later we could come back here and...

1329
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,483
- Practice the magic?

1330
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,663
- No!

1331
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,603
Count up the money!

1332
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,026
Just, let's go.

1333
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:03,112
(Floyd sighing)

1334
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:20,037
(upbeat jazzy music)

1335
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:28,897
- I'm gonna jump!

1336
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,607
- Oh my god, she's gonna jump!

1337
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:32,772
Oh my god!

1338
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,412
- I'm gonna jump!

1339
01:01:34,412 --> 01:01:36,108
- Oh my god, I can't believe it!

1340
01:01:36,108 --> 01:01:37,356
She's gonna jump!

1341
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:39,878
Oh my god, it's gonna be horrible!

1342
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:41,295
She's gonna jump!

1343
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:45,233
(upbeat jazzy music)

1344
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:50,807
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1345
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:52,652
- Hey, buddy.

1346
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:53,620
You dropped your wallet.

1347
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
- [Floyd] Thank you.

1348
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:05,132
(Lulu screaming)

1349
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:21,879
(upbeat jazzy music)

1350
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,273
(sign buzzing)

1351
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:52,765
(Floyd groaning)

1352
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:04,198
Oh, god.

1353
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,270
- That was some performance.

1354
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:12,220
(Floyd chuckling)

1355
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,520
- I had a great assistant.

1356
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,793
You know, I was at the
magic store the other day.

1357
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,521
I saw this really cool trick.

1358
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:23,800
I think it's gonna be great in the act.

1359
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,300
I bet the kids are gonna love it, too.

1360
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,968
- What's with you already?

1361
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:29,423
I told you forget the magic.

1362
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,810
(Floyd sighing)

1363
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,460
- What do you mean forget the magic?

1364
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,290
- We're making 10 times
the amount of money

1365
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:44,510
in half the time picking around town.

1366
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,820
With the magic, we waste the whole night

1367
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,561
with those lame tricks.

1368
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:49,560
If you end up taking one
guy's wallet and he's broke,

1369
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,450
we wasted the whole night.

1370
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,000
- How can you say we
wasted the whole night?

1371
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,090
We did a great performance.

1372
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,733
We did what we love most.

1373
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,120
- No.

1374
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,953
You did.

1375
01:04:00,953 --> 01:04:02,453
We did what you love the most.

1376
01:04:04,018 --> 01:04:04,950
- Well, you too.

1377
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,800
I mean, I thought this
whole thing was about magic.

1378
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,960
- No, Floyd, I don't care about the magic.

1379
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,340
It's about making the money.

1380
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,200
You want it, you look for it,
you see it and you take it.

1381
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,697
Abracadabra, my ass.

1382
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:22,530
(Lulu sighing)

1383
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:23,513
- So that's it?

1384
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,210
We're just gonna drop the whole act?

1385
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,270
- That's it.

1386
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,460
I'm through!

1387
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,410
I've had enough pretending I'm
floating all over the stage.

1388
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,150
- Well, I don't want to
pick anymore pockets,

1389
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,352
so how about that?

1390
01:04:34,352 --> 01:04:35,390
- How about you most certainly are?

1391
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,223
- What?

1392
01:04:36,223 --> 01:04:37,400
- I said you absolutely will.

1393
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,320
Before you met me, you were nothing.

1394
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,410
None of this would've
happened if you didn't

1395
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,910
have me as your assistant.

1396
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,350
- I thought you wanted to be my assistant.

1397
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,460
- I was desperate and I was broke.

1398
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,080
And a desperate, broke
girl will do anything

1399
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,363
for a roof over her head.

1400
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:57,103
Even sleep with a guy like you.

1401
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,731
(Lulu sighing)

1402
01:05:05,895 --> 01:05:07,830
Are you just gonna piss the day away?

1403
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:08,663
Come on, get up.

1404
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:11,580
We're gonna miss the rush
hour push at Grand Central.

1405
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,290
Get dressed.

1406
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,620
Comb your hair. You look like hell.

1407
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,580
I don't know how you got
along before you met me.

1408
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,683
I saved your ass big time!

1409
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:45,137
- Wait a minute.

1410
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:46,973
Lulu.

1411
01:05:50,066 --> 01:05:52,899
(traffic humming)

1412
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,077
Let's skip this guy. He's seen us.

1413
01:06:07,077 --> 01:06:09,310
- No, I got a hunch he's loaded.

1414
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,010
Did you see that diamond
mine he was staring at

1415
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:11,843
in the glass case?

1416
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:12,970
- So what? He's seen us.

1417
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,210
If we do anything, he's seen us.

1418
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:16,230
- I hate it when you get like this.

1419
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,130
- Like what?

1420
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,600
- Just be quiet, will you?

1421
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,453
I'll handle it!

1422
01:06:21,548 --> 01:06:23,310
- [Floyd] Shit.

1423
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,780
- Officer, those are the two individuals

1424
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,650
that were following me.

1425
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,950
- Uh, this man says
you've been following him.

1426
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,580
- We were just on our way to the, um-

1427
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,630
- We've done nothing of the sort.

1428
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,670
Now if you'll excuse me.

1429
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:33,710
- [Man] Thank you, officer.

1430
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,500
- Yeah, uh, I suggest you
get a cab on the next street.

1431
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,490
- Come on, Floyd.

1432
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,323
- Floyd?

1433
01:06:38,323 --> 01:06:40,020
- Idiot, what did you
tell him my name for?

1434
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,810
- What's the big deal?
We haven't done anything.

1435
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,130
- What's in the big bag, ma'am?

1436
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:45,210
- Look, officer, she just
told you we weren't following

1437
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,150
any guy around.

1438
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:48,160
- I wasn't talking to you, Floyd.

1439
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,070
- I don't have to tell you squat.

1440
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,200
- Don't rile him up.

1441
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,530
- No. Who the hell does he think he is?

1442
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,600
We probably make a hundred
times what he does in a day.

1443
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,944
So you can just take your
blue collar whoozy ass

1444
01:06:56,944 --> 01:06:58,218
out of our way.
- [Floyd] Lulu.

1445
01:06:58,218 --> 01:06:59,051
- All right, you know, I'd
like you to come with me

1446
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:00,190
down to the station.

1447
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,560
- No way in hell. Come on, Floyd.

1448
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,920
- Uh, I prefer if you
would come voluntarily.

1449
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,810
- Okay, we'll come.

1450
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,880
- No way in hell!

1451
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,931
- Lulu, what are you doing?

1452
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:08,940
- You have the right to remain silent.

1453
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:09,937
- Shut up.

1454
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:11,150
- [Floyd] Lulu, I said-

1455
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:11,983
- He thinks he's gonna inconvience me!

1456
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:13,010
- [Cop] You have the right to an attorney.

1457
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:13,843
- Just shut up!

1458
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:16,090
I told ya to just shut up.

1459
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,140
You're just gonna get
yourself in more trouble.

1460
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,270
She's sorry, officer.

1461
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,137
- [Cop] If you can't afford one,

1462
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,197
one will be provided for you.
- Let go!

1463
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:23,630
- [Floyd] Can we just call
this a bad misunderstanding?

1464
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:24,510
- I said let go!

1465
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,353
- [Floyd] Officer.

1466
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:29,690
- You! You don't move!

1467
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,940
You're under arrest, too!

1468
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,146
(smoke whooshing)

1469
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:38,646
(Lulu and Floyd coughing)

1470
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:46,210
- Why did you have to start up with him?

1471
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,790
- What happened?

1472
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:51,400
- I saved your butt, that's what happened.

1473
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,160
- How did we? Was I drinking?

1474
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,993
- No.

1475
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,130
Come on, let's go.

1476
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,826
- No, wait. Come on.

1477
01:07:57,826 --> 01:08:00,030
That was a really great trick.

1478
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,250
How'd you do that?

1479
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,720
- Oh, now you wanna know my secrets, huh?

1480
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,230
I think we'll wait to tell you that one.

1481
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,280
- Oh, come on. Seriously, come on.

1482
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,647
I'm your assistant.

1483
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,690
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hello.

1484
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,238
- I'm in the market for a hacksaw.

1485
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:15,707
- Yeah, yeah, a hacksaw.

1486
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:19,740
- Uh. (laughing)

1487
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,040
- Hacksaw, hacksaw.

1488
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,170
Yeah, I think we're out.

1489
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,150
- Ah, that's too bad.

1490
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:28,374
Uh, well, you happen to have anything

1491
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:31,520
that'll saw through metal?

1492
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,090
- Well, if you're desperate,

1493
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,600
I think uh, you could use the little metal

1494
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,700
saw blade in here,
little Swiss Army knife.

1495
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,030
Nice and sharp, huh?

1496
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,140
- Great.
- Cut through anything.

1497
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,260
- Yeah, great. We'll take it.

1498
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,160
- Good?
- Good.

1499
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,120
- Yeah?
- You made a sale.

1500
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,970
- All right.
- Good.

1501
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:44,803
- Good.

1502
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,123
- Stop!

1503
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:51,630
Look, I'm really
uncomfortable with this, okay?

1504
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,423
Come on, you know about my phobia!

1505
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:57,390
- Can you believe the
way we ditched that cop?

1506
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,720
- Yeah, he's probably out now looking for

1507
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,340
every Floyd in New York.

1508
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,603
- No chance.

1509
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,353
Wait a minute.

1510
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:08,015
I thought magicians
could escape handcuffs.

1511
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:10,580
- I'm not very good at handcuffs.

1512
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,376
It's kind of hard to practice.

1513
01:09:12,376 --> 01:09:15,130
- All right, you can
practice the handcuffs.

1514
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,390
I can't believe the load we got.

1515
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,355
It's incredible.

1516
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,940
- Ah.

1517
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,773
Ta-da!

1518
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,403
Oh my god.

1519
01:09:26,548 --> 01:09:29,600
(handcuffs clattering)

1520
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,433
Here.

1521
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,963
Have some more caviar.

1522
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,000
(Floyd chuckling)
- Mmm.

1523
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,030
Baby, it's just getting too easy.

1524
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,863
- Sure.

1525
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:45,290
I'm the one picking the pockets.

1526
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,450
All you do is distract 'em.

1527
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,423
And you almost fouled the
whole thing up tonight.

1528
01:09:49,423 --> 01:09:50,687
- I almost fouled it up?

1529
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,180
You're the one who that trying
to knuckle under that cop.

1530
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,614
If it was up to me-

1531
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:56,770
- If it was up to you
we'd be spending tonight

1532
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,270
eating meatloaf and succotash.

1533
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,170
- What's succotash?

1534
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,540
(phone ringing)

1535
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,140
- Oh, god. Who the heck is that?

1536
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,203
Yeah?

1537
01:10:09,203 --> 01:10:10,450
- Floyd, it's Cy.

1538
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,460
- Hey, Cy!

1539
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,410
How you doin'?

1540
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,483
Lulu, it's Cy.

1541
01:10:15,483 --> 01:10:16,372
- Oh, great.

1542
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:17,781
- [Cy] I've been trying
to get you all day.

1543
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,198
You've been out, I guess.

1544
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:20,200
(Floyd laughing)

1545
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,803
- Yeah, I guess. I've been out.

1546
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,360
- You forget your mother?

1547
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,890
- Forget her? No.

1548
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:28,160
- Well, we haven't seen
you down at the home

1549
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,260
in quite awhile.

1550
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,420
- Well, forgive me, you know?

1551
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,980
Some of us have lives to attend to.

1552
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,740
I mean, I can't sit around
all day, play Parcheesi.

1553
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,080
- Just don't forget about
your mother, that's all.

1554
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,172
My son, he met some little cutie.

1555
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:46,463
Big boobs, you know,
and, uh, little brains.

1556
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,970
That's the last I seen of him.

1557
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,120
Hasn't been around in months.

1558
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,760
Don't do that to Ida.

1559
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,483
She deserves more from you.

1560
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,620
- Look, I've been busy.

1561
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,453
You know what I'm sayin'?

1562
01:10:58,453 --> 01:11:00,210
Real busy, all right, Cy?

1563
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,150
I mean, come on.

1564
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,340
Don't start telling me how to take care

1565
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,850
of my mother, all right?

1566
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,870
I know all about my mother.

1567
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,600
I know exactly what's
going on with my mother.

1568
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,533
- Your mother had a stroke last night.

1569
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,933
- What?

1570
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,870
- [Cy] Floyd, are you there?

1571
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,823
- Yeah. Yup.

1572
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,670
- [Cy] It was a mild one,
but I think you ought to

1573
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,330
come over here.

1574
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,960
She'd like to see you.
(Floyd sighing)

1575
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,813
- Okay, thanks for calling, Cy.

1576
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:40,242
(machines beeping)

1577
01:11:42,402 --> 01:11:44,150
(Floyd sighing)

1578
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:44,983
Hi, Ma.

1579
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,613
It's Floyd.

1580
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:54,883
I'm here.

1581
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,310
Sorry I missed your
performance last night.

1582
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,050
I prefer you left the
really big shows to me.

1583
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:15,983
Sorry, Mom.

1584
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,088
(machines beeping)

1585
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:31,607
I'm sorry, Mom.

1586
01:12:43,149 --> 01:12:44,310
(Lulu sighing)

1587
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,520
- [Announcer] Was on vacation.

1588
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,293
Would you welcome Sharon.

1589
01:12:50,773 --> 01:12:53,679
(gun firing)

1590
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,910
(explosion booming)

1591
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:00,570
- Watch closely as I, the Amazing Mumford,

1592
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,950
say the magic word.

1593
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,685
A-la peanut butter sandwich!

1594
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:08,157
(explosion booming)

1595
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:11,738
(audience applauding)

1596
01:13:11,738 --> 01:13:15,155
(traffic humming softly)

1597
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,100
- Floyd, where have you been?

1598
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:30,713
- [Floyd] I don't know.

1599
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,203
- I've been concerned.

1600
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,714
- [Floyd] Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

1601
01:13:40,714 --> 01:13:42,014
- This is not about money.

1602
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,172
- What are you gonna tell me?

1603
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:46,005
That you care about me?

1604
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,720
That you care about my wellbeing?

1605
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,690
That I can still change?

1606
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,093
People don't change.

1607
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,100
We can all talk about how
we're trying to change,

1608
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,100
but everything's just the same as usual.

1609
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,300
- You're very hostile.

1610
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,543
- My mother had a stroke.

1611
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:07,143
- Floyd, I'm, I'm so sorry.

1612
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:12,240
- [Floyd] I think we
better put these sessions

1613
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,323
on hold for awhile.

1614
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,520
- Well, sounds to me like you
need them now more than ever.

1615
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,673
- [Floyd] What I need now
more than ever is to be alone.

1616
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,780
- I hope you keep in touch.

1617
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,253
- [Floyd] Yeah, maybe.

1618
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,983
(gentle jazzy piano music)

1619
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:59,889
(sign buzzing)
(gentle jazz music)

1620
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:30,734
(gentle jazzy piano music)

1621
01:16:47,045 --> 01:16:47,878
Lu?

1622
01:16:49,499 --> 01:16:51,248
(static crackling)

1623
01:16:51,248 --> 01:16:52,684
Lu?

1624
01:16:52,684 --> 01:16:55,601
(static crackling)

1625
01:16:56,663 --> 01:16:57,496
Lulu?

1626
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:07,854
(static crackling)
(water dripping)

1627
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:17,472
Shit.

1628
01:17:18,622 --> 01:17:19,455
Lulu?

1629
01:17:21,672 --> 01:17:22,505
Lulu?

1630
01:17:26,746 --> 01:17:27,746
God damn it!

1631
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,210
Bessy?

1632
01:17:32,977 --> 01:17:33,810
Bessy.

1633
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:35,503
Oh my god.

1634
01:17:41,444 --> 01:17:42,611
How could she?

1635
01:17:47,802 --> 01:17:48,635
Lulu!

1636
01:17:53,204 --> 01:17:57,210
- Well.
(thunder clapping)

1637
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,960
(rain pattering)

1638
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:05,331
(woman talking indistinctly)

1639
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:12,352
(soft gentle music)

1640
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,351
- I didn't sleep a wink last night.

1641
01:18:20,351 --> 01:18:21,622
It's the damndest thing.

1642
01:18:21,622 --> 01:18:23,214
I kept thinking about necking.

1643
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:26,047
(Floyd chuckling)

1644
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:30,423
- Oh.

1645
01:18:32,343 --> 01:18:34,054
I met this woman.

1646
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:35,554
- I had a feeling.

1647
01:18:37,235 --> 01:18:38,767
She's an actress.

1648
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:40,790
Well, she wants to be an actress.

1649
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,052
- Looks like she did a pretty good job.

1650
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,473
- (Floyd chuckling) Yeah.

1651
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:48,542
She wanted to be my assistant.

1652
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,070
- Just couldn't help yourself?

1653
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:51,903
- Right.

1654
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,720
Things started off great.

1655
01:18:56,602 --> 01:18:58,627
- They usually do.

1656
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:01,044
- Suddenly everything wasn't.

1657
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,730
I was doing things I'd never done before.

1658
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:10,463
Began wishing I'd never gone out

1659
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:11,703
in my pajamas at three
o'clock in the morning.

1660
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,253
Oh.

1661
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,500
You know, I've always
dreamt of finding a woman

1662
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,463
who hugs you back.

1663
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,643
Really hugs you back.

1664
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,770
So much that you could really feel

1665
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:30,553
every bit of hug coming back
that you're giving, you know?

1666
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,701
And when I imagine I'm with her,

1667
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,983
I try to remember how we met
so I can find her for real,

1668
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:42,740
but everything's blurry.

1669
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,120
I can't even think.

1670
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,170
Can't even figure out the trick.

1671
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,660
And it's not because I don't practice.

1672
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,150
I mean, it's not about practicing.

1673
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,360
I just think it can't be done.

1674
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,800
Maybe she doesn't exist at all.

1675
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,472
Maybe it's not even possible.

1676
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:58,734
- Anything's possible, Floyd.

1677
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:01,241
You've got to make your own magic.

1678
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:02,074
You.

1679
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:06,666
(soft gentle music)

1680
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:22,411
(birds chirping)

1681
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:28,581
- Miss!

1682
01:20:29,452 --> 01:20:30,285
Miss!

1683
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:34,700
(Floyd sneezing)

1684
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,450
Now I'll be able to work with rabbits?

1685
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,420
- I'll tell you, sir.

1686
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,077
No problem at all.

1687
01:20:40,114 --> 01:20:40,947
- Ah!

1688
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:45,400
(air whooshing)

1689
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,650
- Now, tell me.

1690
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:54,363
What immediate fears do
you have and what you seek?

1691
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,810
Quickly, try to capture
the core of what it is

1692
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,963
that's frightening you.

1693
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:02,510
- I'm afraid my insurance
isn't gonna cover this,

1694
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,963
but as far as the sharp objects,

1695
01:21:05,924 --> 01:21:07,330
I actually don't feel too badly.

1696
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,730
- Good, good!

1697
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:12,953
You'll feel even better
when we move on to machetes.

1698
01:21:15,183 --> 01:21:18,016
(water splashing)

1699
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,680
- This is my new rabbit, Esmeralda.

1700
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,500
- That would make a warm jacket.

1701
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,360
- Uh, we'll take everything.

1702
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,810
- Oh, will that be cash or credit?

1703
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:46,033
Don't tell me.

1704
01:21:52,053 --> 01:21:53,960
(phone ringing)

1705
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,003
- Get that, will ya?

1706
01:21:57,394 --> 01:21:58,227
- Yeah.

1707
01:21:58,227 --> 01:21:59,200
- [Floyd] Hey, Lu?

1708
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,750
It's me, Floyd.

1709
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,940
- What is it, Floyd?

1710
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,220
I'm in the middle of dinner.

1711
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,399
- Yeah, listen, I know
we had some rough times,

1712
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:08,090
and I don't blame you for
taking the money, okay?

1713
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,680
I want you to have it.

1714
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,660
But could you do me one favor?

1715
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,120
Could you, could you perform
in one more show with me?

1716
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,503
Be the greatest show ever, Lu.

1717
01:22:16,503 --> 01:22:18,310
I've been practicing some new tricks,

1718
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,070
and you know, practice
makes me much better.

1719
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,380
- I don't think so.

1720
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,223
- Look, I feel really badly
about the whole thing.

1721
01:22:23,223 --> 01:22:25,610
It's my fault, okay?

1722
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,890
But I'd just love it if you'd join me

1723
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,053
for one more show.

1724
01:22:30,203 --> 01:22:32,870
Huh? So how about it?

1725
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,523
- What's he want?

1726
01:22:34,523 --> 01:22:36,922
- [Lulu] He wants me to
do one last show with him.

1727
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:38,170
- Do it.

1728
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,790
See if we can get him for more money.

1729
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,173
I saw a great pair of sandals, a favor.

1730
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:48,353
- Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

1731
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,303
When is it?

1732
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:51,136
- Great, next week.

1733
01:22:51,136 --> 01:22:53,010
I'll call you with the details.

1734
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:53,850
Yeah.

1735
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,683
Bye, Lu.

1736
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,210
- [Announcer] And now,
the master of magic,

1737
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:05,750
the prince of hocus pocus,
the ringmaster of the ruse,

1738
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,423
the Amazing Floydini!

1739
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:13,261
(audience applauding)

1740
01:23:15,232 --> 01:23:17,493
- Thank you. Thank you.

1741
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:20,660
(audience applauding)

1742
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:25,989
(crowd oohing and ahhing)

1743
01:23:29,508 --> 01:23:32,591
(handcuffs clicking)

1744
01:23:36,556 --> 01:23:40,389
(Floyd inhaling and exhaling)

1745
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:44,740
(water splashing)

1746
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,687
(audience applauding)

1747
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:06,872
(dramatic music)

1748
01:24:09,288 --> 01:24:12,038
(blade thudding)

1749
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,200
This is it, Lu.

1750
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,990
- When you get the wallet, give it to me.

1751
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:25,568
- I had a dream last night
I was midway through life

1752
01:24:25,568 --> 01:24:27,080
and standing on a huge mountain.

1753
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,660
- What are you talking about?

1754
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,145
- I looked down, Lu.

1755
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:32,097
- So what?

1756
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:34,070
- And I wasn't at the bottom in a rut.

1757
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,903
I wasn't there at all.

1758
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,350
I was really high, almost near the top.

1759
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:38,183
- Yeah, okay, fine.

1760
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:39,515
Just get me the wallet.

1761
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:40,490
- I finally hit it, Lu.

1762
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,470
I finally hit the jackpot.

1763
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,860
You helped me realize
what I really wanted.

1764
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,758
Thank you, Lu.

1765
01:24:47,758 --> 01:24:49,508
- I don't understand.

1766
01:24:51,014 --> 01:24:51,847
- And now.

1767
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:57,803
Would you kindly stand up?

1768
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:00,601
(audience applauding)

1769
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:02,027
Thank you!

1770
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:05,194
(audience applauding)

1771
01:25:07,077 --> 01:25:10,039
Let's give him a big hand
for this saw, please.

1772
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:13,206
(audience applauding)

1773
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:20,369
This one's for Bessy.

1774
01:25:23,433 --> 01:25:25,587
I'd also like to thank my assistant

1775
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:29,920
for helping me realize what
true magic is all about.

1776
01:25:31,385 --> 01:25:34,938
And I'd like to thank
you, the entire audience.

1777
01:25:34,938 --> 01:25:37,438
You've all been most generous.

1778
01:25:38,668 --> 01:25:41,496
(lights clicking)

1779
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:45,426
(audience applauding)

1780
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:46,259
- Floyd?

1781
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,157
Floyd?

1782
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:50,990
Floyd?

1783
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:55,804
(crowd murmuring)

1784
01:25:55,804 --> 01:25:57,536
- Hey, where's my wallet?

1785
01:25:57,536 --> 01:25:59,156
- Floyd?

1786
01:25:59,156 --> 01:26:00,741
- [Man] Yeah, where's my wallet?

1787
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:03,172
- Hey, what's goin' on?

1788
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:06,310
- [Man] My wallet's missing!

1789
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:07,734
