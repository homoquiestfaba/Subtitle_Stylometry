1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:04,380
The hallways were dripping
with blood and gore.

2
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,799
And then I removed
the villain's head from his body.

3
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:09,135
His guts flew everywhere. (CACKLES)

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,763
And, of course, I ate his eyeball.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,183
So he can never find his way back
to the halls of Valhalla.

6
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,601
(LAUGHING)

7
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,694
I guess I'm just taking a break.

8
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,032
This is very different, but, you know,
life is about new experiences.

9
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,117
And this certainly is one of them.

10
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,746
Anyway, I ended up here in Australia

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,165
and moved in with Daryl.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,543
Hello.

13
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:44,504
THOR: <i>We split the rent, of course.</i>
<i>Divide the duties.</i>

14
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:47,882
Clean. Daryl cleans the toilet, mainly.

15
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,425
'Cause you do most of the damage
in there.

16
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,552
(CHUCKLES)

17
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:51,928
<i>I'm a prince from another world</i>

18
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:56,182
and I'm used to giant,
shiny, golden castles.

19
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,725
So this is kind of ridiculous

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,727
- in a lot of ways, but...
- (DARYL SIGHS)

21
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:00,979
You know, I'm managing.

22
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:04,399
Thor's great.
He's kind. He's very strong.

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,568
He has a particular point of view.

24
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,821
But there's another side, which
I understand, it can be frustrating.

25
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:10,905
Connect four.

26
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:13,825
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

27
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,037
He's massively out of touch.

28
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,582
Just things like this.
He destroyed <i>Connect Four</i>

29
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:22,875
and this has been in the family
for quite a while,

30
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,919
and I can't tell him that sort of stuff.

31
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,212
I just sit here cleaning it up.

32
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,716
<i>He just doesn't seem to have</i>
<i>a concept of time.</i>

33
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,093
I said, "Bills are due fortnightly."

34
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,139
And he really deals with things
in centuries, I guess?

35
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:38,516
'Cause he's often said,
"I'll get to it next century."

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,020
I can't, uh, pay rent with these things.

37
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,439
One's a pumpkin,
and these are Asgardian coins.

38
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,441
They're not worth anything.

39
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,193
In Asgard, those coins, these coins,

40
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,530
are worth
gazillion human dollars, okay?

41
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,992
There's a gazillion, you're rich.
There's a gazillion.

42
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,620
Gazillion, gazillion, gazillion.

43
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,997
- No one will exchange these.
- Go to the market.

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,416
- Set up a store, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,710
Asgardianware.

46
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,128
Previously owned by Thor.

47
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,672
I'm a celebrity.
That will sell like hot cakes.

48
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,342
You might need to think about
(STUTTERS) getting a job.

49
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:15,053
- (LAUGHS) Get a job? You serious?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,512
I have a job.
Do you know what my job is?

51
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:17,764
I save the planet.

52
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,474
Maybe you should get a job. Hmm?

53
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,476
- I have a job.
- Really? (BLABBERING)

54
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,520
Hitting the machine,
with the words that come out of it.

55
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,105
"Ooh, this is knowledge.
Knowledge is power."

56
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,776
No, it's not. Knowledge is not power.
That's power.

57
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,902
The brain is a muscle.

58
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,987
And that's a muscle.
And that's a muscle.

59
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,531
And they're all muscles.
This is all muscle.

60
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:39,243
So I am covered in brains,
and I have more brains than you.

61
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,037
So do you think
maybe we could just think about...

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,872
I think we need a servant.

63
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,083
- I don't think we can get a servant.
- We should get a servant.

64
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,584
- I don't think we can get a servant.
- Yay! It's settled.

65
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,752
We're getting a servant.

66
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,883
That came out of a conversation about
me saying, "Could you pay some rent?"

67
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,928
And then his next thought is,
"I'll get a servant."

68
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,180
I don't see how those two things
are connected.

69
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,058
THOR: So, Shane, it's nothing
too hard, really. The usual stuff.

70
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,185
Polishing this guy here.

71
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,230
Cleaning my armour
after adventures and battles.

72
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,857
There'll be blood and sweat
and grime on them.

73
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,277
Sharpening my swords,
writing of my legendary tales.

74
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,781
But really, Shane, the main thing
you'll be doing as my servant

75
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,117
is to get a job and to pay my rent.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,953
And you'll be paid in Asgardian gold.
How does that sound?

77
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,373
Excellent. Oh, you're hired.

78
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,582
Now bring me some more mead.

79
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,043
DARYL: <i>He's essentially</i>
<i>an illegal alien.</i>

80
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,461
I'm dreading the knock on the door

81
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,714
and his reaction to
"Where's your passport?"

82
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:35,717
We were all the best of friends.

83
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:40,680
And then they had a disagreement,
stopped talking, and there was a fight.

84
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,850
But not one of them bothered to call me.

85
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:48,146
And that's just one thing
that you'll have to learn about life.

86
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,650
That friendship is not forever.

87
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,864
That nothing lasts. Nothing.

88
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,700
THOR: <i>Earth is a place</i>
<i>that I've come to love.</i>

89
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,660
And I feel it's a second home.

90
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,370
And I'm very protective of the humans

91
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:07,206
because they're so helpless
and ridiculous.

92
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,419
(INHALES SHARPLY) Let's go to bed.

93
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,005
- It's just me and Daryl now.
- DARYL: Yeah.

94
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,923
And we don't need anybody else.

95
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,592
Just...

96
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,302
Just best friends forever.

97
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,764
- We'll have to get you an outfit.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,226
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Maybe a cape or something.

99
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,269
Yeah, whatever.

100
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,937
What about this?
Do you wanna try to hold that?

101
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,147
(LAUGHS)

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,690
- As if.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
