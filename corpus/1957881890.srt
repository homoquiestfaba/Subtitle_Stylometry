in the reign of
Emperor Xin Chiang,

3
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,948
long before your grandmother's
grandmother was born.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,018
It was a time of
barbarian invaders

00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,121
led by the brutal Mala-Khan.

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,591
It was a time when the
people prayed for heroes.

7
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,565
-Loot.

8
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,033
I've got loot.

9
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,476
-Look at that, Bow-Tie.

10
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,977
Isn't it glorious?

-(SINGING) Mala-Khan Mala-Khan,

13
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,393
Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, backed
with brains and beetle brawn.

-(SINGING) Yes, I am Mala-Khan.

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,337
See the fearsome way
my name is heard.

17
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,807
Yes, I've a little plan.

18
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,777
Taking over all
the blessed world.

00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,779
-(SINGING) Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan.

20

-(SINGING) Yes.

27
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,761
He is Mala-Khan.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,199
But I've my own
special brand of theft.

29
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:45,639
He gets to rule the world, but
I get to take whatever's left.

30
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,577
-(SINGING) Mala-Khan.

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,578

Mala-Khan.

00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,985
There's no better beetle.

36
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,986
-(SINGING) Mala-Khan.

37
00:01:58,986 --> 00:01:59,820
Mala-Khan.

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,455
He's the dark before the dawn.

39
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,457
Please be sure to evacuate,
because your tomorrow

40
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,591
will be gone.

41
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,928

-Onward to the Emperor's palace.

45
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,438
NARRATOR: This is a
tale of one of the most

46
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,307
famous heroes of all, Mulan.

47
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,478
Born in a small village
to a family of farmers,

48
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,449
there was little indication
of what the future held.

49
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,487
Well, maybe there
was a hint or two.

50
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,958
-Mulan, would you please stop
wasting time with that stuff?

51
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,093
-It's not a waste.

52
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,174
-Learning warrior skills is
useful no matter what you do.

53
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,610
Skills like balance,
endurance, and speed.

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,381
-Mulan.

55
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,853
-I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,556
I didn't mean to.

57
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,091
-You never do.

58
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,294
-How will you ever
find a husband?

59
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,063
No man wants a rebellious,
headstrong girl

60
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,400
who doesn't know how to behave.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,068
-You behave your way.

62
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,537
I'll behave mine, and
we'll see what happens.

63
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,580
-Honored grandfather, are you
sure the river will stop them?

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,050
-The river has always been
our strongest defense.

65
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,658
-Drums.

66
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:23,830
Calvary.

67
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,404
-For the Mala-Khan and victory.

68
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,376
Careful, you stupid bug.

69
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,847
No.

70
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:41,648
No.

71
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,816
Cross the river.

72
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
-You see.

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,959
The river does protect us.

74
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,760
-Next.

75
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,139
-Shing-Shing, report.

76
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,242
-Prince Jian, there
are thousands of them,

77
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,978
and they have-- they have wasps.

78
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,080
-The emperor is the
heart of his people.

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,284
You should return to the
capital, where it is safe.

80
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,752
-Where are your servants?

81
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,553
Can-Do.

82
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,723
-Here, sir.

83
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,758
-And-How.

84
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,359
-At your service.

85
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,763
-You must take the
emperor to safety at once.

86
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,097
-Can do, my prince?

87
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,833
-What do you need?

88
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,633
-Nothing.

89
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,534
What do you want?

90
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,835
-Don't stand around.

91
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,504
The barbarians are coming.

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,538
Make haste.

93
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,773
-And how.

94
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,441
-Stop bugging me.

95
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,244
-You stop bothering me.

96
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,045
-Never mind.

97
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,079
Just go.

98
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,048
-Farewell, grandson.

99
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,983
I will see you when
you have driven

100
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,588
these barbarians
from our kingdom.

101
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,689
-Ready the archers.

102
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,232
Aim.

103
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:05,999
Release.

104
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,405
-Mosquitoes!

105
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,206
Run!

106
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,215
-What do you think you're doing?

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,450
-About four knots.

108
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,951
-Make it 10.

109
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,457
That way.

110
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,992
-Aim.

111
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,792
Release.

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,235
-Wasps.

113
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,036
It's wasps.

114
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,142
-What?

115
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,079
Do not think you have beaten us.

116
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,547
The war has only begun.

117
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:13,693
-Now, let them tremble
and beg for mercy.

118
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:19,699
Let them fall down at
my feet in blind terror.

119
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,800
-Make way.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,170
Make way for Mala-Khan
the mega and mighty.

121
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,773
Mala-Khan the Magnamnificent.

122
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,041
Mala-Khan the-- argh.

123
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,913
The awfully muddy?

124
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,650
-Bow-Tie, I should have left
you to rot in the garbage heap

125
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,352
where I found you.

126
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,890
You useless, filthy wretch.

127
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,660
-But, sir, if I may say so,
it gives you that extra touch,

128
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,164
the great tyrant trampling
your enemies in the mud.

129
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,466
-Shut up and grovel.

130
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,336
Oh yes, yes, most
mighty mentally

131
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,706
mordacious Mala-Khan, most
wondrous, lustrous and lordly.

132
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,978
Not to mention, heavy.

133
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,318
[trumpet]

134
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,324
-Barbarians have
crossed the river.

135
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,593
The kingdom is under attack.

136
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,363
His imperial highness
orders every able-bodied man

137
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,832
to report to the
army immediately.

138
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,507
-You must take care of
each other while I am gone.

139
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,076
-But father, you have
already served the emperor,

140
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,546
and you have the war
wound to prove it.

141
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,281
-Hush, daughter.

142
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,782
Ewui, fetch my armor.

143
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,960
-Sir, Mulan is right.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,495
You're no longer
the young man who

145
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,096
wore this armor into battle.

146
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,232
-The emperor calls,
and I must go.

147
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,901
-But you would
only come to harm.

148
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,037
Let someone else go.

149
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,772
-It is my duty.

150
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,342
Would you let our village
fall to the barbarians?

151
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,743
-But father.

152
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,744
-Enough, Mulan.

153
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,315
I have no son to go in my place.

154
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,784
So I must go.

155
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,453
I will leave in the morning.

156
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,688
-There, there.

157
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,424
We'll try talking sense
into him tomorrow.

158
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,558
-But he's right.

159
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,861
The honor of our
family must be upheld

160
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,329
and our village defended.

161
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,798
We must not fail the emperor.

162
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,867
-You do not fool me, young miss.

163
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:48,848
-(SINGING) For
honor, for country

164
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:53,586
I'm told to keep my place.

165
00:10:53,586 --> 00:11:02,295
To stay here, to wait here,
it's more than I can face.

166
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:13,506
But in my father's mind,
a daughter stays behind.

167
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:18,478
I don't know what, but
that's what I must do.

168
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:27,086
The sun used to shine
to paint all the trees.

169
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,990
Every morning, the
light shone through.

170
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,595
Now, by Heaven's design,
there's a harsh winter breeze

171
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,131
that has changed all
I thought I knew.

172
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:50,076
For honor, for country,
because I love this land.

173
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,247
I'll fly now or die now.

174
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,718
He's got to understand.

175
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:06,759
The time has come to fight
for what I know is right.

176
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:12,165
And I'll fight to
do what I must do.

177
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:22,609
I'm ready to do what I must do.

178
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,884
EWUI: Going somewhere, Mulan?

179
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,787
-Ewui, don't try to stop me.

180
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,523
-I served your father
when he went to war.

181
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,892
And now, I will serve you.

182
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,861
-Thank you, Ewui.

183
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,764
-Besides, I don't
want to be around here

184
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,033
when your father
finds out you're gone.

185
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:47,834
Hurry.

186
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,906
EMPEROR: Where is
that messenger?

187
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,242
-Shong-Jing has arrived.

188
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,177
-What's happening?

189
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,279
Is the prince--

190
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,115
-The prince is well.

191
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,484
Though, the invaders have
reached the foothills.

192
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,654
-This cannot be
allowed to continue.

193
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,690
As each company of new
recruits is formed,

194
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,726
they must be sent to the
battlefield immediately.

195
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,527
Go.

196
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,175
-Look.

197
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,643
Everything's so big.

198
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,316
-Then, your heart must
swell to match, Mulan.

199
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,785
-What do I call myself?

200
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,288
I'm sure no soldier is named
for the magnolia flower.

201
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,725
-Battlefields would smell
better if they were.

202
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,926
Soldier Hua.

203
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,727
-Huh?

204
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,528
-No.

205
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,129
Hoo-ah.

206
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,898
-Hoo-hoo.

207
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,168
-Are you an owl?
"Hua" means flower.

208
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,304
You will be Soldier Hua.

209
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,105
-Ah.

210
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,042
-No.

211
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,877
Hoo-ah.

212
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,678
Here.

213
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,884
-Soldier Hua reporting for duty.

214
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,419
-Join the platoon, Hua.

215
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,554
We march to battle.

216
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,504
Ah, this is the life.

217
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,172
Isn't it, comrade?

218
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,207
-Yes.

219
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,775
I mean, (DEEP VOICE) yes.

220
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,848
-Urgent message for the emperor.

221
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,953
-What is it?

222
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,222
-The prince has
fought valiantly.

223
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,991
But our losses are
high, and the barbarians

224
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,061
have pushed us back
into the mountains.

225
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,829
It is hopeless.

226
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,099
-Obviously, the old
ways are not working.

227
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,003
It is said the highest
realization of warfare

228
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,906
is to attack the enemy's plans.

229
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,644
I must know their plans.

230
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,313
You're still here, Shong-Jing?

231
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,316
I said I need more information.

232
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,951
Go.

233
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,853
-That is it?

234
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,522
No thanks.

235
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,056
No nothing.

236
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,892
I am of royal blood.

237
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,927
Not one of his peasant recruits.

238
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,896
How dare he treat me like this?

239
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,146
-Attack!

240
00:15:58,925 --> 00:15:59,725
-Courage!

241
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,402
-Wasps to flank.

242
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,903
-You're mine.

243
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,373
-In your dreams.

244
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,575
-This isn't a picnic.

245
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,342
Go get them!

246
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,760
-Ewui, follow me.

247
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,429
Never give up hope.

248
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,230
Charge!

249
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,767
-Charge?

250
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,245
-For the emperor!

251
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,963
In recognition of outstanding
courage and loyalty

252
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,734
to the emperor, I, hereby,
appoint Soldier Hua

253
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,537
captain of the White
Chrysanthemum platoon.

254
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
Rise, Captain Hua.

255
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,209
ARMY: Yay!

256
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,750
-How could they
possibly have beaten us?

257
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,219
We outnumbered them 10 to one.

258
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,755
It should have been impossible.

259
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,556
-Unthinkable.

260
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,157
It's inconceivable.

261
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,159
Not to mention, embarrassing.

262
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,763
-It was that worm of a soldier,
the one leading his troops

263
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,631
under the White
Chrysanthemum banner.

264
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,000
He's the one who
broke our attacks.

265
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,335
He must be smashed.

266
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,204
-Smushed, crushed, splooshed.

267
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,973
-There must be
someone in that army

268
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,943
willing to betray that
soldier or the prince.

269
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,477
-Or both.

270
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,347
Maybe we could even get
two for the price of one.

271
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,915
-Yes.

272
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,851
Find me a traitor, Bow-tie.

273
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,453
There's nothing
like the though of

274
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,357
treachery to brighten up my day.

275
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,326
PRINCE: I have a
special mission,

276
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,861
and I need two volunteers.

277
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:20,433
-You may count on
me, great prince.

278
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,734
-And me.

279
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,670
-You honor your ancestors
and your emperor.

280
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,009
-Looks like a
scouting party to me.

281
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,945
What do you think?

282
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,848
-Huh?

283
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,351
-I think I found
a couple of spies.

284
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,186
The chief will be
right pleased to have

285
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,556
a couple of the emperor's
slugs to interview.

286
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,357
-Now.

287
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,728
-Hiya.

288
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,363
Ya.

289
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,163
-Hiya.

290
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,671
-For the Khan.

291
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,207
Yikes.

292
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,376
-You're a girl.

293
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,176
-Yes.

294
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,378
I know.

295
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,780
My real name is Mulan.

296
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,283
-So two girls took care
of the horde's warriors.

297
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,187
What a great story
that would make.

298
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,223
What a shame I
can't tell anyone.

299
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,458
-Then, you'll keep my secret?

300
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,826
-Of course.

301
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,627
Look out.

302
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,564
-Ya.

303
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,645
-We must hurry and
warn the prince.

304
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,530
ARMY: Mala-Khan.

305
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,531
Mala-Khan.

306
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,532
Mala-Khan.

307
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,533
Mala-Khan.

308
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,534
Mala-Khan.

309
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,501
Mala-Khan.

310
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,502
Mala-Khan.

311
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,503
Mala-Khan.

312
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,504
Mala-Khan.

313
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,505
Mala-Khan.

314
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,473
Mala-Khan.

315
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,274
Mala-Khan.

316
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,945
-It's a trap.

317
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,329
-Send the first signal.

318
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,503
Attack.

319
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,814
-Protect me.

320
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,317
-There's no time for groveling.

321
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,785
-Yes, great Khan.

322
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,719
-Faster.

323
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,154
Cross the river.

324
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,491
They may have won
today, but I won't

325
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,393
allow them to be
so lucky next time.

326
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,975
-Signal Captain Hua.

327
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,785
-Surrender in the
name of the emperor.

328
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,702
-A brilliant plan,
well-executed, Captain Hua.

329
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,137
I'm impressed.

330
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,138
ARMY: Hua!

331
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,139
Hua!

332
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:47,940
Hua!

333
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:56,015
BOW-TIE: Oh, splendiferous
Khan, master of deceit.

334
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,951
I found what you
wanted, a traitor.

335
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,288
-Such a harsh word, Bow-Tie.

336
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:06,725
He is simply wiser than
his foolish comrades.

337
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:11,163
Hear this promise
my new-found friend.

338
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,633
Serve me well, and you
will have whatever reward

339
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,070
you desire in the
empire of Mala-Khan.

340
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,017
-Never attack first
when out numbered.

341
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,185
Wait.

342
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,656
Find ways to disrupt the
enemy, and then attack.

343
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,925
Disrupt their supply lines.

344
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,094
Provide false information.

345
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,330
Decoy them into splitting
their attention,

346
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,767
but beware of them
doing the same to you.

347
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:53,138
-Captain Hua, you are
needed immediately.

348
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,406
-Now?

349
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,808
-That is what immediately means.

350
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,775
Come on.

351
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,619
-What is it?

352
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,454
I thought the prince
sent you to get me.

353
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,255
-No.

354
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,089
Even better.

355
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,523
You won't believe it.

356
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,725
I'm in love.

357
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,028
-Shing-Shing, we're in
the middle of a war.

358
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,329
-I know.

359
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,998
Isn't it wonderful?

360
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,700
Who'd have though I'd
meet someone here,

361
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,636
and he's a prince.

362
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,537
-Not the prince.

363
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,473
-No, not him.

364
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,608
He thinks only of the war.

365
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,409
No.

366
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,711
This is someone much nicer.

367
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,681
In fact, he really
wants to meet you.

368
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,317
-You didn't tell him
I'm a girl, did you?

369
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,451
-No.

370
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,552
No.

371
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,289
It's just I talk about
Captain Hua so much,

372
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,558
I think he's jealous.

373
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,160
-Jealous of me?

374
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,495
-Uh-huh.

375
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,464
I can't wait for
you to meet him.

376
00:23:52,464 --> 00:24:06,512
[whistle] Captain Hua,
permit me to introduce

377
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:10,783
the emperor's messenger,
Prince Shong-Jing.

378
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:15,421
-You have no idea how much I've
looked forward to this moment.

379
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,522
-Let go of me.

380
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,327
-What are you doing?

381
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,294
Stop!

382
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,729
Come back.

383
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,432
-Thanks for the
help, sweetheart.

384
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,901
I'll see you get a
share of the reward.

385
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,184
-What have I done?

386
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,672
-Where are you taking me?

387
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:11,977
-To someone who appreciates
me, to Mala-Khan.

388
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,846
-Mala-Khan?

389
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,549
-Wasn't it nice of
Shing-Shing to help me?

390
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,017
-I don't believe you.

391
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,386
You tricked her.

392
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:23,756
Shing-Shing would
never betray me.

393
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,190
And you're left with
nothing, traitor.

394
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,502
SHONG-JING: You can't
escape, but your demise

395
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:40,839
will serve the Khan equally
well and be much easier for me.

396
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,774
Farewell, captain.

397
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,941
-Whoa.

398
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,276
Wow.

399
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,845
I think I just used up an
entire lifetime's luck.

400
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,420
I feel so strange.

401
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,321
What's happening to me?

402
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:37,296
-Then Shong-Jing grabbed
Captain Hua and flew off.

403
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,898
-Do you know where
he's taken the captain?

404
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,867
-He mentioned a reward.

405
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:45,070
-I think, I think he's
working for Mala-Khan.

406
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,505
-And you helped him?

407
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,106
-I didn't know.

408
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,676
-Out of my sight,
Shing-Shing, before I

409
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:54,346
have your head for
consorting with a traitor.

410
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,715
Although I will
miss his talents,

411
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:01,286
we must carry on
without Captain Hua.

412
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,756
-I promise, Mulan,
I will find you.

413
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,032
-I must see the Khan.

414
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,634
I have important news.

415
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:52,638
-The malodorous Khan
is not to be disturbed.

416
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,806
You may tell me.

417
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,876
-Tell the Khan I have
done away with his enemy.

418
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,713
Captain Hua has drawn
his final breath.

419
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,315
-My plan worked.

420
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,283
It worked.

421
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,460
-(SINGING) Oh, who's
the greatest vermin,

422
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,328
the creepiest guy.

423
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,970
Other worms are squirming
when they see him pass by.

424
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,377
I'm proud to be confirming
they call me Bow-Tie.

425
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:43,188
Though I'm not one to brag
it, it's hard to deny.

426
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,625
I was one precocious maggot.

427
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,295
But now, I'm super fly.

428
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,229
Yeah.

429
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,533
It's my burden so I drag it.

430
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,567
They call me, Bow-Tie.

431
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,808
I kicked the caterpillars and
stole their precious lands

432
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:07,012
as Mala-Khan's number one thug.

433
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,515
I'm not one of his killers,
but I'm his two right hands.

434
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:15,120
Without me he'd just be a bug.

435
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,592
Don't mean to come off
preachy, but how can I lie?

436
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,526
-(SINGING) Lie.

437
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,561
Lie.

438
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,130
-(SINGING) Without
me as their lychee,

439
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,066
these stupid beetles would die.

440
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,034
-(SINGING) Die.

441
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,435
Die.

442
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,639
-(SINGING) Oh, who's that cootie
cutie with terror in his eye?

443
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:38,043
Who steals and loots the booty
and makes the slug bait cry?

444
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,746
Yes, who's that thing of beauty?

445
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,015
They call him--

446
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,050
-Bow-Tie!

447
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,018
BOW-TIE: (SINGING) Mala-Khan.

448
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,788
Yes, master.

449
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,722
I'm here.

450
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,102
Oh mighty malingering Mala-Khan,
our brilliant plan has worked.

451
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,805
Captain Hua is no more.

452
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,307
-To battle.

453
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,776
Start the drums.

454
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:43,408
-We do this not just for us,
but for the entire kingdom

455
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,678
and to avenge Captain Hua.

456
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,681
For the emperor and Captain Hua.

457
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,079
-Ah.

458
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,715
The joy of switching
to the winning

459
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,985
side at just the right moment.

460
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,243
-Order them to advance.

461
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,978
-But what if we're losing?

462
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,252
-Did the one soon to be
launched into eternity

463
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,087
just question my order?

464
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,794
-(CHANTING) March Advance.

465
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,396
They're fighting,
you stupid ants.

466
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,274
-My prince, they
just keep coming.

467
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,844
We've taken fearsome loses.

468
00:32:58,844 --> 00:32:59,811
-Order the retreat.

469
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:12,757
I'm sure Captain Hua would
have a better plan, but--

470
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,558
ARMY: Retreat.

471
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,216
-Mulan?

472
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,017
Mulan!

473
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,555
-Lonely.

474
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,290
Want toy.

475
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,625
-I am not your toy.

476
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,876
The prince has retreated.

477
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,880
Oh, if only Mulan were there.

478
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,317
This is all my fault.

479
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,286
I must find her.

480
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,915
-Just you wait, Can-Du.

481
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,784
Those scrolls are
useless when it

482
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,619
comes to the emperor's comfort.

483
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,921
-Better wisdom than
luxury, An-Hao.

484
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,457
Wisdom can never be lost.

485
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,860
-What good is wisdom if I'm
forced to sleep on rocks?

486
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,198
-Ah, but wisdom tells
how to not mind the cold.

487
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:00,999
[sneezes]

488
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,934
-I hate cold.

489
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,036
When you're cuddled
with your scrolls,

490
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,371
I'll be warm in pillows.

491
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:10,275
-But those are the emperor's
pillows, not yours, An-Hao.

492
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:14,145
-Oh right, uh, want to
share some of your wisdom

493
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,181
so I don't mind the cold?

494
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,115
-Most gladly.

495
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,720
-Thanks so much.

496
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,787
That's a great help.

497
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:44,843
-Oh, this is wonderful, but
why did it have to happen now?

498
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,645
-Mulan, I'm so sorry.

499
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,720
-Shing-Shing.

500
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,023
-Do I know you?

501
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,658
-Shing-Shing, it's me, Mulan.

502
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,459
-Mulan?

503
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,769
-Since Shong-Jing took you,
things have been awful.

504
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,404
-How long has it been?

505
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,905
What's happened?

506
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,240
-It's been weeks.

507
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,809
We've lost battle after battle.

508
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,678
It's almost as if you
were the army's heart.

509
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,947
Without you, they
couldn't continue.

510
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,315
-But I'm just a caterpillar.

511
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,085
Well, I was.

512
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,787
-But what are we going to do?

513
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,961
-They need Captain Hua,
so that's who they'll get.

514
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,033
Mala-Khan has laid siege.

515
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:47,939
We must hurry.

516
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,140
Help me into my armor.

517
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,356
-This is harder than it looks.

518
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,993
-And I thought this was
difficult to get into before.

519
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:15,600
SHING-SHING: Arms

520
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,504
-I feel like an
over-stuffed pillow.

521
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,305
-Hurry.

522
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,306
Curl up your antenna.

523
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,245
-Now.

524
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,346
-Ta-da.

525
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,216
-Now, how do I get
down there in armor?

526
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,218
-Simple.

527
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,219
Like this.

528
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,226
-Well, at least
it's all down hill.

529
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,468
-It can't be.

530
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,570
I got rid of you once.

531
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,607
This time it will be permanent.

532
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,542
-It's Captain Hua.

533
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,710
I found the captain.

534
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,511
Help us.

535
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,349
-Captain Hua?

536
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,317
Captain Hua!

537
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,585
Fire at will.

538
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,953
Destroy Shong-Jing.

539
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,388
Destroy the traitor.

540
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,435
-I regret my disappearance,
but I have returned.

541
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,872
I am prepared to serve you with
all the courage at my command.

542
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,009
-As your disappearance was
not under your control,

543
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:35,880
I welcome you back, General Hua.

544
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,814
ARMY: Hua!

545
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,782
Hua!

546
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,716
Hua!

547
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,551
Hua!

548
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,752
Hua!

549
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,488
-General Hua, your return
has given us new hope.

550
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,390
We have great need
of your leadership

551
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,925
skills and brave spirit.

552
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,526
-I thank you.

553
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:52,030
Your newest general has
one request though, prince.

554
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,033
Forgive Shing-Shing
for her foolishness.

555
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:59,137
Without her help, I could
not have returned in time.

556
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,805
PRINCE: So be it.

557
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:01,839
Come.

558
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,274
You have a strategy
meeting to attend.

559
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,763
-Master, you're safe.

560
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,166
-Ewui, I'm so
relieved to see you.

561
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,371
-You've changed.

562
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,374
-More than you can
possibly imagine.

563
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,709
PRINCE: [clears throat].

564
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,077
Over here, general.

565
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,245
We must plan our defense.

566
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,187
-It's gas.

567
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,689
I'll handle it.

568
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,857
Stand clear.

569
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,658
-Oh no.

570
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,938
-They're not going to stop
until they've destroyed us all.

571
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:51,082
-Prince Jian, you are trapped.

572
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,652
Surrender, and I
will show you mercy.

573
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,020
-You will?

574
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,655
-Of course not, you dolt.

575
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,690
-Whew.

576
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,725
You had me worried
for a minute there.

577
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:04,896
-I bid you to surrender
while I am feeling merciful.

578
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,673
-Listen to that false bravado.

579
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,241
-It sounded pretty real to me.

580
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,478
Right.

581
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,913
He's a weakling, a pushover.

582
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,215
No problem.

583
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:28,886
-I challenge you to face
in me in combat alone.

584
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:29,954
-I accept.

585
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:30,755
-No.

586
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,557
-You must not.

587
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,993
-I must honor the challenge.

588
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,595
General Hua, you are in charge.

589
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,967
For the emperor.

590
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,404
-Bow-Tie, release
the secret weapon.

591
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,536
-Mala-Khan, face me.

592
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,239
Warrior to warrior,
no more tricks.

593
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:34,085
-You're all that stand
between me and conquest?

594
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,486
Ha.

595
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,890
Prepare to be
squashed, little bug.

596
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,845
-You can do it.

597
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,847
SHONG-JING: Mala-Khan will
take care of your general,

598
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:07,351
and I'll take care of you.

599
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,821
-You can't outrun me.

600
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:10,822
-If you can catch me.

601
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,258
-I've got you now.

602
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:51,262
Yikes.

603
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,263
-Pretty.

604
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,732
Pretty.

605
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,167
-Let me go.

606
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,639
Don't you know who I am?

607
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,540
-Ribbit.

608
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,708
My new toy.

609
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:09,113
-Any last words, general?

610
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:09,914
-Khan you say goodbye?

611
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,561
-Will I never be rid of you?

612
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:57,361
-Never.

613
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,345
-No!

614
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,322
-It's over.

615
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,323
-I'm back.

616
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,303
-You'll never outrun me.

617
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,229
Now I've got you.

618
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:18,309
I don't suppose we
could discuss this.

619
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:26,083
-Prince Shun, your
enemies are destroyed.

620
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,586
PRINCE: Rise and face me.

621
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,154
Who are you?

622
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:35,426
-I am General Hua, though
my family calls me Mulan.

623
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,094
-You've had a good
joke on us, Mulan.

624
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,863
-Oh no.

625
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,532
I only wanted to serve you.

626
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,501
-I'm not sure which
I like better,

627
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:49,440
the courageous and loyal Hua or
the brave and beautiful Mulan.

628
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,742
-Then rejoice, my prince.

629
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,244
For now you have both.

630
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:03,854
-(SINGING) My land is a
beautiful land from the hills

631
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:08,526
to the sky and from
the sea to the sand.

632
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:12,997
My land holds a beautiful dream.

633
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:19,637
It's a promise of peace in
every mountain and stream.

634
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:27,878
And my home is a kingdom
though it's humble and plain.

635
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:38,956
And my heart's in this homeland,
so it's here I'll remain.

636
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:43,728
This time is our moment in time.

637
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:48,365
No more rivers to cross and
no more mountains to climb.

638
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,604
This day, we'll remember
this day as the day

639
00:47:53,604 --> 00:48:02,613
we could lift our heads and
finally say that my home is

640
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:08,519
a kingdom though it's
humble and plain.

641
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:14,992
And my heart's in this
homeland, so it's here

642
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:26,971
I'll remain in my land, my land.

643
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,478
-Can-Du.

644
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,147
-An-Hao.

645
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:38,249
BOTH: Hua!

646
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,585
