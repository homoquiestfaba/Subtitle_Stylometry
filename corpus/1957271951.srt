1
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:24,683
Now I want you and your sister to slow down, okay? Becasue one of you is going to get hurt.

2
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,726
Do you remember yesterday?

3
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,899
They sure grow up fast, don't they?

4
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,016
Too fast.

5
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,540
Oh Jerry, no!

6
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:59,776
Hello. Can you point out Robby Brown for me, please?

7
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,338
Robby Brown?

8
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:53,508
The Unborn II

00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,976
SOLD

10
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,010
So Joey, what do you think of our new home?

11
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:12,994
Here it is.

12
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,262
Look. Joey, I found it.

13
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,389
Where should I put this?

14
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:24,977
Y

15
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,644
SOLD

16
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:45,968
Sorry about that

17
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,414
I got used to this
place being empty.

18
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,194
It's okay. Summers getting kinda hot anyways.

19
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,614
Artie! Who are you talking to?

20
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:59,915
New neighbor Marj. The Clarks finally sold their place.

21
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,441
How much did you pay for it?
-US $ 450,000 and you?

22
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:05,191
$500,000

23
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:12,679
I told you they wouldn't get $600,000 for it.

24
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,588
Oh! We would be right over.

25
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,272
So exciting! New neighbors.

26
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:21,362
Hello there, hello...!

27
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:24,255
I am Marjorie Phillips,Marge...

28
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:26,480
-This is Arthur. -Artie.

29
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,270
Catherine Moore.

30
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:31,383
Catherine! Nice to meet you and welcome to the neighborhood.

31
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:35,835
You are going to love this neighborhood. It's really a wonderful place

32
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,990
Except for the couple across the street She's a little funny...

33
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,617
She might ask you over on Saturday night, for you know what..

34
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,809
Artie stop talking. "Help her with the crates."

35
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,911
That's ok! I'll manage.
I need the exercise.

36
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,660
He's really very strong.

37
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:56,384
He picks me up every saturday night every once in a while, if you know what I mean..

38
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,387
Catherine, are you married?

39
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,411
Of course she's married! Look at all the things in the truck! Baby bottle, stroller...

40
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,336
No, I'm not

41
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,394
Do you smell smoke Ms. Moore?

42
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,872
I smell smoke.

43
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,530
It's that daughter of yours. Sally Anne.

44
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:30,771
You better not be smoking again!

45
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:39,568


46
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,866
Did you manage to see what coloured jacket it was?

47
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:44,754
It was dark. Dark..? Yeah!

48
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,194
This is Lieutenant Briggs. He'd like to ask you a few questions.

49
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:52,315
First, what is CSAT?

50
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,450
California Scholastic Aptitude Test.

51
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,755
They give those tests to 7 year olds?

52
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:00,589
His QI was estimated at 180.

53
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:04,613
And I say estimated, because we don't have the ability to test any higher.

54
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,707
It says here that he was expelled from school. Why?

55
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,052
He was always fighting.

56
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:14,849
That time he pushed a little girl off a swing.Her arm is broken.

57
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,756
Detective, check out the girl's parents.

58
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,493
Why did let a violent kid back into your school?

59
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:26,602
Lieutenant, the boy was in 5 foster homes in 4 years.

60
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:28,463
I felt sorry for him.

61
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,771
I understand.

62
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,913
I think that's about it.

63
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,098
What if the killer comes back?

64
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,474
What if she hurts the other children?

65
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:39,602
I have two kids of my own, Mrs Wagner.

66
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:43,443
We will do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen.

67
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,882
-Alright
-Thank you.

68
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,735
Catherine!

69
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,909
Your neighbors are here!

70
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,460
Yuuhuu, Hello Dear!

71
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:30,743
We thought you would be so busymoving in with the baby...

72
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,015
I made this for you.

73
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,928
Oh Arthur, look what she has done with the place.

74
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:43,588
This is so much nicer than the Clarks, you just couldn't imagine!

75
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,973
Oh look! I don't....

76
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:51,485
They had plastic plants all over the place.

77
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,800
It's really nice to have live things. Look!

78
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:56,010
Look what she's done. What's this?

79
00:09:56,076 --> 00:10:01,496
Oh! Are you a typist dear?

80
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,607
No. I write children's books.

81
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,331
Do you make a living doing it?

82
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,075
Sometimes. Currently
the market is not very good.

83
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,199
I'm a writer too you know!

84
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:16,246
O

85
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,343
You wouldn't want to read that Catherine

86
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,542
Oh by the way, this is
for the baby.

87
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,533
<i>Hi. You do you want to be my friend?<!-- I--></i>

88
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,860
Thank you, I'm sure he's going to love that.

89
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,901
Can I give it to him?

90
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,915
I'm afraid he's napping

91
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,638
Oh please, Can I just pick him up? I just love babies.

92
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,904
I just got him now..

93
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,440
-How old is Joey?
-6 months.

94
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:51,309
This is very complicated stuff for a 6 month old.

95
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:56,531
That was Joey's fathers when he was a boy.

96
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,167
Okay...

97
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:01,451
I know where this piece is goes.

98
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:12,790
- I'll go get a bandage.
-No! I got to get home.

99
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,745
He hates the sight of blood.

100
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,638
Especially his own.

101
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:23,310
Come on, Arthur. Careful.. You are dripping it on the carpet!

102
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,256
Excuse me!

103
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:04,009
Are you Catherine Moore, the writer?

104
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:08,161
Marge told me, when she brought over my casserole.

105
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:09,405
Oh, you got one too?

106
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,574
Of course. I have the right credentials.

107
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,607
I am John Edson.

108
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:16,790
I guess you already know who I am.

109
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:17,746
Who might this be?

110
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,902
This is Joey. He's asleep.

111
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:22,743
If I stop moving he'll wake up.
Excuse me.

112
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,242
I'll see you around.

113
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,977
Have you tried the casserole yet?

114
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,931
I'm afraid to.

115
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,710
Don't be, I hate to admit it but I ate mine all in one sitting.

116
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,243
Boy or girl?

117
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,149
-Boy. and yours?

118
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:00,436
I've got a boy too. "This is Patrick.

119
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:02,822
He is 12 months old.

120
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,103
Joey is 6 months.

121
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,367
Let's meet Joey.

122
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:17,152
He's very special.

123
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:32,325
Don't you pay any attention to her.

124
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,715
Oh! You better not tell my parents.

125
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,326
Why should I? "It's not going to stop you from smoking." Can I have one?

126
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,969
Thanks! It's been a while.

127
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,489
So, do you mind if I hangout back here for a little while?

128
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,065
-Oh, no... I'm leaving
-Oh, you're working?

129
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:29,062
I got to meet a publisher.

130
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,267
So, bet you already have a babysitter for the kid, no?

131
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:38,004
No, I don't know any.

132
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:42,643
Would you mind staying with him?

133
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:46,903
He's asleep. You don't have to play with him or anything.

134
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:49,967


135
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:54,967
Babysitting 101, never work the kid when he's asleep, right?

136
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,015
You know your parents are right about the cigarettes.

137
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:02,986
They just don't want you to die of lung cancer.

138
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:06,529
No they would rather, I die of boredom.

139
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,279

00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:22,919
Can I just have a minute to see my nephew?

144
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:25,676
This is my first chance to see him.

145
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:29,095
I'm sorry, you'll have to come back in the morning.

She's got a gun!

149
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,737
Drop your guns!.

150
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,279
Now!

151
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,548

Lieutenant Briggs.

154
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,715
Same shell casing we found at the playground.

155
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:46,082
Checkout those security monitors and see if it picked up anything.

156
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,454
I want to see her face.

157
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:58,093
Would you turn down that noise, please?

158
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:00,563
Mother!

159
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:14,686
So, what was the baby like?

160
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:17,125
How am I supposed to know?

161
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,359
Well you were baby sitting.

162
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:22,735
Like I said, he
was asleep.

163
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,622
The whole time?
-I don't know.

164
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:28,808
So then he wasn't asleep.

165
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:34,046
Well, I did hear something.

166
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:38,188
Sally Anne! If that baby was awake, you should have been playing with him ...

167
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:41,518
Becasue you are the babysitter and that is what babysitters do.

168
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:44,646
Mom, I couldn't. Ok?
-Why not?

169
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:53,598
Sally Anne, you are not telling me something?

170
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:03,969
The door was locked. "What door?"

171
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,812
The door to the baby's room.

172
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,142

Joey, come on out!

184
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,480
<i> Dispatch to L1. <!-- i--></i>

185
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,725
L1 here, go ahead.

186
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,127
We have that BMW, she ditched it in Woodland Hills

187
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:07,971
L1 copy. I'm enroute

188
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:33,948
Excuse me sir. Is this a Lexus?

189
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,813
-"I'll take the keys please."

190
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,871
Move back. Back.

191
00:25:47,405 --> 00:25:48,996
Hey it's my car! Jesus

192
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:59,552
Guess what Joey? They are going to publish mommys book!

193
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,226
So to celebrate, let's give this a try. Ok?

194
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:09,776
I think you're going to like it.

195
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:15,628
Look Joey I know it's hard for you. It's hard for me too!

196
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,504
I know. Mommy is sorry.

197
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,231
Lieutenant Briggs.

198
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:38,432
A guy about half a mile from here, reported a stolen Lexus.

199
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:41,443
He said he got a good look at the lady who took it.

200
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,683
So she's mobile again.

201
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,008
Mommy knows.

202
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:26,208
Well, when you are through with this...

203
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:28,839
<span style="font-size: 15.4px;">We shall loosen you, Ok?</span>

204
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,871
Maybe tomorrow.

205
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,273
Catherine Moore?

206
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,613
We are from the child welfare agency

207
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,771
We would like to ask a few questions.

208
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,002
What kind of questions?

209
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,879
I'm sorry to say,
but there has been a report of possible misconduct ...

210
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:09,372
Involving you and your child.

211
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:12,617
Who called you? "It was anonymous Mrs Moore."

212
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:16,538
I can assure you that
there has been no misconduct.

213
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:20,521
Can we see the child?

214
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:26,586
Excuse me! "Do you folks have a warrant?"

215
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,754
Because you can't go in there unless
she invites you.

216
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:32,350
or you have a warrant.

217
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,351
Would you please leave?

218
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:39,131
We'll get the
warrant, Mrs. Moore

219
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:42,194
Or is it ... miss?

220
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:53,489
You know, they can't just barge intopeople's houses like that.

221
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:56,932
I do not understand. "I would never do anything to hurt Joey.

222
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,285
Does somebody have an in for you?

223
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,802
It's yours.

224
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:07,349
If you need anything, Just give a holler.

225
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:09,130
Thank you.

226
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:25,351
Oh God!

227
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:35,549
Come on!

228
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,816
Oh my baby!

229
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,630
I'm never going to let them take you away from me.

230
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:50,363
We leave tomorrow. Ok?

231
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:54,145
Are you still hungry?

232
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,594
"Can I help you?" I need to rent a trailer. "

233
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:49,366
Didn't you just return one of these? "Yes, couple of days ago."

234
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:54,311
Well you should have held on to it.
The weekly rate saves you tons of money.

235
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,465
"Can I help you mam?"
-No, thanks.

236
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:30,741
I'm just waiting for my sister.

237
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,098
Oh! Bad leg huh?

238
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:40,161
-Yard work! "Maybe you should get a gardener for that."

239
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:44,788
You take care now.

240
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,826
Joey!

241
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:27,042
You scared the hell out of me!

242
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,136
My mother didn't see you, did she?

243
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:32,179
No, I parked around the block.

244
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,181
I thought she gave you direct orders not to come over.

245
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,437
She did.

246
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,871
She thinks Ms. Moore is abusing her kid or something.

247
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:41,480
It she?

248
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:45,011
"No, Catherine wouldn't do that."
-How do you know that?

249
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:49,196
I just do..

250
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:54,367
You know you better watch it, something you almost sound like you have a heart.

251
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:48,317
-What wrong?
-The baby is crying.

252
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,959
Get out of the way!

253
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:34,308
Jesus Christ! You stupid bitch! You think I could stop this thing at an angle? I can't

254
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:35,989
Move!

255
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:37,677
*abuses angrily*

256
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,304
-So open it! "It's locked."

257
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:15,082
Joey?

258
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:37,224
Jesus! The kids a fucking freak!

259
00:36:39,054 --> 00:36:40,490
It's a baby.

260
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,142
Come here, sweetheart.

261
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:47,477
Look at you!

262
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,117
You see? He just needs to be loved!

263
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,976
Joey killed them!

264
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:50,194
What are you talking about?

265
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,969
-He'll kill anyone who gets in his way.
-Where is he?

266
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,598
What have you done with my baby?

267
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,959
Your baby is a killer.

268
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,758
Do you remember what Joey did to your husband Catherine?

269
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,129
Or has he blocked that out?

270
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,879
They are able to do that you know?

271
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:13,268
He is controlling your thoughts.

272
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:16,112
That's why you can't see what he really is!

273
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:20,068
-He's using you. "He's a baby!"

274
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:27,431
He's not going to stop.

275
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,986
It only gets worse.

276
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:11,408
Everything is going to be alright.

277
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:17,241
She was babysitting.

278
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,939
Her name is Linda Holt.

279
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:23,032
18 months ago she gave birth to a premature baby.

280
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:27,037
The baby was a conceived in vitro
and was born deformed.

281
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:30,454
Her doctor was namedMyrellin.

282
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:33,586
I was a patient of<span style="font-size: 17.6px;">Myrellin</span>.

283
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:37,900
As were the mothers
of the other victims.

284
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,726
Did she threaten you?

285
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,821
It's Joey that she's after.

286
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:49,304
I'm Sorry, I can't even think straight.

287
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:50,821
What about Joey?

288
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,919
Did the suspect mention Joey?

289
00:41:53,028 --> 00:41:55,509
She didn't make any sense.She said...

290
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:57,820
that Joey was using me.

291
00:41:57,905 --> 00:42:01,906
We think that she has a vendetta against normal healthy babies.

292
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:05,451
-And the teenagers? "Just the wrong place at the wrong time."

293
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,431
Did you see Mrs Holt take Joey?

294
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:17,845
Please help me get him back. "He is all I have."

295
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:21,593
Do you have a
photograph of the baby?

296
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,243
A photograph could just help us find him.

297
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:31,556
You don't have a photo of your own child?

298
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:36,720
There is something you need to understand about Joey

299
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:41,804
He is not a normal, healthy baby.

300
00:42:43,672 --> 00:42:46,435
He's handicapped?

301
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:54,678
Ms Moore, I want you to rest assured that we will do everything we can

302
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:57,873
to get Joey back, Ok?

303
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,543
Right now why don't you try to get some rest?

304
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:08,110
We'll be back first thing in the morning to get a formal statement.

305
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,170
Can I help you?

306
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,295
I'm a personal friend of Ms. Moore. "I was wondering if I could talk to her for a minute?."

307
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,279
Yeah. Go ahead
-Thank you.

308
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:43,874
Catherine, are you ok?

309
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,855
Don't worry.
They will find him.

310
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,403
Do you think so?

311
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,499
I am so scared.

312
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:01,395
I'm Sorry.

313
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,574
It's ok

314
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,049
You wait right here.

315
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:00,619
Thank you.

316
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:09,980
Do you have any kids?

317
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:14,421
Yeah, I have one. Wonderful little boy.

318
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,730
I'm hoping he can come live with me sometime soon.

319
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:23,557
The custody balance must be tough, huh.

320
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:30,905
-Feeling better?
-Yes thank you.

321
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:35,074
Listen, I'm going to get going and get out of the way.

322
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,247
Let you have a little time...

323
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:40,136
If you need anything...anything at all

324
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,964
A BLT, a bowl of chicken soup...

325
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:45,172
a cup of sugar...

326
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:50,048
Just give me a call, okay?

327
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,512
Promise?

328
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:00,246
Thank you.

329
00:47:37,928 --> 00:47:40,495
I was so worried!

330
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:42,873
Where were you?

331
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,279
You were hiding?

332
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:09,771
That ought to take care of things.

333
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:13,823
- She wanted a warrant...
'She's got one!'.

334
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,021
What do we have here?

335
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,166
Looks like sleeping beauty.

336
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,597
Ms. Moore?

337
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:37,791
-Sedatives. "Mother of the year".

338
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:42,617
She probably left the baby in the house all night!

339
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:46,270
"Let's go see what we find, shall we?." "We've seen it all."

340
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:12,563
- Why don't we split up? "You take the front room and the kitchen is mine."

341
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:22,264
Jesus! This house stinks. "She is feeding it meat."

342
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:26,251
Alright we need to find this kid
and we need to get him out of here now.

343
00:52:26,424 --> 00:52:27,815
Let's try upstairs.

344
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:40,874
No safety gate.

345
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:43,644
"Surprised?"
-No I am not.

346
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:48,233
-Did you hear that? "It sounds like it's coming from downstairs."

347
00:54:00,564 --> 00:54:02,427
In the closet.

348
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:19,203
"He's probably been hiding in the closet all night long." "Poor thing.

349
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,939
"Must be scared to death" "Wouldn't you be?"

350
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:24,668
-Can you see him?
-I don't see a thing.

351
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:33,171
Come here, come on. It's okay.
Don't be afraid .

352
00:54:33,254 --> 00:54:36,046
-Come here sweetheart.
-Hello baby, come here.

353
00:54:36,122 --> 00:54:38,716
Don't be afraid of the light.

354
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:43,062
"Come to Papa". "Come here, come.

355
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:47,374
It's alright.

356
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,925
It's time, Catherine.

357
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:35,360
Thank God. Help me.

358
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:40,247
It's there!

359
00:55:40,457 --> 00:55:42,938
Quiet! Quiet!

360
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,851
Did you see something? What did you see?

361
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,770
The baby.

362
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,945
Lets go.

363
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,926
I'll take him some place safe.

364
00:56:12,143 --> 00:56:16,552
You don't understand.
No place will be safe with him in it.

365
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,662
Now move.

366
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:33,207
How many morehave to die Cathrine?

367
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,188
You did try the formula!

368
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:42,955
I did too.

369
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:47,066
My baby girl screamed so much ...

370
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:50,195
my neighbors thoughtI was torturing her.

371
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:54,248
The only reason Joey hasn't killed you, is because he needs you.

372
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,768
He needs your breast milk to survive.

373
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:00,170
That's all he needs you for. "How can you say that?"

374
00:57:00,236 --> 00:57:02,579
I've been there.

375
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:07,746
<i>Mrs. Moore? <!-- I--></i>

376
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:12,905
If you say something, I will kill you. "I don't want to, but I will."

377
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:16,571
Now go ahead, answer the door.

378
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,992
-Who is it? "Lieutenant Briggs".

379
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:33,960
Yes, Lieutenant?

380
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:37,731
Good Morning. We've come to get your statement.

381
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,704
Don't you remember?
We said we'd come back.

382
00:57:40,868 --> 00:57:44,493
Yes! But I've said all I have to say.

383
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:49,606
Your statement may just provide us with some leads.

384
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:52,663
Leads that could help us find Joey.

385
00:57:52,774 --> 00:57:55,899
Not now. I have to rest now.

386
00:58:00,636 --> 00:58:04,369
We'll come back later, but today. I'd appreciate that lieutenant.

387
00:58:04,462 --> 00:58:06,185
Good work Catherine.

388
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:14,430
I loved my little girl Katherine.

389
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:35,324
She was my little miracle.

390
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:39,853
I couldn't wait to have a baby

391
00:58:41,028 --> 00:58:44,371
and hold her

392
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:46,797
and walk her through the park.

393
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:49,947
Just like all the other mothers.

394
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:53,431
But I could never be like all the other mothers.

395
00:58:56,807 --> 00:59:01,952
Because my baby...

396
00:59:04,765 --> 00:59:08,648
wasn't like all the other babies.

397
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:11,703
What? What was her name?

398
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:14,663
Grace.

399
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,402
What happened to her?

400
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,057


401
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:30,170
The first victim was a neighborhood child
...

402
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,962
who came up to play with her.

403
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:39,467
He drowned in the pool. "I thought it was an accident."

404
00:59:40,636 --> 00:59:44,166
My husband was next.

405
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:49,372
I managed to escape.

406
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,466
He has to be stopped Catherine.

407
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,634
Call him.

408
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,048
Louder!

409
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:55,845
"Joey! Where are you?"
-Here.

410
01:01:35,964 --> 01:01:37,749
Look at mommy!

411
01:01:39,504 --> 01:01:42,857
There is your momma!

412
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:48,084
Who you are?

413
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:51,757
He is your special boy.
Yes he is.

414
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:53,816
Yes he is.

415
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:56,417
It's it?

416
01:01:56,786 --> 01:02:00,927
"You pretended to be my friend."
-I'm your friend.

417
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,539
What do you think those child welfare workers wanted to do?

418
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:08,295
What do you think Linda was going to do?

419
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:10,505
I protected you.

420
01:02:10,582 --> 01:02:14,946
I watched over you! Over Joey!

421
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,522
Joey! Come on! Come to mommy!

422
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,068
Joey and I have a surprise for you.

423
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:31,062
Don't we?

424
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:45,144
Who's your papa! Yeah! Drink...!

425
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:57,790
Do you know what pisses me off?

426
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,680
Difference.

427
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:03,911
The world is literally falling apart, and people give a fuck about is...

428
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:09,623
cars, looks, how much money do they have ...

429
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:13,837
because they are all so materialistic.

430
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:16,691
Dr, Myrellin..

431
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:20,183
Care about the air..

432
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,638
about the water...about the soil...

433
01:03:23,317 --> 01:03:27,256
care about the whole planet.

434
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,403
care about the fact that so many
indifferent people are born in that planet.

435
01:03:32,588 --> 01:03:35,895
I worked withDr. Myrellin for 10 years.

436
01:03:36,027 --> 01:03:41,115
Do you think I was going to let decades worth of dreams slip away?

437
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,895
What does all this have to do with Joey?
-Think! Catherine! Think!

438
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:53,389
People of average intelligence are not going to make the difference.

439
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,007
These children will make the difference.

440
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:59,819
Not some vicious morality binding them

441
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,878
These children are our only hope.

442
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:07,254
You must be proud Catherine.You should smile

443
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:10,307
because you are a part of it all.

444
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:13,707
Just too sad, but we don't need you anymore.

445
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:50,883
We do appreciate what you've done up until now

446
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,404
Just think of this...

447
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:56,402
as one of those sacrifices
that a mother makes for her child.

448
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,805
Give me back my baby.

449
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:02,072
Did you see how fast they turn on you?

450
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:05,760
That's why I am never getting married!

451
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:09,309
And I don't want you to get married.

452
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:20,660
Be good.

453
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:30,102
survival of the fittest time!

454
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:21,397
Come on, Catherine!

455
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:25,247
Don't make things difficult.

456
01:07:57,405 --> 01:07:58,947
Good girl!

457
01:10:08,182 --> 01:10:09,930
Are you in there?

458
01:10:22,243 --> 01:10:23,606
Nice trick Joey!

459
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,727
Honey! Please let mommy inside. If you open the door ...

460
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:34,805
I'll take you to Toyland.

461
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,263
You can buy some new pieces pieces for your set.

462
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:41,326
I think you'll like them, alot!

463
01:10:42,556 --> 01:10:45,420
Do you want mom to read a story?

464
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,984
That's a good boy!

465
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:01,711
Maybe it's not too late Joey!

466
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:26,391
Maybe mommy can help you change.

467
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:31,714
"Mommy knows you are afraid."

468
01:11:42,917 --> 01:11:46,824
So that's how you lash out.

469
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,929
If you come out right now ...

470
01:11:55,915 --> 01:12:00,042


471
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:04,152
We can work on this together.

472
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:34,197
Get back here!

473
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:26,055
God Damn it!
Get back here!

474
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:55,982
I know you are up here.

475
01:13:58,678 --> 01:14:01,777
Joey get over here. Now!

476
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:29,998
Joey did you just say...

477
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:37,981
I'm going to get you.

478
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:25,964
Enough!

479
01:18:56,457 --> 01:19:00,582
People People! Can you please stay back!

480
01:19:21,497 --> 01:19:22,982
Hang on! Just a second!

481
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:29,468
Where is the baby?- Your baby is gone Mrs Moore.

482
01:19:31,486 --> 01:19:33,460
Are you sure?
