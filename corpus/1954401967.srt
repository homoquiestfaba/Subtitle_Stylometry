- CALL FOR BACKUP, JACK? OR WE SHOOT THEM HERE?

538
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,000
NO, WE SHOULD GIVE THEM

1039
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,855
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
DEAD REDS.

01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:08,361
SO HOW ARE WE GONNA
PROCEED FROM HERE?

1043
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:11,147
HMM?

1044
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,650
THEY'RE DEAD AND YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT MONEY? YOU FUCKING--

WAIT A MINUTE,
THE PHONE'S GOING.

1047
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,824
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

1048
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,827
ASK HIM WHAT

1049
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,745
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
HELLO?

1050
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,591
SERGEI AND YURI
ARE DEAD.

1051
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:40,510
Misha:
<i>COME ON, LEXI.</i>

1052
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,513
YOU CAN GET
THAT LITTLE RESTAURANT YOU ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT.

1053
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,232
Helena:
<i>OR SHE COULD GO TO JAIL.</i>

1054
01:04:46,233 --> 01:04:48,735
OR GET KILLED
IN THE PROCESS.

1055
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:51,521
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TWO?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

1056
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,274
THIS IS A NEW LIFE!
THIS IS LIKE, WE CAN DO ANYTHING!

1057
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:57,744
BY ROBBING A CASINO?
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER.

1058
01:04:57,744 --> 01:04:59,695
IT'S THE ANSWER FOR US.

1059
01:05:01,615 --> 01:05:03,416
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1060
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,202
GET A COLLEGE DEGREE?
WORK FOR SOME MINIMUM WAGE?

1061
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,421
DANCE ON BROADWAY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1062
01:05:09,923 --> 01:05:12,926
I MEAN, LIFE IS JUST
PASSING US BY, YOU KNOW?

1063
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:15,878
AND WE'RE NOTHING!
WE'RE LOSERS!  I'M A LOSER.

1064
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,433
( sighs )

1065
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,729
( sighs )

1066
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,233
I DON'T WANNA BE
THAT PERSON ANYMORE.

1067
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,706
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.
I'M NOT.

1068
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:50,747
FATE IS GIVING US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

1069
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:53,166
TO STEAL?

1070
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,168
THE MONEY'S INSURED.

1071
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:57,587
IT'S SOMETHING.
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING!

1072
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,589
<i>YOU'RE NOT GETTING</i>
<i>ANY YOUNGER.</i>

1073
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,091
<i>YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE--</i>
<i>LYING HERE IN 10 YEARS?</i>

1074
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:05,011
<i>BECAUSE YOU WILL</i>
<i>IF YOU DON'T TAKE</i> <i>THAT RISK.</i>

1075
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:06,979
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1076
01:06:08,982 --> 01:06:10,566
FUCK ME.

1077
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:24,364
WE CAN DO THIS.

1078
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,421
- Misha: <i>HEY.</i>
- NO!

1079
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,423
TOO LATE.
THE WHOLE GANG'S HERE.

1080
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,427
YOU REMEMBER LEXI?
THIS IS HELENA.

1081
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,929
- AND WOODY.
- THIS IS WOODY.

1082
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,430
WOODY.

1083
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:48,137
Troy:
<i>NOW, THESE ARE</i> <i>THE DYE PACKS.</i>

1084
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:50,056
THEY ARE LOADED IN
WITH THE MONEY,

1085
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:53,192
AND THEY HAVE
LOCATOR BEEPERS HIDDEN IN EACH BAG.

1086
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:55,111
SO WE'LL HAVE TO SOAK
THE BAGS IN WATER.

1087
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,147
ISN'T IT JUST EASIER
TO TAKE THEM OUT?

1088
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,700
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE QUESTIONS? COME ON.

1089
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,785
I'M JUST ASKING.

1090
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:05,405
WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
IF WE'RE RUNNING.

1091
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:08,040
SO, AFTER THE HIT,
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE

1092
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,209
TWO TO 10 MINUTES
TO GET OUT OF THE CASINO.

1093
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:14,247
AND ANOTHER TWO HOURS
TO GET BEYOND THE CITY LIMITS.

1094
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:16,749
- WHO'S DRIVING
THE RENT-A-CAR? - I'LL DRIVE.

1095
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,176
HEY.

- RIGHT?
- Misha: ARE WE?

1102
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:07,350
YOU GUYS TALKED ME INTO THIS.
YOU BETTER BE DOING THIS.

1103
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:11,354
LET'S DO THIS.

1104
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,856

01:08:34,794 --> 01:08:36,662
IT'S PRETTY CROWDED
DOWN HERE.

1107
01:08:36,663 --> 01:08:39,666
IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO,
IT'S GONNA BE PACKED.

1108
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,168
SO LET'S SWITCH CAMERAS 14
AND NINE TO THE FLOOR.

1109
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,170
GET SOME MORE EYES
DOWN HERE.
