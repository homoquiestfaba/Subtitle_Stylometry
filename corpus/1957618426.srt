Want to stop off for some ice cream before we go home?

-Uh-huh -Okay.

00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,866

Good job.

15
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37,566
Thanks. Can I read him his rights?

I do my part to keep it safe,

There you go.

Uh, that’s a Chocolate Blast.

44
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,766
I asked for a Slide-Up.

45
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,165
You know, you slide the ice cream up on a stick.

46
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:02,199
Stan, what’s he talking about?

47
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,833
I don’t know. What does it sound like?

48
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,933
Something to slide up on a stick.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,265
-Oh. -We must be out of those.

50
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,599
Yeah. We must be out of those.

51
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
Aw, man. They’re the best kind.

52
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,399
Come on, Stan. Those are the best kind.

53
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,599
Don’t you know how to order?

54
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,499
How do I know? It’s ice cream.

55
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,332
Kid, ice cream is ice cream.

56
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,099
All right, you want ice cream?

57
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,966
You want a stick? Here.

He’s just in a bad mood.

61
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,232
What’s your name, young man?

62
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,099
Peter, ma’am.

63
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,466
Oh, you are so polite.

64
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:39,065
Listen, can I get you something else, maybe?

65
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,432
I’ll just take the Chocolate Blast, please.

66
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,232
Okay. Here you go.

67
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,632
Thanks.

68
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,699
Thank you.

69
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,899
You know, we’ve had this ice-cream truck so long

70
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,566
that I think he’s starting to lose it.

72
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,332

00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,833
Don’t forget. Slide-Ups.

74
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,532
Yeah, yeah, Slide-Ups.

75
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,599
See you, Peter.

76
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,833
-[Peter] Bye. -Bye.

77
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,199
Slide-Ups.

78
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,632
Oh, hi, Peter.

79
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,000
Hi, Mrs. Jacobs.

80
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:21,466
I heard about how brave you were earlier today.

81
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,666
-All in a day’s work. -[chuckles]

82
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,399
Well, just you be careful.

83
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,132
I don’t want to see you get hurt.

84
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,766
Yes, ma’am. Just keeping an eye on the neighborhood.

85
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,866
My mom wanted me to give these to you.

86
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,199
Oh. Oh.

87
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,499
Looks important.

88
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,833
It is.

89
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,733
I’m thinking of selling my coins to a collector

90
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,299
when I get back from my trip.

91
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,399
Your gold coins?

92
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,466
Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,132
Well, they’re just sitting around.

94
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,866
If someone else can appreciate them, why not?

95
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,799
Oh, but they’re so cool.

96
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,733
Well, I have no use for them, really.

97
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,199
They belonged to Mr. Jacobs,

98
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,866
and since he’s passed on...

99
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,599
I wish I could buy them.

100
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,299
I’d put ’em to good use.

101
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,466
Well, I don’t think your allowance would cover it.

102
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,132
Now listen. It’s getting close to dinnertime.

103
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,299
You better run along.

104
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,265
You’re right. Bye, Mrs. Jacobs.

105
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:09,599
Bye-bye, Peter.

106
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:32,532
Hi, sweetie.

107
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,799
How was your day?

108
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,332
Great. Frank says hi.

109
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,432
Oh, Peter, were you down at the police station again?

110
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,866
Yeah. We caught a mugger.

111
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:40,999
What do you mean, "we"?

112
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:42,399
Frank and me. We nabbed him.

113
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:43,599
Well, "Frank and me"?

114
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,899
We’re gonna have a little talk about this.

115
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,466
[man on radio] Anybody know where Frank is?

116
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,532
[man #2] He’s on Bridal Lane checking out a 459. Over.

117
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,165
Copy. I’m bringing it in.

118
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,966
-Time to call it a night. Over. -Roger.

120
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,332
Can you respond? Over.

[Frank] Yeah, this is, uh, Frank.

123
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,733
Seems to be another popular night for alarms.

124
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,366
Still at the Bridal Lane address,

125
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,599
and I’ll go on over to Main in a little while. Over.

126
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,599
10-4.

127
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,599
[Peter] The back door was open,

128
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,032
and Frank wasn’t here yet.

129
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,799
I figured I’d better have a look inside

130
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,299
and check things out.

Peter?!

137
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,399
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,833
I heard the alarm went off,

139
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,265
and you were still on Bridal Lane.

140
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh, you thought you’d come and do some investigating?

141
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:51,899
Frank, it wasn’t like that, honest.

142
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,432
Do you have any idea how dangerous

143
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,599
the situation could have been here?

144
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,933
Oh.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,432
What is the meaning of this?

146
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,099
Mayor Cosgrove.

147
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:02,899
Yeah, well, Charlie called me about the alarm.

148
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,699
They got into the cash register.

149
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:07,065
-Peter. -My cash register?

150
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,999
[sighs] Oh, no.

151
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,099
Ah, it’s only about 40 bucks.

152
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,065
What’s the kid doing here?

153
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:21,232
He’s a curiosity seeker, sir. I’ll take him home.

154
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,199
All right. Well, since it’s no big deal,

155
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:27,899
let’s not blow this whole thing out of proportion.

156
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,566
We don’t want the constitu--

157
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,532
the, uh, residents to get alarmed, eh?

158
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,833
Yeah, well, say, Frank,

159
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,599
how’s this budget thing going, huh?

160
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,666
Uh, fine.

161
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,799
Good, good. Well, you know, I’d hate to see your father

162
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:46,699
have to go just because we can’t find the cuts to make in your department.

163
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:49,232
Ooh, that reminds me. What about this quote

164
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:52,299
I asked you for for the new squad car?

165
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:53,899
Back at the police station, Your Honor.

166
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,632
I-I’ll pick ’em up, bring ’em by here

167
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,699
after I’ve taken him home.

168
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,999
Good, good. Okay. Well, uh, good.

169
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:01,699
You, come on.

170
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,799
Hey, Frank, did he mean Charlie?

171
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,899
Ah, he didn’t get my Bettie Page collection.

172
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:11,499
Klutz.

173
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,666
Oh, thank you. That’s very nice.

174
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,299
I’m in there risking my neck,

175
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,733
and you call me a klutz?

176
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,699
I practically cut my foot off.

177
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,366
So did you get it?

178
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,933
Yeah, I got it.

179
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,566
[laughs] Good work.

180
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,833
Everything is falling into place, Stan.

181
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:32,866
You know, I’m hungry.

182
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,666
Are you hungry?

183
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,065
Nah.

184
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,866
[telephone ringing]

185
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,566
Soon as I finish up this paperwork,

186
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:01,632
we’ll be heading home.

187
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,566
Hey, Frank, does Charlie know yet?

188
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,332
[dog barking]

189
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,265
Oh. Forgot the file.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,165
[vehicle passes]

191
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,432
Hey!

192
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,332
[sighs] Charlie.

193
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,232
What have I always told you about being a good cop?

194
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,366
Always be prepared for anything.

195
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:34,032
-And? -Kick ’em in the shins.

196
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,699
Well, you got it, kiddo.

197
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,833
Hey, why so down?

198
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,332
Aw, Frank’s all mad at me.

199
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,366
Kinda ruined a bust.

200
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:46,265
Kinda? Now, Peter, you know better

201
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:47,999
than to get yourself involved in the big stuff.

202
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:51,733
Now you stick to your neighborhood watch, okay?

203
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,265
I was just doing what Dad would have done.

204
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:59,299
Hey, Charlie, did you always want to be a cop?

205
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,799
What are you, kiddo, 11?

206
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:05,566
Let’s see. When I was 11, what did I want?

207
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, yeah. Wanted to be a baseball player.

208
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:10,132
I used to dream I was Babe Ruth.

209
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,132
Really?

210
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,099
Yeah, but just as well.

211
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,265
I mean, who needs the weight problem?

212
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,933
Besides, look at me now.

213
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,733
Now I get all the really rough assignments,

214
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,566
like getting a coffee for him.

215
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,232
Come on, kiddo. Let’s go.

216
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,299
Hi, Mom.

217
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,566
Peter?!

218
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,966
Frank.

219
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:42,933
Frank, is he in some kind of trouble?

220
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,432
Only with you.

221
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,833
Cosgrove’s store was broken into--

222
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,265
Peter broke into the Mayor’s store?

223
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:50,466
No. He was just somewhere he shouldn’t have been. That’s all.

224
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,099
Frank, what happened?

225
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:53,866
The alarm went off. He went in.

226
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,232
It’s nothing to worry about.

227
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,933
Somebody grabbed a measly 40 bucks

228
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,632
out of the cash register and ran.

229
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,232
Well, next time, it might not be such a small thing.

230
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,699
[sighs] You know, I remember when he used to play ball

231
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:07,866
and idolize Cal Ripken Jr.

232
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:10,566
Now it’s cop shows and Angela Lansbury.

233
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,666
[laughs] He’ll be fine.

234
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,833
Thank you for bringing him home.

235
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:15,899
Sure.

236
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,733
[woman] Mike, can you respond to an accident

237
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,399
-on the corner of... -That’s it, Peter.

238
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,399
No TV tonight.

239
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,766
But NYPD Blue is coming on--

240
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,499
Especially that.

241
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,499
Peter, what is going on here?

242
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,532
I mean, this is getting to be just too much.

243
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,032
Break-ins, muggers--

244
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,733
-Mom-- -We’ve discussed this.

245
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,165
I just want to do something important,

246
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:38,599
like Dad. He loved what he did.

247
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,899
[sighs]

248
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,733
Sweetie, but he loved you even more,

249
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,432
and he would not want to see you get hurt.

250
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,332
You know me better than that, Mom.

251
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,299
I hope so.

252
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,499
Now get ready for bed...

253
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,632
now.

254
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,499
[Peter] My dad. When he was alive,

255
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:54,833
Mom and I cut out everything ever written about him.

256
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,532
I was sure my scrapbook wouldn’t be big enough,

257
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,599
[telephone ringing]

258
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,065
Ah, you’re back.

259
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,532
Got coffee and doughnuts.

260
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,632
Try not to get too excited.

261
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,332
It’s not good for the ticker.

262
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,165
Jelly or glazed?

263
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:20,265
Ah, jelly’s fine.

264
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,833
Careful. Jelly stains.

265
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:27,999
Decaf or regular?

266
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:29,799
What are you-- The regular.

267
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,366
Black or cream?

268
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,933
Black, of course.

269
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,799
-Sugar? -No!

270
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,799
There you go.

271
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,399
Had a problem with the kid tonight?

272
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,165
Ah, yeah.

273
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,366
Was, uh, Sarah very upset?

274
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,599
She was pretty upset.

275
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,165
Well, lucky she has you.

276
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:57,532
What do you mean?

277
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,799
Nothing.

278
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:01,766
N-Nothing. She doesn’t have me.

279
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,366
I’m helping her out with a little problem.

280
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,099
Problem.

281
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,733
Yeah, a little pr--

282
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,599
There’s nothing between us.

283
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,899
Nothing at all.

284
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,199
I don’t know what you’re inferring here,

285
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,632
but Paul was her husband, and he was my partner,

286
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,866
and this man stood for me to the very last.

287
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,532
This is the least that I can do.

288
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,799
Ah, the very least.

289
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,000
That’s right.

290
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,199
Besides, when Sarah’s ready,

291
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:34,099
she’ll come around.

292
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,966
You’re--

293
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,065
[announcer] The time is 7:20.

294
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:44,799
And now the weather, sponsored by the Leesbrook Luncheonette.

295
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,899
Why don’t you stop in today for their luscious...

296
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,399
Aw, man, it’s early.

297
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,666
Well, it’s gonna be sunny and hot, hot, hot today.

298
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,132
Temperatures in the upper 80s.

299
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,165
Low’s tonight, oh, around 75.

300
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:58,366
Currently 79 at the Leesbrook Community Center.

301
00:18:58,432 --> 00:18:59,966
-Badge. -Back in the news,

302
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:03,466
there seems to be an epidemic of cats stuck in trees.

303
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,466
[radio continues, indistinct]

304
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, we could give this to charity

305
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,666
and take the deduction of it--

306
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,099
Hi, Mayor Cosgrove.

307
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,799
Peter, you’re back.

308
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,532
I dropped something here last night.

309
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,566
Mind if I look around?

310
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:54,566
Search for yourself.

311
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,199
Thanks.

312
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,899
Well, I didn’t see anything back there before

313
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,632
when I was cleaning up a broken vase.

314
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,332
Thank goodness for cheap imitations.

315
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,332
[chuckles]

316
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:02,099
Large piece of glass with blood on it.

317
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,000
Robber must have cut himself.

318
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,699
Wonder if there’s more.

319
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,599
How you doing back there?

320
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,566
Blood.

321
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,733
Drop of blood.

322
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:37,899
And another.

323
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,499
They stopped.

324
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:56,232
The blood drops stop.

325
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:57,232
[clatter]

326
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,933
"Downey’s Garage."

327
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,599
[bird squawks]

328
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:24,399
No! Don’t!

329
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:26,833
Oh, Beverly, please. I’ve asked you so many times,

330
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,232
don’t shout at me in the morning.

331
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,432
I’m sorry, but don’t drink that!

332
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,265
I-I can’t function without my coffee.

333
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:34,466
You won’t be functioning at all if you drink that.

334
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:37,132
That’s the plaster for the key mold.

335
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:41,532
Give me that.

336
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:45,332
Yeah, I should have let you drink it.

337
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:48,199
Maybe it would have shut your mouth for good.

338
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:49,899
"Thank you."

339
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,432
-[boys laughing] -[girl] Give it back!

340
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:52,632
Billy, throw it here!

341
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,132
-Ah, yes. -Give my book back!

342
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,366
-Catch. -[laughs]

343
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,532
-Can’t get it. -Give it back!

344
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,099
[Peter] Tom, Billy, leave her alone.

345
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,499
-Oh, "detective." -Thank you.

346
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:04,833
Are you okay?

347
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:07,499
Is this what they mean by small-town charm?

348
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:09,766
-[boy] Yeah. -Bullies!

349
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,733
Ah, come on.

350
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,833
Thanks. It’s nice to see

351
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,766
there’s some gentlemen in this one-horse town.

352
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,766
Huh?

353
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,966
Never mind.

354
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,366
I’m Lisa.

355
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,966
Uh...

356
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,599
Is everyone here a one-syllable dolt

357
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,933
like those Neanderthals back there?

358
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:26,032
You talk awful fast.

359
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:29,132
People say I’m wise beyond my years.

360
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,099
It’s from moving around too much.

361
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,599
My dad gets transferred a lot.

362
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,099
I’m used to this, new town, new people,

363
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,699
being treated like an outsider.

364
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,699
It’s okay, though.

365
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:40,132
Builds character.

366
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,399
So?

367
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,799
What?

368
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:46,933
You still haven’t told me your name yet.

369
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,666
Oh. Peter.

370
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,432
Well, O’Peter, it was nice to meet you.

371
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,032
You want to get a soda or something?

372
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,632
You mean like a date?

373
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,165
Really, O’Peter, get over yourself.

374
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,566
You’re kinda cute, but I just want to be friends.

375
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,199
I got things to do.

376
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:08,766
Boys.

377
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,766
Hey, Baretta, what you investigating today?

378
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,399
Robbery, Main Street.

379
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,999
So when you coming back to play ball?

380
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,666
[telephone ringing]

381
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:21,833
Hey, Charlie.

382
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:23,432
Hey, kiddo.

383
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,265
What’s going on?

384
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,499
Nothing. It is quieter than a monk’s convention in here.

385
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:32,265
Anything on the B & E last night?

386
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,599
Peter, leave it alone.

387
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,099
Well, Jim dusted for prints. Nothing.

388
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,933
And they found some blood spots,

389
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,165
but it didn’t lead anywhere.

390
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,566
It’s small potatoes, anyway,

391
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:43,165
just a few bucks missing.

392
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,432
No crime’s too small.

393
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,933
You tell that to the guys who make the budget.

394
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:49,733
Yeesh. I hate these things.

395
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,699
Press the F1 key.

396
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,399
[computer beeps]

397
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,733
And they say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.

398
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,466
-What are these? -Doughnuts.

399
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:03,366
I think they call it downsizing.

400
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:06,332
I am a cop. What do I know about budgets?

401
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,933
Hey, Charlie,

402
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,599
could you do me a favor?

403
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,733
Is this gonna get me in trouble with your mother?

404
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,866
Nah. It’s my, uh, science project

405
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:15,599
for when school starts up.

406
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,399
School. Sounds vaguely familiar.

407
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,366
Come on, Charlie. Quit kidding.

408
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,065
I’ve got this blood sample.

409
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:24,833
It’s mine.

410
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,165
Anyway, it’s on this slide.

411
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,165
Can you run this up to the boys in the lab, get a blood type?

412
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:31,799
"The boys in the lab"?

413
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,999
What, have you been watching Homicide again?

414
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,165
Come on, Charlie. Please?

415
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,999
[sighs] All right, I’ll do it, but that’s all.

416
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,599
And if you think I can get you DNA, RFLP, WXYZ,

417
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,232
you’ve been watching Court TV too much.

418
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,632
Thanks, Charlie. You’re the best.

419
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,432
Yes, I am.

420
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,933
Hmm.

421
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:08,332
Watch where you’re going, kid!

422
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:28,165
[Peter] I really wanted to check out Downey some more,

423
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,899
but I knew Mom would kill me if I was late for dinner.

424
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,299
[woman] Mike, I have a car blocking the driveway at the back.

425
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:35,966
[Mike] Uh, roger that.

426
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,899
Hi, sweetie. I’m sorry I’m late.

427
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,399
Why isn’t the table set?

428
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,399
Whoops.

429
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,099
Ohh, Peter.

430
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:44,699
I ask you one little thing.

431
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,999
Why don’t you forget things

432
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:47,866
like Law & Order being on tonight?

433
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,632
’Cause it’s my favorite.

434
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:51,332
Of course.

435
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,099
[sighs]

436
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:54,432
So I brought you something.

437
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,632
I know your birthday’s not for a couple weeks.

438
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,132
You got me a new scanner.

439
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,799
No.

440
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,866
I know the summer leagues are signing up next week,

441
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,065
and I thought maybe you’d want to sign up for them.

442
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:09,499
Thanks, Mom.

443
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,299
[sighs] Yes, Mr. Mayor.

444
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:20,766
I-I know the zoning budgets are due tomorrow.

445
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:24,532
Uh-huh. Yes, I’m working on them right now.

446
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,933
-[doorbell rings] -[gasps]

447
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:29,566
Uh-huh. Uh, Mr. Mayor, that’s my door.

448
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:32,165
Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay.

449
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:36,099
All right. Yes, I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

450
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,399
Peter’s. He left it.

451
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:45,866
Of course.

452
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,566
Come on in.

453
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,766
I’m just getting ready for dinner.

454
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,366
Well, I can’t really stay or anything.

455
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:53,632
I gotta get back to the station. I’m doing budgets and stuff.

456
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,733
-Oh, tell me about it. -What’s that?

457
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,199
Oh...

458
00:27:57,265 --> 00:27:59,699
Budget marinara, my favorite.

459
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,699
Uh, would you like some soda?

460
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:02,699
Ooh, ye--

461
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,165
Uh, no. Thanks, anyway.

462
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:08,232
Yeah, it sure smells great in here, though.

463
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,065
You always were a great cook.

464
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:11,065
Paul used to say...

465
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,766
Stupid, stupid. I’m sorry.

466
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,065
No, no, no. Don’t be sorry.

467
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:17,566
I know you mean well.

468
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,699
[sighs]

469
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,699
You know if there was anything that I could do

470
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,899
to change that night, I would.

471
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,532
I mean, when he insisted on changing shifts,

472
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,933
-I should have-- -Yes, yes, I know,

473
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,733
and then a drunk driver wouldn’t have hit him.

474
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,199
I know. We’ve been through this. Please.

475
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:35,466
You gotta remember he loved what he did.

476
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:38,099
He couldn’t have done-- He wouldn’t have done anything else.

477
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:40,065
Yeah.

478
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,766
And I’m the one who’s left alone

479
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,499
trying to raise a kid who wants to follow in his father’s footsteps,

480
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:47,532
but who doesn’t realize what it’s doing to me.

481
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:53,766
Frank, you have got to stop encouraging Peter with all this cop stuff.

482
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:57,165
Oh, I’m-- I’m trying.

483
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,899
It’s just he’s so much like Paul.

484
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,532
Yeah.

485
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:07,065
[chopping]

486
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,299
And, um...

487
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:16,899
Listen, Sarah...

488
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:21,599
you ever need anything,

489
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,899
you know you can count on me.

490
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:35,032
Okay, read what we’ve got back.

491
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,032
[whispering] Evidence:

492
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,532
Bloody piece of mirror--

493
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,532
Not that voice.

494
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:47,666
Forty dollars stolen, Blood trail.

495
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,866
To do: Tomorrow morning,

496
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:52,032
question Mr. Downey.

497
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:54,466
Right, Downey.

498
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,032
Hey! Hey!

499
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,432
-[kid] Downey! -Hey, get out of there,

500
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,032
-you little rug rats! -Get out of here!

501
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,065
-Go on! Move! -Downey! Hurry!

502
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,332
[stereo playing rock music]

503
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,566
What do you want?

504
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,766
-I, uh-- -"I, uh--"

505
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:30,966
You guys are all the same.

506
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,933
You keep bugging me, you kids.

507
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,265
What happened to your hand?

508
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,099
I cut it yesterday

509
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,699
because of the Man.

510
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:38,933
What man?

511
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,699
The Man, the system,

512
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,599
-Cosgrove and his cronies. -The Mayor?

513
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,799
Yeah. He’s been trying to run me out of town for years.

514
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,866
They keep accusing me of code violations.

515
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:51,099
I keep fixing the stuff,

516
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:54,199
but they keep finding more.

517
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,432
Get out of here. I got work to do.

518
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,866
Charlie, I’ve got it.

519
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:18,432
Yeah, me, too.

520
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,099
I haven’t been able to sit all morning.

521
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,799
-Huh? -Never mind.

522
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:22,966
What have you got?

523
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:24,399
-I know who did it. -Did what?

524
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,499
Robbed the Mayor’s store.

525
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,099
Do you have the blood test results?

526
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:28,199
Now wait a second.

527
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:30,065
I thought that blood test was for school.

528
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:33,466
Would you have done it if I told you what it was really for?

529
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:34,933
Mm, good point.

530
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,399
You’re gonna make a great cop,

531
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,332
but an even better politician.

532
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,933
Hey, Frank, I know who robbed the Mayor’s store, Downey.

533
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:44,599
Listen. I thought we agreed

534
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,899
you were gonna let us do the investigating.

535
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,099
Charlie, you got the report on mall vandalism?

536
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,366
But, Frank...

537
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:52,432
No buts about it. You can’t go around

538
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:54,332
accusing people of things without proof.

539
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,165
But I have proof. Bet you the blood test matches Downey’s.

540
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:00,899
What’s he talking about?

541
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,699
Well, he came to me. You were busy with those darn budgets.

542
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,299
And I’ll bet you it matches the blood

543
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,799
I scraped off the broken glass from the Mayor’s store.

544
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:11,065
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

545
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,999
You telling me that you removed evidence from a crime scene?

546
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:19,099
Peter, you know better than that.

547
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:20,733
Frank, just listen.

548
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,833
There’s blood, his hand’s cut,

549
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,132
and the drops lead to his garage.

550
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,899
Besides, Downey hates the Mayor.

551
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:29,799
Frank, don’t you think you should at least look into it?

552
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,299
Yeah, well, but I’ll look into it.

553
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:35,399
-Guy’s got a record. -See?

554
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:37,666
Ah, granted it was in the sixties.

555
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:39,566
Hey, it was chic back then.

556
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,165
Don’t you think this lets you off the hook.

557
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:45,065
Hey, it’s me, Charlie...

558
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,833
And I want you to go right home.

559
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,632
I don’t want you to be late for dinner,

560
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,232
’cause I don’t want to have to explain

561
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:51,833
to your mom what you been up to.

562
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,499
Please don’t.

563
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,099
Channel 9 has a Dragnet marathon on tomorrow.

564
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,432
Get out of here.

565
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,332
-[Charlie] Thank you. -[hangs up receiver]

566
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,432
Run down his blood by Doc Wentworth.

567
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,666
If there’s any sort of match, I’ll question him.

568
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,466
I already did.

569
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,599
What are you guys looking at, huh?

570
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,599
[Frank] Thanks, Jim.

571
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,632
His alibi checks out.

572
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,666
He was playing harmonica at the Moose Lodge.

573
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,599
Sorry for the inconvenience. Good day to you.

574
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,933
Once again, the Man’s coming down on the little peoples.

575
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,866
And get off my property, Sparky.

576
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:30,866
Pipe-smoking, beard-wearing, no-good Communist punk.

577
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:34,032
Hey, Charlie.

578
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,933
Why, if it isn’t Sherlock Holmes.

579
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,299
What happened with Mr. Downey?

580
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:40,065
Uh, Peter, come on in here.

581
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,999
Downey didn’t do it.

582
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,933
But I thought...

583
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,866
He’s got an alibi.

584
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,032
Listen, kiddo, I been thinking about our arrangement,

585
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,432
and, you know, it’s okay with me

586
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:58,632
if you ride around in the squad car with us sometimes,

587
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:00,232
but I really think the time has come

588
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,099
for you to leave the police work to us.

589
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,265
But, Frank...

590
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,799
Ah, no buts.

591
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:08,833
I’m really counting on you on this one, okay?

592
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,599
Uh, Frank,

593
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,032
Mayor on line one.

594
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,833
I suddenly have the urge to go to the bathroom.

595
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,733
Yeah.

596
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,532
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

597
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,933
Frank, about your budget proposal,

598
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,265
town council shot it down.

599
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,566
Someone has to go, and...

600
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,366
So, what, the oldest goes first? I-- This doe--

601
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:33,165
Is there anything that I can do?

602
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:35,733
Well, you could plead his case

603
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,966
before the town council tomorrow evening,

604
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,899
but it’s your last shot.

605
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:43,866
Uh, thank you, Mayor Cosgrove.

606
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,966
[whispering] Go ahead.

607
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:56,866
Be careful this time, Stan.

608
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,399
What do you mean, be careful?

609
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,299
I’m always careful. You wanna do this?

610
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,899
Well, I could probably do it better.

611
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,432
No, remember the old lady that I punched out in Churchville?

612
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,532
Oh, that was different.

613
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,265
Oh, how hard is it to break something open

614
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,532
without cutting yourself? Come on.

615
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,099
I told you. I didn’t cut myself breaking in.

616
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,432
I cut myself falling over glass inside.

617
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,366
Clod.

618
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:17,599
So what are we waiting for?

619
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,933
Come on. Break it.

620
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,432
Ow! [groans]

621
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:23,899
Did you cut yourself again?

622
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:25,933
No. I banged my funny bone.

623
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,933
Oh.

624
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,799
[chuckles]

625
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,199
Do not duplicate, huh?

626
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,933
Watch this.

627
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:53,833
$40?

628
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:57,366
Jeez. That all they keep in these things?

629
00:35:57,432 --> 00:36:00,699
It’ll all be worth the trouble when we make the big score, baby.

630
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,999
Oh, I just love it when you talk like that. It’s so forceful.

631
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:05,899
Remember that couple in Lansdale,

632
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:07,933
-the ones you tied up? -Oh, yeah.

633
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,499
They were quaking in their boots.

634
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,265
Yeah. Oh, you were good.

635
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,833
[grinding]

636
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,299
Once we pull off this job,

637
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:22,499
they’re gonna have to erect a statue of me.

638
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,032
There it is.

639
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:36,966
-Oh. -The key to the city.

640
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:39,132
Oh, it is beauty-ful.

641
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,099
[Frank] ...is out. I mean, can’t you send somebody else?

642
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,065
Jim’s still inside taking down his statement.

643
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:50,432
[woman] Did they get much?

644
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,232
Ah, just 40 bucks from the cash register.

645
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,733
How’s the kook? Oops. I mean Downey.

646
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,899
[laughs] He’s fine. He’s fine.

647
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,366
Takes a lot to shake that guy up.

648
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:01,532
Downey’s place was robbed.

649
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,566
[Lisa] So where’s the fire?

650
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:06,099
There’s been two robberies.

651
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,265
Ooh. Hot time in the old town.

652
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,366
Actually, I’m in the middle of the investigation.

653
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:13,499
Who are you, Columbo Jr.?

654
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,332
Heh. Very funny.

655
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,199
The cops don’t seem to care too much,

656
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,833
’cause the robberies were so small,

657
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:20,165
but I know something’s up.

658
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,366
Cool! Some excitement.

659
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:23,199
I’m on the case with you, Starsky.

660
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:25,165
No, you’re not. I work alone.

661
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,532
Aw, come on. Two heads are better than one.

662
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,399
Besides, what do you know about detective work?

663
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:30,933
My dad was a cop.

664
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,366
Was?

665
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:34,566
He died about a year ago.

666
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,265
Wow, that’s tough.

667
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:38,466
We did everything together.

668
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:43,132
He used to tell me, "You see something wrong, you gotta make it right."

669
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,699
I think you need a partner.

670
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,532
Come on. Cagney had Lacey.

671
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,766
Nick had Nora Charles.

672
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,065
Batman had Robin.

673
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:51,566
Wait. Check that last one.

674
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:52,999
I’m not into green tights.

675
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,299
Okay, I’ll tell you what. You can come along,

676
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:57,165
and if I need your help, I’ll ask.

677
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:58,699
If not, stay out of it.

678
00:37:58,766 --> 00:37:59,833
Deal.

679
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:03,999
[stereo playing rock music]

680
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,733
See those old clunkers over there?

681
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:13,866
Yeah.

682
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,232
Downey hates it when kids play in ’em.

683
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,532
Go play in ’em.

684
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,966
What?! I’m a decoy?

685
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,399
Shh.

686
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:30,432
[tool whirs]

687
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,366
Hey, what are you doing here?

688
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:35,399
-Who, me? -Yeah, you.

689
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:37,966
I told you kids not to come around here.

690
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,999
Well, I’m new in town.

691
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,966
Know where a girl can get a good manicure?

692
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,265
Aw, jeez.

693
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,132
[Peter] Good thing for Lisa,

694
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,065
she had a vocabulary that could confuse a guy for a month.

695
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:52,332
All I needed was a little time.

696
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,165
[Lisa] Sorry.

697
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,933
[creaks]

698
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,733
Ooh. What kind of car is that?

699
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,165
My brother’s in the market.

700
00:39:41,232 --> 00:39:42,966
I don’t have time for games, kid.

701
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,466
Look, I got work to do, okay,

702
00:39:46,532 --> 00:39:48,699
and I don’t need you to get hurt.

703
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,399
But wait! Mr. Downey...

704
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:53,299
uh, don’t go in yet!

705
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,165
Hey, wait a minute! I, um--

706
00:39:55,232 --> 00:39:57,899
Are you still here?

707
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,165
[tool clatters]

708
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,199
Hey!

709
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:09,532
What are you doing in here?

710
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,265
[Lisa] Yeah, what are you doing in here?

711
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:14,466
These neighborhood kids. I see what you mean.

712
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:16,632
They don’t ever leave you alone, do they?

713
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:19,065
Yeah.

714
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:22,532
Well? What do you have to say for yourself?

715
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,199
I was, um...

716
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:26,799
looking to have a key made for my mom.

717
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:29,332
She wanted to know how much it would cost.

718
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,499
79 cents.

719
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,299
If that darn thing still works.

720
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:35,366
You mean the machine’s broken?

721
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,099
I don’t know.

722
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,366
I haven’t used it in a year.

723
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:41,699
Oh. Okay, I’ll tell my mom.

724
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,099
Yeah, you do that.

725
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:44,332
You kids get out of here.

726
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,499
I got work to do.

727
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,933
Thank you, Mr. Downey.

728
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,165
I’ll come by every now and then just to say hello.

729
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,933
[chuckles] Yeah.

730
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,065
Whatever.

731
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,833
What was all that about?

732
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:00,265
What was all what about?

733
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,599
All that about "all these neighborhood kids"?

734
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:05,666
"I’ll stop by every once in a while"? What was that?

735
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,899
[sighs] That was called good detective work.

736
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,566
What?

737
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,032
Number one, if your partner gets caught,

738
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:13,699
don’t let on that we know each other.

739
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:16,232
Number two, all that about neighborhood kids and all

740
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:20,199
was to give you time to come up with a decent excuse for being in there.

741
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,666
Well, what’d you find?

742
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,899
Nothing for sure, anyway.

743
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,165
[sighs] Well, I don’t trust that guy.

744
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:28,899
He gives me the creeps.

745
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,499
Lisa, why don’t you go to the park?

746
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:32,099
I’ll meet you there in a few minutes.

747
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:34,265
Sure. See you there.

748
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:38,899
[clears throat]

749
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,165
Um, Mr. Downey.

750
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:44,566
I was wondering if I could talk to you.

751
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:47,032
You kids are worse than the rats in this place,

752
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,466
never leaving me alone.

753
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:51,566
Well, I need to tell you something.

754
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:53,232
What, already?

755
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:56,432
Remember that time Frank questioned you about the robbery?

756
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,466
What about it?

757
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:02,132
I kind of told him that I thought you did it.

758
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:04,566
You snitch.

759
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:05,966
Please don’t be mad.

760
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:08,733
It’s just that when I saw your hand and the blood

761
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,766
and the blood trail from the collectibles store

762
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,032
and all the things you said about the Mayor...

763
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,866
I’m sorry I caused you trouble.

764
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:21,299
Takes a lot of guts to admit that you’re wrong.

765
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,332
Apology accepted, kid.

766
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:25,332
I promise to make it up to you.

767
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:31,999
-Hey, Lisa. -Hi.

768
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:33,966
-Want to get some ice cream? -Sure.

769
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:36,265
All this detective work has got my appetite going.

770
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:37,999
I’m gonna get a Slide-Up. What do you want?

771
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:39,733
Is this on you?

772
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:40,799
Sure.

773
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:41,933
Make it two.

774
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,933
Okay.

775
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:44,933
[truck playing soft music]

776
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,499
Hi. Can I have two Slide-Ups, please?

777
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:51,999
Stan.

778
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:53,666
The Slide-Up kid is back.

779
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,899
Slide-Ups? We don’t have any Slide-Ups, kid.

780
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:58,065
Ice cream is ice cream. What do you want?

781
00:42:58,132 --> 00:42:59,733
How long you guys had this truck?

782
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:01,766
-Seven years. -Five years.

783
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:04,999
Uh, what Stan means is that we’ve had the truck for seven years,

784
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,032
but we’ve been using it for five.

785
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,632
I don’t remember seeing you before this year.

786
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:12,399
Where are you guys from?

787
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:13,999
-Moreland. -Southampton.

788
00:43:14,065 --> 00:43:17,632
Uh, what Stan means is that we are originally from Southampton...

789
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,065
-Yeah. -but we’ve been living in Moreland...

790
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,966
-Yeah. -for about a year.

791
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:22,399
Oh.

792
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,599
-But you told me Moreland. -Why Moreland?

793
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,065
-We never said Moreland. What are you talking... -Shh!

794
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:29,899
Get what you want, but stall ’em.

795
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:31,299
I’m gonna have a look around.

796
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:32,532
Got it.

797
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:35,632
[Beverly] If you told me Southampton,

798
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:36,733
where did I get Moreland, huh?

799
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:37,833
The same place you pull everything else...

800
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:42,032
Um, what shall I have?

801
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,966
What’s your biggest seller today?

802
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,199
Sandwiches.

803
00:43:47,265 --> 00:43:48,532
Okay.

804
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:51,899
"Biggest seller"? Who is she,

805
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:53,866
Price Waterhouse Jr.?

806
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:03,966
You know, this problem with not having Slide-Ups

807
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:07,165
could be solved with a computerized inventory program.

808
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:13,899
And this xanthan gum, what exactly is it?

809
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:15,432
[Stan] How should I know?

810
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,032
I’ve never bought xanthan at the five-and-ten.

811
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:19,666
Is it sweet?

812
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:23,165
[Beverly] So-- So now she’s a food inspector.

813
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:24,332
"Xanthan gum."

814
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:27,132
Xanthan.

815
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,132
Xanthan.

816
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:33,466
I guess... cinnamon family.

817
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,132
Uh, wait!

818
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,666
Look, look, kid, what is it already?

819
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:40,532
You want to know what kind of gas I put in the truck?

820
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,432
Well, now that you mention it...

821
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:44,699
Look, uh, we gotta go.

822
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,065
Uh, that’s okay.

823
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,399
Don’t want you to think I’m nosey or anything.

824
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:50,599
Come on.

825
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:54,766
Why do I always have to be the decoy?

826
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,532
’Cause you think fast and always have something to say.

827
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,733
Right.

828
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,432
When I want to go to Harvard,

829
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:03,032
I’ll use you as a reference.

830
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:04,733
"Marvin Richards."

831
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:07,000
I’ve seen that name before.

832
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,099
That’s not the way to Moreland.

833
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:16,366
Lisa, I’ll catch you later.

834
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:18,165
Yeah, I better get going, too.

835
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,366
Yes. It’s got Moreland in it.

836
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:35,299
Dworkin. Dworkin. Dworkin. Dworkin.

837
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:38,399
It’s not there.

838
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,466
[telephone ringing]

839
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:45,799
Hey, Charlie. What’s going on?

840
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,699
Hey, kiddo. Not a thing.

841
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:50,199
I been watching the mold grow in the refrigerator.

842
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:51,766
Mind if I hang a while?

843
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,666
Knock yourself out.

844
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:16,432
-Hey, Charlie. -Hmm?

845
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:18,466
If you knew something was gonna happen,

846
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:19,899
but you didn’t know what or when,

847
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,332
how would you go about it?

848
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:23,432
Call a psychic hot line.

849
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:25,199
Come on, Charlie.

850
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:26,733
Now, where’s Frank?

851
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:28,199
Ah, he’s out at the school

852
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:29,366
checking out vandalism.

853
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:31,065
He thinks it’s a couple of bullies

854
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:33,232
bored, with nothing to do.

855
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:34,666
Hey, what’d Dad and Frank do

856
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:36,666
if they had a hunch about something?

857
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,733
Get proof.

858
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,599
Uh, I can see you’re busy, Charlie,

859
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:50,366
so I’ll just check you later.

860
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,966
Yeah. See ya, kiddo.

861
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,299
I’m in.

862
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:22,032
Stan Dworkin.

863
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:31,933
Let’s try Beverly Dworkin.

864
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:38,265
[sighs] One more try.

865
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:42,332
Marvin Richards.

866
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:47,699
Let’s try the DMV.

867
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:56,332
Stan Dworkin.

868
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,899
All right, it’s 7:00,

869
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,499
two hours before it gets dark.

870
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:06,899
Now I figured out where to put the truck.

871
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:07,899
Right here.

872
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:08,933
Oh, yeah.

873
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,000
That way, it’ll be out of sight.

874
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:11,366
Yeah, good call, Stan.

875
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:13,299
Once we get into City Hall, it’s a piece of cake.

876
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:15,165
We’ll be in and out of there in two seconds.

877
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:18,165
Then all we gotta do is wait for Mrs. Rich Lady to leave town,

878
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:19,999
-and we’re home free. -Yeah.

879
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:27,232
We’ve got the Mayor’s store.

880
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:32,032
40 bucks stolen.

881
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,733
Then Downey’s.

882
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:38,232
$40 again.

883
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:42,933
But the key machine.

884
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,432
Why would someone break in to use the key machine?

885
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,399
We’re obviously dealing with someone very clever.

886
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,000
-Give me the key. -I don’t have the key.

887
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:18,566
What do you mean, you don’t have the key?

888
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:20,366
-I don’t have the key. -I just gave it to you to hold.

889
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:21,733
No, you didn’t. You didn’t give me the key.

890
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:23,099
Are you telling me you don’t have the key?

891
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:25,265
I don’t have the key. Did you look in your pockets?

892
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:26,466
I don’t have it!

893
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:28,232
Oh. Wait a minute.

894
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,366
[grunts]

895
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:33,733
I got it.

896
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:36,766
-This was in your shoe? -Yeah.

897
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,766
Hate to think what else you might have in there.

898
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,699
What does it have to do with the Mayor’s store?

899
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:49,833
And are Stan and Beverly involved?

900
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,466
Key machine.

901
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,733
Keys.

902
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,165
That’s it.

903
00:49:57,232 --> 00:50:00,032
The Mayor checked his keys when his store was robbed.

904
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,866
Could be a key to City Hall.

905
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:06,833
There’s nothing worth stealing in there.

906
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:41,499
[Stan] This is it.

907
00:50:57,366 --> 00:50:59,165
Soon we’re gonna have it all.

908
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:01,833
[sighs]

909
00:51:01,899 --> 00:51:03,833
I could settle for a place like this.

910
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:06,933
-Place like this? -Yeah.

911
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:08,666
What about our dream?

912
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,699
The motor home?

913
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,432
A motor home?

914
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,499
That is your idea of a-- of a dream?

915
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:17,999
Yeah.

916
00:51:18,065 --> 00:51:19,566
We gotta think bigger.

917
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:21,733
Bigger? Why?

918
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:23,165
If we had a place like this,

919
00:51:23,232 --> 00:51:25,099
we’d be doing nothing but cleaning all the time.

920
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,399
And a motor home? It would be plenty of cleaning

921
00:51:27,466 --> 00:51:29,065
every time a tornado whipped through.

922
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:31,366
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Am I to understand now

923
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:33,666
that a motor home is no longer good enough for you?

924
00:51:35,532 --> 00:51:37,466
Only one way to find out.

925
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,699
Get proof.

926
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,799
Testing. One, two, testing.

927
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:47,032
[radio static]

928
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:07,299
[Jacobs] So I’ll be leaving

929
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:09,332
this afternoon until next Wednesday

930
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:10,332
visiting my daughter.

931
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:12,232
Of course, Mrs. Jacobs.

932
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,766
Oh, Charlie.

933
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,499
How many times have I told you to call me Edna?

934
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,366
You make me feel so old when you call me Mrs. Jacobs.

935
00:52:19,432 --> 00:52:21,265
You? You’re just a kid.

936
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:23,165
[laughs] You are a sweetheart.

937
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:24,866
Now, about my house...

938
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,332
I’ll see to it personally.

939
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:28,833
Believe it or not, I’m not chained to my desk.

940
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:31,999
When I’m good, my son let’s me go all the way

941
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,833
across town to Moreland’s Bakery for doughnuts.

942
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:36,733
[laughs] Charlie, you’re too much.

943
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:38,733
That’s what all the women say.

944
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:40,566
-Charlie. -[chuckles]

945
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:42,000
Bye, Mrs. Jacobs.

946
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,399
Mom, I’m going out!

947
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:48,699
Peter, wait!

948
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,299
Hon, will you do me a huge favor?

949
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:51,833
Will you give Mrs. Jacobs these maps?

950
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:53,265
She needs them for her trip. Thanks.

951
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:55,065
-Hey, Mom... -Hmm?

952
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:57,165
do they keep anything valuable at City Hall?

953
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:59,599
No, except for the people who work there,

954
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,899
files, lots of files,

955
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:04,566
blueprints, deeds, things like that.

956
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:05,966
How come?

957
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:07,799
-Just curious. -Mm.

958
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:09,966
You are never just curious.

959
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:11,432
Bye, Mom!

960
00:53:11,499 --> 00:53:13,532
And no police station!

961
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,099
Stop wiggling your leg.

962
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:26,099
Thank you.

963
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:27,999
Now, here’s where we are.

964
00:53:28,065 --> 00:53:30,632
Here’s where the front door is.

965
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:32,699
Here is where I think the secret room

966
00:53:32,766 --> 00:53:33,899
with the safe ought to be.

967
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,099
"Ought to be" or is? I mean, we gotta be sure.

968
00:53:36,165 --> 00:53:38,132
Is! Is! Is!

969
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:40,399
Now, the lady told me that she’s leaving tonight--

970
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,699
You know, I love it when you act like Marvin Richards.

971
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,966
I mean, it just-- it just gives me goose bumps.

972
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:46,299
She’s leaving tonight,

973
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:47,733
and she won’t be back ’til Wednesday.

974
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:48,733
Are you sure?

975
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:50,232
Why are you doubting me?

976
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:51,432
I’m just double-checking.

977
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:52,632
What’s the matter with that?

978
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,666
Nothing, as long as you don’t contradict me.

979
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,966
I hate being contradicted.

980
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,132
Who’s contradicting? I’m just double-checking.

981
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,132
Long as it’s not double-checking via contradiction.

982
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,132
It’s double-checking via checking.

983
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,165
-Hi, guys! -[Beverly screams] You little--

984
00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:06,699
Oh.

985
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:09,632
Oh, it’s you.

986
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:11,666
Stan, i-it’s the Slide-Up kid.

987
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:12,799
-Yeah. -Hi.

988
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:14,132
What are you guys doing?

989
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,000
Shouldn’t you be at the park selling ice cream?

990
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:17,966
-We’re taking a break. -We’re restocking.

991
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:20,299
Uh, what Stan means is that we’re,

992
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:22,366
uh, taking a break from restocking.

993
00:54:22,432 --> 00:54:24,666
Does this mean you have Slide-Ups?

994
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:26,666
Yeah. We just got a whole new shipload of ’em.

995
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,666
-Yeah, I’ll get you one. -Have one on the house.

996
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,499
I’ll take that.

997
00:54:41,132 --> 00:54:42,065
Here.

998
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:48,733
What’s wrong?

999
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,799
It’s not a Slide-Up.

1000
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:52,366
It’s a Blue Thunder.

1001
00:54:52,432 --> 00:54:53,733
Oh.

1002
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:55,766
Well, um, you know,

1003
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,132
I think-- I think a Blue Thunder is much more cool.

1004
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,065
Yeah. Look, kid, we’re sort of busy around here,

1005
00:55:00,132 --> 00:55:02,199
so could you make like an egg and beat it?

1006
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,366
That’s okay.

1007
00:55:03,432 --> 00:55:04,866
You’ve been a great help.

1008
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,265
Oh. Goodbye.

1009
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:09,065
[Stan] That kid asks a lot of questions.

1010
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:10,499
Should we be worried?

1011
00:55:10,566 --> 00:55:12,466
He’s just a kid.

1012
00:55:12,532 --> 00:55:13,933
That’s exactly what worries me.

1013
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,432
I was just a kid once, too.

1014
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:21,232
Feel like a darn Pied Piper.

1015
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,966
Kids follow me around wherever I go.

1016
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:26,899
Yeah, but you look so cute in your-- in your ice cream outfit.

1017
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:29,232
Cute? We haven’t looked this ridiculous

1018
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:30,666
since we posed as Bible salesmen

1019
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,366
for that heist in Tuscaloosa.

1020
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:35,299
[Beverly] Personally, I think that was a very enlightening experience.

1021
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:36,432
Enlightening? Heh.

1022
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,632
Give me a break, will you?

1023
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:41,566
I mean it.

1024
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,966
[Peter] I was sure those two were up to no good.

1025
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:56,065
Unless I got the goods on ’em,

1026
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:57,466
no one would believe me.

1027
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:10,399
I can’t wait to ditch this stupid truck.

1028
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:13,699
It won’t be long now.

1029
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,766
-[static crackles] -[Stan chuckles]

1030
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,332
You’re getting those goose bumps again.

1031
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:21,766
Yeah, I know. I always do

1032
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,799
when we’re getting ready to do a big job.

1033
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,966
[multiple channels overlapping]

1034
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:30,065
...robbing a bank.

1035
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:32,833
They’re gonna rob the bank tonight.

1036
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:34,599
[both laughing]

1037
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,566
Ooh.

1038
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:41,199
[vehicle approaching]

1039
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,966
Frank, you’re not gonna believe this.

1040
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:01,466
They’re gonna rob the bank.

1041
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,699
[sighs] Now pull the O’Leary file, will you?

1042
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:05,099
I thought we agreed that we weren’t

1043
00:57:05,165 --> 00:57:06,466
gonna keep doing this, Peter.

1044
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,432
But I heard them with my own ears.

1045
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:10,232
[sighs] Check priors. Who?

1046
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:11,899
Stan and Beverly.

1047
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:13,899
Who are Stan and Beverly?

1048
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:15,366
They own the ice-cream truck.

1049
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,165
No, Peter, no.

1050
00:57:17,232 --> 00:57:19,999
No, no, no. First you tell me it’s Mr. Downey.

1051
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,833
Now you’re telling me it’s the ice cream man. Who’s next?

1052
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,065
I hear the Queen of England’s got money troubles.

1053
00:57:25,132 --> 00:57:26,499
But, Frank, I heard them.

1054
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:28,432
They’re gonna rob the bank tonight.

1055
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:30,532
I tried to get proof, but...

1056
00:57:31,632 --> 00:57:32,666
You expect me to believe

1057
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:34,833
a cockamamie story about ice cream thieves?

1058
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:36,833
I saw them looking at these drawings.

1059
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:38,532
They said, "Property of City Hall."

1060
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,766
-Drawings? -Yeah.

1061
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,799
Looked like a building, like maybe the bank.

1062
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:44,833
I saw them looking at them in their truck.

1063
00:57:44,899 --> 00:57:46,733
I know they stole ’em from City Hall.

1064
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,532
Eh, there were no reported break-ins at City Hall.

1065
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,332
Because they had a key.

1066
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:54,099
Okay, how’d they get a key?

1067
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:57,499
This.

1068
00:57:57,566 --> 00:57:58,966
Key shavings.

1069
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:01,833
Stan and Beverly got a copy of the Mayor’s City Hall key

1070
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,733
from his store and copied it at Mr. Downey’s.

1071
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:05,966
They made a mold. Oldest trick in the book,

1072
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:07,532
almost as old as my career.

1073
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,866
Stan broke in to the Mayor’s store

1074
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:10,165
to make a mold of the key.

1075
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:12,399
I saw his sneaker, and there was blood on it.

1076
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:14,999
They broke in to Downey’s to get a copy of the key

1077
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:17,799
and got into City Hall to steal the plans. It’s all there.

1078
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,499
Uh, as much as I hate to admit it,

1079
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:20,866
I think you may be onto something,

1080
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:22,733
but listen. This has got to stay between you and I.

1081
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,499
I don’t want you saying anything to your mother.

1082
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,332
She’s got enough to worry about right now.

1083
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:28,332
Sure. Hey, Frank...

1084
00:58:28,399 --> 00:58:31,165
isn’t this just like you and Dad used to do?

1085
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:35,199
Yeah.

1086
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,699
Yeah, it’s just like we used to do.

1087
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,699
Oh, I-- Town council meeting.

1088
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:44,132
-I gotta make the proposal tonight. -I’ll go to the meeting.

1089
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,866
-No, no, no. It’s gotta be me this time. -...you stop the robbery.

1090
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,000
No discussion, Frank.

1091
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,899
You go and catch those guys, okay?

1092
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,866
[stereo playing rock music]

1093
00:58:57,933 --> 00:58:59,532
[Edna clearing throat]

1094
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:02,566
Well, Arnold?

1095
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:05,733
[grunts]

1096
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,666
Relax, mamacita.

1097
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,566
Here’s your problem.

1098
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:12,632
Radiator hose, it’s broken.

1099
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,632
Well, that doesn’t smell--

1100
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:17,799
sound too bad, does it?

1101
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:20,165
Nah, not once I get the part,

1102
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:21,165
probably tomorrow.

1103
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:22,366
Tomorrow?

1104
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:24,632
Uh, but I wanted to leave today.

1105
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:26,499
Hey, relax. You can hang out with me.

1106
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:27,966
We can listen to The Doors.

1107
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:29,499
[laughing] Hang?

1108
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,833
Well, reminisce about high school.

1109
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:33,499
High school?

1110
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:35,699
Well, that was a long time ago.

1111
00:59:35,766 --> 00:59:38,532
Well, I don’t remember too much between then and now.

1112
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:41,466
I-I do remember you being pretty fine, though.

1113
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:44,733
I mean, not that you’re not fine now. I mean...

1114
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,165
[blows nose]

1115
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:48,466
Ahem.

1116
00:59:48,532 --> 00:59:50,399
[woman] Yeah, Adam, we just got a report.

1117
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:53,532
Those two kids just smashed some car windows on Main.

1118
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,399
[man] Roger. I’ll check it out. Over.

1119
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,099
Do you have an E.T.A. on that?

1120
00:59:57,165 --> 00:59:58,165
Uh, about ten min--

1121
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:10,165
She’s still here.

1122
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,032
I thought you said she was gonna be away, Stan.

1123
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:13,432
Don’t blame me. Something must have happened.

1124
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:14,766
Yeah, you’re losing it.

1125
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,265
This is what I get to look forward to in my old age?

1126
01:00:17,332 --> 01:00:20,165
I hate to say it, babe, but you’re not that far from it already.

1127
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:22,132
That’s a horrible thing to say.

1128
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,866
So I have wrinkles?

1129
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,065
You got ’em, too.

1130
01:00:25,132 --> 01:00:26,532
Yeah, but on me, they’re character lines.

1131
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:27,866
Now you’re saying I don’t have character.

1132
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,232
-Ah, Beverly-- -After all these years,

1133
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:31,566
this is the truth. This is what you really think of me.

1134
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:34,733
What I think is that you’re a noodge, a nag, and a thorn in my side.

1135
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,933
Yeah, well, I’ll stick something else

1136
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,632
in your side if you don’t watch out.

1137
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:40,332
Will you listen to how we’re talking to each other?

1138
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:42,733
We gotta keep our focus on the job at hand.

1139
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:46,265
Yeah, you’re right, sweetheart.

1140
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:48,232
What next?

1141
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,599
We’ll check it out and come back tomorrow.

1142
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,966
-[radio] Slow night tonight. -[slurping]

1143
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:55,165
Not much going on over here either. When’s your shift over?

1144
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:56,733
Looks like everything’s quiet at the bank tonight.

1145
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,833
...a double, so I can take all the action.

1146
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:06,432
[telephone rings]

1147
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:11,699
Hello.

1148
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:13,466
Hi, Sarah. It’s Frank.

1149
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:14,766
Hello, Frank.

1150
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,265
Uh, listen, I was just calling to check on Peter.

1151
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:18,499
Is he there with you?

1152
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,366
Uh, yeah. He’s in his room.

1153
01:01:20,432 --> 01:01:22,666
Wh-Why? Do you need to talk to him?

1154
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:25,132
No, no, not really. Just something might be coming down tonight.

1155
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,165
I wanted to make sure he was safe at home.

1156
01:01:27,232 --> 01:01:28,999
[sighs]

1157
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,432
Well, I appreciate you calling.

1158
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:32,833
Bye, Sarah.

1159
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,065
Bye-bye.

1160
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:39,499
[Charlie] Frank, you there?

1161
01:01:39,566 --> 01:01:41,466
Hey, Charlie, how’d the meeting go?

1162
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,299
The committee chairman said he’d rather have

1163
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,599
a new squad car than an extra cop,

1164
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:48,933
and I told him where he could put the squad car.

1165
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:50,065
Dad, you didn’t.

1166
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:51,366
Hey, don’t worry.

1167
01:01:51,432 --> 01:01:53,199
Retirement won’t be so bad.

1168
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:56,232
I’ve always wanted to learn how to play shuffleboard.

1169
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:57,265
Over and out.

1170
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:02,199
Over and out.

1171
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:03,632
[slurps]

1172

[chamber music playing]

1173
01:02:08,065 --> 01:02:09,532
Well, no, Mr. Richards.

1174
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,065
My plans haven’t changed. I’m leaving this morning.

1175
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:13,065
But I still want to meet with you next week.

1176
01:02:13,132 --> 01:02:16,065
Mrs. Jacobs, let me just tell you

1177
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,532
it’s a pleasure doing business with you.

1178
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:24,466
No, no, thank you.

1179
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,199

1181
01:02:33,632 --> 01:02:35,265
Hello.

1182
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,032
Oh, Arnold.

1183
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:40,299
What? What do you mean my car’s still not ready?

1184
01:02:40,366 --> 01:02:43,366
Well, here I’m telling everyone I’m leaving.

1185
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:45,699
Oh, my daughter’s gonna be so disappointed.

1186
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:48,699
Okay.

1187
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:53,933
[telephone ringing]

1188
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:55,499
Hey, Charlie.

1189
01:02:56,632 --> 01:02:57,666
Is Frank here?

1190
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,933
Kiddo, I don’t think you wanna know.

1191
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,399
Are Stan and Beverly being sent up the river?

1192
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:06,132
No, but you might want to grab a paddle.

1193
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,799
[Frank] Peter?

1194
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:10,933
Peter, I’m sorry. I want you out of here now.

1195
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,833
Frank, go easy.

1196
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:13,966
Frank, what’s going on?

1197
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:15,065
I’ll tell you what’s going on.

1198
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:16,065
Nothing is going on.

1199
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,332
There’s no bank robbery.

1200
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:19,699
There’s no Stan. There’s no Beverly.

1201
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:21,532
There’s no more meddling in police work for you.

1202
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,132
I don’t understand.

1203
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,966
You are not to set foot in this police station.

1204
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:28,332
That’s no longer a request, Peter.

1205
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:29,466
But, Frank--

1206
01:03:29,532 --> 01:03:30,966
There’s no buts about it.

1207
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:34,366
You were wrong. You--

1208
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:35,899
Why can’t you be like other kids

1209
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:37,566
and just go play ball or something?

1210
01:03:37,632 --> 01:03:40,199
’Cause I don’t want to be like other kids.

1211
01:03:40,265 --> 01:03:41,899
I wanna be like my dad.

1212
01:03:44,265 --> 01:03:46,766
I know you miss your father.

1213
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:51,032
I do, too.

1214
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:53,566
I know how you feel.

1215
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,899
You don’t know how I feel.

1216
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:17,132
[Lisa] Hey, there you are.

1217
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,299
I’ve-- Whoa, why so down?

1218
01:04:21,532 --> 01:04:23,132
Hi, Lisa.

1219
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:24,866
Hey, what’s the matter with you?

1220
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:26,833
Is this any way for a detective to be acting

1221
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:28,799
on the verge of breaking a case wide open?

1222
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,099
There’s no case.

1223
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:31,766
I’m done.

1224
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:32,866
Back up.

1225
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:34,733
This is not the old Peter I know.

1226
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,599
Come on. Who should I be a decoy for?

1227
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,165
No one.

1228
01:04:40,232 --> 01:04:42,366
You are not giving up.

1229
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:44,466
We are not giving up.

1230
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:46,366
Look, I just cost Charlie his job.

1231
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:49,933
Frank hates me, and he’s not letting me back at the station.

1232
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:53,265
When my mom finds out, she’s gonna kill me.

1233
01:04:53,332 --> 01:04:54,799
Come on, Peter.

1234
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:57,232
When you see there’s something wrong,

1235
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:59,232
you’ve got to make it right.

1236
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:02,032
You’re the one who told me that.

1237
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,165
Or is that only when there’s no challenge?

1238
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:07,165
[truck playing music]

1239
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:14,466
What time is it?

1240
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:16,065
Ten to 11:00.

1241
01:05:16,132 --> 01:05:18,599
Stan and Beverly take their break at 11:00 and come back at 2:00.

1242
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:20,799
I’m gonna go home and get my bike and follow ’em.

1243
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,666
Meet me back here at 2:00.

1244
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,132
You get ’em, O’Peter.

1245
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:25,699
Thanks, Lisa.

1246
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,065
Okay, Crunchy.

1247
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:38,299
Tonight’s the night.

1248
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:40,265
We get in, locate the room,

1249
01:05:40,332 --> 01:05:42,299
take what we came for, and get out fast.

1250
01:05:42,366 --> 01:05:44,366
Did you get in touch with that contact?

1251
01:05:44,432 --> 01:05:46,933
Yeah. He’s gonna sell the coins for us, no problem.

1252
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,399
Oh, honey, we’re gonna be rich, rich, rich.

1253
01:05:49,466 --> 01:05:51,099
Oh, we’ve never had it this easy.

1254
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:53,599
This is gonna be like taking ice cream from a baby.

1255
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,766
Yeah, and you would, too, wouldn’t you, Stan?

1256
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,733
Absolutely. [laughs]

1257
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:12,065
[Peter] Just as I had suspected,

1258
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:14,833
they were on their way right out of town.

1259
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:16,432
I knew I had to follow them

1260
01:06:16,499 --> 01:06:18,466
to whatever hole they crawled into.

1261
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:03,966
[clatter]

1262
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:08,899
[leaves crunch]

1263
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,899
Looking for this?

1264
01:07:23,966 --> 01:07:25,766
I was wondering how it got there.

1265
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:28,299
Whoa!

1266
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:31,799
[grunting]

1267
01:07:31,866 --> 01:07:32,799
[laughs]

1268
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:38,733
[camera whirs]

1269
01:07:40,132 --> 01:07:43,265
So did you check him for a wire?

1270
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:44,966
Good idea.

1271
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:51,032
Ah.

1272
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:52,599
Looky here.

1273
01:07:53,966 --> 01:07:55,999
A policeman’s badge?

1274
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:57,632
Whose is this?

1275
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,599
My dad’s.

1276
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,232
Well, too bad for you

1277
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:07,399
your dad ain’t around to help you out, huh?

1278
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:09,399
Stan, come on. Don’t be mean.

1279
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:10,799
It’s his dad.

1280
01:08:12,866 --> 01:08:14,065
Come here.

1281
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,833
Come on.

1282
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:23,833
This messes everything up.

1283
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,532
Now there are gonna be people looking for him, cops all over the place.

1284
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:28,499
Yeah, yeah. What do we do?

1285
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:31,232
I know what to do. I think we just gotta pull off the job

1286
01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:33,399
and get out of town. I hate this place.

1287
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:35,833
I don’t know what to do about the Slide-Up kid.

1288
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:38,499
I told you we shouldn’t do anything that involves children,

1289
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:40,632
but you wouldn’t listen to me. You never listen!

1290
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,666
It’s Mrs. Jacobs’ house.

1291
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:44,499
-[Beverly] Shh! -Don’t shush me.

1292
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:46,232
I’ll shush you whenever I want.

1293
01:08:46,299 --> 01:08:48,666
Stan must be Marvin Richards.

1294
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:52,165
They’re after the gold coins.

1295
01:08:52,232 --> 01:08:53,966
Of course not. Wait a minute.

1296
01:08:54,032 --> 01:08:55,632
You think I would put a gun to your head?

1297
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,733
-He just said it. -It was a logical...

1298
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,432
You know, a-a metaphor.

1299
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:01,099
-A metaphor? -A metaphor.

1300
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:02,899
[continues, indistinct]

1301
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,265
[doorbell rings]

1302
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:12,933
Hello.

1303
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:14,299
Hi.

1304
01:09:14,366 --> 01:09:16,032
You must be O’Peter’s mom.

1305
01:09:16,099 --> 01:09:17,366
I’m Lisa, a friend of his.

1306
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:19,165
Oh. Uh, yeah.

1307
01:09:19,232 --> 01:09:20,599
Uh, but if you’re looking for Peter,

1308
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:22,065
I’m afraid he’s not here.

1309
01:09:22,132 --> 01:09:23,499
He’s not?

1310
01:09:23,566 --> 01:09:25,532
Is something wrong?

1311
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:32,199
Don’t worry, kid. We’ll be back to get you.

1312
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:34,399
Yeah. We’ll deal with you then.

1313
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:35,866
Come on.

1314
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,632
[telephone rings]

1315
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:42,232
Robbins.

1316
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:44,265
Frank, it’s Sarah.

1317
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:47,399
I-I’m worried about Peter. I don’t know where he is.

1318
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,799
When was the last time you saw him?

1319
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:50,933
This morning.

1320
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,265
His friend Lisa came by

1321
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:54,399
and said something about an ice cream truck.

1322
01:09:54,466 --> 01:09:55,833
We’ll find him.

1323
01:10:05,032 --> 01:10:06,966
[grunting]

1324
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,632
Honey, I know I said I’d be there today,

1325
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:22,265
but my car still isn’t ready.

1326
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:26,099
[sighs] Okay. I’ll extend my visit by one more day.

1327
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,132
[sizzling]

1328
01:11:41,065 --> 01:11:43,000
[police radio chatter]

1329
01:11:54,466 --> 01:11:56,733
[grunting]

1330
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:17,432
Hey.

1331
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:22,265
Beverly, what are you--

1332
01:12:22,332 --> 01:12:23,899
Will you cut that out?

1333
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:25,232
We’ve got work to do.

1334
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:29,933
I’m telling you, Stan, this is the life.

1335
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:32,432
I want to be queen of a castle.

1336
01:12:32,499 --> 01:12:34,399
Yeah, well, you’re gonna end up being a court jester

1337
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:36,366
if we don’t finish up and get out of here.

1338
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:43,632
Well, if you or Josh see him, please call.

1339
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:45,099
Okay. Thanks, Cathy.

1340
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:55,532
Hi, Trudy. It’s me.

1341
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:58,866
Listen, uh, has Carl seen Peter around lately?

1342
01:13:00,599 --> 01:13:02,666
This is the stairway through right here.

1343
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:04,432
This means we’re going that way.

1344
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:05,799
Got it. Here.

1345
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:10,265
[door closes]

1346
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,032
All right, all right.

1347
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,933
Told you so.

1348
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,265
I know. I know.

1349
01:13:37,132 --> 01:13:38,532
What happened?

1350
01:13:38,599 --> 01:13:41,165
Never mind. Take this walkie-talkie.

1351
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:43,566
What’s going on?

1352
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:44,999
This is no time for chitchat.

1353
01:13:45,065 --> 01:13:46,532
Something big’s going down.

1354
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:49,099
Josh, you find Frank, and tell him to come to Mrs. Jacobs’.

1355
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,499
Carl, you go get Mr. Downey.

1356
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:52,499
You, before the whole world knows, I need you to--

1357
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:21,399
[whispers] Beverly.

1358
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:31,232
[both scream]

1359
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:43,866
Hey, Downey! Mr. Downey!

1360
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:46,699
[grunts] By the way, lady,

1361
01:15:46,766 --> 01:15:50,699
you’re not gonna be getting a visit from any Marvin Richards either.

1362
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:52,766
[muffled grunts]

1363
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,265
Beverly, do you happen to remember

1364
01:15:55,332 --> 01:15:58,032
which wire goes in the middle, the red one or the yellow one?

1365
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:00,265
Um, wires are wires. Jeez.

1366
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:02,032
Why do you have to be so messy?

1367
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,599
Why don’t you just ask her for the combination? Jeez.

1368
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:05,966
Good idea.

1369
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:08,766
Lady, tell me the combination,

1370
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:12,232
or the next rope you feel is gonna be around your neck.

1371
01:16:12,299 --> 01:16:13,399
[grunts]

1372
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:15,099
[Charlie] Frank, come in.

1373
01:16:17,299 --> 01:16:19,199
You got Frank. Come on.

1374
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:21,099
Josh Randall just ran in here,

1375
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,833
said Peter’s headed over to Edna Jacobs’ place.

1376
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:25,966
Peter?

1377
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:35,766
You have no idea what I had to promise my brother for this.

1378
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,399
I got the maple syrup.

1379
01:16:37,466 --> 01:16:40,566
They’re gonna be in the room up there I saw circled in the plans.

1380
01:16:40,632 --> 01:16:42,566
Why don’t you use that statue over there?

1381
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,466
Hey, Peter...

1382
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:47,766
Yeah?

1383
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:50,366
your mom told me about your dad,

1384
01:16:50,432 --> 01:16:52,833
how he was killed in a chase.

1385
01:16:54,032 --> 01:16:55,299
You must miss him a lot.

1386
01:16:55,366 --> 01:16:57,165
More than anything.

1387
01:16:57,232 --> 01:16:59,132
He was the greatest.

1388
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,699
I think you take after him.

1389
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:28,132
Oh.

1390
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:29,833
Oh, my God. Oh, look at that.

1391
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:31,099
Oh, Beverly, look at this.

1392
01:17:31,165 --> 01:17:32,299
We’ve hit the big time now.

1393
01:17:32,366 --> 01:17:33,966
-Stan. Stan. -What?

1394
01:17:34,032 --> 01:17:35,332
-[humming] -What’s that?

1395
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:36,566
What?

1396
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:37,632
This is the police.

1397
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:39,332
We got the place surrounded.

1398
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,699
[gasps] We’re trapped.

1399
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:53,466
You got five minutes, and we’re coming in.

1400
01:17:57,566 --> 01:18:01,332
Never was crazy about the Renaissance period.

1401
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:03,265
We’ve got the lady up here!

1402
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:05,699
One move out of you, and she buys the farm!

1403
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:11,099
They’ve got Mrs. Jacobs in there.

1404
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:19,299
Try it, and I’ll make Swiss cheese out of ya.

1405
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,199
Oh, yeah?! You’ll never take us alive!

1406
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,466
That’s it. I’m going in. Cover me.

1407
01:18:34,099 --> 01:18:35,165
Got it, partner.

1408
01:18:48,232 --> 01:18:50,099
Perfect.

1409
01:19:07,099 --> 01:19:09,699
-All right, we gotta think of something. -Yeah.

1410
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:11,966
[sighs] I’m thinking. I’m thinking.

1411
01:19:12,032 --> 01:19:13,366
We can’t go out the front door,

1412
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:14,833
but we gotta get to our truck.

1413
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:16,132
Yeah, but how? We’re surrounded.

1414
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:18,799
I’m thinking. I’m thinking.

1415
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:21,032
Yeah, yeah. You know, if you wasted so much time

1416
01:19:21,099 --> 01:19:22,666
with that silly wire on that stupid bomb,

1417
01:19:22,733 --> 01:19:24,165
we could have been out of here by now.

1418
01:19:24,232 --> 01:19:25,632
-[Stan] Oh, I wasted time? -Yeah.

1419
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:28,065
[Stan] What about you dressing yourself up like Cleopatra?!

1420
01:19:28,132 --> 01:19:29,666
Cleopatra? Yeah, I wish.

1421
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:31,265
Her man gave her a kingdom.

1422
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:33,366
My man wants to give me a trailer park.

1423
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:34,799
Well, if it weren’t for your man,

1424
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:37,265
-you wouldn’t even be here. -Exactly my point.

1425
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:38,699
-What about you-- -Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:19:38,766 --> 01:19:40,699
You know, if you wasted--

1427
01:19:40,766 --> 01:19:43,099
-Shh. Listen. -[fuse fizzing]

1428
01:19:43,165 --> 01:19:45,933
[typing]

1429
01:19:45,999 --> 01:19:47,866
[whispering] Is the east side secure?

1430
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:49,733
-Yes, sir. -Oh, no.

1431
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:54,265
So is the north side. Men, maintain positions.

1432
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:55,499
[stapler clatters]

1433
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:56,799

Oh, no. They’re inside. We gotta switch to plan B.

1435
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:00,866
What’s plan B?

1436
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:02,199
Don’t ask me. I didn’t know

1437
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:03,899
we were gonna need a plan B.

1438
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,265
[whispering] Everybody ready?

1439
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:08,699
[multiple voices] Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready.

1440
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:11,632
On the count of three, throw in the tear gas,

1441
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:13,466
and then we’ll get ’em.

1442
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:18,132
One, two, three.

1443
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:21,432
[muffled squealing]

1444
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:23,499
-Plan B. -Plan B.

1445
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:27,466
Gonna get through this. Watch out.

1446
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:29,265
Right with you, Stan.

1447
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:30,866

[can clatters]

1449
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:33,632
Don’t worry about the smoke, Mrs. Jacobs.

1450
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:34,999
It’ll be gone in a second.

1451
01:20:35,065 --> 01:20:37,165
It’s okay! Someone’s coming!

1452
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:40,399
Hurry, Stan.

1453
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,933
[gags]

1454
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,265
[yelling]

1455
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:51,165
But, Stan, I think we can get out.

1456
01:20:51,232 --> 01:20:52,432
Ohh!

1457
01:20:52,499 --> 01:20:55,466
Wh-What’d she spray us with, ant poison?

1458
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,132
Come on, Lisa. Let’s follow ’em.

1459
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:25,232
Forget the bikes. Hop in the car.

1460
01:21:29,265 --> 01:21:30,833
Do you know how to drive this thing?

1461
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,799
-No. Get down there. -Where?!

1462
01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:34,065
There, with your hand.

1463
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:36,065
When I say, "Gas," give it the gas.

1464
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:37,999
When I say, "Brake," hit it.

1465
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,699
[car engine starts]

1466
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:40,733
Gas!

1469
01:22:02,799 --> 01:22:05,899
Hello. Charlie.

1470
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:07,833
Frank thinks he’s at Mrs. Jacobs’ house?

1471
01:22:07,899 --> 01:22:09,466
What would he be doing there?

1472
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,733
[siren blaring]

1473
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:25,799
Can’t you go any faster?

1474
01:22:25,866 --> 01:22:27,399
This is an ice cream truck!

1475
01:22:27,466 --> 01:22:29,199
It ain’t designed for the Indianapolis 500!

1476
01:22:30,632 --> 01:22:33,532
Yeah, but they’re gaining on us, Stan!

1477
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,332
[Lisa grunting]

1478
01:22:47,532 --> 01:22:48,933
Hiyah!

1479
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:52,632
Said you like ice cream?

1480
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:55,299
Well, I’ll show you ice cream.

1481
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:01,566
Ah.

1482
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:08,099
Sherbet! Yes! Whoa.

1483
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:12,899
Hey! Those are Slide-Ups!

1484
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:17,933
That’s gonna stop us?

1485
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:26,499
I swear I’m never doing this again.

1486
01:23:26,566 --> 01:23:28,999
[grunting]

1487
01:23:29,065 --> 01:23:31,666
We’re getting creamed.

1488
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:33,566
Stan, they’re still coming!

1489
01:23:33,632 --> 01:23:35,833
Try the ice squeezers!

1490
01:23:35,899 --> 01:23:37,766
Yeah.

1491
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:40,733
[Beverly] Take that!

1492
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:49,032
There’s a cop on a bike, Stan.

1493
01:23:49,099 --> 01:23:50,699
Stan, quicker!

1494
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:53,833
So that’s what the kid meant by trouble.

1495
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:55,599
Stan, I’m running out of ice cream!

1496
01:23:58,532 --> 01:23:59,933
Ah...

1497
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:05,132
Ah! [screams]

1498
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,632
Brake!

1499
01:24:16,766 --> 01:24:18,332
Hey, kid...

1500
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:21,599
good going.

1501
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:23,666
You gotta get to Mrs. Jacobs’ house.

1502
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:24,933
She needs your help.

1503
01:24:26,632 --> 01:24:28,399
Come on, Lisa.

1504
01:24:29,799 --> 01:24:31,699
[sputters]

1505
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:32,699

1506
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:34,399
You all right, baby?

1507
01:24:34,466 --> 01:24:36,799
[crying] No.

1508

-Ohh. -[crying]

-[bicycle clicking] -Oh.

1511
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:03,899
20 years of a clean life of crime,

1512
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:05,399
only to be foiled by a kid!

1513
01:25:05,466 --> 01:25:08,132
I don’t wanna go to jail. I look terrible in stripes.

1514
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:09,632
Honey, you look good in anything.

1515
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:11,366
Book ’em, Frank-o.

1516
01:25:13,866 --> 01:25:15,666
[muffled yelling]

1517
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:18,099
Mamacita, I’m here to save you.

1518
01:25:18,165 --> 01:25:20,099
Oh, Arnold.

1519
01:25:20,165 --> 01:25:22,632
[sighs] Arnold.

1520
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:25,399
[gasps] I’m so glad you’re here.

1521
01:25:25,466 --> 01:25:27,332
Yeah, it’s a jungle out there, baby.

1522
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:28,866
[sighs] All right.

1523
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:32,833
Oh.

1524
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:36,499
You know, Mrs. Jacobs, I’ve always wanted to tell you something,

1525
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:38,299
but-- Oh, I’ll just tell you in the truck.

1526
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,599
Good job, partner.

1527
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:43,766
I love you, my sweet potato.

1528
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,466
I love you, my little tangerine.

1529
01:25:47,933 --> 01:25:50,199
[kids laughing]

1530
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:53,366
[applause]

1531
01:25:58,432 --> 01:26:00,666
Congratulations.

1532
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:05,733
And now, to the citizen of Leesbrook

1533
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:09,833
who’s demonstrated leadership, bravery

1534
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:12,599
in the name of our good town.

1535
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:15,733
The newly dedicated Paul Hansen award

1536
01:26:15,799 --> 01:26:19,232
goes to Peter Hansen.

1538
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:21,933
Yay!

1539
01:26:23,132 --> 01:26:24,799
Yay!

1540
01:26:26,132 --> 01:26:27,499
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1541
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:28,933
Show me. Show me.

1542
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:33,733
So, Peter, you know, I am so proud of you,

1543
01:26:33,799 --> 01:26:36,332
and your father would be, too. Can I see that?

1544
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:37,866
You did great, kiddo.

1545
01:26:37,933 --> 01:26:40,666
I can’t believe you cracked the case for a measly 40 bucks.

1546
01:26:40,733 --> 01:26:42,299
I could learn a few things off you.

1547
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:43,666
Thanks, Frank.

1548
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:46,699
Now, listen, Peter. I got a proposal.

1549
01:26:46,766 --> 01:26:49,265
You know we can’t hire any more manpower back at the station,

1550
01:26:49,332 --> 01:26:51,032
but would you consider...

1551
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:53,699
heading up the Leesbrook Junior Detectives?

1552
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:55,099
Mom?

1553
01:26:55,165 --> 01:26:56,265
Congratulations, Peter.

1554
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:58,065
-Thanks, Frank. -You bet.

1555
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:01,165
Of course, I can hire whoever I want for my squad.

1556
01:27:01,232 --> 01:27:02,165
Of course.

1557
01:27:02,232 --> 01:27:03,632
I expect all the perks that come

1558
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:05,699
with the position of senior officer.

1559
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:09,432
Uh, Peter, Mrs. Jacobs has a surprise for you.

1560
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:10,766
Here you are, Peter.

1561
01:27:12,366 --> 01:27:13,933
You deserve them for your heroics.

1562
01:27:13,999 --> 01:27:15,566
I know you’ll put them to good use.

1563
01:27:15,632 --> 01:27:17,599
Hey, don’t spend that all in one place, kid, huh?

1564
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,866
[laughs]

1565
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,666
These are for you, Charlie.

1566
01:27:20,733 --> 01:27:22,165
Whoa. That’s a--

1567
01:27:22,232 --> 01:27:23,899
That’s a lot of shekels, kiddo.

1568
01:27:23,966 --> 01:27:25,999
I want them to go to the police department

1569
01:27:26,065 --> 01:27:27,966
for a new car and to save your job.

1570
01:27:28,032 --> 01:27:30,399
Oh, Peter, that is such a wonderful gesture.

1571
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:31,799
You did good, kiddo.

1572
01:27:31,866 --> 01:27:33,632
You sure did do good.

1573
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:35,399
Dad, when you come back,

1574
01:27:35,466 --> 01:27:37,199
would you like to walk the street beat again?

1575
01:27:37,265 --> 01:27:38,332
Yeah.

1576
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:41,532
Well, I’m going to go check on the food.

1577
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:42,833
Come on, Arnold.

1578
01:27:46,466 --> 01:27:47,733
You made him very happy.

1579
01:27:47,799 --> 01:27:49,532
Oh, well, he’s becoming quite a man.

1580
01:27:49,599 --> 01:27:52,566
Well, you know, he’s his father’s son also.

1581
01:27:52,632 --> 01:27:55,132
Yeah. I guess I’m beginning to learn that.

1582
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,165
See you later.

1583
01:27:57,232 --> 01:27:59,199
Never seen so many people so happy

1584
01:27:59,265 --> 01:28:01,399
since my brother passed the tenth grade.

1585
01:28:01,466 --> 01:28:03,165
It’s all because of you.

1586
01:28:03,232 --> 01:28:07,366
You really made it right, Peter.

1587
01:28:08,532 --> 01:28:09,466
Thanks.

1588
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:11,299
Hey, Peter, Lisa,

1589
01:28:11,366 --> 01:28:12,866
we’re starting up a game of baseball.

1590
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:14,000
Do you guys wanna join?

1591
01:28:14,065 --> 01:28:15,199
Sure.

1592
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:16,666
You got it.

1593
01:28:16,733 --> 01:28:17,666
I’ll meet you guys there.

1594
01:28:17,733 --> 01:28:19,065
I have to get my glove first.

1595
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:21,132
Hey, see you guys later. Come on, Lisa.

1596
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,699
Bye, sweetie. [laughs]

1597
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:26,299
Thank you, Frank.

1598
01:28:28,232 --> 01:28:31,733
Would you like to go out for a coffee?

1599
01:28:31,799 --> 01:28:33,299
Thought you’d never ask. Come on.

1600

Yep, things are back to normal in old Leesbrook.
