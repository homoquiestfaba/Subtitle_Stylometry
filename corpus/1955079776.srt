00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:31,251
-This is the Eyecast contact camera.

3
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,971
The discreet HD camera
that you wear on your eye.

4
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:35,822
This is where it goes.

5
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,947
This is how it works.

6
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:42,229
And this is what it sees.

7
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,957
Because this is what <i>you</i> see

8
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,489
as <i>you</i> see it.

9
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,137
This is <i>your</i> life. Live.

10
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,689
Because you're only live once.

11
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,121
-Any suggestion for
today's soundtrack?

12
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,868
-Who are these guys?
-Not a clue.

13
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,310
-Talk to the viewers. See if anyone
knows who these pricks are.

14
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,982
-Anyone out there know
these guys?

15
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,708
Please message us.
Turn on your Bluetooth.

16
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,037
- Got it.

17
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:17,162
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
One at a time!

18
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,829
-Do you guys know you're
driving with a gas hose?

19
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,032
-Yes, we are aware.
Who is this?

20
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,704
-This is Albert from
Sin City. Long-time follower. Hey Tara.

21
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,673
-Hey Albert. How did you
know we were driving that gas hose?

22
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:36,673
-One of those guys chasing you-
I'm watching his channel right now.

23
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:39,631
-Good work, Albert. What's
his channel number?

24
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,152
-473-999

25
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,682
-Got it! Wyatt, look!

26
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,364
Wyatt, look out! He's
 coming right at us!

27
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,497
-Keep down, hold up the phone!

28
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,552
<i>-They're full fitting and extra absorbent.</i>

29
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,576
<i>Don't let wetness slow you down.</i>

30
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
-This kid's got a sponsor!
-What?!

31
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,019
- ♪Absorbeez ♪
-Shit!

32
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:28,508
They're gaining over us!
-Hang on!

33
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,394
- Come on, we'll figure it out.

34
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,212
-Sargent Maddox!

35
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,723
Phone call from you.
From the states.

36
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,240
-It's late there.

37
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,537
Is it an emergency?

38
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,734
-I'm not sure, Sargent.

39
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,078
-Thank you, Private.

40
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,152
-Sargent Maddox, you've got a call.

41
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:10,647
Thank you, sir.

42
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:12,022
-Carry out.

43
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:19,052
-Hello, this is Sargent Maddox.

44
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,650
-Look, Jonah,

45
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,674
I'm really sorry about Wyatt, man.

46
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,368
-The rate he was going, it
was just a matter of time, right?

47
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,580
-A matter of time for all of us.

48
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,751
-Could you open that glove-box
for me, will you?

49
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,915
Flip that switch right there.
Watch this.

50
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,230
- Nice. Where'd you find this?

51
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,512
-I made that work. Super
illegal today, I'm telling you.

52
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:57,347
but we're in a hurry,
so...uh, fuck it!

53
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,093
-What?

54
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,648
What's that goofy grin about?
-Nothing, man...

55
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,093
Now, I know y'all
didn't get along, but

56
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,116
when we were kids, man,
your brother Wyatt.

57
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,351
Back then,  he was cool.

58
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,393
-I don't know...
all knew Wyatt was cool.

59
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,857
A lot of good it did him.

60
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:25,723
What did you hear about
the night Wyatt died?

61
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,755
-What? No one told you?

62
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:31,872
-They told me.

63
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,109
"Your brother succumbed
to blunt force

64
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,426
injuries sustained by a
hit and run accident."

65
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:39,264
And that he had drugs in his system.

66
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,020
-He had drugs in his system,
of course they told you <i>that</i>.

67
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,762
Basically being for
the cops didn't do nothing.

68
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,942
it was like he deserved to die.

69
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,583
Case closed.

70
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,444
-Feels weird to be home.

71
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,854
You've gotta be kidding me.

72
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,557
-No, this can't be right.

73
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,080
The people...they must
be here for a different service.

74
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,674
-No, there's my sister.

75
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:24,045
Thanks for the ride, Gabe.
-I'm gonna hoof it from here.

76
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:25,381
-Ok, you sure?

77
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:26,717
-Yeah.

78
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,296
-Hey...

79
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:15,694
Look at you.

80
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,522
You look good.

81
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,885
<inteligible>

82
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,768
-No, no don't be.

83
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,229
-Hey dad.

84
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:27,362
-Son.

85
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,214
is it...uh...

86
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,401
much to ask for you

87
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,426
to be back in time for
your father's burial?

88
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:36,594
- I don't know, dad.

89
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,969
Was it too much to ask for
you to wait for me to get

90
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,441
back from halfway
around the world?

91
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:42,985
-You're here now.

92
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,414
I already put some
linens in the...

93
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:49,585
exercise room for you.

94
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,081
-I can't believe him.

95
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,680
-He just doesn't know
who to be mad at.

96
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,190
-So he's moving me
to an exercise room?

97
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:58,454
-I'll show you.

98
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,335
Hey...uh...

99
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,905
Don't worry about...
about missing the funeral.

100
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,022
Wyatt wouldn’t have wanted you there.

101
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:14,053
Seeing him wear a suit.

102
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:15,757
Dude...

103
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,300
As a matter of fact he
probably made you late.

104
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,179
-Yeah he's having a
good laugh somewhere.

105
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:23,920
You know...they called me.

106
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,107
Over there?

107
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,124
um-hum.

108
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,334
Must have been Thursday?

109
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,565
-Sounds like he chose
 to speak to his brother last.

110
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:42,097
Ok, Well, Um...do you need anything?
-No, I'm good. let me get settled and...

111
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,217
I'll talk to you later, Ok?

112
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,604
<inteligible>

113
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,833
Honestly, I just...

114
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,068
just really need to
get out of this house.

115
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,302
You know? When...
when someone in your family dies...

116
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,911
There's all this stuff
that you have to deal with.

117
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,443
And no one warns you about.

118
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,044
Example:

119
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,421
Who's gonna cancel my brother's cable?

120
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:12,731
Do we just let the bill
go unpaid, or...

121
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,325
I mean, no one is exactly
worried about his credit score anymore.

122
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:23,591
-Hey Ash, do you
mind if I check my email?

123
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:24,904
Ash!

124
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,464
- I used to know my family,
but let me just say it's

125
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,104
not like anyone is going to
take care of this stuff.

126
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:51,229
My other brother...he's very responsible.

127
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:55,091
But he's also been gone since
I was like thirteen.

128
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,699
So...

129
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:59,604
I get to deal with the life of things like

130
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
this.

131
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,604
This came from the county
coroner today.

132
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,911
I think it has my brother's stuff in it.

133
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,341
The stuff he had on when he died.

134
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,130
I'm kind of terrified.

135
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:15,353
And grossed out

136
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:17,223
about opening it, but...

137
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:19,401
I'd rather do it then
let my dad do it.

138
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Yeah.

139
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,302
Somehow you guys make
me feel a little more brave.

140
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,032
So, what do you guys think?

141
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,628
Should I open it?

142
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:35,162
-You need help with this
stuff? You just need to ask.

143
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:37,427
And this...is not for them.

144
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,169
-You know what, Jay?
I'm the one who handles all the

145
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,973
stuff where you’re God knows where.
So don't get righteous with me.

146
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:45,083
I mean, you've been home
what? An hour?

147
00:12:55,065 --> 00:13:00,971
-<i>And Wyatt Maddox, the bionic bird brain
has fallen for the fourth time.</i>

148
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,990
-<i>Wyatt!</i>

149
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,521
<i>Wyatt!</i>

150
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,110
<i>Get the Goddamned
bike out of the street!</i>

151
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,293
<i>Are those my sunglasses?</i>

152
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,115
<i>Come here!</i>

153
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,376
-<i>You OK, Wyatt?</i>

154
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,304
<i>Wyatt?</i>

155
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,491
-<i>Fine!</i>

156
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,336
You're such a geek.

157
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,359
-No...I'm good, thanks.

158
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:39,963
Hello?

159
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,667
-<i>Who the hell is
 this on Wyld's channel?</i>

160
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,883
-Who the hell is this?

161
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:46,665
-<i>Log off. Log of right
now or I'll hang up!</i>

162
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:53,547
-Ok.

163
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:54,976
It's done.

164
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,953
-Whoever you are, I
hope you get a wicked case of pink eye.

165
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,507
-Yeah. Thanks for that.

166
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,445
Look, this is Jonah Maddox.

167
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,005
I'm Wyatt's brother.

168
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,593
-<i>Right. Or maybe you're
the guy who murdered him.</i>

169
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:07,898
-Murdered?

170
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,535
Look, why don't uh...

171
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,278
Why don't you and I meet up

172
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:16,364
and talk?
-Why don't you get cancer?

173
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,156
-Cute.

174
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,249
-This is happening right now.

175
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,311
This is live TV.

176
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:45,397
The number on the corner
of the screen...

177
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,421
that's gidgets rating.

178
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,428
Oh! Homegirl wiped out!

179
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,327
Well, she could have injured herself

180
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,210
and then rescued by a
handsome lifeguard.

181
00:19:57,234 --> 00:20:00,936
Now, imagine your advertisement
at the bottom of the screen.

182
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,491
Imagine an audience
without the ability

183
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:06,236
to fast-forward, skip,
or delete that ad.

184
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,377
Let's see a demo.

185
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,964
Are we beginning to
grasp the potential here?

186
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:22,159
-Garrett, these numbers

187
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,128
They're fine...

188
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:25,895
but they don't compare
with the network's

189
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,371
post on a moderately
popular draw.

190
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:28,914
-Leonard, is it?

191
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,948
Don't compare Eyecast
with scripted.

192
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,073
Wrong model.

193
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,979
The small percentage of viewers
who actually stay awake to watch that crap,

194
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:38,003
they fast-forward your clients' commercials

195
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:40,776
and that negate to no one.
You want to talk numbers?

196
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
-Of course, we want to talk numbers.

197
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:45,144
-Ok, let's talk about 9/11.

198
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,603
The Oklahoma city bombing.

199
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,212
OJ trial,

200
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:51,237
both gulf wars, well the first one,

201
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:52,932
<i>those</i> got numbers.

202
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,292
And that audience held.

203
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:56,455
for days.

204
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,205
No one TiVoed 911.

205
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:04,080
<i>That's</i> the analogy you
need to look at when talking about casting.

206
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:06,651
No reruns. No DVR. No do overs.

207
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,532
You're only live once.

208
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,893
Surprise. Immediacy.

209
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,917
Chaos. That's what the audience wants.

210
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:14,214
What?

211
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,143
-You got to get this, Garrett.
-Who is it?

212
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,924
-He just gave me his channel number. 79.
-Sorry.

213
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,577
I'm going to have to take this.
We're...about done here, right?

214
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:41,888
-I'm gonna watch some of these channels.
See how I can package this.

215
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
Well...

216
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,918
I'm going to have you
come to your all a moment...

217
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:47,935
I'll be here...just don't wait too long.

218
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,450
Wyld, in the flesh,

219
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:56,685
good to meet you.
Want some sushi?

220
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,311
-No, I'm a Vegan.

221
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,544
-Ha! Bullshit. I've seen your channel.

222
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:02,708
I shouldn't say this too loud..
but you've got a

223
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,513
...few fans in this company.

224
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,097
-Why should you be quiet about that?

225
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:11,989
-I mean, your channel's not exactly
what we put in our promotional materials.

226
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:14,013
-No, I suppose it's not.

227
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:17,383
-Is that why you're
here, promotion?

228
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,994
-You're a fan, right?

229
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,403
You watched what
happened the other night?

230
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,155
-You've been...uh...

231
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,328
...switched off

232
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,437
for a little while,
is that right?

233
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:37,909
I mean forgive me,
I...I don't pay too close attention.

234
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,308
-I've been gone for a week.

235
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:41,378
-Any trouble?

236
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,104
You got...you and
Tera got in a fight?

237
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:44,574
That Tara...

238
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,340
Life doesn't offer too
many costars like that.

239
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,490
You were...you were
caught with another girl, right?

240
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:53,632
or is that me? Wyld stop...

241
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,835
-No, that's not what happened.

242
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:58,499
Think about <i>that</i>. Now,
you should be scripting this.

243
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:00,523
That's exactly what I'm
 talking about, you know?

244
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,116
No half measures.

245
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:04,257
Whatever your tag is, live it.

246
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,858
-You don't think what
I'm doing is enough?

247
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,522
Oh, I mean, you know...

248
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:11,963
Your numbers are descent.

249
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,392
But Wyld...

250
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,854
You're just a vessel.

251
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,884
You got thousands of people
seeing through your eyes.

252
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,491
You got to get more.

253
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,556
You want top-shelf sponsors?

254
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Then you got to give them <i>everything</i>.

255
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,097
-Everything?

256
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,535
-Everything.

257
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,546
I gotta mosey.

258
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,233
You want the tour?
-No, thank you.

259
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:39,452
-You got a great count,
 even for a vegan's.

260
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:41,476
-Nice meeting you, Garrett.

261
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:32,949
-A nightmare?

262
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:37,231
No, uh...

263
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,021
No, that...that was memory.

264
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,693
-This can be worse.

265
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,625
-Ash...

266
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:52,562
Did we...uh...

267
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:56,043
-No.

268
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:58,817
-No?
-Uh uh .

269
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,207
-What...what were
you waiting for?

270
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,449
-You were kind of passed out.

271
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,948
-Alcohol plus opiate-based pain killers...

272
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,394
-Oh, no, no, see...
I slipped you a roofie.

273
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:12,464
Just didn't work out
quite as I expected...

274
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,488
-Oh, maybe you should
use a smaller dose.

275
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,316
-Yeah, I'll try that.

276
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:28,389
-Seriously, though...

277
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:33,637
-I like you.

278
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,052
-But...

279
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:39,339
-No, that is the reason,
 believe it or not.

280
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,526
-So where's the fire?

281
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:55,507
-Um...Madison and me...
we...we got that new sponsor, and now

282
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:58,832
there's all these...obligations...
-I'm off.

283
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:01,871
Come on, stay right here.

284
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,079
I'll uh...

285
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,552
...make an omelet.

286
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:08,771
with the one egg
that I have in the fridge.

287
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:14,389
-<i>He promised to sponsor. Go.</i>

288
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:18,491
-I'm so over sponsors.

289
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:21,648
-Why, are they pressuring you?

290
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:24,671
-Yeah, and they're like,
'No, Conner, you take your time...'

291
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,694
'...concentrate on feeling better...'

292
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,563
and then they're like 'Hey,
guess who made nationals.'

293
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:34,306
-Oh, we don't have to do
anything we don't want to, right?

294
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,391
-I guess not.

295
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:39,001
Come on, we gotta do something.

296
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:04,065
-Seriously?

297
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,671
-I knew you weren't armed.

298
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:38,695
You turn off Wyatt's channel?

299
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,523
-It's off, yeah.

300
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:46,130
-You look...uh...
different in person.

301
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,146
-Most people do.

302
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:52,946
-How'd you get in here?

303
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:55,447
-Your brother's house keys.

304
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,467
-Shouldn't have asked that.

305
00:28:58,092 --> 00:28:59,404
-You <i>should</i> have.

306
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,316
-What are you looking for?

307
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:19,611
-Something that's not here anymore.

308
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:26,542
Let's get out of here.

309
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,425
I'll buy you a waffle.

310
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,705
-So, you and my
brother were stealing cars?

311
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:46,447
-<i>Racing</i> cars.
-Yeah, stolen cars.

312
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,806
-Look, race your own car,
it's fifty viewers.

313
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,619
Race a stolen car,

314
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:53,698
it's like 50, 000.

315
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,307
-So how do you
pick these cars?

316
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,783
-We got tipped.

317
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:03,379
-There are cars all over this
town just begging to be raced.

318
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,918
I'm talking about race cars.

319
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,762
Barely street legal.

320
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,965
Relegated to grocery getters.

321
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:14,332
Rolled out for once a
month for a clay wax.

322
00:30:15,574 --> 00:30:17,193
And all it takes is

323
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,605
one pissed-off teenager

324
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,078
one disgruntled valet,

325
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:29,228
or a little help from the
 infamous mission creep.

326
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:39,068
-So basically, we're running
a request line for felons.

327
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,709
-Yes.

328
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:44,498
-And what do they get
 in return? These tipsters?

329
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:47,515
-They get to watch.

330
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,960
it's about taking risks.

331
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,475
The faster the car,
the closer the race,

332
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,499
the higher the danger

333
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,116
the better the ratings.

334
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:49,627
On a good day everyone wins.

335
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:51,652
Sponsor's happy, viewer's happy.

336
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,028
-Wyatt and Tara are happy.

337
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,015
-Oh, I don't think your brother
was going to make it as a day trader.

338
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,192
And yeah. We had fun.

339
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:01,278
-Fun...

340
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,626
What about the day my
brother died? Was that fun?

341
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:07,779
-What do <i>you</i> think?

342
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:13,231
Wyatt always likes to leave the
car with a full tank.

343
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:14,486
Like a rental.

344
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:18,423
You know. Gas it up and
leave the keys in a night drop.

345
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,900
And that's how the car doesn't
get boosted again.

346
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:24,447
His little way of saying
thank you, I think.

347
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,924
That's when the three
horsemen showed up.

348
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:48,373
-Get down! get down!

349
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,590
-They're gaining on us!

350
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,779
-That's it? No shouting, no
threats, just bullets?

351
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,537
-Just bullets and buckshot.

352
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,763
I mean, these guys
wanted us to die in a hurry.

353
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,419
-And you'd never seen them before?

354
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,638
-Never.

355
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,677
Once we got some distance,
Wyatt dropped me off.

356
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:10,092
-Hop out.

357
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,224
Go inside.

358
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,428
-What are you gonna do with this thing?

359
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,139
-I haven't quite decided yet.

360
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:18,561
What I might do I don't want
you anywhere near it, so

361
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,822
please just get out and go inside.

362
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,049
-Ok, text me when
you are clear of this.

363
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Fuck.

364
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,077
-Did my brother keep broadcasting?

365
00:34:57,781 --> 00:34:59,233
And did you watch?

366
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:03,265
What did you see?

367
00:35:09,283 --> 00:35:10,283
-Not much.

368
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:11,744
Not enough.

369
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,246
- He called me, you know?

370
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,343
That night.

371
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,430
-What did he say?

372
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:29,226
-He said to say hi.

373
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,517
What would happen if
I relaunch Wyatt's channel?

374
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,663
-Uh...it would suck.

375
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:48,414
-Tara.

376
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,960
If these people think
that Wyld is still alive,

377
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:53,669
he might just come out of hiding.

378
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,693
Hit men don't like unfinished business.

379
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,649
-Look, if your serious about this,

380
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,297
then I'm on board.

381
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,349
-Thank you but no.

382
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,592
This is between me and my-
-Just stop right there.

383
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,242
Wyatt was your brother,
 but he was my partner.

384
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:16,462
There is no Wyld Life without me.

385
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:22,275
-You know, Wyatt and I did
have one thing in common.

386
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:25,033
-What's that?

387
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,392
-I can drive.

388
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,178
-Oh, dude, dude, dude, look.
We're ready, we're ready.

389
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:45,373
-Should I bring it?
-yeah, yeah...come on.

390
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:46,937
Come on, come on.

391
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,328
Hood up, hood up.

392
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,555
Here we go.

393
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:55,868
Here we go.

394
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:58,385
See that countdown?

395
00:36:58,409 --> 00:36:59,750
You got to get this, come on.

396
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:01,321
There it is, there it is.

397
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:03,355
Are...you ready for this?

398
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:05,547
Yeah, baby...

399
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:07,969
Come on, come on.

400
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:09,743
on three...

401
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:10,985
...two...

402
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:13,923
Let it go.

403
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,297
Let it simmer, guys.

404
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,068
Man on fire!

405
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:22,647
Do it!

406
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,671
Yeah! Yeah!

407
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:30,089
You took these with a red light camera?

408
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,810
-That's right.

409
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,410
-Well...

410
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,012
How did DMV know
where to send the picture?

411
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,544
I mean, Dino here doesn't
 seem to have a license plate.

412
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:39,568
-They didn't come from the DMV.

413
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:42,448
-We hack the intersection cameras.

414
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,745
That's the only way
 to get the raw files.

415
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,347
-Far out!

416
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,086
-I don't know...

417
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:49,793
it seems risky.

418
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:52,942
-That's the work!

419
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:57,105
That risk, that's a part
 of the art, man.

420
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:59,933
I mean, without it,
those would be worthless.

421
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,660
-You got any sponsors?
-Hell, no.

422
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:04,595
I'm not a sellout.

423
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:06,341
That's the thing about street art.

424
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:08,152
The second you’re bought,
you're sold.

425
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:09,902
It's done. over.

426
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:14,961
- Is that Wyatt's channel?

427
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:16,497
-Yeah.

428
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:18,521
-Can I take a look at it?
-that's why I brought it.

429
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,800
-There's a lot of stuff in here.

430
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,096
-That records the last
 thing he looked at?

431
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,479
-No.

432
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,822
 These aren't VCRs, grandpa.

433
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,684
They're transmitters.

434
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,596
ready.

435
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,151
For what?

436
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:56,010
-For what we call a rolling buffer.

437
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,917
A contact camera
constantly records them.

438
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:00,941
And erase and record over
and over again.

439
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,535
-What's the point if
it doesn't store anything?

440
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,914
-The software uses the buffer
to add it out to your blinks.

441
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:07,609
And drop signals.

442
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,516
Otherwise, you know, these channels,
they would be super annoying to watch.

443
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,492
You know, constantly taking
hits and dropping signals and whatnot.

444
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:15,938
Usually it's just a
bunch of code but...

445
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:19,516
sometimes you can find some
orphaned frames of video and...

446
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,447
A few seconds of

447
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:24,472
a recent cast.

448
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,960
You're going to get a lot of...

449
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:34,180
<i>-You see people? This is live
and we have a channel.</i>

450
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,666
-Hey, I didn't know
that Wyatt was...

451
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:40,064
-No, no, yeah.
-Clearly.

452
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:42,137
Accidental. -Yeah,
that didn't look

453
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,526
like it was on purpose.

454
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:49,369
-Gabe, could you...

455
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:50,634
-Alright.

456
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,191
-<i>Everybody stay calm.</i>

457
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:58,609
-<i>Everybody make space.</i>

458
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:00,767
<i>-Yes, got it.</i>

459
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:04,804
<i>-Yes, let's have everybody on the
 line while we're trying to do this.</i>

460
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,572
-Your brother.

461
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:09,845
Wyld's channel used
to be so edgy, dude.

462
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,423
Very subversive.

463
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,134
You guys should have
never taken those sponsors.

464
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,937
-Hey, we're entitled
to make a living.

465
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:18,508
-Yeah, granted, but you
can't deny it changes things.

466
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,860
Now he won't even open up
 my channel to comment.

467
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,290
I'm gonna do my thing,
people like it, great.

468
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:25,314
if not, say they'll fuck it.

469
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,888
-That's the car.

470
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:28,678
-What is?

471
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:31,597
-Is that the airbag?

472
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,272
-Gabe...

473
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:35,716
-Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

474
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,232
-No, hold on. Is that Wyatt's phone?

475
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,030
-Yes.

476
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,155
-That's not his point
of view on the screen.

477
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:44,957
-He's right, Gabe.

478
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:46,397
-Hold on.

479
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:48,757
Check it.

480
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,971
Looks like he's getting
something out of the trunk.

481
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:53,968
-What's that?

482
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:56,593
-Let me see.

483
00:40:58,718 --> 00:41:00,387
It's a QR code.

484
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,168
And that can be
linked to anything.

485
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,324
Web address, price tag...

486
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,035
any information, really...

487
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,333
You're in.

488
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:12,574
-Really? You're gonna
let that stop you?

489
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:15,739
-OK...tell you what...

490
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,590
I'm going to see if I can
ninja my way into this website.

491
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:21,029
And I will get in touch
with y'all if I find something.

492
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:24,029
when I find something.

493
00:41:25,124 --> 00:41:26,920
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

494
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:28,882
-Wyatt's death

495
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:30,461
wasn't an accident.

496
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:33,976
-More jack.

497
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:37,147
I mean, your brother, man...

498
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:38,756
God bless him, he was pushy.

499
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:41,108
You said it yourself man.
-I know what I said, man.

500
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,279
They were fuckin' chased.

501
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:44,546
Shot at.

502
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:46,819
-Rob a car?

503
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,757
Alright.

504
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,085
Hey, jay,

505
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:55,741
I'm gonna find something.

506
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,531
-I know.
-Alright?

507
00:42:21,837 --> 00:42:23,720
-<i>Check 1...2</i>

508
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,040
<i>1...2...</i>

509
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:32,196
<i>Check, check, 1,2 ... 1,2...</i>

510
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:50,345
-Cyrus, this is Slag...

511
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,501
He's been fixing bets.

512
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:55,877
He's been scripting outcomes.

513
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,172
<inleligible>

514
00:42:57,797 --> 00:43:00,938
-Badge found him camping
out in public storage locker unit.

515
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:03,922
Boards, the works.

516
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,171
-You'd like to untie
him, wouldn't you?

517
00:43:09,726 --> 00:43:10,726
-Kind of.

518
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,647
I like a stand up fight

519
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,449
-I know you do.

520
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:17,238
-Why don't we get some blows?

521
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,496
You know, fight back?

522
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:22,285
-Yeah, that's because you get
all co-dependent with him.

523
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:24,106
Not me.

524
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,918
I just want to get him done with.

525
00:43:27,097 --> 00:43:29,963
I couldn't stand watching
him  cycle through the stages of grief.

526
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:31,394
Like denial...

527
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:33,699
"I didn't do it, it wasn't me."

528
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:34,910
"I'm not the guy."

529
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:37,730
"but actually I am."
-And then the anger stage.

530
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:40,822
if they got some fight
in them it's the time to do it.

531
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:44,088
because then comes the bargaining

532
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,526
-Makes my skin crawl.

533
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:49,432
It's like...just...

534
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,760
-just shut up!

535
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:54,784
-It's the pressure. Now that one I get.

536
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:58,253
I really do. I just wish
they'd skip from anger to acceptance.

537
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:00,278
there's so much more grace.

538
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,052
-Listen...you can't be like this one.

539
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,417
I had this one time, this woman, right?
had one of those blades. -Yeah.

540
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:10,676
You know one of the mini Katanas
they use to cut sushi?

541
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,153
So I had this blade
deep in this lady, right?

542
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:15,235
And you know what she does?

543
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:16,318
She hugs me.

544
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:17,997
Hugs me.

545
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:20,348
And then she takes her hand

546
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:22,622
and she gets it through
my hand. Crazy, right?

547
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:25,199
-Wish I could get emotional
about that stuff.

548
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:28,457
Jewish give lots of sentences
for crimes of passion.

549
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
There's a guy down in
Texas doing four months.

550
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,044
Four shooting up his old lady.
-Four months!

551
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:35,892
It's like a fucking sabbatical.

552
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,594
Pay...your...debts.

553
00:44:53,564 --> 00:44:56,030
-Have the Badge dump
him somewhere.

554
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,630
-Shut the fuck up!!

555
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,790
-Do you always eat so healthy?

556
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,847
-Oh, I'm sorry, Major
Dick, I guess you prefer

557
00:45:17,872 --> 00:45:19,861
eating freeze dried ice
cream out of a helmet.

558
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:23,406
-MREs are better than you imagine.
-they <i>have</i> to be.

559
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,992
Look, I can't be instructing
you while we're casting.

560
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,016
That will be a dead giveaway
that you're not Wylde.

561
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:29,863
So, a couple of pointers.

562
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:32,930
Don't blink too much and
try not to hum to yourself.

563
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:36,094
Think like you're telling
 someone a story.

564
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:38,289
Because you are, you just
don't know how it ends yet.

565
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:41,172
And if things go south, just bail,
and I'll catch up with you later.

566
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,384
Oh, and avoid mirrors.

567
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:46,144
Ready?

568
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:55,721
Start casting.

569
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,930
Good morning, followers.

570
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,553
And normally Wylde and I
don't indulge in a lot of

571
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:09,124
talking and naval
gazing and such, but

572
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:11,804
seeing that it's been
forever since our last cast

573
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,702
I think we owe you an explanation.

574
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,260
Now, if you've been
 in the chat room then

575
00:46:17,285 --> 00:46:18,983
I'm sure you've seen the rumors

576
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:21,007
about Wylde being hurt or

577
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,858
us being killed.

578
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:26,288
<i>And while I do
appreciate your concern,</i>

579
00:46:26,313 --> 00:46:30,812
<i>I have to ask : Whose channel do
you think you're watching?</i>

580
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:36,050
<i>Those lightweights who chased us?
Well, you won't be seeing them for a while.</i>

581
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:38,488
Well, unless they recognize you.

582
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:41,363
Yeah, so Wylde and I
had to cool up for a bit,

583
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:43,144
you know, regroup, hit the spa...

584
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:50,317
That, my friend, is today's donor car.

585
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:52,724
I'm gonna go meet our mark.

586
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,335
-So that one's yours?

587
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,604
-See, that brown one.
That's my car.

588
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:39,628
It's very nice. Do you
 want to go for a ride?

589
00:47:51,457 --> 00:47:52,457
-Ok.

590
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:21,721
-Vehicle looks good.

591
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,102
Where are my keys?

592
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,550
This one.

593
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:28,979
-This isn't your car.

594
00:48:29,003 --> 00:48:31,792
-This is my car. I
don't understand what the problem is.

595
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:42,980
I really don't have time to argue.

596
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:19,505
- I thought I told you
to bail if things wiped out.

597
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:22,341
Let the keys is in the car. We'll
just figure out something else to do today.

598
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:25,747
-No, no, no way. If the
idea here is to get attention,

599
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:27,771
this is the perfect opportunity.

600
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,880
Now, if you want to get out, I understand.

601
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,810
Get up.

602
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,794
Wow, that was fast.

603
00:49:40,818 --> 00:49:42,818
-Oh, crap.

604
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,346
OK, I hear nothing makes
them madder than when people run, right?

605
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,080
I mean, when people run, cops make them
go on the ground and stay on their face

606
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:23,431
-No one's gonna stand
on your face.

607
00:50:35,523 --> 00:50:36,856
What...what is this?

608
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,881
-Oh crap. I hate when this happens.

609
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,905
They sending updates
every ten freaking minutes.

610
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:44,803
-Are we still on?
-No, not right now.

611
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,827
-So no one's seeing this?
-Hold on!

612
00:50:50,385 --> 00:50:51,956
I have to read this to you,
all right?

613
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,980
But you have to
look at me. Try not to crash.

614
00:50:57,995 --> 00:50:58,995
-What is this?

615
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:01,019
-Just drive!

616
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,810
Please repeat after me.

617
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:09,334
I understand and accept the terms of use.
-What?

618
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,318
Just say it!
-I understand and accept the terms of use.

619
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:16,314
-Alright. We're back on.
We're casting.

620
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:18,678
Oh crap!

621
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:21,514
-You in the Trans Am!

622
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,538
Pull over to the curb immediately!

623
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,953
Turn off the ignition!
-Huh?

624
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:30,726
I'm sorry. You're going to have
to eat a fresh bowl of dicks, man!

625
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:33,593
-Did you just tell the
cop to eat a fresh bowl of dicks?

626
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:35,617
-Pull over to the curb immediately!

627
00:51:38,593 --> 00:51:40,289
-Here.

628
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:51,661
Let's pull between those trailers.

629
00:52:07,034 --> 00:52:08,034
This way.

630
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:14,635
Ok. You good?

631
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,376
Hey folks.

632
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:16,283
You know, I think we'll go
out for a bit, but we'll see you soon.

633
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,501
-I know it's not that easy.

634
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:33,199
-Hang on, buddy.

635
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:36,180
Hang on for a sec.

636
00:56:36,181 --> 00:56:37,264
-Get off me.

637
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:38,695
Get your hands down.

638
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,975
Let me look at that cut.

639
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:52,338
This guy's casting.

640
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:55,368
Man, hold on a second.

641
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:56,393
Hold on.

642
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,340
-You...you...

643
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,434
You look like an ass backwards.

644
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:27,683
-You're not so good, huh?

645
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,009
You're going through
the denial stage right now.

646
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,734
I just wanna talk to your buddy Wylde.

647
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:33,250
Wylde.

648
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:38,259
Last time I saw you, I
put a bike chain across your face.

649
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:40,331
I asked for more.

650
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,457
It can be arrenged.

651
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,697
It's for your friend here.

652
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:48,448
Hold this...

653
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,370
-Let's go.
-Oh, God.

654
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:08,667
-The thing got pretty bad.

655
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:13,237
-The good news is it'll
 probably retain the ???

656
00:58:13,262 --> 00:58:15,847
That lens save his vision.
-Thank God for that.

657
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:21,585
OK...Well..

658
00:58:22,023 --> 00:58:23,023
What now?

659
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:31,999
-tomorrow we visit
that place Gabe found.

660
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:33,718
Make sure isn't all for nothing.

661
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:50,856
-Yeah, these designs are
all by Jay Bahn,

662
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,957
And I'm like...loving it.

663
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,553
Yeah well...maybe

664
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,990
this one

665
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,654
not as much...uh...

666
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:18,382
Wow, I mean...
I kind of thought...

667
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:23,068
You know what, guys?
I'm actually gonna get ready on my own.

668
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:25,387
But when you get that push text

669
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:28,114
tune in because tonight
is gonna be different.

670
00:59:38,053 --> 00:59:39,053
Hey Ash...

671
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:41,029
Nice muffin top.

672
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:42,240
Really sexy.

673
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,147
Ashleigh , could you stand
 up straight, please?

674
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:54,350
You could be so much prettier
 if you'd just stand up straight.

675
00:59:59,337 --> 01:00:02,321
And Ashleigh , stop mumbling,
use your words.

676
01:00:09,635 --> 01:00:11,869
How could you be so fucking

677
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,369
ugly and stupid and fat?

678
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:21,625
of course he doesn't
actually like you.

679
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:24,032
Why would he?

680
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,280
Are you gonna channel this place?

681
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:37,640
-What's the old saying?

682
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:39,729
Sunlight is the best disinfectant

683
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:43,263
This place could use some sunlight.

684
01:02:20,058 --> 01:02:21,191
-Need a light?

685
01:02:27,221 --> 01:02:28,221
Alright, take care.

686
01:02:59,825 --> 01:03:02,426
-I bet 200 they shoot someone.

687
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,559
-Alright, moving right along.

688
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,023
- 200.

689
01:03:19,648 --> 01:03:22,187
-Details are as follows

690
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:25,672
Chandler had unprotected sex
 with men four weeks ago

691
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:28,525
Her recent menstrual cycle is late.

692
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:32,430
However, Chandler has a
 history of sporadic period.

693
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:36,337
So we are placing the
 odds at 2 to 1 for this test

694
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:38,361
to confirm pregnancy.

695
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:41,673
Alright, betting's open,
please place your bet.

696
01:03:44,477 --> 01:03:45,985
-OK, got it.

697
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:48,829
<i>-I'm nervous</i>
-I know, sweetie.

698
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:56,418
-Place your bets.

699
01:03:58,191 --> 01:03:59,791
-I think she's pregnant.

700
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:01,815
-Placing the odds at 2 to 1.

701
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:11,349
-Alright, so...

702
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:14,719
You just peel this and...

703
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:16,365
in three minutes we'll know

704
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:18,826
Ok...
-Wait, what if I'm too nervous to pee?

705
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,388
Will you, will you just
stay here? I know that's weird.

706
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:24,111
-Yeah, no, I'll stay.
I don't mind.

707
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:25,861
Just don't fart.

708
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:30,525
I know.

709
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:33,946
-Ok, betting's closed.

710
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:35,198
Thank you.

711
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,495
Pregnant.

712
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:44,721
Congratulations to the
winner and the new mother.

713
01:04:44,745 --> 01:04:46,745
Alright, now winners, you may

714
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:49,174
choose to extend betting
to the next context

715
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:54,790
Just keep in mind it is a long-term
 bet so please plan accordingly.

716
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:56,516
Hans, could you step in for me?

717
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,540
Thank you.
-Let's get out of here.

718
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:14,113
-Security!

719
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,620
-<i>Over here.</i>

720
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:20,030
-Alright, moving right along,

721
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,588
-No!

722
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:29,150
-Hey! Mine!

723
01:05:37,122 --> 01:05:38,122
-Get back!

724
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,605
Get...back!

725
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:42,793
Alright, we walk out of here or I'll
paint you all with this guy's DNA. Got it?

726
01:05:56,413 --> 01:05:58,694
-Was that the dead man
 who stole my car?

727
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,131
Whose friend just hacked our site?

728
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,428
-I'm not sure it's
the same guy, Cole.

729
01:06:04,453 --> 01:06:06,202
I mean, it looked like
him but I don't know.

730
01:06:06,227 --> 01:06:07,842
Let me give you an
old suggestion, Tanner.

731
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:09,867
It's called a strategical moment.

732
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,227
-I need commitment of the longest of sorts.

733
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,251
It's not something you do
in HALF MEASURES!

734
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:20,162
-I can fix this.

735
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,340
Alright? I'll grab the guys and we'll go.

736
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:25,889
-Go what? Go what?

737
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:28,600
He's got 80, 000 bloody
witnesses in his pants.

738
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:30,815
Take care of it.

739
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,498
Go on. Piss off.

740
01:07:02,326 --> 01:07:03,726
-Keep your head back.

741
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:08,193
Does it hurt?

742
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:10,639
Put your head up.

743
01:07:13,122 --> 01:07:14,793
And keep it up.

744
01:07:15,497 --> 01:07:16,964
You're quite handsome.

745
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:19,747
Here we go. It's not that bad.

746
01:07:24,985 --> 01:07:26,578
You'll get blood in my hair.

747
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:51,348
-Let them see.

748
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:08,519
Look, a lot's happened today and

749
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:10,847
my head is just kind of spinning.

750
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:13,613
-Yeah.

751
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:34,519
I'm gonna go.

752
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,345
-Wait.

753
01:09:04,635 --> 01:09:06,861
Turn this thing off...please.

754
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:25,783
Open like this.

755
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:31,034
Look at me.

756
01:09:57,322 --> 01:09:58,322
-Hey guys.

757
01:09:58,346 --> 01:10:00,346
Standing outside the entrance to Club Feux.

758
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,370
Expecting for Victoria
to arrive any second.

759
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:05,275
Now, you know every time
Victoria shows up it's a story, but

760
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:08,416
especially tonight because
 she is under house arrest so

761
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,440
Her presence her or any place

762
01:10:10,464 --> 01:10:12,221
that serves alcohol , for that matter,

763
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:13,528
is a violation of her parole.

764
01:10:13,553 --> 01:10:14,973
Uh, are you Max from that show?

765
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:17,222
Yeah. I'm just waiting
for Victoria to show up.

766
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:19,792
-Yawn.
-Stop it, Mandy.

767
01:10:19,817 --> 01:10:21,817
-Listen, I'm gonna go out for a drink.

768
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:24,426
-<i>I think I know you two,</i>
<i>you serve the fashion thing, right?</i>

769
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:25,699
You girls are spicy!
-Yeah!

770
01:10:25,724 --> 01:10:28,496
That's us. We actually just got a sponsor.

771
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:30,520
-What's your work like?

772
01:10:30,544 --> 01:10:32,325
-We were hoping you'd say that.

773
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:34,512
-Uh, Ashleigh , what you wearing?

774
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:37,978
-We are wearing our new-
-Wait, folks, there she is.

775
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:41,337
And who is she with? What is
 she wearing? Oh, no.

776
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,713
That is awesome.

777
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,738
That's a bedazzled ankle monitor.

778
01:10:45,596 --> 01:10:47,924
Oh! Meow!

779
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,420
-Hey.

780
01:10:54,748 --> 01:10:57,006
That...was...awesome.

781
01:10:57,038 --> 01:11:00,498
-Yeah, we were basically
 the opening act for Victoria.

782
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:05,893
-Come on.
-Wait, hold on a second.

783
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:08,362
I just want my father to
see how cute you are.

784
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:12,334
-They're not interested in me.
-Oh, really?

785
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:13,959
Ok, you want me to turn on comments?

786
01:11:13,984 --> 01:11:16,709
-No, actually, I really...really don't.
-Text please.

787
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:18,266
Can we not do this now?

788
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:21,832
Let's see. Talia in Trevor
City said "he is so hot."

789
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:24,216
-Ashleigh...

790
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,240
Sara in Boca Raton says

791
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:29,599
"Don't trust him, Ashleigh!" And she
even used an angry emoticon.

792
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:31,146
What to do?

793
01:11:31,178 --> 01:11:34,553
But you're so popular with my general.
-That's great.

794
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:38,449
What is your general like? Eleven year-old
girls? they don't buy snowboards.

795
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:40,326
-Eleven to seventeen year old girls.

796
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,700
And a smattering of thirty age women.

797
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:45,709
Members of the LGBT community I present.

798
01:11:46,013 --> 01:11:48,774
Not to mention all the fine
people that just want a glimpse of you.

799
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:50,837
-Come on.

800
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,893
-What are you doing?

801
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:31,464
-I'm just...checking to see how we did.

802
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:38,973
-So, did you get the high score?

803
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:40,902
-What?

804
01:12:42,464 --> 01:12:43,464
-Your ratings.

805
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:45,168
How are they?

806
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:48,311
-Do you mean our ratings?

807
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:56,184
I'm surprised anyone else
was concerned, Those were biased ratings.

808
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,603
-<i>Congratulations.</i>
-That was the point, wasn't it?

809
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:01,934
-<i>Nice job.</i>

810
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,051
-I'm gonna go.

811
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:21,387
-Do you want me to give you a ride?
I can drop you somewhere.

812
01:13:26,999 --> 01:13:30,601
Why don't you crash here and
I'll just...I'll go sleep in my dad's?

813
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:32,641
-Wow.

814
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:34,665
Sure is chivalrous of you.

815
01:13:34,907 --> 01:13:37,125
I don't think I want to spend one
 more night in this bed or this apartment.

816
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:38,716
You can have it.

817
01:13:40,735 --> 01:13:42,743
-I'm real sorry I'm
not my brother, Tara.

818
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,500
-Yeah, you're right about that.

819
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,665
-Why don't you give me
some pointers then? From memory?

820
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:53,862
-Fuck...you.

821
01:13:54,823 --> 01:13:57,019
You think I'm a slut? fine, assume
 whatever you want.

822
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,495
I don't have any pointers for you

823
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,519
because me and your brother

824
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:03,045
never happened.

825
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,935
I guess Wyatt didn't want
me to become confused.

826
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,264
-I think we should take a picture!

827
01:14:29,624 --> 01:14:30,624
-Look, Ash.

828
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:32,389
Vick's got a fresh pedicure.

829
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:34,655
Do you think she did that
or do you think it was her cell mate?

830
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:36,608
- I don't know that.

831
01:14:36,632 --> 01:14:41,104
-<i>Hey guys, does this ankle monitor
make my ankle look big?</i>

832
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,901
Can I have the picture with Santa too?

833
01:14:48,624 --> 01:14:49,624
Oh-oh.

834
01:14:50,304 --> 01:14:51,655
Look who's coming to town.

835
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:53,897
-Having fun?

836
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:57,061
-Yes.
-You're Ashleigh, right?

837
01:14:57,272 --> 01:14:59,897
-Yeah.
-You're into casting, right?

838
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:01,874
-Yeah, a bit. Um...

839
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,233
This is Madison.

840
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:04,780
We just got sponsored.

841
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:08,084
-Nice! What's like a
 lot of followers to you?

842
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:11,018
-Oh, I don't know, maybe like 20, 000?

843
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:15,038
-I get more than that
when I get a pedicure.

844
01:15:15,062 --> 01:15:17,440
So how about tonight? Any change?

845
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:19,797
-Um...yeah...

846
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:22,109
we've got already like...40K.

847
01:15:22,134 --> 01:15:24,852
But I figure it's gonna be like
 that when we get a sponsor.

848
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:27,039
-Somehow I don't think that's it.

849
01:15:27,063 --> 01:15:29,625
- Victoria...drop it.

850
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,030
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-Drop it!

851
01:15:32,055 --> 01:15:34,821
-Are we..wait...was she in on it?

852
01:15:34,845 --> 01:15:37,360
I mean, she can't possibly
be that naive, right?

853
01:15:37,384 --> 01:15:39,384
-What are you guys talking about?
-Victoria...seriously.

854
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:41,594
-Ash, sweetie, a little advice.

855
01:15:41,618 --> 01:15:44,399
if you're gonna fuck
Conner while he's casting,

856
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,211
don't get on top. Stay
on missionary position.

857
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,093
It's a little more modest.

858
01:15:55,408 --> 01:15:56,408
-Ashleigh

859
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:58,200
-Nice, Conner, real nice.

860
01:15:58,223 --> 01:16:00,775
And Victoria? She's a total bitch.

861
01:16:01,259 --> 01:16:02,992
Are you gonna unfriend me?

862
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,720
Are we unfriends?

863
01:16:05,017 --> 01:16:07,470
-Ashleigh stop. Ashleigh seriously.
Grow up.

864
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:10,962
Think this is gonna help us both.
-You are unbelievable!

865
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:33,256
-<i>Let her go, Conner.
Sorry Ash.</i>

866
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,460
-Ashleigh!

867
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:54,662
-Welcome back guys, Match here,
your agent of casting,

868
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:57,179
here I am reporting inside Club Fig

869
01:16:57,204 --> 01:16:59,204
in the ladies' restroom where

870
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:02,421
Ashleigh has just taken refuge

871
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:04,445
inside a stall.

872
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:07,405
It seems Conner was live
when he and Ashleigh were fornicating

873
01:17:07,952 --> 01:17:10,018
Apparently he was Ashleigh's...

874
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:11,397
maiden voyage.

875
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,030
But...

876
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,613
the question remains

877
01:17:15,161 --> 01:17:17,216
Was Ashleigh's cameo

878
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,240
on Connor's video unauthorized?

879
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:24,318
Was Ash simply trying to get her
 new beau's pathetic numbers up?

880
01:17:25,404 --> 01:17:26,404
Stay tuned.

881
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,514
Hey...

882
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:35,115
Do me a favor.

883
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:36,788
Send me a text letting
me know you're going out

884
01:17:36,813 --> 01:17:38,357
and I'll make sure to
get you some coverage.

885
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,588
-You know, sometimes I think about

886
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:08,908
why I channel myself,

887
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:11,265
and...

888
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:15,999
It's moments like this
that I still have to understand.

889
01:18:18,163 --> 01:18:19,764
So many girls

890
01:18:19,789 --> 01:18:22,718
have the same crappy stuff
happen to them that happen to me

891
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,250
and

892
01:18:24,274 --> 01:18:26,274
knowing that you're watching

893
01:18:26,727 --> 01:18:27,727
and that

894
01:18:27,751 --> 01:18:29,751
you see things from my perspective

895
01:18:31,945 --> 01:18:33,531
This makes me feel a little stronger.

896
01:18:36,547 --> 01:18:37,547
Anyway,

897
01:18:38,203 --> 01:18:39,536
remember this, okay?

898
01:18:41,086 --> 01:18:42,419
Thanks for watching.

899
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:44,518
And start cueing up early because

900
01:18:44,776 --> 01:18:46,776
tomorrow's gonna be an interesting day.

901
01:18:53,363 --> 01:18:54,363
Well, Ash...

902
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:58,148
that's a record.

903
01:19:12,106 --> 01:19:13,427
-I told her it was a bad idea,

904
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:15,935
but she insisted, so...

905
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,959
I figured hey

906
01:19:20,734 --> 01:19:22,945
if she wants to break off,
I'll be somewhere else.

907
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:35,959
Ok, you see this?

908
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:38,236
That's how my people are
going to watch me kick your ass.

909
01:21:21,379 --> 01:21:23,179
- You're really going back?

910
01:21:25,004 --> 01:21:26,004
-Have to.

911
01:21:26,612 --> 01:21:27,877
At this point I may as well.

912
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:30,283
It has been a cool fifteen
 minutes for me for sure.

913
01:21:31,221 --> 01:21:32,621
-What does that mean?

914
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,596
-It means I'm gonna have
 shit duties for a while.

915
01:21:36,198 --> 01:21:37,998
Figuratively and literally.

916
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:43,537
-I hate to see you in
trouble and all, but

917
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:46,213
I really <i>am</i> glad
you're here right now.

918
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:47,807
-Really?

919
01:21:47,994 --> 01:21:49,994
Because I did just beat
up your boyfriend.

920
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,640
-He had it coming.

921
01:21:52,432 --> 01:21:54,197
And besides, he likes
the drama.

922
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,791
Give him an excuse to relapse.

923
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:00,990
Today

924
01:22:02,811 --> 01:22:04,107
I let Wyatt down.

925
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,350
I used

926
01:22:07,311 --> 01:22:09,052
his...passing

927
01:22:09,795 --> 01:22:11,045
as an excuse to...

928
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:13,327
to do whatever I
wanted to do anyway

929
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,873
and that just sucks.

930
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:19,106
-Wyatt would be disappointed if we
didn't use his death to act like idiots.

931
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,567
Right? You and me.

932
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,966
We're gonna go knock over
a liquor store, for old time's sake.

933
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:31,161
It happened.

934
01:22:31,442 --> 01:22:32,442
They're headed for me.

935
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,895
-Wow, someone's important.

936
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:37,971
Ok, well let me...

937
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:40,333
let me stall them while you slip out.

938
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:41,995
-You sure?

939
01:22:42,019 --> 01:22:44,901
-Yeah, I'm an old pro
at this. Just use my car.

940
01:22:47,886 --> 01:22:48,886
-Ash...

941
01:22:50,308 --> 01:22:51,308
You know...

942
01:22:51,886 --> 01:22:52,886
-I know.

943
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,520
-Are you sure you're up for this?

944
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:44,042
-We know you guys channel
us to see something real,

945
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:48,802
but most of the time
what you see is not true.

946
01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:52,021
Something else, something less.

947
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,834
But tonight,

948
01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:56,365
tonight we're gonna settle this.

949
01:24:56,809 --> 01:24:58,058
And you

950
01:24:58,692 --> 01:25:00,496
You can believe what
 you're gonna see.

951
01:25:15,863 --> 01:25:17,109
-Spend lots of money.

952
01:25:23,521 --> 01:25:24,721
Whoa, whoa whoa...

953
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,745
where you going?

954
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:28,769
-I don't believe this.

955
01:25:28,793 --> 01:25:31,739
-I got Wylde. he's upstairs right now.

956
01:25:32,948 --> 01:25:34,987
-You know, I have no
trouble believing that

957
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:37,442
given your unbroken
chain of anecdotes, Tanner.

958
01:25:39,065 --> 01:25:40,065
Move!

959
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:41,625
Tell me.

960
01:25:41,882 --> 01:25:42,984
Do you fancy a wager?

961
01:25:49,172 --> 01:25:50,773
Eh? Would you

962
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,620
Come on.

963
01:25:55,768 --> 01:25:56,932
What should I give you?

964
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,112
Let's call it a suggestion. The teeth.

965
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:54,670
-Where is he?

966
01:27:10,576 --> 01:27:11,576
Dude!

967
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,617
-You OK?
-I'm fine.

968
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,383
I'm a pretty good bait.

969
01:27:50,408 --> 01:27:53,243
-Yeah, thanks. I hope
I don't get pink eye.

970
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:55,039
let's go, huh?

971
01:27:56,384 --> 01:27:58,184
-I have to go do something.

972
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,899
Keep your head low,
I'll catch up with you later.

973
01:30:48,513 --> 01:30:49,513
-Hey dad!

974
01:30:49,919 --> 01:30:51,871
-Hey, bud.

975
01:30:57,614 --> 01:30:58,614
How's your mom?

976
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,770
Dylan?

977
01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:07,122
Kid's not here two seconds
and already he's...

978
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,277
-<i>Did you hear they hurt my dad?</i>

979
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:20,739
-Dylan?

980
01:31:20,763 --> 01:31:22,763
Why don't you walk
down to Tyler's house, Ok?

981
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,658
It's gonna be alright.

982
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,199
It's OK.

983
01:31:31,394 --> 01:31:32,988
-You put the thing around my brother

984
01:31:34,934 --> 01:31:36,667
-So what's your real name?

985
01:31:37,012 --> 01:31:38,012
-Jonah.

986
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:39,535
-So, Jonah.

987
01:31:40,113 --> 01:31:41,425
What are your ratings like?

988
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:43,878
Breaking in my house, scaring my kid?

989
01:31:44,863 --> 01:31:46,130
-Surprisingly good.

990
01:31:46,809 --> 01:31:48,269
-Felonies always find an audience.

991
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:51,470
Do your followers know that they're

992
01:31:51,494 --> 01:31:52,886
watching an imposter?

993
01:31:56,419 --> 01:31:58,841
-Do your shareholders
know you're mission creep?

994
01:31:59,943 --> 01:32:01,476
You see where I've been

995
01:32:01,638 --> 01:32:03,238
we know what that means.

996
01:32:03,943 --> 01:32:04,943
-That's right.

997
01:32:05,318 --> 01:32:07,677
Aren't you in the army or something?
-Yeah.

998
01:32:08,396 --> 01:32:09,396
Or something.

999
01:32:10,638 --> 01:32:11,739
-Thirsty?

1000
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:26,906
You know when your
brother posted his best ratings?

1001
01:32:28,164 --> 01:32:29,164
-No.

1002
01:32:29,523 --> 01:32:31,256
-It was the night he died.

1003
01:32:31,577 --> 01:32:33,976
Wylde got nearly half a million followers.

1004
01:32:34,627 --> 01:32:36,338
And those numbers helped, but

1005
01:32:37,144 --> 01:32:38,979
Long after he went black

1006
01:32:39,746 --> 01:32:41,959
half a million people

1007
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:44,760
watched the inside of
your brother's eyelids.

1008
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,467
nothing but blood vessels

1009
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:51,925
He got an ovation

1010
01:32:53,722 --> 01:32:55,323
We should all be so lucky.

1011
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,472
So what?

1012
01:32:58,714 --> 01:33:00,447
Are you gonna kill me now?

1013
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:02,081
I get it.

1014
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,974
You loved your brother.

1015
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:06,131
I guess you had to end up here.

1016
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,584
-I didn't love my brother.

1017
01:33:12,757 --> 01:33:13,757
I should have.

1018
01:33:15,405 --> 01:33:16,738
That's why I'm here.

1019
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,993
-Phone call for you.
From the States.

1020
01:33:22,428 --> 01:33:23,562
-it's late there.

1021
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:31,319
Hello, this is Sargent Maddox.

1022
01:33:31,725 --> 01:33:34,662
-Hello, this is Wyatt Maddox.

1023
01:33:35,634 --> 01:33:39,227
-Dude, what are you
doing calling me like this?

1024
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:42,912
You realize how much
 trouble I could get in?

1025
01:33:42,943 --> 01:33:46,149
Look, email me tomorrow
and I'll call you when I can, Ok?

1026
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,165
-Yeah, and just how
long will that take, huh?

1027
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:52,047
-Jesus, Wyatt, I got
responsibilities here, man.

1028
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:53,821
-I know, I know.

1029
01:33:55,532 --> 01:33:57,571
-Come on, Jay, don't be mad.

1030
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:00,602
I know you're glad to hear from me.

1031
01:34:01,993 --> 01:34:04,016
I mean, what's up?
Were you sleeping?

1032
01:34:04,977 --> 01:34:07,782
-It's the middle of the day,
and man, I'm busy.

1033
01:34:07,806 --> 01:34:09,088
-Oh, yeah.

1034
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:10,511
An...

1035
01:34:10,535 --> 01:34:12,846
orphanage ain't gonna
bomb itself, right?

1036
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,120
Nope.

1037
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,182
-I'm a medic, remember?

1038
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:20,409
-You leave the other
 boredom to others.

1039
01:34:20,604 --> 01:34:21,604
Do ya?

1040
01:34:21,878 --> 01:34:23,623
Now, that's cool.

1041
01:34:24,569 --> 01:34:26,369
it's important to delegate.

1042
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,510
-Wyatt, what's this about?
Are you in trouble?

1043
01:34:32,491 --> 01:34:34,091
-Always, little brother.

1044
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,271
Never fail to disappoint, do I?

1045
01:34:39,223 --> 01:34:40,423
-Well, what is it?

1046
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:41,954
What'd you do now?

1047
01:34:42,746 --> 01:34:45,816
-Oh...about six tabs of Oxyne

1048
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,261
That's supposed to calm you.

1049
01:34:49,418 --> 01:34:51,558
When you take enough of it it's like being

1050
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:53,583
rocked to sleep

1051
01:34:53,607 --> 01:34:56,959
And you can hear your
own heart snore.

1052
01:34:57,624 --> 01:34:58,624
it's like

1053
01:34:59,452 --> 01:35:02,561
A little puppy in the bed
with the clock just listening

1054
01:35:02,586 --> 01:35:04,735
to that ticking so he
don't think he's the

1055
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,108
last fucking dog on earth.

1056
01:35:06,926 --> 01:35:07,926
-Look...

1057
01:35:08,645 --> 01:35:09,711
I gotta go, man.

1058
01:35:10,613 --> 01:35:14,207
Go home, sleep that stuff
off, and I'll call you when I can.

1059
01:35:14,519 --> 01:35:16,675
-Got an ovation tonight, Jonah.

1060
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,769
That's like

1061
01:35:19,793 --> 01:35:25,074
500,000 people all clicking
that little clap icon.

1062
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,603
-Oh, yeah? What'd that cost you?

1063
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:31,899
-Exactly.

1064
01:35:36,647 --> 01:35:38,045
And Jay...

1065
01:35:40,483 --> 01:35:42,732
I always wanted to
be so much like you.

1066
01:35:45,373 --> 01:35:47,013
Disgraceful, huh?

1067
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:50,092
Wanting to be like your kid brother.

1068
01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:00,522
-Wyatt...

1069
01:36:03,811 --> 01:36:05,478
that cough sounds hollow.

1070
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,736
Are you alright?

1071
01:36:09,084 --> 01:36:10,240
-<i>I'm fine...</i>

1072
01:36:11,139 --> 01:36:12,139
I'll be fine.

1073
01:36:14,998 --> 01:36:17,398
Especially with this many followers.

1074
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:28,456
Sign off, little brother.

1075
01:36:30,988 --> 01:36:31,988
And hey Jay...

1076
01:36:33,238 --> 01:36:35,120
-Yeah.Yeah, I'm here.

1077
01:36:37,034 --> 01:36:38,501
-Say hi to her for me.

1078
01:37:08,908 --> 01:37:11,088
-I think your followers are
going to be disappointed.

1079
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:14,376
You're not gonna hurt me.

1080
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:15,733
Not like this.

1081
01:37:16,443 --> 01:37:18,643
I don't think that's who you <i>are</i>.

1082
01:37:19,693 --> 01:37:20,693
-You're right.

1083
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,800
it's not who I am.

1084
01:37:25,365 --> 01:37:27,299
So I'm leaving it up to them.

1085
01:37:30,436 --> 01:37:32,568
Let's see here...oh, look at that.

1086
01:37:33,772 --> 01:37:34,772
Steve

1087
01:37:35,154 --> 01:37:36,537
from San Fran

1088
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:38,561
just texted I should
order you to run

1089
01:37:38,733 --> 01:37:40,733
and then shoot you
in the back of the head.

1090
01:37:40,757 --> 01:37:45,398
Jesus. Reese in the U.K. thinks
that I should knee-cap you.

1091
01:37:46,633 --> 01:37:47,967
I don't know, Reese.

1092
01:37:48,704 --> 01:37:50,313
these are Wadcutter bullets.

1093
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,672
They're soft slug.
they'll pulverize the bone.

1094
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,514
You are not popular with
my demographic, Garrett.

1095
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,538
-they don't even know this is real.

1096
01:37:59,563 --> 01:38:02,873
-Deon in Gary, Indiana
wants to see us slug it out.

1097
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:06,599
What do you say? You look like you
work out. -You don't get this, do you?

1098
01:38:06,623 --> 01:38:08,279
-I got 'make him beg!',

1099
01:38:08,327 --> 01:38:09,327
-Listen...

1100
01:38:09,351 --> 01:38:10,624
-Curb stomp hem!
-Wylde!

1101
01:38:10,647 --> 01:38:12,647
-Slit his throat!
-Jonah!

1102
01:38:12,671 --> 01:38:14,990
-Talk to your customers, Garrett.

1103
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,521
After all, I'm just a vessel, right?

1104
01:38:17,545 --> 01:38:18,748
-Dad?

1105
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:22,069
-You need to go to Tyler's house.

1106
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,339
-But dad!
-No buts, go!

1107
01:38:51,763 --> 01:38:53,029
How's it gonna end?

1108
01:38:55,552 --> 01:38:56,552
-Watch.

1109
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:36,359
My brother

1110
01:39:36,844 --> 01:39:37,844
Wyatt,

1111
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,115
he made his decisions.

1112
01:39:42,953 --> 01:39:43,953
I'll make mine.

1113
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:45,758
And you

1114
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:48,393
you just let people be.

1115
01:39:49,273 --> 01:39:50,340
Just let 'em be.

1116
01:39:54,195 --> 01:39:56,070
I'm sorry for scaring your son.

1117
01:39:57,937 --> 01:39:58,937
-Is that it?

1118
01:40:01,367 --> 01:40:03,234
Is that how your story ends?

1119
01:40:04,375 --> 01:40:06,351
-No, just your part.

1120
01:40:38,422 --> 01:40:39,999
And they will catch us.

1121
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:43,476
I want you to blame
this whole thing on me.

1122
01:40:44,316 --> 01:40:46,394
Tell them it was PTSD,

1123
01:40:46,418 --> 01:40:49,699
tell them it was some
crazy vet on a venge trip,

1124
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:51,269
Tell them it was Agent Orange.

1125
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,699
Whatever. Just make something up.

1126
01:40:53,723 --> 01:40:56,761
Tell them whatever it takes to
 keep you out of this trouble.

1127
01:41:04,786 --> 01:41:06,586
-Maybe I'm Ok with trouble.

1128
01:41:11,169 --> 01:41:12,169
What about you?

1129
01:41:13,044 --> 01:41:14,511
What are you gonna do?

1130
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:53,560
-Does anyone have any
requests for today's soundtrack?

1131
01:42:11,377 --> 01:42:12,767
-Go, go, go!

1132
01:42:15,438 --> 01:42:18,493
-Watch out! move, move, move.
