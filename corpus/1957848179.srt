1
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:12,840
You'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

2
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,749
But let's not kid ourselves,
you had your 15 minutes,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,473
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

4
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,399
Bonsoir, mon ami.

5
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,683
Just thought I'd stop by.

6
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,389
Well, enough chit chat.

7
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,409
You know why I'm here, Thibaut.

8
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,243
Do I?

9
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,909
As president of the skating union,

10
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,519
having to tell those past their prime

11
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,049
that they're past their prime

12
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,889
is one of the least
saddest parts of my job.

13
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,923
Saddest, I meant saddest. What did I say?

14
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,750
Are we done?

15
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,369
Let's be clear here, Frenchie.

16
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,939
I strongly advise you to end
your skating career yourself,

17
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,669
ASAP, because if you don't,

18
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,722
I will personally make sure you regret-

19
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:58,973
Oh shit, the soup.

20
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,849
So as I was saying, I
will personally make sure

21
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,092
that you regret-
Here, hold this.

22
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
What was I saying?

23
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,209
Thanks.
Yeah, uh-huh.

24
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,189
Look, there, there's no
need to tell me all this.

25
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,223
See, I disagree.

26
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,013
If it were up to you,

27
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:31,729
you'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

28
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,019
But let's not kid ourselves,
you had your 15 minutes,

29
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,409
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

30
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,963
You are old news. And old news
goes out with the garbage.

31
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,333
You see this soup?

32
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,343
Well, you can't have any.

33
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,737
Oh, what a beautiful thing

34
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,988
To leave a gloomy place

35
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,879
For Paris, beautiful Paris

36
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,720
which love must have created one day

37
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,203
Oh, ffff-

38
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,453
Most film teachers think mainstream,

39
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,789
but those teachers are
not Professor Steve.

40
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,039
See, Professor Steve thinks visionary.

41
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,449
And that is why we're going to skip over

42
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,679
these very nice mainstream folks.

43
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,899
And instead focus on the works

44
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,463
of one quietly brilliant modern master:

45
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,299
Professor Steve.

46
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,603
Sorry.

47
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,043
Actually, dudes and dudettes,

48
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,069
Professor Steve has changed his mind.

49
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,419
Let's all break out our short
scripts we wrote last week

50
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,880
because it's time for
another rousing round of

51
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,370
peer

52
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,073
critique.

53
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,749
Hmm.

54
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,939
Now, of course, we don't have
time to critique everybody.

55
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,109
So instead, let's just
spotlight one very lucky person.

56
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,483
Claire, how about you?

57
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,959
Now, remember, people, we are
not here to attack Claire,

58
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
but to guide her, to inspire
her, to shape her as a writer.

59
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,303
Wilson?

60
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,459
Yeah, so, Claire, this
isn't to attack you,

61
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,869
but to inspire you and
shape you as a writer.

62
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,743
Um, I just feel like
your script didn't, like,

63
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,983
convey the human experience.

64
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,999
That's because it's
about a talking tapeworm.

65
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

66
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,123
This is not an arguing space,
this is a growing space.

67
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,623
Wilson, please continue.

68
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,739
And quite frankly, it
could use more minorities.

69
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,665
Ooh.

70
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,334
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

71
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:54,270
Mm, mm.

72
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,638
Unpack that for me. Yes.

73
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,699
I felt that there was a lack
of a true political voice

74
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,759
from the tapeworm.

75
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,162
I found that deficit to be, frankly, sad.

76
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,169
I feel like the tapeworm comes
from a place of privilege.

77
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,156
Is the tapeworm willing to
examine his privilege, Claire?

78
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:16,259
I mean,

79
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,093
I just feel like a tapeworm

80
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,319
wouldn't say this stuff in real life.

81
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,871
Unpack that for me.

82
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,639
Okay, everybody.

83
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,329
Thank you, thank you. Very rich remarks.

84
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,479
Now, for your next assignment,

85
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,909
you are going to make your own films.

86
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,713
Yes, that's right, you're
going to make art, art.

87
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,793
Like Professor Steve before you.

88
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,430
Only not as good.

89
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,389
I figured out my film
genre: puppet Greek tragedy.

90
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,579
So it'll be "Oedipus," but with puppets.

91
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,909
I call it: "Oedipuppet."

92
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,009
Oh, so cute.

93
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,843
Can I be in it?

94
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,643
Yeah, actually, I was
thinking of you for Oedipus.

95
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,739
Oh my God, Claire,
doesn't he murder his dad,

96
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,059
and have sex with his mom, and
gouge his eyes out, and die?

97
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,219
Yeah.

98
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,449
Cute, I'm in.

99
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,749
Seriously, though, can't
believe your professor

100
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,878
signed off on this,
how'd you convince him?

101
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,199
Whoa, Claire, did you even tell him?

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,399
Oh my God, don't you
care about your grade?

103
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,339
Mm, he'll come around,

104
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,549
or not. And I'll get an F,
and flunk out of college,

105
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,339
and spend the rest of my
life cleaning toilets.

106
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,840
Ew! Don't talk about
toilets, toilets are gross.

107
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:29,373
You know what you need?

108
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,190
Get laid?

109
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:34,119
No, but yes, but I mean realistically,

110
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,029
you need to go to Paris.

111
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,419
I can't just drop
everything and go to Paris.

112
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,899
Sure you can, Claire.

113
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,199
Like, all you've ever talked
about since middle school,

114
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,289
is the poems of Apollinaire,
the history of the catacombs,

115
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,179
the entire "Astérix" series.

116
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,199
No wonder you're still a virgin.

117
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,739
You are very loud.
But, seriously,

118
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,559
you've worked so hard for this.

119
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,929
You literally taught yourself
French when you were a kid.

120
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,763
You should go.

121
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,349
We should both go,

122
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,149
make it a party.

123
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,779
Unlike you, I would have to withdraw

124
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,099
my entire college fund in order to go.

125
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,103
So what?

126
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,083
It's not like you're getting
anything outta college.

127
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,950
It's a crazy idea, though.

128
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,289
We don't even know anyone in Paris.

129
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,799
Sure we do, my Uncle Antoine lives there.

130
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,049
Really?
Mm-hmm.

131
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,179
Yeah, he's the head

132
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,559
of like this puppet conservatory in Paris.

133
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,879
Your uncle is the head

134
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,606
of Le Conservatoire de la Marionnette,

135
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,116
and you never told me?

136
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:34,393
You never asked.

137
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,639
Well, I just need to
get through this class

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,699
and this professor, and
then I'll figure it out.

139
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,619
Follow your gut, Claire.

140
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,989
If you wanna go to
Paris, then go to Paris.

141
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,159
If you wanna make Oedipuppet,
then make Oedipuppet,

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,339
because life is far too short

143
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,343
and true passion is far too rare.

144
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,829
How did you get so wise?

145
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,680
I talk to Yoda.

146
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,559
He lives in my closet,
and when I touch his hand,

147
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,319
I ask him questions,
and he gives me answers.

148
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,009
Maybe I should try it sometime.

149
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,059
Yeah, but you should
probably get your own.

150
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,079
I don't let just anybody touch my Yoda.

151
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,653
He's in his original box.

152
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,079
Okay, let's do one last take.

153
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,039
Oedipuppet, gouging out
the eyes, take four.

154
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,579
Roll camera

155
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,670
and

156
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,794
action.

157
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,709
Oh ye gods!

158
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,389
I am ruined!

159
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,319
For my wretched sins

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,488
I rip out mine eyes!

161
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,639
For my wretched sins

162
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,687
I rip out mine eyes!

163
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,409
I'm sorry, Claire, I
can't raise your grade.

164
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,959
To do so would be to compromise

165
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,589
the rigorous standards of Professor Steve.

166
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,599
I didn't ask you to raise my grade.

167
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,489
I asked why you're saying
my work isn't honest.

168
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,023
Oh, Claire, Claire, Claire,
Claire, Claire, Claire.

169
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,719
How do I explain honesty?

170
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,859
Honesty is real

171
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,119
and honest.

172
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,999
You saw Wilson's movie today, right?

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,109
Now that was an honest work,

174
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,419
a heartfelt account of
his turbulent upbringing

175
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,773
as a Cambodian child under
the merciless Bic Pen regime.

176
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,729
You do realize Wilson is a lacrosse player

177
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,223
from Greenwich, right?

178
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,599
And

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,433
white.

180
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,669
Professor Steve chooses to ignore you.

181
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,269
Well, if I can't raise this grade,

182
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,270
I'm just worried about my GPA because...

183
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,883
Wait a second.

184
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,900
No, I'm not.

185
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:20,849
I'm not.

186
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,623
I'm just not.

187
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:26,579
Excuse me a second.

188
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,653
I need to call Yoda.

189
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,929
Julia, ask Yoda if we should go to Paris.

190
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,630
Ooh, yay, hang on a sec.

191
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,777
Yoda says, "For 800 years,
have I trained Jedi."

192
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,167
Good enough for me!

193
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,853
Your application is adequate.

194
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,206
Now, tell me why you wish to
work as an au pair in Paris.

195
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,590
Okay. Well, uh, I've never been to France,

196
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:41,647
but what I've always
wanted more than anything

197
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,098
is to live in Paris

198
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:45,786
So... I think this job

199
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,908
can help me get to know
Parisian culture better.

200
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,133
You speak French perfectly!

201
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:54,809
Thank you! I'm, uh, I'm -

202
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,829
I'm half Belgian.

203
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,009
Yes.

204
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,399
Well, even so.

205
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,809
Anyway, some family in
Paris will be very lucky

206
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,829
to have you for an au pair.

207
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,053
So, welcome to Babysitting Paris!

208
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,489
Ah,

209
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,009
but a word to the wise.

210
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,428
Some families don't particularly like it

211
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,838
when their au pair is
as well-educated as you.

212
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,664
It can threaten their
fragile sense of superiority.

213
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:27,979
So, you can't be too careful, you know?

214
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:30,006
Wait, um, what did you...

215
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,679
Great, it's settled then.

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,479
Welcome to Babysitting Paris.

217
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,225
That is...

218
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,333
...if that's truly what you want.

219
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,458
This is the kind of decision that can

220
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,658
come back to haunt you,

221
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,577
if you see what I'm saying.

222
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,059
My God...

223
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,790
To look at your young face

224
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,133
and your supple, youthful skin.

225
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,588
...knowing full well that
in three months' time

226
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,242
you'll come back prematurely aged

227
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,825
and wrinkled like a prune,

228
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,367
with a permanent twitch.

229
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,521
Uh, sorry, would you mind repea...

230
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,779
I didn't say anything.

231
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,519
Right, so I have other applicants to see,

232
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,670
how will you be paying?

233
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,783
Excuse me?

234
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,109
You, you dropped this,
this receipt from, uh,

235
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,898
Babysitting Paris.

236
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,170
Oh, thank you.

237
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,547
You...

238
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,169
You speak French?

239
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,003
Uh, yes!

240
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,327
Are you French?

241
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:36,646
No, but...

242
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,782
I'm going to France next week.

243
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,967
It's my first time.

244
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,303
How about you? Are you from France?

245
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,815
Yeah, from Lyon.

246
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,732
Lyon! That's where Guignol is from.

247
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,297
How do you know about Guignol?

248
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,809
Funny for an American to
know about a French puppet.

249
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,165
Well, uh, I like puppets!

250
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,044
I do too.

251
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,726
I mean, when you're from Lyon

252
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,410
It's pretty much required.

253
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:00,354
You live here in New York?

254
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,644
Yeah.

255
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,220
Well...

256
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,907
...not anymore, after this week.

257
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,124
But I did live here, for four years.

258
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:09,906
I was training for figure skating.

259
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,542
Oh, you skate?

260
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:12,454
Yeah.

261
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:13,287
I mean...

262
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:15,626
No.

263
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:18,443
Well, actually... it's complicated, but...

264
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,288
...oh, that's my ride.

265
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,789
- Ah. Oh, no.
- Um.

266
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,335
Oh, okay.

267
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,753
Uh.

268
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,870
...See you soon!

269
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,779
Okay, Paris question.

270
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,429
Where do you think is
best to rent an apartment:

271
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,629
La Rive Gauche or La Rive Droite?

272
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,669
Of course, La Rive Gauche is
associated with bohemians,

273
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,549
so that might be kind of iffy.

274
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,593
Now certain places are going
to be pricier, but consider-

275
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,730
You what?

276
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,930
Room and board with who?

277
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,999
Au pairing?

278
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,609
Oh my God, Claire.

279
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,389
No! I'd rather sell my
body, except not really

280
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,359
because that's super
unhygienic and you know me,

281
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,929
I'm like a super huge germophobe.

282
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,895
But, seriously, why do this?

283
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,921
Well, it's at least a little
cheaper than living with you.

284
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,789
Oh, Claire.

285
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,790
No, I didn't mean, I didn't
mean you could live with me.

286
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,719
I need my space.

287
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,870
You could live near me.

288
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,949
Oh my God, Claire, you love him.

289
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,783
No, I don't.

290
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,046
Sure you do.

291
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,199
Look at you.

292
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,809
Your cheeks are flushed,
your pupils are dilated,

293
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,609
your face looks like this,

294
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,489
and your heartbeat is
Julio Iglesias music.

295
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,139
Get your ear off my boob.

296
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,799
Oh my God, Claire, you
guys should get married.

297
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,899
I should get married to someone

298
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,509
because I met them on the street?

299
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,559
You'd be surprised. People
get married over less.

300
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,809
My cousin Jenna married this guy

301
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,419
because his flesh tones
complemented her home furnishings.

302
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,449
How'd that work out for her?

303
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,279
Oh, she dumped him when his tan faded.

304
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,129
So let that be a lesson to
you before you marry rashly.

305
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,863
Before, do you even listen to you?

306
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,599
What? Sorry, I was so distracted.

307
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,633
You know, your pores are huge.

308
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,109
It's funny what moves some people,

309
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,073
and not others.

310
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,693
For some it's rock-and-roll,

311
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,943
for others it's Beethoven and Brahms.

312
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,953
For one person, it's a Magritte painting,

313
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,179
and for another, it's a guy on ice

314
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,649
hurling himself into the air,

315
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,823
spinning three times, and
landing on one tiny blade.

316
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,319
Somehow, it just makes you
feel a little less lonely

317
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,193
in the world.

318
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,210
And who knows why.

319
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,009
Claire, welcome.

320
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,869
I'm Nadege St. Pierre,
this is my husband Bernard.

321
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,529
He is pleased to meet you.

322
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,939
These are our children,
Elodie and Angelique;

323
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,929
this is my mother, Katia;
and our gouvernante,

324
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,669
how do you say that in English?

325
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,763
Housekeeper.

326
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,883
Bonjour.

327
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:29,759
Oh, no need, she does not speak French.

328
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,149
She's from Tasmania.

329
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,179
Tanzania.

330
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,035
Yes, that.

331
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,245
Nice to meet you all.

332
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:39,557
My goodness, you speak such lovely French!

333
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:41,941
Bernard, she speaks such lovely French!

334
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,345
Mother, she speaks such lovely French!

335
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:50,221
Such refinement, such education!

336
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,213
So wonderful!

337
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,609
Well, um, this is the key of your room.

338
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,077
Come with me, I'll show you.

339
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,681
Thank you.

340
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:04,313
You speak so well French.

341
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,259
Oh my God, Claire.

342
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,349
I'm like really depressed
for you, except not really

343
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,349
because I have a really
nice apartment to myself,

344
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,819
but still.

345
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,743
Thanks.

346
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,190
You're welcome, Claire.

347
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,869
So why do they call it a
chambre de bonne anyway,

348
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,699
is it because everybody
that ever lived here

349
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,289
died of depression and all
that was left was their bones?

350
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,613
No, chambre de bonne means maid's room.

351
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:37,565
Ew.

352
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:40,677
Gross.

353
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,460
Hello.

354
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:54,202
Hi, my name is Claire Burkhardt.

355
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:57,191
I'm here to do a documentary project.

356
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:58,025
Why?

357
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,157
Uh... it was all arranged before I left,

358
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:05,316
with Mr. Le Drouin.

359
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,302
With whom?

360
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,138
With Mr...

361
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:09,983
Who??

362
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:10,816
Mr. Le Drouin.

363
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:14,201
Ah, Mr. Le Drouin!

364
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:15,693
Of course.

365
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,234
Because I'll be honest with you,

366
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:19,176
I can't understand you with your accent.

367
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,908
At any rate, I can't help you.

368
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:26,457
You better try the
Registrar's office instead.

369
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,316
But... why...

370
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:28,466
Have a nice day.

371
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:39,591
Mr. Le Drouin.

372
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,806
Who?

373
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,057
Mister... Le... Drouin.

374
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:50,996
Ah, Mr. Le Drouin!

375
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:56,821
Frankly, I can hardly
understand that accent of yours.

376
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:02,041
Go to the admissions office instead.

377
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,208
It's over there.

378
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,031
Ah, you're here to see Mr. Le Drouin!

379
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:24,436
Why didn't you say so before?

380
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:25,580
Though I must say,

381
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,691
It's not easy to understand
you, with your...

382
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:31,121
Yes, I know. My big fat accent.

383
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,238
Yes, exactly.

384
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,639
Go try the front desk.

385
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,116
What did I just tell you?

386
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,056
I know, Madame, but they told me...

387
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:46,498
What you're doing is very rude.

388
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,938
In France, we do not interrupt.

389
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:51,272
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

390
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,205
I'll take it from here.

391
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,039
Hi, I'm, uh, I'm Rafal
Dabrowski, I, I'm a student here.

392
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,053
Uh, they sent me to get you.

393
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,143
Bonjour.

394
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:06,009
Wow.

395
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,379
Your French is so beautiful.

396
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,249
So I heard you're gonna be filming us?

397
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,053
Uh, yeah.

398
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,673
And you'll be here all semester, I hope?

399
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,573
Um,

400
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:20,240
mm, mm-hmm.

401
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,953
So, um,

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,323
another question, um,

403
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:29,574
do you have, um, boyfriend?

404
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,563
Hi, um...

405
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:58,006
...don't we... know each other?

406
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,032
No, madame.

407
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,443
Um, do you know

408
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,659
why Thibaut Baudet isn't on the program?

409
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:07,385
Yes, madame.

410
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:09,894
It's because he retired at
the start of the season.

411
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:13,100
So... he's not skating?

412
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,498
Yes, exactly.

413
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:16,682
He's not skating.

414
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,022
However...

415
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:22,180
...he's here to watch the competition.

416
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,187
Well, thanks so much for
coming. It was great to see you.

417
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,995
I hope you guys liked the performance.

418
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,815
He skated really well today.

419
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:48,916
Especially today.

420
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:52,029
Hello...

421
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:54,170
Can I help you?

422
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,472
Yes. Uh... Sorry, uh...

423
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:58,414
Excuse me.

424
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,709
I tanted to well you...

425
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,935
...I mean, you tell...

426
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:07,119
...that you're my skavorite fater

427
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,888
...I mean, fakorite skaver

428
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,040
fuh... ska... fa...

429
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,333
I need to go to the bathroom.

430
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,363
Oh my God.

431
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:32,337
...favorite skater!

432
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,229
My favorite skater. Is you.

433
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:36,080
That's all.

434
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:38,668
...Me?!

435
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:39,501
Yes!

436
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,640
Well... thanks! That's nice of you.

437
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,432
Wait... we know each other!

438
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,575
We met in New York,

439
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:48,558
that time I was waiting for a cab.

440
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,000
We talked about puppets, and Guignol.

441
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,555
It's funny, you know...

442
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:56,568
I've always wanted to do some kind of show

443
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:58,250
with both skating and puppetry.

444
00:27:58,251 --> 00:27:59,418
Oh? Uh, me too!

445
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:01,267
No kidding.

446
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,718
Wait, so you live in Paris now?

447
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,851
I could give you my
contact info, if you want.

448
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,685
YES!

449
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:44,005
Was it good?

450
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:46,470
Oh. Uh-huh.

451
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
It was fine.

452
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:46,011
So, you work near here, right?

453
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,719
Yup, just around the corner,
for the Banc Francilienne

454
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,303
You work at a bank?

455
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:53,770
Isn't that boring?

456
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:57,820
Yes. Life-threateningly.

457
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,875
But I mean... you can't skate
your whole life, you know?

458
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,943
And besides...

459
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:07,219
...it was a sensible time for me to quit.

460
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,824
I'm not getting any younger, after all.

461
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:16,310
Well, so, uh...

462
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,382
What should we do, for a
skating show with puppets?

463
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,744
Honestly, I don't know.

464
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,389
I really like the concept,

465
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,528
but I'm not really sure
what it would look like.

466
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:28,820
Maybe like a ballet.

467
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:31,327
A ballet?

468
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:33,649
You know what, in that case,

469
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,339
we should work with my girlfriend, Trina.

470
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,089
She's an incredible ballet dancer.

471
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,314
Sorry... who?

472
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,307
My girlfriend. Trina. A dancer.

473
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:48,774
She's American, too. You guys should meet!

474
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:53,767
You okay?

475
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,541
Yes.

476
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,950
Excuse me.

477
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:51,330
- Attack! - Killed you!
- Got you!

478
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,556
Girls - stop it!

479
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,390
Stop it.

480
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,650
What happened!?

481
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:18,000
Is it your lip? What happened? Show me...

482
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,843
It wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!

483
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:21,218
Show me, is it your lip?

484
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:23,343
I didn't do anything, it
wasn't my fault! It wasn't me!

485
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:25,242
Show me, show me...

486
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,075
It wasn't my fault...

487
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:29,580
What's going on? Angie?
What happened to her?

488
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:32,684
- It wasn't me, I didn't do anything!
- What's wrong, Angelique? Show me.

489
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:34,526
- It wasn't my fault!
- Show me, show me your lip.

490
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:35,360
It's okay...

491
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:38,529
It wasn't me, it wasn't my fault...

492
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,719
Claire, don't stress, this
is not your fault, okay?

493
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,833
These things happen.

494
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,899
Can I do anything?

495
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,539
No, really, don't worry yourself.

496
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,923
Just go home and get some rest, okay?

497
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,340
Go on. Have a good night.

498
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:16,088
It wasn't my fault, wasn't me.

499
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,572
Claire's the one who did it.

500
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:21,241
Is that true, my little Angie?

501
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,288
What did that mean old Claire do to you?

502
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,734
Did Claire do this?

503
00:34:34,421 --> 00:34:36,029
I have a candy for you!

504
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:37,935
But!

505
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:39,335
...did Claire hit you?

506
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,299
Yeeeees!

507
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,373
Yes!

508
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,165
Dirty Bitch.

509
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,367
Dirty bitch, dirty bitch, dirty bitch!

510
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,584
Dirty bitch, dirty bitch, dirty bitch!

511
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,678
Girls!

512
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:02,712
Girls, watch your language!

513
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:05,958
Girls...

514
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,373
Are you feeling all right, Claire?

515
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,549
Uh,

516
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,723
yes.

517
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,853
Are you happy here with us?

518
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:06,254
Sure.

519
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,738
She's not happy here.

520
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:33,138
Yes, but that's not enough.
We'll need something more.

521
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,529
Bernard, call Khadija.

522
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,363
Khadija!

523
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:39,221
Maybe she'll give us
something interesting.

524
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:47,079
Khadija, we want to speak
to you about Claire,

525
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,409
about Claire.

526
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,603
Do you understand?

527
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,229
Often you see Claire
with the children, right?

528
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,883
Is she good with them,
or is she bad with them?

529
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,089
Good, she is good.

530
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,559
Bad. You mean bad, right?

531
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,819
No, she is good.

532
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,529
She's good always, Madam.

533
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,393
She is, uh,

534
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,823
beautiful with them.

535
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,439
Maybe she does not understand.

536
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,549
Bernard, you explain to her.

537
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,659
Never mind, I'll do it.

538
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,309
Is she ever, mm, lazy?

539
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,339
Like maybe she ignore
the children sometimes?

540
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,659
No.

541
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,019
No, Madam,

542
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,269
she do, uh, the games with the children.

543
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,799
She is much nice.

544
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,903
She, uh, much im,

545
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:46,612
uh, imagination.

546
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:49,043
Imagination... Too much
imagination, maybe?

547
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:50,624
She imagines too much?

548
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,445
She imagines too much.

549
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:54,145
Works for me.

550
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:58,399
Uh, so you say that she's
maybe a little stupid,

551
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,453
like a, a little slow,
head always in the clouds.

552
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,393
Yes?

553
00:38:06,942 --> 00:38:08,409
Yes?

554
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,533
Yes?

555
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,609
Yes?

556
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,402
- Yes?
- Yes?

557
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:16,359
- Yes?
- Yes?

558
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,599
Uh,

559
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,433
yes.

560
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,541
Excellent, thank you Khadija.

561
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:32,042
You know, Mom, she's a nice girl,

562
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,318
but a little too stupid to handle things.

563
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:36,148
It's a shame!

564
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,104
Yes, yes.

565
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:37,937
A shame.

566
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:40,288
She'll have to go.

567
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,681
Yes, we'll have to find a way to get rid...

568
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,489
Claire. Good evening.

569
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,119
Oh, we have decided my
mother will supervise you now

570
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,859
while you do the babysitting.

571
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,139
So it's not too hard for you.

572
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,673
Well, have a good night!

573
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,963
Are you depressed, Claire?

574
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:18,019
Angelique.

575
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,363
My love.

576
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:20,197
My baby!

577
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:23,359
You are my star!

578
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:25,889
You too!

579
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,633
Come give Claire a great big kiss.

580
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,830
Hmm.

581
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:33,664
Hm.

582
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,133
Oh my.

583
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:43,213
Angelique, this is not very polite.

584
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:46,899
You see, she's just a little baby,

585
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,941
she doesn't know what she does.

586
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,597
You're Grandma man's little...

587
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,826
Do you want some tea, Grandma man?

588
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,427
Yes, thank you so much!

589
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,262
A sip for?

590
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:06,489
Ma man.

591
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,489
Very good!

592
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,217
And a sip for?

593
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:12,849
Papa.
Yes,

594
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,010
a sip for Papa.

595
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,040
How about a sip for

596
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,420
Claire?

597
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,921
No, she's a dirty bitch!

598
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:25,319
Oh my,

599
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,723
you don't like Claire?

600
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,309
No?

601
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,626
Well,

602
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:35,229
all right then, we
won't do sip for Claire.

603
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,789
No tea for that nasty Claire.

604
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,348
Nasty Claire.

605
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,650
And, uh, how about

606
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,749
a sip of tea for?
- Grandma man.

607
00:41:23,457 --> 00:41:26,249
Okay, let's go over the house rules.

608
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,409
As you know, I'm a huge germophobe,

609
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,419
and you've been sleeping
in a chambre de bonne,

610
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,869
and chambres de bonne probably have nits.

611
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,289
So I do ask that you stay a
minimum of 10 feet away from me,

612
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,159
or 3.05 meters in local measurements.

613
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,539
Wait, so nits can't
travel more than 10 feet?

614
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,179
Claire, do not put the
fear of God into me.

615
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,763
Well, can I get a pillow at least?

616
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,533
Okay.

617
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,389
But I will be asking you to
sleep in protective headgear.

618
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,470
Night, Claire.

619
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,205
Goodnight.

620
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:49,599
PETRUSHKA - Adaptation
for Skater and Puppeteer.

621
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,199
St. Petersburg, Russia. The 1830s.

622
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,033
A carnival.

623
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,270
Three puppets: a ballerina, a
Moor, and Petrushka, a clown.

624
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,086
A magician called the Charlatan

625
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,369
brings them to life.

626
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,269
Petrushka falls in love
with the ballerina,

627
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,013
but she loves the Moor.

628
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,309
Petrushka is angry and hurt,

629
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,993
and he challenges the Moor to a duel.

630
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:24,839
But the Moor kills him.

631
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,509
So Petrushka's ghost floats
up and he curses the Charlatan

632
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,589
for bringing him to life,

633
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,279
before he dies,

634
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,869
again.

635
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,629
So you'll perform it with me?

636
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,719
You'll be Petrushka on skates.

637
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,429
I'll be all the other
characters as puppets.

638
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,029
It'll be perfect.

639
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,029
So you're in?

640
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,214
Um.

641
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,857
Well, Claire, uh...

642
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,222
It's a great story

643
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:51,038
and I'm sure you'll find
a skater for your project.

644
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,718
But I don't see why it needs to be me.

645
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,950
What!?

646
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:57,565
There are so many other skaters in Paris.

647
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:59,693
More talented ones, for that matter.

648
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,599
Y-you don't get it.

649
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,109
No, no, no, Claire, you don't get it,

650
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,069
but that's only because you don't know

651
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,209
anything about skating.

652
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,839
Just take my word for it, okay?

653
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,299
I'm, I'm past my prime.

654
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,059
I had my 15 minutes and now no one wants

655
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,699
or needs to see me on the ice anymore.

656
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,429
I, I'm old news.

657
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,059
Okay, but you wouldn't understand-

658
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,373
Will you shut up!

659
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,293
Enjoy.

660
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,149
Thank you.

661
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,329
- Claire, what I'm trying-
- Nah-uh-uh.

662
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,643
Say one more word and I will
throw this scone in your face.

663
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,953
Look.

664
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,173
You can't see yourself,

665
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,203
but I can.

666
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,923
And I can see there is no
one else out there like you.

667
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,649
Maybe you don't know how
much talent you have,

668
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,900
but I think that you do

669
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,823
and you try to deny it.

670
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,699
You try to forget what it
was like to be on the ice

671
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,299
because it's too painful to remember.

672
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,119
Instead, you've chosen a
more manageable kind of pain,

673
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,799
the kind of pain you feel every day

674
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,359
at la Banque Francilienne.

675
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,513
That kind of pain you can handle.

676
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,559
It's the white noise in
between the coffee machine

677
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,829
and the snack machine and the restroom-

678
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,593
- But-
- Ah, I am speaking.

679
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,009
It's hard to explain, but

680
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,669
when you were on the ice,

681
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:56,133
you were like this human sunbeam,

682
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,563
or like a big beating heart on skates.

683
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,403
And now you're trying to
erase it because you're hurt.

684
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:11,159
Really, who can blame you?

685
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Well, you.

686
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:15,308
Yes,

687
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:17,671
me.

688
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:21,665
I blame you.

689
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:26,859
Because some of us need to see a sunbeam

690
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,143
every once in a while.

691
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,373
Some of us need to feel a beating heart.

692
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,633
Some of us need you.

693
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:47,086
Uh, can I talk?

694
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,035
You know, I'm lucky to have a job.

695
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,190
I mean, in this economy,
it's a privilege to be...

696
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,679
You know, you're right.

697
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,553
All I do at work is go to the restroom.

698
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,053
I pee like 20 times a day.

699
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,441
I pee all day long.

700
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,496
I think it's just to give
me an activity to do.

701
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,435
I don't have anything anymore.

702
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:36,386
So you'll be Petrushka for me?

703
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,479
Okay, let's take
- Okay.

704
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,250
A look at the next scene.

705
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:13,379
So Petrushka tries to win
the heart of the ballerina,

706
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,003
but she isn't interested in him.

707
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:19,153
What?!

708
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:20,895
She's not interested in me?!

709
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,075
Well, we'll just see about that.

710
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:25,092
Give me that.

711
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,553
Look

712
00:49:29,815 --> 00:49:31,929
deep into my Russian eyes.

713
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,209
Oh my God.

714
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,067
You will love me.

715
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:37,709
Say that you vant me.

716
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,665
I love you. Kiss me, you fool.

717
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:46,368
You see? Child's play.

718
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:47,693
Bravo. Give me that.

719
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:50,723
- Okay, okay.
- Let's take it from the top.

720
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,439
You are trying to impress her,
but she runs away from you.

721
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,959
And then you curse the
portrait of the Charlatan

722
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,721
who brought you to life.

723
00:49:58,722 --> 00:49:59,654
Okay, okay.

724
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:01,323
I'm going to improvise a bit.

725
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:03,056
Can you put on the music?

726
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,929
You had your 15 minutes,

727
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:06,439
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

728
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,867
You are old news.

729
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,981
What are you doing!?

730
00:51:34,982 --> 00:51:36,298
I don't know, Claire...

731
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:39,770
I... thought I was done with all this.

732
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:42,642
I mean, I have a life, a job...

733
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:46,418
I don't want to do stuff like this.

734
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:47,435
What is this?

735
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,539
It's my sock.

736
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,089
It is more than that.

737
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,149
It is a hostage.

738
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,609
I'm taking your pretty little sock home,

739
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,129
and I'm going to keep it until
you get back out on the ice

740
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,543
and start performing again.

741
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,548
You know, I don't give a
shit about an old sock.

742
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:05,019
And about performing?

743
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,803
I suppose you don't give
a shit about that either?

744
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:12,559
You know, you're going to
have that sock forever.

745
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,143
You promised me,

746
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,163
I trusted you, don't let me down.

747
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:25,694
Prove yourself worthy of your sock,

748
00:52:25,695 --> 00:52:26,528
Thibaut.

749
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,010
You look happy.

750
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:11,113
So you're, uh, interested in the festival?

751
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,713
Uh, yeah.

752
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,357
Um, maybe, um.

753
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,202
You, too?

754
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,069
No,

755
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,897
not at all.

756
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:29,229
You're really charming, you know?

757
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,479
Charming, and a little shy.

758
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,430
Shy?

759
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,309
Yes, there's something about you,

760
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,863
like you're not very self-assured.

761
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,663
It's really lovely, uh, poetic even.

762
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,177
Do you, uh, know the
French word, mm, farouche?

763
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:48,903
Uh, no.

764
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,423
It means shy, but it also means wild.

765
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,660
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're a little bit of both.

766
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,419
I don't know.

767
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,717
Oh, sure you do.

768
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,000
Deep down you're a tigress.

769
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:14,422
We both know it.

770
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:18,723
Does it bother you that
I can read your mind?

771
00:56:21,572 --> 00:56:24,582
Um.

772
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:25,491
Hey, Rafal!

773
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:27,705
You gonna come rehearse with us or not?!

774
00:56:27,706 --> 00:56:29,339
Uh, hang on, be right there!

775
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,673
See you,

776
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:36,380
Tigress.

777
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,069
You know what your fatal
flaw is, don't you?

778
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,059
No, please, tell me.

779
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,569
I'm getting to that, Claire.

780
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,299
Please be patient.

781
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,779
Your problem is, you're not sexual enough.

782
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,499
A guy just called me a tigress,

783
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,619
and now you're telling me
it's because I'm not sexual?

784
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,219
Exactly, Claire.

785
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,299
He was using reverse psychology on you

786
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,499
to turn you into a sexual being.

787
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,519
Only it didn't work.

788
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,169
However, my PowerPoint on the
subject should do the trick.

789
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,369
You prepared a PowerPoint?

790
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,843
Shh it's loading.

791
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,469
Now, there are two types
of people in this world,

792
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,663
the non-sexual,

793
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,739
that's you,

794
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,773
and the sexual,

795
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:28,539
ta-da.

796
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:33,239
So now we ask, how do
we turn this into this?

797
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,409
It's simple, you wanna be a tigress?

798
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,249
You have to think like a tigress.

799
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,739
The first step is to develop a
nice sexually arousing growl.

800
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,147
Now growl for me.

801
00:57:43,148 --> 00:57:44,108
No.

802
00:57:44,109 --> 00:57:45,434
Do it or I'll scream.

803
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:48,501
More oomph!

804
00:57:50,507 --> 00:57:52,357
I need more, Claire.

805
00:57:53,475 --> 00:57:54,715
More!

806
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:58,893
I'm not sexually excited,
guess I'll read a magazine.

807
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,358
Hey, this is in French.

808
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,512
Nope, frigid!

809
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,464
Dry as the Sahara.

810
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,513
Ooh.

811
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,433
Oop, nope, I was ovulating.

812
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,957
Hey, that one was good!

813
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:37,538
Our rehearsals are so nice.

814
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:39,438
Yeah. A little too nice, maybe.

815
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,517
What do you mean?!

816
00:58:44,873 --> 00:58:46,262
Oh, um, just that, uh...

817
00:58:46,263 --> 00:58:49,027
It's cool just having
something nice to do.

818
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:50,394
I could get used to it.

819
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:53,996
Oh, check this out...

820
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:58,259
I'm going to submit us for the festival.

821
00:59:00,282 --> 00:59:01,115
You and me.

822
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:05,155
You and me...

823
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,089
And do not forget, you
have to do this with me

824
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,199
because I still have your sock.

825
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,443
Yes, I know, I know.

826
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,693
See ya.

827
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:37,206
Hey dude,

828
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,877
that wasn't your Asian chick.

829
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:40,431
No, no... that was a colleague.

830
00:59:40,432 --> 00:59:41,564
We were rehearsing.

831
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:43,535
Ah, yes, "rehearsing."

832
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:46,194
So, how many times have you
banged your "colleague"?

833
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,046
Shut up, Maxime.

834
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:48,945
What, you don't want to?

835
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:50,543
No, of course I don't want
to! Why would I want to?

836
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:51,610
See, you do want to!

837
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:53,758
Want to what?

838
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:58,161
To bang his other girlfriend, of course.

839
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:00,435
All right. Gotta go.

840
01:00:00,436 --> 01:00:01,269
So long!

841
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,203
What's Maxime talking about?

842
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:06,454
God knows.

843
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,267
He's insane.

844
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:29,022
Hello, my name is Claire Burkhardt,

845
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:30,739
I'm American, I live in Paris,

846
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,749
and I wanted to drop off these...

847
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,283
No. Not possible.

848
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:38,789
Can I at least tell you

849
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,398
what my question is first?

850
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:44,198
Fine, if you must.

851
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:47,659
I wanted to leave these flyers.

852
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,552
For my puppetry services.

853
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,017
You want parents to hire you

854
01:00:53,018 --> 01:00:54,733
for birthday parties - is that right?

855
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,174
Yes, exactly.

856
01:00:56,175 --> 01:00:58,745
Well, I'm not going to tell you no.

857
01:00:58,746 --> 01:00:59,754
But, frankly,

858
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:02,935
you'll have a hard time
getting hired in Paris,

859
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:05,028
because the thing is, Parisian parents...

860
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,803
they have standards, you see.

861
01:01:07,804 --> 01:01:09,612
But I'm not going to tell you no.

862
01:01:11,055 --> 01:01:11,930
That said...

863
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:14,389
I'm going to put your flyers
at the very back of the store,

864
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,189
behind everything, where
no one will see them.

865
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,023
Okay?

866
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:20,939
Thanks.

867
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,754
Anytime, my dear.

868
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:24,537
And good luck, eh?

869
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:25,414
Because...

870
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,405
It's not easy to get hired in Paris.

871
01:01:33,365 --> 01:01:35,769
Did you always wanna be a puppeteer?

872
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,963
No, not necessarily.

873
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,489
Sometimes I wanted to be a
writer, sometimes a musician.

874
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:45,119
I just wanted to create my
own universe however I could.

875
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,199
The universe of Rafal

876
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,200
or the Raphaelite universe.

877
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,039
Get it?

878
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,849
Raphaelite has a double meaning there,

879
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,613
because Raphael, or Rafal...

880
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,789
You see, there was once a great painter

881
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,669
by the name of Raphael.

882
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,229
It was different for me,

883
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:13,124
I always wanted to-
The Raphaelite universe.

884
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,459
I just always wanted to tell
stories however I could,

885
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,093
one way or another.

886
01:02:21,626 --> 01:02:22,839
Do you like stories?

887
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,609
Oh, yeah.

888
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,879
Um, I have a friend
who is a figure skater,

889
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,209
and he can tell the most
beautiful stories on ice

890
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,679
without saying a single-

891
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,437
You know who's beautiful?

892
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,943
In fact, his name is Thibaut
Baudet, the figure skater.

893
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,569
Maybe you've heard of him?

894
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,923
Mm, don't think so.

895
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,143
He's amazing.

896
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:51,290
You know who's amazing?

897
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:57,943
Wait, why?

898
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,874
You're beautiful.

899
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:01,780
You're just so beautiful,

900
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,245
I, I can't stop thinking about you.

901
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:05,079
Really?

902
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,379
Since the day I met you.

903
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:15,635
Y-you're allowed to kiss back, you know?

904
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:27,102
You're even allowed to open your mouth.

905
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:01,820
You learn fast, little tigress.

906
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:21,963
What?

907
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:25,739
It,

908
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,033
it's a little complicated.

909
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:30,893
Complicated,

910
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:35,803
what do you mean, uh, complicated?

911
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,933
You've never done it?

912
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,773
Wow.

913
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,113
Why?

914
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,209
Because no one wanted
to have sex with a girl

915
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,113
who has 45 puppets on her bed.

916
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:04,163
Well, um,

917
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,793
personally, I'd call that a turn on.

918
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:21,733
I knew I liked you.

919
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:34,711
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh, that was amazing.

920
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:45,741
There's more,

921
01:05:50,248 --> 01:05:51,081
right?

922
01:06:16,578 --> 01:06:18,996
What's wrong beautiful?

923
01:06:18,997 --> 01:06:21,497
Why are you looking like that?

924
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:23,938
It's nothing.

925
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:29,022
Nothing at all.

926
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,409
Claire, question,

927
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,309
if somebody serves you a
suggestively shaped croissant,

928
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,629
do you have the right to sue?

929
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,872
Because according to my attorney...

930
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,059
Oh dear God.

931
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,429
What happened to you?

932
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:49,459
Some birthday kid's mom
put a clown wig on me.

933
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,320
That's what.

934
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:52,869
You know I have coulrophobia,
or a fear of clowns,

935
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,609
due to the time a clown
bit me in the wild.

936
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,443
Please remove it.

937
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,909
Give me a sec, will you?

938
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:59,129
An army of rabid moms
stuck this to my head

939
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,289
with France's national
supply of bobby pins.

940
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,713
Also, my day was fantastic,
thank you for asking.

941
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,439
Mademoiselle?

942
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,474
Yes, you.

943
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:12,713
Ze puppet person, come here at once!

944
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,229
Oui, madame?

945
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:19,619
You will wear this clown wig
or else, s'il vous plait.

946
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,659
I don't need it, I'm
here to do a puppet show.

947
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,789
Ah, but you do not understand,

948
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:29,480
the birthday girl is my
tiny snot of a daughter

949
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,423
and she insists that you wear it.

950
01:07:35,437 --> 01:07:39,949
Wear it or die!

951
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,608
Tres bien.

952
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:42,942
Kids, come here!

953
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:48,793
The clown lady is here
to do face painting!

954
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,829
What is that on my cheek?

955
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,599
A corpse?

956
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,693
No, it's a butterfly.

957
01:07:59,061 --> 01:07:59,894
No,

958
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:03,344
I wanted

959
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:08,345
a good butterfly!

960
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,589
Oh, la la la la!

961
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,763
We are very disapproving!

962
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,529
As punishment, we will let
our children run around

963
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,913
and scream while you try to perform,

964
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,009
and then we will criticize
your performance,

965
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:29,873
which we did not watch!

966
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:33,679
And

967
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,613
scene.

968
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:38,943
Is there more?

969
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:11,753
No, don't say that.

970
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,910
Give me that.

971
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,922
You know, it's funny,

972
01:09:26,923 --> 01:09:29,073
all my life I've only ever done one thing.

973
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,973
Every single day, repeat
and repeat and repeat.

974
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,150
And I was pretty damn good at that thing.

975
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,523
And now it turns out I
can't do anything else.

976
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,249
It's like I was just dropped
in the middle of the ocean

977
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,505
without a lifeboat.

978
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,043
And so when Claire
asked me to skate again,

979
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:02,129
I felt like I could just swim
back, a million miles back

980
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:06,679
just to, to skate and, and
feel like myself again.

981
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,169
You know what I mean?

982
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,837
Yep. Mm-hmm.

983
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:12,783
Did you hear me?

984
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,930
Sure, skating, repetitive,
million miles away.

985
01:10:26,034 --> 01:10:27,034
Thank you.

986
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,641
Oh, right. The puppets.

987
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:38,715
Excuse me.

988
01:11:58,373 --> 01:11:59,206
Here.

989
01:12:00,244 --> 01:12:02,177
And, um, sorry about everything.

990
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,403
No need to be sorry, Monsieur Petrushka.

991
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:09,870
I submitted us for the
puppetry festival...

992
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,843
and they've selected us.

993
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,136
Here.

994
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:29,216
Unbelievable.

995
01:12:29,217 --> 01:12:31,128
Why are you forcing me to do this?

996
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:32,920
Why can't you just let it go?

997
01:12:34,503 --> 01:12:35,685
Excuse me?

998
01:12:35,686 --> 01:12:39,189
I, I already told you, I'm
not interested anymore.

999
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,839
But y-you were.

1000
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,469
Yes, I was, and now I'm not anymore.

1001
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:46,079
Is that, is that so hard to understand?

1002
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,249
I mean, w-why do this?

1003
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,633
Why, why, what's the point

1004
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,119
of forcing me?
- I'm not trying to force you.

1005
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,949
I'm trying to help you, that's
what you do for friends.

1006
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:54,475
But we're not friends!

1007
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,438
We-we're colleagues, we know each other.

1008
01:13:12,378 --> 01:13:13,659
Claire, you...

1009
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,107
...you think we're close,
because you know my performances.

1010
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:17,791
But the "me"...

1011
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:20,257
The Thibaut on the ice and
the Thibaut in front of you

1012
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:21,652
aren't the same person.

1013
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:22,534
Okay?

1014
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:25,589
You know, I... I have my own private life.

1015
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,131
And you're not part of it.

1016
01:13:29,074 --> 01:13:32,089
You don't need to take care of me, Claire.

1017
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:34,573
You'd do better to concentrate on you.

1018
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:36,307
Okay? I don't need your help.

1019
01:13:38,228 --> 01:13:40,728
Go do something that has meaning for you.

1020
01:13:42,704 --> 01:13:44,404
You mean like you with the bank?

1021
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,139
Claire, I, I, I don't mean to hurt you.

1022
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,340
You're not hurting me.

1023
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,903
If the ice you wasn't the real you,

1024
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,240
then you had me fooled.

1025
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,941
If you see him, tell him I miss him.

1026
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,683
Goodbye, Petrushka.

1027
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,003
I don't get it, I thought
he and I were getting along.

1028
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,489
You think maybe he's afraid?

1029
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:41,590
Afraid of what?

1030
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,929
Who knows?

1031
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,879
Guys are just fearful creatures.

1032
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,730
And then they try to cover it
up by acting like assholes.

1033
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,829
Could be.

1034
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:57,597
Anyway, lucky for you,
it's not your problem.

1035
01:15:01,306 --> 01:15:02,556
I don't know.

1036
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:05,053
It's just so hard to let go.

1037
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,129
I got too invested

1038
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:10,963
in the show.

1039
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:17,113
Fortunately, you have
other things in your life.

1040
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,233
Yeah.

1041
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:26,615
I guess

1042
01:15:26,616 --> 01:15:28,153
he's just scared.

1043
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,659
You know, it's ironic, the name Thibaut,

1044
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,113
it means brave.

1045
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,689
Funny, huh?

1046
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,339
Yeah.

1047
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,173
Funny.

1048
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,229
So did you like it?

1049
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,010
Yeah, it was great.

1050
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:56,339
Really?

1051
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,959
Yeah, the music, the acting,

1052
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,063
it was perfect.

1053
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

1054
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,080
Why?

1055
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:07,369
Why?

1056
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:10,149
Because it was mediocre,
and that's being generous.

1057
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,119
It was amateurish.

1058
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:16,463
The problems are obvious
to an educated person.

1059
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,113
Well, anyway, it was nice.

1060
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:28,199
Nice, interesting
concept you have of nice.

1061
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,679
Maybe one day you'll understand
why that wasn't good cinema.

1062
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,129
Okay.

1063
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,053
What do you mean, okay?

1064
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,799
I mean, I don't care, Rafal.

1065
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,750
We can agree to disagree, but
I don't wanna fight about it.

1066
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,133
Are you sure about that?

1067
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,547
I don't get it, Rafal.

1068
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,310
You just want us to fight

1069
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:14,093
for nothing?

1070
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,150
I don't know how to tell him
it doesn't feel good anymore.

1071
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,589
None of this makes sense.
All he wants to do is fight.

1072
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,639
And at first, I thought it
was because he was upset,

1073
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,679
and then I realized it's turning him on.

1074
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,279
It's all just to have sex.

1075
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Claire.

1076
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,823
Back up, back up.

1077
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,199
You had sex?

1078
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,903
- Yeah.
- Without consulting me?

1079
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:16,090
It just kinda happened.

1080
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,329
But I never got to give
you your sexual education.

1081
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:20,279
Never mind, we'll start now.

1082
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,280
Okay, the first rule in
having sex is: don't have sex.

1083
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,859
Little late.

1084
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:29,869
Listen, Claire, you may not know it,

1085
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:33,128
but you are an innocent baby marshmallow.

1086
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:34,819
And I don't think you
understand the gravity here.

1087
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,139
Do you realize what happens when a man

1088
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,653
sticks his thing in you?

1089
01:18:41,887 --> 01:18:43,879
The answer is germs, mega germs.

1090
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,879
Now, I'm about to tell
you something so gross,

1091
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,559
so disgusting, you're going
to want to cover your ears.

1092
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,610
I'll cover mine, too.

1093
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,864
Okay.

1094
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,489
So you know condoms, right?

1095
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:04,070
Yes, Julia, I know condoms.

1096
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,050
Could we maybe-
- So the thing about condoms

1097
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:09,069
is when a guy puts one on, it
covers his one thing, right?

1098
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:13,489
But it doesn't cover his other two things.

1099
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:15,899
- Testicles.
- I'm sorry, Claire,

1100
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,469
I wasn't emotionally prepared for that,

1101
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:22,089
but, yes, it doesn't cover them.

1102
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,779
That would be impossible and painful.

1103
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,749
So? Men should learn to live with pain.

1104
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,399
It toughens the loins.

1105
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,929
Now, it's obviously too late for you,

1106
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:34,299
who have exposed yourself to
all manners of ball germs,

1107
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,889
or, in medical terms, testicooties.

1108
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:40,359
But, for those as yet un-besmirched,

1109
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,529
I've made a miracle product,

1110
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:46,203
the likes of which shall
revolutionize the sex industry.

1111
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,069
See, it covers the entire
leg so not one of those

1112
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,059
icky man-germs will
touch your precious skin.

1113
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,789
And for those who live on the wild side,

1114
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:57,399
not that I endorse that sort of thing,

1115
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,053
I've developed the lederhosen variety.

1116
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,133
Good God.

1117
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:03,966
Say what you will,

1118
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,459
but I plan to make a
killing at Oktoberfest.

1119
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:10,263
I don't know. I, I think
people want sex to be fun.

1120
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,900
Wait, sex is supposed to be fun?

1121
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,785
What's wrong?

1122
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:37,172
I don't know.

1123
01:20:37,173 --> 01:20:39,909
I think I might be a bad person.

1124
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,518
What makes you say that?

1125
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:45,143
I think I made a really bad mistake today.

1126
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,979
Saying no to the puppet show, I mean.

1127
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:52,083
Oh, really? So you think
I gave you bad advice?

1128
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:56,203
I don't know.

1129
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:57,789
All I did was tell you the truth.

1130
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,219
Your skating days are behind you,

1131
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,039
you know that.
- Yes, I know that, yes.

1132
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,309
Yes, but I don't know, I, I like,

1133
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:05,998
I liked working with Claire.

1134
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,006
It just gave me something
that was missing from my life,

1135
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:11,499
you know?

1136
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,649
Wow.

1137
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,873
Well, sorry to hear that.

1138
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,703
Did you ever just sort of
not appreciate somebody,

1139
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:29,809
like not knowing how much
they cared about you,

1140
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:32,099
or how much you were hurting them,

1141
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,819
even though it was right
there in front of you?

1142
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,469
Gosh, I don't know, Thibaut,

1143
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:41,079
what with spending my
days overworking my body,

1144
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,939
making myself crazy for a dance company

1145
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:47,129
that sees women as disposable.

1146
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,469
Then coming home to a boyfriend

1147
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:52,363
who stares through me
as if I'm a hologram.

1148
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:58,083
That definitely takes up all
my mental space these days.

1149
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,009
But now that I think about it,

1150
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:05,529
definitely go find your sweetie-pie Claire

1151
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:09,608
and let her know she has
been missing from your life.

1152
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,233
Did you want any soup?

1153
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:33,366
Fuck!

1154
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,653
Claire,

1155
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,023
Claire, wake up.

1156
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,779
What? Are you okay?

1157
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,613
I don't know, Claire.

1158
01:22:53,614 --> 01:22:56,513
I'm just overwhelmed by this
feeling that you don't love me.

1159
01:22:57,595 --> 01:22:59,559
Of course, I love you.

1160
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,843
I don't think so. You don't seem sure.

1161
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:06,469
I love you a lot, Rafal, but it's 4 am,

1162
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,573
let's just go to sleep.

1163
01:23:12,232 --> 01:23:15,729
I can't bear you turning
your back against me.

1164
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,739
Switch sides of the bed with me,

1165
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,629
so I can have you facing me.

1166
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:19,463
What?

1167
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,003
You take my side and I take yours.

1168
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:27,671
You have to face me.

1169
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:32,822
If you turn your back to me,
it means you don't love me.

1170
01:23:32,823 --> 01:23:35,849
But that's crazy.

1171
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,493
Switch sides with me, Claire.

1172
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:41,002
You'd do it if you love me.

1173
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:43,869
Switch sides!

1174
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:03,119
Tha-that's better.

1175
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,906
Stop! Girls, stop!

1176
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:54,029
No, no, no, no, no.

1177
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,347
Give me that! No! Stop!

1178
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:19,870
May I have your attention, please...

1179
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:21,987
I DON'T LIKE THIS PUPPET SHOW!

1180
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,162
Will you just-

1181
01:25:28,559 --> 01:25:30,890
Give me that! Give me...

1182
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:34,621
Give, give me that! Give me that!

1183
01:25:34,622 --> 01:25:37,371
Will you just give, give me!

1184
01:25:37,372 --> 01:25:38,205
No!

1185
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:43,145
Give that!

1186
01:25:47,617 --> 01:25:52,617
I hate you, you little shits!

1187
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:46,588
Who was that then?

1188
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,380
I brought my own stuff to throw, too.

1189
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:28,803
You're a good friend.

1190
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,527
I'm ready when you are.

1191
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,903
Ready.

1192
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:43,743
No more.

1193
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:49,413
No more!

1194
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,418
No more! I can't believe I just-

1195
01:27:53,419 --> 01:27:54,729
- Hi-ya!
- Okay, Julia, you really

1196
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,567
don't have to-
- Hi-ya!

1197
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:01,746
Hi-ya!

1198
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,333
Okey do key.

1199
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,719
So how are you getting to the airport?

1200
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,219
Please, tell me you're not
taking a bus, buses have crud.

1201
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:27,529
Crud.

1202
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:29,243
Yes, Claire! Crud.

1203
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:33,739
One time, I read about
a girl who went on a bus

1204
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,639
and she contracted bus
crud, and then she died,

1205
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,509
and then it was made
into a Lifetime movie.

1206
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:43,529
Relax, I scheduled a car for30,

1207
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:46,519
and I'll be back to get
my luggage on the way.

1208
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,049
Oh my God, Claire, what about skater boy?

1209
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,519
Did you tell him you're leaving?

1210
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,973
No, he hates me, plus I'll
probably never see him again.

1211
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,613
Uh.

1212
01:29:02,322 --> 01:29:03,155
Hi.

1213
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:04,974
Hi.

1214
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:09,296
Uh... how are you?

1215
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,013
Okay.

1216
01:29:12,087 --> 01:29:12,920
Maybe.

1217
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:16,423
I'm actually about to leave France.

1218
01:29:16,424 --> 01:29:17,327
Really?

1219
01:29:17,328 --> 01:29:19,051
I'm going back to the US.

1220
01:29:21,683 --> 01:29:22,567
For good?

1221
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:23,400
Yeah.

1222
01:29:24,628 --> 01:29:25,461
Oh.

1223
01:29:29,683 --> 01:29:31,933
Actually, Claire, I wanted to say...

1224
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,485
...You were saying?

1225
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:45,455
...I forgot. But, um...

1226
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:49,654
I wanted to say have a good trip,

1227
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:52,704
and...

1228
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:54,797
...good luck...

1229
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:57,749
And, um...

1230
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:02,585
...have, have a good trip, um...

1231
01:30:12,822 --> 01:30:16,049
Actually, do you want to take a walk?

1232
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,695
Yeah.

1233
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:19,615
Yeah, I'd like that.

1234
01:30:19,616 --> 01:30:20,449
Please.

1235
01:30:28,552 --> 01:30:31,847
So what are you up to these days?

1236
01:30:31,848 --> 01:30:33,773
Oh... nothing much, really.

1237
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:38,237
In a few days I'm taking
Trina to Portugal,

1238
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:39,547
for the weekend.

1239
01:30:39,548 --> 01:30:41,783
We need some time together.

1240
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:42,892
It'll do us good.

1241
01:30:43,878 --> 01:30:44,711
...maybe.

1242
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:47,972
You know, I still have your sock.

1243
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:54,006
Well, I did say you'd have it forever.

1244
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:57,433
Claire, actually, I have to say...

1245
01:30:57,434 --> 01:30:58,267
I,

1246
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,593
I wanted to say,

1247
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,440
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

1248
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:12,663
If I cared less, I would,

1249
01:31:14,714 --> 01:31:17,937
I would probably let
you be closer, you know?

1250
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:22,962
But you'll never be far
from me, you understand?

1251
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:31,687
Phew, okay, that's enough of that.

1252
01:31:31,688 --> 01:31:32,521
Um.

1253
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,753
I,

1254
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:41,652
I can't forget what you
say, even if I want to.

1255
01:31:41,653 --> 01:31:45,677
How do you like, um, how do you say, um,

1256
01:31:47,448 --> 01:31:48,865
une fee-marraine?

1257
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:51,809
A fairy godmother?

1258
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,839
Oui! Voila!

1259
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,673
You're like a very
annoying fairy grandmother.

1260
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,003
Oh my God, that's my airport cab.

1261
01:33:47,865 --> 01:33:49,448
Goodbye, Petrushka.

1262
01:34:49,155 --> 01:34:52,069
...achieving more than two
million euros in turnover.

1263
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,611
So if they can finish out
this round of fund raising

1264
01:34:54,612 --> 01:34:55,919
before the end of January,

1265
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,562
I think they'll bring their
capital to fifty million eur...

1266
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:02,927
...you okay, Thibaut?

1267
01:35:03,785 --> 01:35:05,449
Hm?

1268
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,880
Um.

1269
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:08,364
Yes. Yeah, of course.

1270
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:11,244
Will you excuse me a minute?

1271
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,863
It's funny what moves some
people and not others.

1272
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:44,439
For some people, it's a meteor shower.

1273
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,190
For others, it's a math problem.

1274
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,788
For some, it's the night sky.

1275
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:58,299
And for others, it's the memory of a girl

1276
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,457
staring at you in the soul
and saying, "Do better."

1277
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,119
And sometimes, the best you can do

1278
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,263
is to put that memory in a box,

1279
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,718
then leave it there.

1280
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,447
And put yourself first for a change.

1281
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,230
Because what if the light
you saw in someone else

1282
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:26,100
was really your own light
reflected back at you?
