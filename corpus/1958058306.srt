01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:43,591
I'm not ordinarily
a religious man,

1551
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:46,681
but I have to admit
that, in the past week,

1552
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:49,336
I've joined my wife
in praying.

1553
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,601
Senator Hughes, how has
this past week been for you?

1554
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:55,734
There's mounting pressure
from the senate

1555
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:58,215
and from women's groups
from the left and the right

1556
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,347
for the president to remove
your daughter's name

1557
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:01,522
from nomination.

1558
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:05,222
Timber, I've been a senator
for 24 years,

1559
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:07,659
a congressman for 8 years
before that,

1560
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,922
but first of all,
I am a father.

1561
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,491
Now, lyssa and I, we don't
see eye to eye on most subjects,

1562
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,014
except for coleslaw.

1563
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,582
We both like it dry.

1564
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,541
But there is no one
that I believe in more.

1565
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,110
But technically, your daughter
did commit a crime.

1566
01:06:24,154 --> 01:06:26,330
My daughter
committed an oversight.

1567
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:27,592
I made a mistake.

1568
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,855
I should have answered
that notice,

1569
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:32,466
and I apologize for it.

1570
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:37,428
It was simply bad juggling
of a working mother.

1571
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:40,387
Have you heard from the
president this week, Dr. Hughes?

1572
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,824
No, but this has been
a very busy week for him.

1573
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:45,871
The battle to balance the budget
is ongoing.

1574
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,568
Senator: I believe
the president knows

1575
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:50,136
he made the perfect choice
when he nominated my daughter.

1576
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,878
So, here you are,
a descendant of a president,

1577
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:54,662
a pioneer
in healthcare reform,

1578
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:56,882
truly an American daughter
of the highest caliber

1579
01:06:56,925 --> 01:07:00,277
in the midst
of an ever-growing

1580
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,628
political
and feminist maelstrom.

1581
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:06,022
Now, who are the good guys
and who are the bad guys?

1582
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,850
I don't look at things
in black-and-white.

1583
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:11,984
It's not even, really,
good medicine.

1584
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,335
If there's <i>any</i>fault,
though, it's mine.

1585
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:17,729
As I said,
I made a mistake.

1586
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,644
I was wrong,

1587
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:21,994
and I take
full responsibility.

1588
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,084
Well, you've obviously had
a long and distinguished career

1589
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:26,607
in women's healthcare,

1590
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:29,001
but female opinion
is running against you 4 to 1.

1591
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,656
Do you have any idea why?

1592
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:33,092
I don't know.

1593
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,225
I was honestly
surprised by that.

1594
01:07:35,268 --> 01:07:36,748
Most of my work in medicine

1595
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,837
has been in
increasing awareness

1596
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,795
of female-health issues,
so --

1597
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,581
when you refer to
female-health issues,

1598
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,105
are you referring
to your position on choice?

1599
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,760
Reproductive rights
are one of many issues.

1600
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:51,241
For instance,
primary-care doctors --

1601
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:53,504
yeah,
but you are pro-choice.

1602
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,635
Yes.

1603
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:56,507
And your father is not.

1604
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,510
My father and I
have differing opinions

1605
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,512
on many subjects...

1606
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:03,340
Except coleslaw.

1607
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:04,776
Do you feel as though

1608
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:06,778
you're close to your father
and his wife?

1609
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:09,128
Yes, I'm very happy
dad met chubby --

1610
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:11,609
I mean [chuckles]
Charlotte.

1611
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:14,307
Have you been close
to all of his wives?

1612
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:18,137
Well, I was away at college
when he married Faye Francine,

1613
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:19,704
and I was a resident

1614
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:22,315
when he married, um,
ginger, um...

1615
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:23,838
Eichenbacher, sorry.

1616
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:26,406
So you weren't
close to them.

1617
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,931
I believe that they were
both very nice women,

1618
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:34,458
but I was already focusing
on my own professional life,

1619
01:08:34,501 --> 01:08:37,722
so that took
a lot of dedication, and --

1620
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:40,203
well, you have been,
for the last 10 years,

1621
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:43,423
on the <i>good housekeeping</i>list
of American-women role models.

1622
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,599
Is that what makes
women dislike you?

1623
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:47,340
Do they think
you're too perfect?

1624
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:48,863
[ Sighs ]

1625
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,300
I hope not.

1626
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:52,650
Well, you are privileged.

1627
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:56,697
My greatest privilege
is my family.

1628
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:59,744
Well, let's talk a little
bit more about your family.

1629
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:00,745
Your mother.

1630
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:02,660
My mother died
when I was 14.

1631
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:06,011
When we last talked,
you referred to your mother

1632
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:08,448
as an ordinary
Indiana housewife

1633
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:11,147
who made
the now-infamous icebox cakes.

1634
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,670
Yeah.

1635
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,585
Can you tell US
more about her?

1636
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:19,677
She was an attractive woman.

1637
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,853
She went to church.

1638
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:24,334
Did you resent her?

1639
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:25,552
No.

1640
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:27,815
Did you feel her horizons
were limited?

1641
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:31,689
How is this relevant
to my confirmation?

1642
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:34,039
Because there are women
in america

1643
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:36,955
who feel that your attitude
toward your mother

1644
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:39,044
is your attitude
toward <i>them.</i>

1645
01:09:39,087 --> 01:09:42,308
I promise you, it's not.

1646
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:45,311
Were you always closer
to your father than your mother?

1647
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:48,706
My father and I both chose
careers in public life.

1648
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:51,839
Do you think perhaps your
father's career in public life

1649
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:53,885
caused
your mother to suffer,

1650
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:55,191
like other
political wives?

1651
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,802
As you know,
many famous political wives --

1652
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,630
timber,
I really don't believe

1653
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:02,459
we can judge who will make
the best surgeon general

1654
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:04,765
based on their mother's
marital happiness.

1655
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:07,986
But you do agree
that a family life is important.

1656
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:11,250
Yes, of course it's important,
but it's also private.

1657
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:12,947
Well, the surgeon general

1658
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,428
is considered
the physician to the nation,

1659
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:18,475
and many American women
feel that your private life

1660
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:21,869
disqualifies you from such an
important humanitarian position.

1661
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:24,568
How could they possibly
know about my private life?

1662
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:27,310
They are convinced, according
to our latest "time zone" poll,

1663
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:29,355
that you are both
condescending and elitist.

1664
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:35,753
The women of america
should concern themselves

1665
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:38,625
with the possibility
of their reproductive rights

1666
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:40,148
being taken away from them.

1667
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:43,021
The women of america
should concern themselves

1668
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:46,067
with the fact that
breast cancer, ovarian cancer,

1669
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:48,940
and uterine cancer
are grossly underfunded

1670
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:51,159
compared
to prostate cancer.

1671
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:54,511
The women of america
should concern themselves

1672
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:56,904
with the fact
that their children

1673
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:58,906
are increasingly smoking,

1674
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,126
falling prey
to drug addiction,

1675
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:03,781
and the rapid growth
of teenage violence.

1676
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:07,045
The women of america
should <i>not</i>concern themselves

1677
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:10,004
with my father's wives,
my cooking, or my mother.

1678
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,053
So you're emotional
about this subject.

1679
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:17,403
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm emotional!

1680
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:20,014
I share that
with the women of america!

[ Chuckles ]

01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:26,107
Would you like to know,
timber [sighs]

1683
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:30,634
Why I have avoided public life
until this nomination?

1684
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:33,376
Mm-hmm.

1685
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:36,988
Because I know that I can
make a difference in the world

1686
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,991
without having to
go through any of this.

1687
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:42,733
I know if I raise money
for new wallpaper

1688
01:11:42,776 --> 01:11:46,084
in my chemotherapy unit,
it'll make a difference.

1689
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,303
People I work with,

1690
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:49,870
they look at life and death
every day.

1691
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:53,352
Sometimes we manage to save
life, and sometimes we don't,

1692
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:56,355
but I promise you,
it has nothing to do

1693
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,098
with whether we did or did not
like our mothers.

1694
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:02,100
It has to do with service.

1695
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:05,669
Dr. Hughes,
are you saying

1696
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:07,758
you're not really
interested in public life?

1697

I'm saying
that I don't know

1698

what public life
has become.

1699
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:14,330

that you're too good for it.
